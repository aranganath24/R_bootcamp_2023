These 5 year runs are made with different sets of parameters in order to figure out the best model configuration based on a suite of state-of-the-art metrics. This analysis is also a systematic attempt to understand the model sensitivity to the SMCM parameters. The model is found to be resilient to minor changes in the parameters used implying robustness of the SMCM formulation. The model is found to be most sensitive to the midtropospheric dryness parameter (MTD) and to the stratiform cloud decay timescale (tau(30)). MTD is more effective in controlling the global mean precipitation and its distribution while tau(30) has more effect on the organization of convection as noticed in the simulation of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). This is consistent with the fact that in the SMCM formulation, midtropospheric humidity controls the deepening of convection and stratiform clouds control the backward tilt of tropospheric heating and the strength of unsaturated downdrafts which cool and dry the boundary layer and trigger the propagation of organized convection. Many other studies have also found midtropospheric humidity to be a key factor in the capacity of a global climate model to simulate organized convection on the synoptic and intraseasonal scales. Plain Language Summary The implementation and calibration of a stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) convective parameterization technique in the National Centres for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) is presented here. The response in terms of simulating the mean climate and its intraseasonal variability of the host model, the CFSv2, due to the incorporation of the SMCM is examined in this study for different parameter regimes and consequently the best suite of parameters are identified in order to obtain a longer climate run to analyze the tropical intraseasonal variability in further detail. The SMCM implemented CFSv2, designated as the CFSsmcm, is found to be resilient to minor changes in the parameters used implying robustness of the SMCM formulation and most sensitive to the mid-tropospheric dryness and the life-time of the stratiform clouds. The tropical intraseasonal variability simulated by the CFSsmcm, has been communicated in a separate research paper.","[Goswami, B.

The aim is to expose characteristics of past climate changes occurred without human influence. In this context, numerical simulations are an indispensable tool for inferring changes in near-surface air temperature and precipitation in regions where proxy information is scarce or absent. The analyzed PMIP3 models describe MH temperatures significantly warmer than those of LGM with magnitudes of change depending on the season and the specific geographic region. In addition, models indicate that seasonal mean precipitation during MH increased with respect to LGM values in wide southern continental areas to the east of the Andes Cordillera whereas seasonal precipitation developed in areas to the w2est of Patagonian Andes reduced from LGM to MH.

Here we investigate the causes for the 2019 pIOD by analyzing multiple observational datasets and performing numerical model experiments. We find that the 2019 pIOD was triggered in May by easterly wind bursts over the tropical Indian Ocean associated with the dry phase of the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation, and it was sustained by the local atmosphere-ocean interaction thereafter. During September-November, warm sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the central-western tropical Pacific Ocean further enhanced the Indian Ocean's easterly winds, bringing the pIOD to an extreme magnitude. The central-western tropical Pacific warm SSTA was strengthened by two consecutive Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) events that originated from the tropical Indian Ocean. Our results highlight the important roles of cross-basin and cross-time-scale interactions in generating extreme IOD events. The lack of accurate representation of these interactions may be the root for a short lead time in predicting this extreme pIOD with a state-of-the-art climate forecast model.","[Zhang, Lei; Han, Weiqing] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hu, Zeng-Zhen] NOAA, NWS, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",lezh8230@colorado.edu,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400","National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 1658132, AGS 1935279]; NASA OSTST [NNX17AI63G]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); NASA OSTST,"We appreciate the constructive comments and insightful suggestions from three reviewers.

Unfortunately, rain gauge measurements are sparse and unevenly distributed, which substantially hampers the use of in situ precipitation data in many regions of the world. The increasing availability of high-resolution gridded precipitation products presents a valuable alternative, especially over poorly gauged regions. This study examines the usefulness of current state-of-the-art precipitation data sets in hydrological modeling. For this purpose, we force a conceptual hydrological model with multiple precipitation data sets in >200 European catchments to obtain runoff and evapotranspiration. We consider a wide range of precipitation products, which are generated via (1) the interpolation of gauge measurements (E-OBS and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) V.2018), (2) data assimilation into reanalysis models (ERA-Interim, ERA5, and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis - CFSR), and (3) a combination of multiple sources (Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation; MSWEP V2). Evaluation is done at the daily and monthly timescales during the period of 1984-2007. We find that simulated runoff values are highly dependent on the accuracy of precipitation inputs; in contrast, simulated evapotranspiration is generally much less influenced in our comparatively wet study region. We also find that the impact of precipitation uncertainty on simulated runoff increases towards wetter regions, while the opposite is observed in the case of evapotranspiration. Finally, we perform an indirect performance evaluation of the precipitation data sets by comparing the runoff simulations with streamflow observations. Thereby, E-OBS yields the particularly strong agreement, while ERA5, GPCC V.2018, and MSWEP V2 show good performances. We further reveal climate-dependent performance variations of the considered data sets, which can be used to guide their future development. The overall best agreement is achieved when using an ensemble mean generated from all the individual products. In summary, our findings highlight a climate-dependent propagation of precipitation uncertainty through the water cycle; while runoff is strongly impacted in comparatively wet regions, such as central Europe, there are increasing implications for evapotranspiration in drier regions.","[Fallah, Ali] Shiraz Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran; [Fallah, Ali; Sungmin, O.; Orth, Rene] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Shiraz University; Max Planck Society,"Fallah, A (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran.;Fallah, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",alifallah@shirazu.ac.ir,"O, Sungmin/AAQ-8919-2021; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022; Orth, Rene/AAG-7034-2021; Fallah, Ali/AAA-5405-2022","Orth, Rene/0000-0002-9853-921X","German Research Foundation [391059971]; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (MSRT) of the Islamic Republic of Iran","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (MSRT) of the Islamic Republic of Iran","This research has been supported by the German Research Foundation (Emmy Noether; grant no. 391059971) and the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (MSRT) of the Islamic Republic of Iran.",,79,5,5,4,13,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Here we analyze the prospects for interactive icebergs in GCMs by forcing an iceberg drift and decay model with circulation and temperature fields from (i) state-of-the-art GCM output and (ii) an observational state estimate. The spread of meltwater is found to be smaller for the GCM than for the observational state estimate, despite a substantial high wind bias in the GCM-a bias that is similar to most current GCMs. We argue that this large-scale reduction in the spread of meltwater occurs primarily due to localized differences in ocean currents, which may be related to the coarseness of the horizontal resolution in the GCM. The high wind bias in the GCM is shown to have relatively little impact on the meltwater distribution, despite Arctic iceberg drift typically being dominated by the wind forcing. We find that this is due to compensating effects between faster drift under stronger winds and larger wind-driven wave erosion. These results may have implications for future changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation simulated with iceberg-enabled GCMs. Plain Language Summary Recent reductions in the volume of the polar ice sheets highlight the importance of the question how ice sheet meltwater impacts the large-scale ocean circulation and global climate. For example, it has been argued that increased meltwater from Greenland will slow down the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in the coming decades. The likelihood of this scenario depends on where the meltwater is released at the ocean surface. Icebergs, which carry up to half of this meltwater, play a crucial role in transporting meltwater equatorward in the North Atlantic. Our results suggest that climate models that include icebergs will underestimate this equatorward transport of meltwater, with potentially far-reaching implications for the AMOC.","[Wagner, Till J.

Trang An exemplifies the rise of ecotourism in Vietnam as a solution to the country's need for both economic growth and environmental protection, while responding to climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges. Located in an area undergoing peri-urbanization, Trang An contributes to the fostering of a 'greener' urban development pattern while providing local communities with less climate-sensitive livelihoods. However, new vulnerabilities emerge from this transition as a result of redefined power relations and differential access to resources. Our critical approach provides a more nuanced picture of a project that is often represented as a success story. While pitfalls are inevitable in such a transformational project, the lived experience of local residents reveals the complex, elusive, and inefficient governance between the various stakeholders on the management level and begs troubling questions about environmental and social justice.","[Hoang, Thao] Teach Vietnam, 216 My Hoang Quarter,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Pulliat, Gwenn] Univ Montpellier 3, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, UMR Art Dev, CNRS, Route Mende, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Pulliat, G (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 3, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, UMR Art Dev, CNRS, Route Mende, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France.",thaohoang5915@gmail.com; gwenn.pulliat@cnrs.fr,,"Pulliat, Gwenn/0000-0003-2649-5614",,,,,55,3,3,4,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2365-757X,2365-7588,978-3-319-98968-6; 978-3-319-98967-9,URBAN BOOK SERIES,,,2019,,,,,179,199,,10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6_9,10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6,,21,Environmental Studies; Geography; Urban Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Urban Studies,BQ9GS,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000624512100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Strategic and transformative effects of arts in anti-coal struggles in Oakland, CA",GEOFORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,"Artistic activism; Socio-spatial transformations; Anti-coal movement; Environmental justice; Social movements; Oakland, CA",ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; CLIMATE JUSTICE; LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY; WEST OAKLAND; COMMUNITY; MOVEMENTS; PARTNERSHIP; EXPOSURE; POLITICS; DEGROWTH,"Mushrooming opposition to coal mining and transportation in the United States (US) connects with both environmental justice and climate justice movements. Artistic expressions are part of the strategic toolkit of these movements. Art's capacity to foster cultural, cognitive and psychological changes is amply recognized by academics as well as by public in general. Nevertheless, the theoretical question of how art is linked to activist strategies and to socio-spatial transformations in environmental conflicts remains unexplored. This paper contributes to filling this gap by examining the emblematic struggle to stop the construction of a coal-export terminal in Oakland, CA. Our data includes 32 in-depth interviews of activists, artists and legal experts linked to the conflict surrounding this coal-export terminal. Non-participant observation and secondary data collection helped to contextualize the interviews. The results offer a timeline of the movement, a map of artistic expressions, and network analyses around the effects of environmental artistic activism. We demonstrate that creative activism has critical relevance for facilitating engagement, education and outreach of the anti-coal movement. Arts and its spatial impact benefited the movement by expanding its scale and making it more inclusive regarding demographics, including particularly women and youth of color. The use of the arts raised environmental and political awareness and enhanced public participation in decision making. The paper connects the literatures of environmental justice, environmental humanities and human geography. We contribute to the yet underdeveloped dialogue discussing the capacity of art to influence socio-ecological structures and socio-spatial dynamics in cases of environmental justice conflict.","[Sanz, Teresa; Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, 310 Social Sci Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Sanz, T (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",teresa.sanz@uab.cat; Beatriz.rodriguez@uab.cat,"Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz/I-6257-2015","Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz/0000-0002-0559-910X; Sanz, Teresa/0000-0003-3369-0434",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [797444],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant,"This research was possible thanks to CLAMOR project, funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement 797444.

Climatic envelope models describing the spatial distribution of palsa mires (mire complexes with permafrost peat hummocks) in northern Fennoscandia were calibrated for three baseline periods, eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques and 25 versions sampling the parameter uncertainty of each technique - a total of 600 models. The sensitivity of these models to changes in temperature and precipitation was analysed to construct impact response surfaces. These were used to assess the behaviour of models when extrapolated into changed climate conditions, so that new criteria, in addition to conventional model evaluation statistics, could be defined for determining model reliability. Impact response surfaces were also combined with climate change projections to estimate the risk of areas suitable for palsas disappearing during the 21st century. Structural differences in impact models appeared to be a major source of uncertainty, with 69% of the models giving implausible projections. Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was judged to be the most reliable technique for model extrapolation. Using GAM, it was estimated as very likely (>90% probability) that the area suitable for palsas is reduced to less than half the baseline area by the period 2030-2049 and as likely (>66% probability) that the entire area becomes unsuitable by 2080-2099 (A1B emission scenario). The risk of total loss of palsa area was reduced for a mitigation scenario under which global warming was constrained to below 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial climate, although it too implied a considerable reduction in area suitable for palsas.","[Fronzek, S.; Carter, T.

While many studies compare methods, we will focus in this study on the consequences of the input data choice in a state-of-the-art Kalman-filter paleoclimate data assimilation approach. We evaluate reconstruction quality in the 20th century based on three collections of tree-ring records: (1) 54 of the best temperature-sensitive tree-ring chronologies chosen by experts; (2) 415 temperature-sensitive treering records chosen less strictly by regional working groups and statistical screening; (3) 2287 tree-ring series that are not screened for climate sensitivity. The three data sets cover the range from small sample size, small spatial coverage and strict screening for temperature sensitivity to large sample size and spatial coverage but no screening. Additionally, we explore a combination of these data sets plus screening methods to improve the reconstruction quality. A large, unscreened collection generally leads to a poor reconstruction skill. A small expert selection of extratropical Northern Hemisphere records allows for a skillful highlatitude temperature reconstruction but cannot be expected to provide information for other regions and other variables. We achieve the best reconstruction skill across all variables and regions by combining all available input data but rejecting records with insignificant climatic information (p value of regression model > 0 :05) and removing duplicate records. It is important to use a tree-ring proxy system model that includes both major growth limitations, temperature and moisture.","[Franke, Jorg; Valler, Veronika; Bronnimann, Stefan; Neukom, Raphael] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Franke, Jorg; Valler, Veronika; Bronnimann, Stefan; Neukom, Raphael] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Neukom, Raphael] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Neukom, Raphael] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Jaume-Santero, Fernando] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Earth Phys & Astrophys, Madrid, Spain",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Zurich; University of Fribourg; Complutense University of Madrid,"Franke, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland.;Franke, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",franke@giub.unibe.ch,,"Franke, Jorg/0000-0001-7897-4225; Neukom, Raphael/0000-0001-9392-0997; Jaume-Santero, Fernando/0000-0002-8441-3798",Swiss National Science Foundation [162668 RE-USE]; EU ERC project [787574 PALAEO-RA]; Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF) [PZ00P2_154802],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); EU ERC project; Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This research has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. 162668 RE-USE) and the EU ERC project (grant no. 787574 PALAEO-RA) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF; grant PZ00P2_154802).,,45,7,7,2,7,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1814-9324,1814-9332,,CLIM PAST,Clim.

Insights into the implications of climate change on rainfall extremes and resulting floods are of major importance to improve flood risk analysis and water system design. A wide range of statistical and dynamical downscaling and bias-correction methods for the generation of local climate projections exists. Yet, the applicability of these methods highly depends on availability of meteorological data. In developing countries, data availability is often limited, either because data do not exist or because of restrictions on use. We here present a climate change analysis for the Brahmani-Baitarani river basin focusing on changes in rainfall using data from three GCMs from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that were selected based on their performance. We apply and compare two widely used and easy to implement bias-correction methods. These were selected because reliable open historical meteorological datasets required for advanced methods were not available. The results indicate likely increases in monsoon rainfall especially in the mountainous regions and likely increases in the number of heavy rain days. We conclude with a discussion on the gap between state-of-the-art downscaling techniques and the actual options in regional climate change assessments.","[Dahm, R. J.; Weiland, F. C.

(Climatic Change, published online 14th May, DOI: (10.1007/s10584-011-0093-x), analysed different projections from global climate models in order to assess the frequency of storm surges in Venice during the 21st century under a climate change context. They concluded that the frequency of storm surges would decrease by about 30%, and that this reduction would compensate the expected mean sea level rise. Their final statement was that the frequency of extreme tides in Venice might largely remain unaltered. Although we agree in the expected reduction of storm surges, we strongly disagree in their final conclusion. First, because the impact of storm surges not only depends on the number of extreme surge events, but also on their intensity, that was not explicitely addressed. Second, because their estimates of mean sea level change for the 21st century are largely underestimated, as they miss some of the components driving sea level variability. Using state-of-the-art estimates for the thermosteric, mass and tidal contributions we show that the flooding events in Venice are expected to dramatically increase in a climate change scenario.","[Jorda, G.; Gomis, D.; Marcos, M.] CSIC, UIB, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Esporles 07190, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Mediterraneo de Estudios Avanzados (IMEDEA); Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Jorda, G (corresponding author), CSIC, UIB, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Esporles 07190, Spain.",gabriel.jorda@uib.es,"Marcos, Marta/C-7053-2012","Marcos, Marta/0000-0001-9975-5013; Gomis, Damia/0000-0002-9732-0080",,,,,20,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

One method to succeed in this task is to increase the integration timestep. We have tested several techniques which may prove useful. The most successful was applied to the shallow water equations over a spherical surface in which the prediction model was represented in its normal modes, the high-frequency modes were balanced while the low-frequency modes were predicted. Experiments which we will describe extend this procedure to a state-of-the-art model (the NCAR/CCM3). We have taken the predicted data from each timestep of the model integration, projected it onto Hough modes, separated the modes into fast and slow components, integrated the slow components with a timestep 3 times longer than that used in the standard model run and balanced the fast modes. The modal data was then reconverted to model format and returned for the next iteration. Seasonal model output using this procedure was compared to the standard model run output and the results of 10 realizations showed that both calculations gave identical results within model variability.","Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Baer, F (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Zhang, Banglin/GLN-6919-2022","Zhang, Banglin/0000-0001-7836-8102",,,,,17,2,2,0,2,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0280-6495,,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

After an introduction on the state of the art, with particular reference to the Alpine region, the results of recent investigations in the two study sites are illustrated. At Cortina d'Ampezzo, several landslides were dated mainly by the radiocarbon method. The most ancient landslide event there involved large rock slides, which affected the dolomitic slopes following the withdrawal of glaciers after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and also slides and flows mainly occurring in pelitic materials of the valley floors (from 13,000 to 10,000 cat BP). A later series of flows occurred between 5500 and 2500 cat BP. In the Upper Badia Valley (Alta Badia), the most ancient events go back to 10,000 and 9000 cat BP, and correspond with earth flows that followed vast rotational slides affecting the bedrock up to a depth of about 50 m. More recent earth flows, involving more modest amounts of material, took place between 6500 and 2300 cal BP. By analysing the dates from the two study areas, it was possible to correlate the recorded increase of landslide activity with the climatic changes occurring at the boundary between the Late glacial and the Holocene and between the Atlantic and the Subboreal, and to compare the results with those derived from other European regions. The types and causes of landslides taking place in these two periods were substantially different, reflecting the different morphoclimatic conditions that existed in the two areas when these mass movements were triggered. Finally, notwithstanding the importance of non-climatic causes, such as geological-structural factors and possible human influences, it is concluded that many of the dated landslides can be considered as indicators of climatic change.

This framework integrated the projections of environmental niche models (ENMs) with an index of vulnerability based on the species' ecological traits. We found vulnerability to be highly variable among species, suggesting that responses to climate change will be idiosyncratic, and identified a number of species that by virtue of their ecological traits and model projections may be at risk of significant range contractions in the near future. Importantly, we also found that extrinsic vulnerability (as measured by the degree of range change) and intrinsic vulnerability (based on species traits) were not correlated, highlighting the importance of considering both types of information.

State-of-the-art numerical weather predicition (NWP) models are already used at the kilometer-scale. At this resolution explicit calculation of convection becomes feasible and effects of small-scale topographic features and land use structures can be accounted for. It is assumed that consequently extremes like wind gusts, thunderstorms or heavy rain will be modeled more realistically. COSMO-CLM is the climate version of the NWP model of the COSMO consortium. It has been employed in simulations at 1,3 km resolution over the region of Rhineland-Palatinate. Two time slices of 10 years (1960-69 and 2015-24) show changes in extremes for the IPCC A1B scenario. A peaks over threshold (POT) extreme value analysis gives information about changes in extremes of near-surface wind speed, screen level temperature and precipitation. Moving block bootstrapping is used for the assessment of the stability of the POT method. Regionalization of the extreme value analysis shows that mountaineous regions will experience the strongest change in daily minimum temperature extremes while in flat and lowland region daily maximum temperature extremes change most. The changes in wind speed tend around zero, in the mean as well as in the extremes. Our study shows that there is an added value through the better resolution of the meteorological variability.","[Knote, Christoph; Heinemann, Guenther] Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Knote, Christoph; Rockel, Burkhardt] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany",Universitat Trier; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Knote, C (corresponding author), Empa Mat Technol & Sci, Lab Air Pollut & Environm Technol, Ueberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",christoph.knote@empa.ch,"Knote, Christoph/A-9809-2010","Knote, Christoph/0000-0001-9105-9179; Heinemann, Gunther/0000-0002-4831-9016",DKRZ Model Data group,DKRZ Model Data group,"We are grateful to the DKRZ Model & Data group, especially Martina Schubert and Irina Fast for their support.

Here, we examine the natural range of variability in the Conejos River Valley, southern Colorado, through documentation of terrace morphostratigraphic and sedimentological characteristics as well as through investigation of sediment contributions from headwaters, hillslopes and tributary streams. Additionally, soil development and radiocarbon ages, together with local and regional paleoclimate reconstructions, were used to infer the range of processes acting in this system. Since de-glaciation, the Conejos River has fluctuated between episodes of bedrock strath formation, aggradation and vertical incision. Morphostratigraphic relationships, soil development and radiocarbon ages enable us to propose a chronology for periods of alluvial deposition (around 8.9-7.6?ka, 5.5?ka and from 3.5 to 1.1?ka), separated by intervals of fluvial incision. We infer potential forcing mechanisms by utilizing multiple working hypotheses. Specifically, we discuss the potential for increases in sediment supply during periods of (1) para-glacial adjustment, (2) climatic cooling, (3) increased frequency of climate change and (4) increased fire frequency or severity. We also consider the effects of changes in stream discharge and extreme storm occurrence. We conclude that combinations of these processes, operating at different times, have contributed to sediment mobilization since de-glaciation. Stream and landform morphology also varies longitudinally due to the influence of remnant glacial topography. In particular, valley bottom overdeepening at tributary junctions has resulted in incision and strath formation into unlithified glacial deposits (i.e. fill-cut terraces) rather than bedrock in some reaches. Overall, the Conejos fluvial system has varied significantly both temporally and spatially since de-glaciation and appears to be sensitive to changes in sediment supply related to Holocene scale climate fluctuations. This natural range of variability must therefore be a key consideration in any future stream management policies.

It is comprehended from the available research domain of sales ethics that it is imperative to study and validate those factors that directly or indirectly enhance the productivity of sales. It is observed that only sprinkling of research efforts have evaluated the available studies on sales ethics in a single tabular study. To address this concern, in this paper, researchers have presented the state-of-the-art framework on sales ethics that tends to evaluate various sales domains ranging from job satisfaction, purchase intention, sales leadership, sales situation, leader-member exchange, ethical sales behavior, individual and organization perspectives. The entire literature review is divided into four categories based on the shift in trends focus of variables undertaken to study sales ethics. The findings indicate that during the four-time span of studies, the focus has shifted from organizational factors to individual characteristics and skills of the salesperson and their influence on ethical climate. In the third identified duration, researchers focus on customer dealings and ethical behavior, and finally, the main emphasis is on the moralistic values of salesperson while performing sales activities. The practice of competition and leader-member exchange, the collegiality of salesperson, and conflict of the role were identified by various researchers in this state-of-the-art strategy of sales ethics. In this work, researchers delineated the objectives and essential findings of the reported work in the sales ethics domain. This will help the readers to practice the dependent factors covered in this study.

We construct private and social marginal cost curves for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient runoff in Finnish agriculture. We find that the social marginal costs of reducing emissions that reflect the cobenefits are lower than the private costs. Accounting for greenhouse gas cobenefits from nutrient load reduction or water cobenefits from climate emissions reduction creates a gap between privately and socially optimal reduction levels. This gap varies depending on the valuation of cobenefits. The cost-efficient reduction of the focus pollutant is increased when cobenefits from the other pollutant are accounted for. For policies, this implies a higher cap or tax on the focus pollutant. We decompose the optimal tax rate to a basic tax on the focus pollutant and on an additional tax component depending on the level of cobenefits.","[Lotjonen, Sanna; Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Lotjonen, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",sanna.lotjonen@helsinki.fi; markku.ollikainen@helsinki.fi,,"Lotjonen, Sanna/0000-0003-4801-7533; Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683",Academy of Finland [291681] Funding Source: Medline; Seventh Framework Programme [BONUS (Art 185)] Funding Source: Medline,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission),,,25,6,6,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,1654-7209,,AMBIO,Ambio,NOV,2019,11,,SI,,1304,1313,,10.1007/s13280-019-01257-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01257-z,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JH2IX,31552643,"Green Published, hybrid",,,12/21/22,WOS:000492594700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using the Community Earth System Model with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3, we find that anthropogenic aerosol emissions from East and Southeast Asia exert a global mean net radiative effect of -0.49 +/- 0.04 W/m(2). Approximately half of this cooling effect can be attributed to anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions. The aerosol emissions drive widespread cooling across the Northern Hemisphere. Strong suppression of precipitation occurs over East and Southeast Asia, indicating that anthropogenic aerosol emissions may impact water resources locally. However, in contrast to previous research, we find no clear evidence of remote effects on precipitation over Australia and West Africa. We recommend further investigation of possible remote effects.

The model uses the three-dimensional primitive equations for both ocean and atmosphere but is simplified from a 'state of the art' coupled model by using simplified atmospheric physics and parameterisation schemes. These simplifications provide considerable savings in computational expense and, perhaps more importantly, allow mechanisms to be investigated more cleanly and thoroughly than with a more elaborate model. For example, the model allows integrations of several millennia as well as broad parameter studies. For the ocean, the model uses the free surface primitive equations Modular Ocean Model (MOM) and the GFDL/FMS sea-ice model (SIS) is coupled to the oceanic grid. The atmospheric component consists of the FMS B-grid moist primitive equations atmospheric dynamical core with highly simplified physical parameterisations. A simple bucket model is implemented for our idealised land following the GFDL/FMS Land model. The model is supported within the standard MOM releases as one of its many test cases and the source code is thus freely available. Here we describe the model components and present a climatology of coupled simulations achieved with two different geometrical configurations. Throughout the paper, we give a flavour of the potential for this model to be a powerful tool for the climate modelling community by mentioning a wide range of studies that are currently being explored.","[Farneti, R.; Vallis, G.

WEST combines two models that operate at different spatial scales. The Mesoscale Compressible Community (MC2) model is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model that produces simulations over large domains of the order of a thousand kilometres. The MC2 model uses long-term synoptic scale wind climate data from the analysis of radiosonde and other observations to simulate mean wind fields at tens of metres above the ground using a horizontal resolution of a few kilometres. The mesoscale results are used as input to MS-Micro/3 (Mason and Sykes (1979) version of the Jackson and Hunt (1975) model version for microcomputers/3-dimensional; MS-Micro hereafter), a more computer-efficient, microscale model with simpler linearized momentum equations and a domain restricted to a few tens of kilometres with horizontal grid sizes of tens or hundreds of metres. MS-Micro provides wind field results at specific wind generator hub heights (typically 30 to 50 in above ground level (AGL)) which are of interest to researchers and developers of wind farms. WEST shows relatively strong correlations between its simulated long-term mean wind speed and the measurements from ten wind energy monitoring stations. However, in the mountainous terrain of the Yukon, WEST tends to predict wind speeds which art about 40% too high. The model also produces erroneous wind directions and some were perpendicular to valley orientations. The most likely cause of the wind speed and direction errors is the substantially modified 5-km grid-spaced mesoscale terrain used in MC2. The WEST simulation was also found to double the wind speeds observed at airport stations and there was poor correlation between the simulated and observed wind speeds. The bias in the model could be attributed to a number of factors, including the use of smoothed topography by the model, the discrepancy between the neutral atmosphere assumed in MS-Micro and the normally observed stable atmosphere, the application of MS-Micro to every third grid point of the MC2 output, abnormally high sea level wind speeds in the input climate data for MC2, and a certain degree of disagreement between the land surface characteristics used in the model and those found in the field. At comparatively low computer cost, WEST predicts a wind climate map that compares favourably to the wind measurements made in several locations in the Yukon. However, the problem of the modified terrain in the mountainous regions is the most pressing problem and needs to be addressed before WEST is used in the mountainous regions of Canada.","Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; MSC, RPN, Dorval, PQ, Canada",University of Alberta,"Pinard, JDJP (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",jpinard@polarcom.com,,,,,,,35,10,11,0,3,CANADIAN METEOROLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHIC SOC,OTTAWA,"150 LOUIS PASTEUR PVT., STE 112, MCDONALD BUILDING, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1N 6N5, CANADA",0705-5900,,,ATMOS OCEAN,Atmos.-Ocean,SEP,2005,3,,,,259,282,,10.3137/ao.430306,http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.430306,,,24,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,967QK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000232106100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is significant interest in the role of abrupt climate events as a driver of early Holocene human activity, but there are very few well-dated records directly compared with local climate archives. Here, we present evidence from the internationally important Mesolithic site of Star Carr showing occupation during the early Holocene, which is directly compared with a high-resolution palaeoclimate record from neighbouring lake beds. We show that-once established-there was intensive human activity at the site for several hundred years when the community was subject to multiple, severe, abrupt climate events that impacted air temperatures, the landscape and the ecosystem of the region. However, these results show that occupation and activity at the site persisted regardless of the environmental stresses experienced by this society. The Star Carr population displayed a high level of resilience to climate change, suggesting that postglacial populations were not necessarily held hostage to the flickering switch of climate change. Instead, we show that local, intrinsic changes in the wetland environment were more significant in determining human activity than the large-scale abrupt early Holocene climate events.","[Blockley, Simon; Candy, Ian; Matthews, Ian; Palmer, Adrian; Lincoln, Paul; Abrook, Ashley] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, Ctr Quaternary Res, Egham, Surrey, England; [Langdon, Pete; Langdon, Cath] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Taylor, Barry] Univ Chester, Hist & Archaeol, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Conneller, Chantal] Univ Manchester, Dept Archaeol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Bayliss, Alex] Hist England, Cannon Bridge House, London, England; [Bayliss, Alex] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland; [MacLeod, Alison] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Deeprose, Laura] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Darvill, Chris] Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kearney, Rebecca; Staff, Richard] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Beavan, Nancy] Kenepuru Sci Ctr, Inst Environm Sci & Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Staff, Richard] Univ Glasgow, Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, E Kilbride, Lanark, Scotland; [Bamforth, Michael; Taylor, Maisie; Milner, Nicky] Univ York, Dept Archaeol, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Southampton; University of Chester; University of Manchester; University of Stirling; University of Reading; Lancaster University; University of Manchester; University of Oxford; Institute of Environmental Science & Research (ESR) - New Zealand; Scottish Universities Research & Reactor Center; University of Glasgow; University of York - UK,"Blockley, S (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, Ctr Quaternary Res, Egham, Surrey, England.",Simon.Blockley@rhul.ac.uk,"MacLeod, Alison/AAA-6039-2020; Langdon, Peter G/B-4682-2013","Darvill, Christopher/0000-0001-8175-2658; Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643; Abrook, Ashley/0000-0002-2645-5535; Matthews, Ian/0000-0002-1642-7346; Staff, Richard/0000-0002-8634-014X; Beavan, Nancy/0000-0001-5649-0430; Lincoln, Paul/0000-0003-0566-2970","European Research Council under the European Union [283938]; British Academy [SG-44333, SG-47081, SG-50217]; English Heritage/Historic England [5536, 6064, 6793, 6796]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I015191/1]; Vale of Pickering Research Trust; Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2015-396]; Natural Environment Research Council's London Doctoral Training Partnership; NERC [NE/I015191/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); British Academy; English Heritage/Historic England; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Vale of Pickering Research Trust; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Natural Environment Research Council's London Doctoral Training Partnership; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the landowners of Star Carr, English Heritage/Historic England, and Natural England for granting permission to excavate.

Application of the K-means clustering method on a historical reconstruction of SIT from 1958 to 2013, produced by an ocean-sea-ice general circulation model, identifies three Arctic SIT clusters or modes of climate variability. These SIT modes have consistent patterns in different calendar months and their discrete time series of occurrences show persistence on intraseasonal to interannual time scales. We use the EC-Earth2.3 coupled climate model to produce five-member 12-month-long monthly forecasts of the NH SIT modes initialized on 1 May and 1 November every year from 1979 to 2010. We use a three-state first-order Markov chain and climatological probability forecasts determined from the historical SIT mode reconstruction as two statistical reference forecasts. The analysis of ranked probability skill scores (RPSSs) relating these three forecast systems shows that the dynamical SIT mode forecasts typically have a higher skill than the Markov chain forecasts, which are overall better than climatological forecasts. The evolution of RPSS in forecast time indicates that the transition from the sea-ice melting season to growing season in the EC-Earth2.3 forecasts, with respect to the Markov chain model, typically leads to the improvement of prediction skill. The reliability diagrams overall show better reliability of the dynamical forecasts than that of the Markov chain model, especially for 1 May start dates, while dynamical forecasts with 1 November start dates are overconfident. The relative operating characteristics (ROC) diagrams confirm this hierarchy of forecast skill among these three forecast systems. Furthermore, ROC diagrams stratified in groups of 3 sequential forecast months show that Arctic SIT mode forecasts initialized on 1 November typically lose resolution with forecast time more slowly than forecasts initialized on 1 May.","[Fuckar, Neven S.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Fuckar, Neven S.; Guemas, Virginie; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] BSC, Barcelona, Spain; [Guemas, Virginie] CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grp Etud Atmosphere Meteorol, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Johnson, Nathaniel C.] Princeton Univ, Cooperat Inst Climate Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",University of Oxford; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Princeton University; ICREA,"Fuckar, NS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.;Fuckar, NS (corresponding author), BSC, Barcelona, Spain.",neven.fuckar@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Johnson, Nathaniel C/L-8045-2015; Guemas, Virginie/B-9090-2016","Johnson, Nathaniel C/0000-0003-4906-178X; Guemas, Virginie/0000-0002-6340-3558; Fuckar, Neven S./0000-0002-0097-3764",PICA-ICE Project - Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [CGL2012-31987]; SPECS Project - Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [GA 308378]; PRIMAVERA project - Horizon 2020 framework of the European Commission [GA 641727]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain; NOAA's Climate Program Office,PICA-ICE Project - Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain; SPECS Project - Seventh Framework Programme (FP7); PRIMAVERA project - Horizon 2020 framework of the European Commission; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain(Spanish Government); NOAA's Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors acknowledge funding support for this study from the PICA-ICE (CGL2012-31987) Project funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain, the SPECS (GA 308378) Project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the PRIMAVERA (GA 641727) project funded by the Horizon 2020 framework of the European Commission.

The model simulations differ with respect to the prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and whether nudging is applied or not. The CCM EMAC is able to most closely reproduce the signature and pattern of the water vapour drop in agreement with those derived from satellite observations if the model is nudged. Model results confirm that this extraordinary water vapour decline is particularly obvious in the tropical lower stratosphere and is related to a large decrease in cold point temperature. The drop signal propagates under dilution to the higher stratosphere and to the poles via the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC). We found that the driving forces for this significant decline in water vapour mixing ratios are tropical sea surface temperature (SST) changes due to a coincidence with a preceding strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation event (1997/1998) followed by a strong La Nina event (1999/2000) and supported by the change of the westerly to the easterly phase of the equatorial stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in 2000. Correct (observed) SSTs are important for triggering the strong decline in water vapour. There are indications that, at least partly, SSTs contribute to the long period of low water vapour values from 2001 to 2006. For this period, the specific dynamical state of the atmosphere (overall atmospheric large-scale wind and temperature distribution) is important as well, as it causes the observed persistent low cold point temperatures. These are induced by a period of increased upwelling, which, however, has no corresponding pronounced signature in SSTs anomalies in the tropics. Our free-running simulations do not capture the drop as observed, because a) the cold point temperature has a low bias and thus the water vapour variability is reduced and b) because they do not simulate the appropriate dynamical state. Large negative water vapour declines are also found in other years and seem to be a feature which can be found after strong combined El Nino/La Nina events if the QBO west phase during La Nina changes to the east phase.","[Brinkop, Sabine; Dameris, Martin; Joeckel, Patrick; Garny, Hella] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Lossow, Stefan; Stiller, Gabriele] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Brinkop, S (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",sabine.brinkop@dlr.de,"Jöckel, Patrick/C-3687-2009; Stiller, Gabriele P./A-7340-2013","Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394; Stiller, Gabriele P./0000-0003-2883-6873; Brinkop, Sabine/0000-0003-3167-203X; Lossow, Stefan/0000-0003-2833-0522; Dameris, Martin/0000-0001-6700-0628",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the research unit Stratospheric Change and its Role for Climate Prediction [SHARP-FOR 1095]; Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the research unit Stratospheric Change and its Role for Climate Prediction(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ),"This work has been funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the research unit Stratospheric Change and its Role for Climate Prediction (SHARP-FOR 1095).

Based on a suite of NorCPM retrospective forecasts, we show that seasonal prediction of pan-Arctic SIE is skillful at lead times up to 12 months, which outperforms the anomaly persistence forecast. The SIE skill varies seasonally and regionally. Among the five Arctic marginal seas, the Barents Sea has the highest SIE prediction skill, which is up to 10-11 lead months for winter target months. In the Barents Sea, the skill during summer is largely controlled by the variability of solar heat flux and the skill during winter is mostly constrained by the upper ocean heat content/SST and also related to the heat transport through the Barents Sea Opening. Compared with several state-of-the-art dynamical prediction systems, NorCPM has comparable regional SIE skill in winter due to the improved upper ocean heat content. The relatively low skill of summer SIE in NorCPM suggests that SST anomalies are not sufficient to constrain summer SIE variability and further assimilation of sea ice thickness or atmospheric data is expected to increase the skill.","[Dai, Panxi] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yongqi; Counillon, Francois; Wang, Yiguo; Kimmritz, Madlen; Langehaug, Helene R.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Gao, Yongqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kimmritz, Madlen] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany","Peking University; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Dai, PX (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pancy@pku.edu.cn,"gao, yongqi/N-9347-2014","Wang, Yiguo/0000-0001-9544-8382; Dai, Panxi/0000-0002-4614-3045; Counillon, Francois/0000-0002-6412-3806",national Key RD Program [2018YFC1407104]; NordForsk through the Nordic Center of Excellence ARCPATH [76654]; EU H2020 Blue-Action [727852]; SIU CONNECTED project [UTF-2016-long-term/10030]; EC [727890]; Norwegian Research Council project SFE [27073]; Trond Mohn Foundation [BFS2018TMT01]; Norwegian Program for supercomputing (NOTUR2) [NN9039K]; storage Grant (NORSTORE) [NS9039K],national Key RD Program; NordForsk through the Nordic Center of Excellence ARCPATH; EU H2020 Blue-Action; SIU CONNECTED project; EC(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Norwegian Research Council project SFE; Trond Mohn Foundation; Norwegian Program for supercomputing (NOTUR2); storage Grant (NORSTORE),"This study was supported by the national Key R&D Program (Grant No. 2018YFC1407104), the NordForsk through the Nordic Center of Excellence ARCPATH (Grant 76654), the EU H2020 Blue-Action (Grant 727852), SIU CONNECTED project (Grant UTF-2016-long-term/10030) through mobility grant, the EC Horizon2020 project INTAROS (Grant 727890), the Norwegian Research Council project SFE (Grant 27073) and the Trond Mohn Foundation under the project number BFS2018TMT01.

Tipping points are often associated with bifurcations, where a previously stable system state loses stability when a system parameter is increased above a well-defined critical value. However, in some cases such transitions can occur even before a parameter threshold is crossed, given that the parameter change is fast enough. It is not known whether this is the case in high-dimensional, complex systems like a state-of-the-art climate model or the real climate system. Using a global ocean model subject to freshwater forcing, we show that a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation can indeed be induced even by small-amplitude changes in the forcing, if the rate of change is fast enough. Identifying the location of critical thresholds in climate subsystems by slowly changing system parameters has been a core focus in assessing risks of abrupt climate change. This study suggests that such thresholds might not be relevant in practice, if parameter changes are not slow. Furthermore, we show that due to the chaotic dynamics of complex systems there is no well-defined critical rate of parameter change, which severely limits the predictability of the qualitative long-term behavior. The results show that the safe operating space of elements of the Earth system with respect to future emissions might be smaller than previously thought.","[Lohmann, Johannes; Ditlevsen, Peter D.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Phys Ice Climate & Earth, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute,"Lohmann, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Phys Ice Climate & Earth, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.",johannes.lohmann@nbi.ku.dk,,"Ditlevsen, Peter/0000-0003-2120-7732",Villum Foundation [17470]; European Union's Horizon 2020 project Tipping Points in the Earth System [820970],Villum Foundation(Villum Fonden); European Union's Horizon 2020 project Tipping Points in the Earth System,J.L. thanks Roman Nuterman and Dion Hafner for support in configuring the Veros model.

We aimed to investigate: 1) the association between empowering (EMC) and disempowering (DMC) motivational-climate and musculoskeletal injuries in ballet, and 2) if EMC moderates the association between DMC and injuries. METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort survey-study was conducted online among ballet dancers (>18 yrs old) reporting acute and overuse injuries of the previous 2 years. Motivational climate was assessed with the Empowering-and-Disempowering Motivational Climate Questionnaire (5-point Likert scale). The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre Overuse Injury Questionnaire assessed severity of overuse injuries. Linear regression was performed adjusted for the confounders age, sex, expertise, experience, and initiation-age with an interaction term between EMC and DMC to assess effect modification. RESULTS: An international sample of 189 dancers (26.7 +/- 7.9 yrs; 130 professionals) reported 197 acute and 465 overuse injuries (in the previous 2 years). Mean EMC was 3.1 +/- 1.07, DMC 3.3 +/- 1.08. EMC was associated with less acute (13=-0.22; 95%CI -0.40 to -0.04) and overuse injuries (13=-0.74; 95%CI -0.99 to -0.50), while DMC was associated with more injuries (acute: 13=0.30; 95%CI 0.13 to 0.47; overuse: 13=0.74; 95%CI 0.50 to 0.98). When tested together and adjusted for confounders, EMC lost its protective effect (acute: 13=-0.15; 95%CI -0.19 to 0.49; overuse: 13=-0.34; 95%CI -0.81 to 0.13). DMC was positively associated with injuries throughout all settings (acute: 13=0.43; 95%CI 0.10 to 0.76; overuse: 13=0.46; 95%CI 0.00 to 0.91). EMC showed no moderating effects on DMC in the adjusted models. CONCLUSION: To avoid injuries, it is not enough to create an EMC, because any disempowering nuances may negatively affect empowering climates. Teachers should avoid DMC altogether to prevent injuries in dancers. Med Probl Perform Art 2021;36(3):187-198","[Kaufmann, Judith-Elisa; Nelissen, Rob G. H. H.; Gademan, Maaike G.

Consequently, Peru is currently creating its national structure to combat climate change through mitigation and adaptation actions. Nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) are the planned interventions that nations report for intended reductions in GHG emissions. In fact, Peru has now committed to reduce its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 with respect to a business-as-usual estimation for that same year. The 76 NDCs have been divided into six main sectors: energy, transport, industrial processes, agriculture, forestry and waste. In this context, the main goal of this study is to provide a critical review of the validity and effectiveness of current mitigation NDCs proposed by the Peruvian government to comply with the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the analysis is accompanied by a discussion on how the use of life-cycle methods, namely Life Cycle Assessment, can be of utility in terms of policy support to evaluate the mitigation potential of these NDCs, as well as in the identification of additional contributions in sectors where the mitigation potential has been obviated. The expansion of system boundaries beyond the national context to account for the globalized nature of current market flows or the modelling of indirect impacts of a particular policy appear as relevant advantages of including life-cycle methods in public climate policy. The analysis, which is intended to be of utility to policy-makers in Peru and in other developing and emerging economies across the world, suggests that life-cycle methods arise as adequate tools to monitor the environmental appropriateness of adopting or adapting low-carbon technology to the local context.

The appearance of these periods of difficulty as a subject of representation is presented as a subject of analysis for some creators throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, manifesting themselves in multiple ways that affect both content and form. Many of these episodes indicate the cyclical condition of these events if their appearance is analyzed on the timeline. The forecasts on the result of the thesis, are in exposing the antecedents as well as the three most relevant events regarding the context of general crisis in our society such as the Second World War, the Great Recession of 2008 and climate change. Undoubtedly, these are social processes that have affected various artists when approaching their work, including the one who subscribes, to include this object of study as an important discursive element. Each one has channeled it and subsequently represented it under their particular point of view, choosing the most appropriate support according to their style or way of expressing themselves. Although personal production has been very important in our work, it is not placed as the main theme but something secondary that offers us the opportunity to talk about our work, although without doing it in an explicit way.

Since the first decade of the 20th century, the revolutionary conscience was a singular feature of the Russian intelligentsia, so the concept of Mysterium was, in such social climate, a concept of force that prompted the artist to seek a better world. Just like avant-garde artists - whose actions are an intervention in social systems in his Mysterium Scriabin emphasized the need for a transformation of the world through art. Bearing this in mind, the musicological interpretation of Mysterium here is made with the aim of positioning Scriabin as a modernist subject. The insights into the composer's responses to socio-political reality - both within Scriabin's philosophical and creative narratives - refer to the demands of the revolutionaries for the collective/sobornost. This study shows that those demands were, in the case of Scriabin, shaped as the idea of the utopian function of art.","[Trifunovic, Branislava] Univ Novi Sad, Acad Arts, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Trifunovic, B (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Acad Arts, Novi Sad, Serbia.",branislavatrifunovic90@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,0,"SERBIAN ACAD SCIENCES & ARTS, INST MUSICOLOGY-SASA",BELGRADE,"35, KNEZA MIHAILA ST, BELGRADE, SERBIA",1450-9814,2406-0976,,MUZIKOL-MUSICOL,Muzikol.-Musicol.,,2019,26,,,,161,181,,10.2298/MUZ1926161T,http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/MUZ1926161T,,,21,Music,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Music,VJ7YU,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000627652500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a set of ensemble hindcasts from the NCEP coupled forecast system (CFS) is used to examine the initial growth of the coupled model bias. These CFS hindcasts are 9-month integrations starting from perturbed real-time oceanic and atmospheric analyses for 1981-2003. The large number of integrations from a variety of initial states covering all months provides a good opportunity to examine how the model systematic errors grow. The monthly climatologies of ensemble hindcasts from various initial months are compared with both observed and analyzed oceanic and atmospheric datasets. Our analyses show that two error patterns are dominant in the hindcasts. One is the warming of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the southeastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. This error grows faster in boreal summer and fall and peaks in November-December at round 2 degrees C in the open ocean. It is caused by an excessive model surface shortwave radiative flux in this region, especially from boreal summer to fall. The excessive radiative forcing is in turn caused by the CFS inability to reproduce the observed amount of low cloud cover in the southeastern ocean and its seasonal increase. According to a comparison between the seasonal climatologies from the CFS hindcasts and a long-term simulation of the atmospheric model forced with observed SST, the CFS low cloud and radiation errors are inherent to its atmospheric component. On the other hand, the SST error in CFS is a major cause of the model's southward bias of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in boreal winter and spring. An analysis of the SST errors of the 6-month ensemble hindcasts by seven coupled models in the Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble System for Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction project shows that this SST error pattern is common in coupled climate hindcasts. The second error pattern is an excessive deepening of the model thermocline depth to the north of the equator from the western coast toward the central ocean. This error grows fastest in boreal summer. It is forced by an overly strong local anticyclonic surface wind stress curl and is in turn related to the weakened northeast trade winds in summer and fall. The thermocline error in the northwest delays the annual shoaling of the equatorial thermocline in the Gulf of Guinea remotely through the equatorial waveguide.","Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmospher Studies, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Climate Dynam, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Predict, RSIS, Climate Predict Ctr, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA",George Mason University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Huang, BH (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmospher Studies, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",huangb@cola.iges.org,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400; Huang, Bohua/0000-0003-4869-3849",,,,,39,73,73,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Studies on variability and climate change have interested the world community after several large-scale climate events. Of these, one can identify the 1972-1973 and 1983-1984 droughts felt in Cameroon and which hit most of the countries of tropical Africa. Apart from these droughts, the global warming findings of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), show a temperature increase of about 0.7 degrees C since the beginning of the last century. This paper is based on basic research begun in 2008 focusing on climate change in Cameroon and its related risks. This work attests to these changes at different scales. Indeed, the drought over the last forty years in Sahelian countries has extended to the humid countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea (including Central Africa and Cameroon), with serious consequences (e.g., decreasing of rainfall, lowering of groundwater levels, drop and deficit of stream flows) to the whole region. The Sanaga River basin was chosen, because it has the advantage of belonging to three climatic zones and, thus, it is better able to illustrate the phenomenon, and gives an idea of its impact on availability of water resources for hydroelectric production. The large rainfall deficit has caused a significant decrease in flows and the mortgage of the country's electricity provision. Characterization of rainfall variability using statistical methods and the evaluation of its impacts on groundwater resources are the first major objectives of this study. Indeed, starting from the background of the Cameroonian geological setting, this paper makes the link between its configuration and ongoing challenges of climate change and subsequent modifications of the landscape. Special mention is made to related environmental hazards. The challenge to this landscape dynamic involves changes such as deforestation, increased flooding and erosive potential of rivers, processes that induce a new landscape dynamic with acceleration of geomorphic processes. Therefore, significant environmental risks may appear as a consequence. Deforestation is linked to agricultural activities, mining or logging, and has brought an increase in erosion and degradation of natural conditions. In addition to mass movements, changes in fluvial processes are an inevitable consequence because the increased sediment budget on the deforested watershed reduces or affects the erosive power of rivers by increasing accumulation. Sedimentation recorded at the Edea dam on the Sanaga River, are proof of such a situation. Morever, the occurrence of increased flooding appears to be the main consequence of deforestation and changes in water processes. Mass movements are the most visible face of environmental risk arising from these activities.

The award of compensation to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry has been justified on both economic grounds (protection against the impact of international competition) and environmental grounds (reducing the risk of carbon leakage). However, following recent economic studies on carbon leakage in Australia, this article concludes that a compensatory mechanism is unlikely to be justifiable under the environmental exceptions in Art XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Given this limitation, the article considers the scope available to enact a compensatory mechanism that does not need to rely upon any environmental justification. It concludes that a compensatory mechanism is most effective when built within a border tax adjustment. Importantly, this limitation on compensatory mechanisms has broader implications for the design of a climate change scheme. Should the Australian government wish to include a compensatory mechanism in a climate change regulation, it is best administered through a domestic carbon tax.",,,,,,,,,,,78,0,0,0,1,LAWBOOK CO LTD,PYRMONT,"LEVEL 6, 19 HARRIS ST, PYRMONT, NSW 2009, AUSTRALIA",0813-300X,,,ENVIRON PLAN LAW J,Environ.

Specific ratios are due to the occurrence of clay minerals like illite, kaolinite, smectite, and feldspar, quartz, carbonates like calcite and dolomite, manganese oxyhydroxides, and apatite. Their occurrence corresponds to the local origin and composition of the primary aeolian material. In general, the analyzed desert varnish shows lamination patterns characterized by alternating MnO2-rich and -poor layers (,<= 25wt% MnO2) at rather constant iron oxyhydroxide content (6wt% Fe2O3). Varnish on non-engraved surfaces exhibits three MnO2-rich layers, whereas varnish-coated petroglyphs reveal minor lamination patterns corresponding to the dating of petroglyphs by rock art. The older Naturalistic Bubaline Art School petroglyphs (about 6-4 ka BP) and the younger Tazina Art School petroglyphs (about 3.8-3 ka BP) contain only two and one MnO2-rich layer, respectively. It is assumed that the occurrence of such microlaminations is caused by climate changes in North Africa. Three humid periods are discerned from the Terminal Pleistocene to Holocene in the literature. Such periods are suitable to induce manganese accumulation by biotic and abiotic processes. Accordingly, the distinct lamination patterns gained from this study verify the dating of petroglyphs by rock art. From another point of view, classification of the above petroglyphs may be provided by analyses of microlaminations independently on cultural historical aspects. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

Choice of mode and complementary policies are critical to shaping the costs of climate mitigation in the transport sector. This paper investigates the potentials offered by combined technological and behavioural changes stimulated by strategic infrastructure deployment that can facilitate decarbonization of transport in China. Our study is carried out using IMACLIM-R, a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model, which includes a detailed representation of transport dynamics by incorporating the behavioural determinants of mobility in a standard transport modelling framework. More specifically, this behavioural representation considers (i) the spatial organization of residential dwellings and industrial production, (ii) modal shift induced by transport infrastructure deployment and (iii) the intensity of freight transport production and distribution processes. It is found that supplementing carbon pricing with behavioural measures and a decoupling of economic activity from mobility needs can efficiently promote a modal shift towards low-carbon transport modes and reallocate the sectoral distribution of mitigation efforts. This in turn would significantly reduce the macro-economic impacts of deeply decarbonizing Chinese transport activities over the next decades. Complementary policies should focus on infrastructure, fiscal incentives, land-use, building regulations and other policies affecting the ways urban activities are distributed within the city's boundary, along with industrial policies and other regulations that affect where firms choose to locate. Key policy insights To decarbonize China's transport sector an integrated approach is needed due to strong inertia and distributional effects. Complementary policies have to focus on transport infrastructure, fiscal incentives, land-use and building regulations, as well as spatial organization. Transport-related climate policies interconnect with the ways in which urban activities are distributed within the city's boundary, but also with industrial policies and other regulations that affect where firms choose to locate. A suite of policy instruments is required, including larger institutional incentives and greater financial leverage supporting innovations in the transport sector.","[Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem] Sci Po Paris, Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Paris, France; [Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem; Broin, Eoin O.] ParisTech, ENPC, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev CIRED, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem; Broin, Eoin O.] CNRS, EHESS, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Li, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun] Curtin Univ, Sch Management, Perth, Australia; [Broin, Eoin O.] EnvEcon 11 Priory Off Pk, Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sun Yat Sen University; Curtin University,"Li, J (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",lijun267@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,European Commission; Guandong Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515011624],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Guandong Basic Research Foundation,This work was supported by European Commission: [Grant Number ADVANCE]; Guandong Basic Research Foundation [Grant Number 2019A1515011624].,,41,2,2,3,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

However, this potential has yet to be fully realised. The tracer signature is established in the near-surface zone, with evapotranspiration processes enriching the concentration inherited from input from atmospheric deposition (predominantly rainfall). This pore-moisture tracer signature then moves vertically through the USZ sediments toward the water table, producing a hydrostratigraphy that, with increasing depth, records changes to the moisture balance at the surface through time. The small fluxes of water through the USZ in dryland climates means that this hydrostratigraphy approach is particularly valuable in these environments for providing climate records longer than the instrumental data period. This paper sets out the current state of the art in the use of the USZ as an archive. We explain the nature of the USZ, the basis of the tracer technique and also the field and sampling methodologies employed. Examples of application worldwide by broad geographic region are also evaluated. This shows that the USZ hydrostratigraphy approach can be used across three key timescales: (i) decadal to multi-decadal resolution records covering hundreds of years that provide information about recent climate fluctuations and patterns of land-use change: (ii) multi-decadal through to millennial scale length records which may record wetter and drier events down to decadal scale resolution and (iii) Last Interglacial through to the Holocene records of lower resolution that indicate broad shifts over multi-millennial timescales. We also explore the questions and challenges surrounding the depositional flux of tracer inputs and the extent to which infiltration is non-uniform, before setting the agenda for their future potential use alongside related proxies for palaeohydrology.

However, the interpretation of this proxy is still in debate. While this proxy is originally interpreted as regional rainfall amount of the Asian monsoon, other studies have interpreted it as upstream monsoon rainfall or atmospheric circulation changes. To better understand the signal preserved in speleothems over various time scales, this study employs a state-of-the-art isotope-enabled climate model to quantify contributions to the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation (delta 18OP) over China. Results suggest that orbital-scale speleothem delta O-18 variations at Chinese sites mainly record the meridional migration of the Asian monsoon circulation, accompanied by an early northward movement of the East Asian rain belt. At interannual scales, Chinese speleothem delta O-18 is also tied to the intensity of monsoonal circulation, via a change in moisture source locations: Enhanced moisture delivery from remote source regions leads to more negative delta 18OP, particularly in late summer and early autumn. Our results have implications for the hydroclimatic interpretation of speleothem delta O-18 from Chinese caves and suggest that this interpretation is time scale dependent.","[Hu, Jun; Emile-Geay, Julien] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Tabor, Clay] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geosci, Storrs, CT USA; [Nusbaumer, Jesse] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Partin, Judson] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX USA",University of Southern California; University of Connecticut; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Hu, J; Emile-Geay, J (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",hujun@usc.edu; julieneg@usc.edu,"Hu, Jun/K-8453-2019","Hu, Jun/0000-0002-0458-5996; Partin, Judson/0000-0003-0315-5545; Nusbaumer, Jesse/0000-0002-4370-3537; Tabor, Clay/0000-0002-9915-6157",Dornsife Merit Fellowship from the University of Southern California (USC),Dornsife Merit Fellowship from the University of Southern California (USC),"This work was supported by a Dornsife Merit Fellowship from the University of Southern California (USC).

One hundred species of Lepidoptera, selected from the Distribution Atlas of European Butterflies, and three climate variables were used to determine the bioclimatic envelope for each butterfly species. The data set consisting of 2620 grid squares 30' x 60' in size all over Europe was randomly split into the calibration and the evaluation data sets. The performance of different models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. Observed differences in modelling accuracy among species were then related to the geographical attributes of the species using GAM. The modelling performance was negatively related to the latitudinal range and prevalence, whereas the effect of spatial autocorrelation on prediction accuracy depended on the modelling technique. These three geographical attributes accounted for 19-61% of the variation in the modelling accuracy. Predictive accuracy of GAM, GLM and MDA was highly influenced by the three geographical attributes, whereas RF, ANN and GBM were moderately, and MARS and CTA only slightly affected. The contrasting effects of geographical distribution of species on predictive performance of different modelling techniques represent one source of uncertainty in species spatial distribution models. This should be taken into account in biogeographical modelling studies and assessments of climate change impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Anthropocene Festival mobilizes disruptive and creative possibilities at the juncture of digital and ecological life, while simultaneously embodying developments in the institutional form of green capitalism. To argue these points, we locate the Anthropocene Festival within a proliferation of new institutional environmentalisms, including biennales, hackathons, and initiatives in the neoliberal university. Next, we provide a survey of recent examples, observing across them an increasingly hegemonic template of environmental sociality-or model of collective interaction-rooted in digital technologies. Next, we discuss two examples of environmental governance propositions expressive of the Anthropocene Festival ethos: (1) Climate Symphony, a project that uses sonification techniques to facilitate new understandings of climate change, (2) Terra0, an art project which reconceptualizes forest ecology and non-human agency using blockchain technology. We conclude by arguing that the ontological generativity of the Anthropocene Festival arises from the dissenting approaches to conventional models of environmental governance it cultivates, but that the Anthropocene Festival does not necessarily carry a radical political valence because of this.","[Ritts, Max] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Box 66, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Bakker, Karen] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of British Columbia,"Ritts, M (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Box 66, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",max.ritts@alumni.ubc.ca,,,,,,,110,4,4,8,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

In recent times architects and designers have gained control over the design process by using parametric design to produce an original sustainable design that interacts with the project's environment, climatic and sustainable constraints. Research into parametric urban design shows it to be a good tool for achieving sustainable and healthy communities. It does this through minimum form and high performance spaces, particularly in hot climatic zones where outdoor life is absent, there is an abundance of solar radiation, and local materials and resources are rare or limited. Consequently, the aim of this research paper is to investigate the potential for applying parametric design optimisation processes over conventional urban design processes in order to achieve a more sustainable style of urban design. The methodology adopted for this study is the use of current state-of-the-art computer tools like Grasshopper and ANSYS CFX to achieve optimised parametric design. An urban area in Dubai was selected to act as the case study location for this project. An in-depth analysis was carried out between the base case and the optimised case. Future recommendations were drawn based on the findings and results. The study covered many environmental factors such as solar irradiation, urban ventilation, building form and orientation to achieve the optimum sustainable urban morphology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluate herein the thermal consequences of these processes as simulated by models in the third phase of the paleoclimate modelling intercomparison project and the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (PMIP3/CMIP5). We examine air and ground temperature tracking at decadal and centennial time-scales within PMIP3 last-millennium simulations concatenated to historical simulations from the CMIP5 archive. We find a strong coupling between air and ground temperatures during the summer from 850 to 2005 CE. During the winter, the insulating effect of snow and latent heat exchanges produce a decoupling between the two temperatures in the northern high latitudes. Additionally, we use the simulated ground surface temperatures as an upper boundary condition to drive a one-dimensional conductive model in order to derive synthetic temperature-depth profiles for each PMIP3/CMIP5 simulation. Inversion of these subsurface profiles yields temperature trends that retain the low-frequency variations in surface air temperatures over the last millennium for all the PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations regardless of the presence of seasonal decoupling in the simulations. These results demonstrate the robustness of surface temperature reconstructions from terrestrial borehole data and their interpretation as indicators of past surface air temperature trends and continental energy storage.","[Garcia-Garcia, A.; Cuesta-Valero, F.

Many of the rock shelters are decorated with rock art of high heritage significance. This art belongs to semisedentary communities from the Late Prehispanic Period (ca. 1550-350 AP). They include morphologies inherited from more humid ancient climates combined with current weathering processes. Evolutionary relief study established that tafoni formation is a product of inherited past wetter climates. Mineralogical and petrographic analyses were performed on samples collected from the sandstones and from various morphologies, weathering residues, and wall and ceiling concretions at four rock shelters, Cueva del Indio, Ricci, Quitilipi, and La Trampa. Gypsum and other salts that are not part of the unaltered rock but the result of weathering reveal the magnitude of hydroclastic and haloclastic processes. These activities form active granular disintegration, flaking, and spalling, and impinge on some painted panels. Mapping the distribution of weathering features and processes at each rock shelter enables the planning of interventions to mitigate and alleviate the effects caused by infiltration of water through rock discontinuities, fractures, and overhangs. It also allows decreasing the accumulation of dust and minimizing muddy water flowing over the paintings. These actions are aimed at retarding the progression of rock art degradation and the visible loss of some paintings.","[Luis Pena-Monne, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geog & Ordenac Terr, Pedro Cerbuna 12, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Sampietro-Vattuone, Maria M.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Ariel Baez, Walter] Fac Ciencias Nat UNSa CONICET, Inst Bio & Geociencias, NOA, Rosario De Lerma, Argentina; [Garcia-Gimenez, Rosario] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Geol & Geoquim, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain; [Matias Stabile, Franco] Ctr Tecnol Recursos Minerales & Ceram CETMIC CCT, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Martinez Stagnaro, Susana Y.] CONICET UNCo, Inst Invest & Desarroilo Ingn Proc Biotecnol & En, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Tissera, Luis E.] Museo Arqueol Cerro Colorado, Direcc Patrimonio Prov Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina",University of Zaragoza; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Pena-Monne, JL (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geog & Ordenac Terr, Pedro Cerbuna 12, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.",jlpena@unizar.es,"Garcia, Rosario/B-2113-2008",,"Aragon Government; European Regional Development; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman [PIUNT G629]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 2018-1119, PICT2019-0931]; Agencia Cordoba (Gobierno de Cordoba); IUCA",Aragon Government(Gobierno de Aragon); European Regional Development(European Commission); Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica(ANPCyT); Agencia Cordoba (Gobierno de Cordoba); IUCA,"Aragon Government and European Regional Development and IUCA; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman, Grant/Award Number: PIUNT G629; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Numbers: PICT 2018-1119, PICT2019-0931; Agencia Cordoba (Gobierno de Cordoba)",,83,2,2,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-6353,1520-6548,,GEOARCHAEOLOGY,Geoarchaeology,MAR,2022,2,,,,332,349,,10.1002/gea.21890,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gea.21890,,21-Nov,18,"Archaeology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology; Geology,YX7WA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000713310600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It introduces natural elements to create a pleasant space for human activities. However, this study measured a typical sunken courtyard and found potential problems of excessive solar radiation and accumulated air pollutants in summer when at an acceptable outdoor temperature for human activities. To improve the comfort and health of a sunken courtyard, this research proposes some green retrofit designs. Firstly, compared with green wall, water and a tree, sunshade is a primary measure to improve thermal comfort. Combining sunshade, a green wall and water reduces the temperature by up to 5.6 degrees C in the activity zone during the hottest hour. Secondly, blocking/guiding wind walls can effectively improve the wind environment in a sunken courtyard, but only when the wind direction is close to the prevailing wind. A blocking wind wall was better at affecting velocity and uniformity, while the guiding wind wall was more efficient at discharging air pollutants. This study initially discusses the climate-adaptive design of underground spaces in terms of green, thermal comfort and natural ventilation. Designers should generally integrate above/underground and indoor/outdoor spaces using natural and artificial resources to improve comfort and health in underground spaces.","[Han, Gang; Wen, Yueming; Leng, Jiawei; Sun, Lijun] Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Han, Gang; Wen, Yueming; Leng, Jiawei; Sun, Lijun] Southeast Univ, Future Underground Space Inst, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China,"Leng, JW (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.;Leng, JW (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Future Underground Space Inst, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",han_gang007@163.com; wenyueming66@163.com; jw_leng@seu.edu.cn; s-lijun@163.com,,"Wen, Yueming/0000-0003-4603-9405",National Natural Science Foundation of China [52178009]; Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX20_0112]; open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency [BEE201902],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 52178009, the Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, grant number KYCX20_0112, and the open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency, grant number BEE201902.",,63,4,4,15,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,SEP,2021,9,,,,,,413,10.3390/buildings11090413,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings11090413,,,19,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,UV3SS,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000699403300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Imagination has allowed us to think of some ends of the world, but it has been a privileged space. Creating alternative futures for our relationship with energy is vital. Corporate renewable energy projects are emerging in corners of the planet where green capitalism has not yet reached. In this way, the creation of alternatives to centralized and corporate models of energy production, distribution, and consumption must go through new potentialities to Inhabitat new possible futures. Science fiction is a literary genre that has inspired generations of people assembling art, techno-science, utopia, and dystopia embedded in a political design. Solarpunk has consolidated itself as an area of counter-cultural hope to enable us to overcome socio-ecological injustices and increasing epistemic and ontological violence. This genre is derived from other currents such as Cyberpunk, Steampunk, and Dieselpunk, elucidating another relationship between technology, society, and nature, nourished in turn by climate sci-fi, Indigenous, and Afro-futurist science fiction. In this sense, a concept revision is made in three spheres: i) historical, based on its digital origins; ii) literary, based on the edited anthologies and iii) academic, of the reflections that it has raised. In the final section, concluding remarks are presented and the Solarpunk Manifesto, unveiled in early 2020, is shared to continue its co-creation.","[Reina-Rozo, Juan David] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Reina-Rozo, JD (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.",jdreinar@unal.edu.co,,,"IDARTES Bogota (Colombia -South America) -Arte, Tecnologia y Ancestralidad research Grant [2020]","IDARTES Bogota (Colombia -South America) -Arte, Tecnologia y Ancestralidad research Grant [2020]","This work was supported by IDARTES Bogota (Colombia -South America) -Arte, Tecnologia y Ancestralidad research Grant [2020].",,51,0,0,2,3,INT JOURNAL ENGINEERING SOCIAL JUSTICE & PEACE,KINGSTON,"INT JOURNAL ENGINEERING SOCIAL JUSTICE & PEACE, KINGSTON, ON 00000, CANADA",1927-9434,,,INT J ENG SOC JUSTIC,Int.

Delayed and inconsistent field emergence poses a significant threat in the production of agri-crop, especially during drought and adverse weather conditions. To open new routes of nutrients' acquisition and revolutionizing the adapted solutions, stewardship plans will be needed to address these questions. One approach is the identification of plant based bioactive molecules capable of altering plant metabolism pathways which may enhance plant performance in a brief period of time and in a cost-effective manner. A biostimulant is a plant material, microorganism, or any other organic compound that not only improves the nutritional aspects, vitality, general health but also enhances the seed quality performance. They may be effectively utilized in both horticultural and cereal crops. The biologically active substances in biostimulant biopreparations are protein hydrolysates (PHs), seaweed extracts, fulvic acids, humic acids, nitrogenous compounds, beneficial bacterial, and fungal agents. In this review, the state of the art and future prospects for biostimulant seedlings are reported and discussed. Biostimulants have been gaining interest as they stimulate crop physiology and biochemistry such as the ratio of leaf photosynthetic pigments (carotenoids and chlorophyll), enhanced antioxidant potential, tremendous root growth, improved nutrient use efficiency (NUE), and reduced fertilizers consumption. Thus, all these properties make the biostimulants fit for internal market operations. Furthermore, a special consideration has been given to the application of biostimulants in intensive agricultural systems that minimize the fertilizers' usage without affecting quality and yield along with the limits imposed by European Union (EU) regulations.","[Malik, Anurag; Mor, Virender S.; Singh, Pradeep; Singh, Nirmal; Nidhi; Singh, Gagandeep] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Seed Sci & Technol, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Tokas, Jayanti; Punia, Himani] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Basic Sci & Humanities, Dept Biochem, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Malik, Shweta; Karwasra, Aman] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agron, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Malik, Kamla] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Basic Sci & Humanities, Dept Microbiol, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Sangwan, Sonali] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Basic Sci & Humanities, Dept Mol Biol Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Tomar, Saurabh] Chandra Shekhar Azad Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Vegetable Sci, Kanpur 208001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Himangini] Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar Univ Hort & Forestry, Dept Seed Sci & Technol, Solan 173230, Himachal Prades, India; [Vikram; Vikram] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Vegetable Sci, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Kumar, Vinit; Sandhya] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Hort, Coll Agr, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India",CCS Haryana Agricultural University; CCS Haryana Agricultural University; CCS Haryana Agricultural University; CCS Haryana Agricultural University; CCS Haryana Agricultural University; Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture & Forestry; CCS Haryana Agricultural University; CCS Haryana Agricultural University,"Punia, H (corresponding author), CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Coll Basic Sci & Humanities, Dept Biochem, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India.",anuragmalikseed@hau.ac.in; virendermor@gmail.com; jiyaccshau@gmail.com; himanipunia91@gmail.com; malik.shweta54@gmail.com; kamlamalik06@gmail.com; sonalisangwan03@gmail.com; Chaudhary.csa@gmail.com; pradeepkhilery29@gmail.com; nirmalsingh@hau.ac.in; Himangini.kanwar@gmail.com; vghiyal06@gmail.com; nidhibabbar11@gmail.com; Gagantogar5@hau.ac.in; vikramdhiman2015@gmail.com; vikky4660@hau.ac.in; s.goswami97hr@gmail.com; mr.aman.karwasra@gmail.com,"Punia, Dr. Himani/ABF-6565-2021; SANGWAN, SONALI/GON-5428-2022; Malik, Anurag/AED-6066-2022","Punia, Dr. Himani/0000-0002-3754-2888; SANGWAN, SONALI/0000-0003-0494-2137; Singh, Nirmal/0000-0002-8023-1305; MALIK, ANURAG/0000-0002-5037-425X; Tokas, Jayanti/0000-0003-3013-3157; SINGH, PRADEEP/0000-0003-2864-3262",,,,,172,35,35,22,109,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JAN,2021,1,,,,,,14,10.3390/agronomy11010014,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11010014,,,24,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,PU9ZL,,gold,Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000609656200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

But, unlike the latter, they are generally presented in terms of units of mass or weight (kilograms per functional unit), rather than in spatial units (such as global hectares). These carbon footprints have become the 'currency' of debate in a climate-constrained world. They are increasingly popular ecological indicators, adopted by individuals, businesses, governments, and the media alike. The influence of economic wealth, population density, and pollutant emission intensity upon national carbon footprints has been correlated using a 'power-law' equation. This analysis provides a greater understanding of the carbon footprint concept and its national determinants in a bipolar world: one embracing the countries of the prosperous or industrialised North of the planet and the other covering the developing, 'Majority' South, where some 80% of the global population resides. Such a bipolar world is depicted by highlighting the countries that make up some of the largest economies in the form of the G-20 nations. This international grouping encompasses nation states from both the North and South. Emerging countries from the South with large populations (such as China and India) now have economies whose overall size rivals those of the North. Here the factors that are principally responsible for driving national carbon footprints are illustrated in the context of their potential consequences for global warming. An insight into these parameters is important in a period when the international community is seeking to agree a successor regime to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change mitigation.

Nevertheless, research has found that SRL implementation in primary schools remains limited. This qualitative study investigates the role of school climate, the SRL implementation history, and the role of the principal school leader in the school-wide development of SRL implementation as an educational innovation. A comparative analysis between 2 successful and 2 less successful schools as to the implementation of SRL was carried out. Interviews were administered with 15 school members. The results reveal that successful SRL schools distinguish themselves by a shared vision, sufficient and focused opportunities for professional development, and regular collaboration and communication among colleagues resulting in a collective feeling of responsibility for SRL implementation. Moreover, this is influenced by the school?s SRL development history and the supportive role of the school leader. The results underline the need for more school-wide interventions regarding SRL implementation.","[De Smul, Mona; Heirweg, Sofie; Devos, Geert; Van Keer, Hilde] Univ Ghent, Dept Educ Studies, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"De Smul, M (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Educ Studies, Ghent, Belgium.",Mona.DeSmul@UGent.be,,"Van Keer, Hilde/0000-0002-9819-4864; De Smul, Mona/0000-0002-0880-3620",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [G.0198.15N],Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),This work was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) under Grant [G.0198.15N].,,51,4,4,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0924-3453,1744-5124,,SCH EFF SCH IMPROV,Sch.

The Indus Village is a modular agent-based model designed as a heuristic sandbox to investigate how IC farmers could cope with diverse and changing environments and how climate change could impact the local and regional food production levels required for maintaining urban centers. The complete model includes dedicated submodels about weather, topography, soil properties, crop dynamics, food storage and exchange, nutrition, demography, and farming decision-making. In this paper, however, we focus on presenting the parts required for generating crop dynamics, including the submodels involved (weather, soil water, land, and crop models) and how they are combined progressively to form two integrated models (land water and land crop models). Furthermore, we describe and discuss the results of six simulation experiments, which highlight the roles of seasonality, topography, and crop diversity in understanding the potential impact of environmental variability, including climate change, in IC food economies. We conclude by discussing a broader consideration of risk and risk mitigation strategies in ancient agriculture and potential implications to the sustainability of the IC urban centres.","[Angourakis, Andreas] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Archaol Wissensch, Bergbaumuseum 31, D-44791 Bochum, Germany; [Angourakis, Andreas; Ustunkaya, M.

El Oro province is a key dengue surveillance site, due to the high burden of dengue, seasonal transmission, co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes, and the recent introduction of chikungunya and Zika. In this study, we used climate forecasts to predict the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in the city of Machala, following one of the strongest El Nino events on record. Methods We incorporated precipitation, minimum temperature, and Nino3.4 index forecasts in a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model to predict dengue incidence. The model was initiated on Jan 1, 2016, producing monthly dengue forecasts until November, 2016. We accounted for misreporting of dengue due to the introduction of chikungunya in 2015, by using active surveillance data to correct reported dengue case data from passive surveillance records. We then evaluated the forecast retrospectively with available epidemiological information. Findings The predictions correctly forecast an early peak in dengue incidence in March, 2016, with a 90% chance of exceeding the mean dengue incidence for the previous 5 years. Accounting for the proportion of chikungunya cases that had been incorrectly recorded as dengue in 2015 improved the prediction of the magnitude of dengue incidence in 2016. Interpretation This dengue prediction framework, which uses seasonal climate and El Nino forecasts, allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. Combining active surveillance data with routine dengue reports improved not only model fit and performance, but also the accuracy of benchmark estimates based on historical seasonal averages. This study advances the state-of-the-art of climate services for the health sector, by showing the potential value of incorporating climate information in the public health decision-making process in Ecuador.

However, the ecology of semi-arid to arid shallow Mediterranean lakes is less explored. Hydrological effects (e.g. water level fluctuations, water residence time) on major ions and nutrient dynamics and processes, and ecology of submerged macrophytes appear to have a crucial role for food webs in shallow Mediterranean lakes. Nutrient control may be of greater priority in eutrophicated warm shallow lakes than in similar lakes at higher latitudes. This will be relevant for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, and conservation and management of these ecosystems. Strong trophic cascading effects of fish resulting from dominance of omnivorous and benthivorous fish species, whose diversity is usually high, together with frequent spawning and absence of efficient piscivores, seem to be the reason for the lack of large-bodied grazers that could control phytoplankton. However, such effects may vary within the region depending on fish distribution and community. These factors need elaboration in order to allow shallow lake ecologists and managers to develop better restoration strategies for eutrophicated shallow Mediterranean lakes. Consequently, modifications for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive for determining ecological status in shallow Mediterranean lakes appear to be necessary. Furthermore, the implications of climate warming may be even more challenging than in high latitude lakes since shallow lakes in the Mediterranean region are among the most sensitive to extreme climate changes. There is an urgent need for data on the ecology of shallow lakes in the region. An appeal is made for international cooperation, development of large-scale research and information exchange to facilitate this and a web-based discussion list has been implemented.","Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; Fac Biol, Area Ecol, Valencia 46100, Spain; Univ Ioannina, Dept Biol Applicat & Technol, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain; Univ Leon, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Middle East Technical University; University of Ioannina; Universitat de Girona; Universidad de Leon,"Beklioglu, M (corresponding author), Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",meryem@metu.edu.tr,"beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Quintana, Xavier/L-5083-2014; Becares, Eloy/H-6361-2015","Quintana, Xavier/0000-0002-4070-1915; Becares, Eloy/0000-0002-7123-3579",,,,,83,161,169,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JUN,2007,,,,,317,326,,10.1007/s10750-007-0577-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0577-x,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Marine & Freshwater Biology,169HO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000246583500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Aside from these well-known civilian and commercial applications, GNSS is now an established atmospheric observing system, which can accurately sense water vapour, the most abundant greenhouse gas, accounting for 60-70% of atmospheric warming. In Europe, the application of GNSS in meteorology started roughly two decades ago, and today it is a well-established field in both research and operation. This review covers the state of the art in GNSS meteorology in Europe. The advances in GNSS processing for derivation of tropospheric products, application of GNSS tropospheric products in operational weather prediction and application of GNSS tropospheric products for climate monitoring are discussed. The GNSS processing techniques and tropospheric products are reviewed. A summary of the use of the products for validation and impact studies with operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models as well as very short weather prediction (nowcasting) case studies is given. Climate research with GNSSs is an emerging field of research, but the studies so far have been limited to comparison with climate models and derivation of trends. More than 15 years of GNSS meteorology in Europe has already achieved outstanding cooperation between the atmospheric and geodetic communities. It is now feasible to develop next-generation GNSS tropospheric products and applications that can enhance the quality of weather forecasts and climate monitoring. This work is carried out within COST Action ES1206 advanced global navigation satellite systems tropospheric products for monitoring severe weather events and climate (GNSS4SWEC, http://gnss4swec.knmi.nl).","[Guerova, Guergana] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Sofia 1164, Bulgaria; [Jones, Jonathan] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Dousa, Jan] RIGTC, Geodet Observ Pecny, New Technol Informat Soc, Zdiby 25066, Czech Republic; [Dick, Galina] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [de Haan, Siebren] Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3732 GK De Bilt, Netherlands; [Pottiaux, Eric] Royal Observ Belgium, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Bock, Olivier] Inst Natl Informat Geog & Forestiere, F-94160 St Mande, France; [Pacione, Rosa] E Geos Spa ASI CGS, I-75100 Matera, Italy; [Elgered, Gunnar] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Earth & Space Sci, S-43992 Onsala, Sweden; [Vedel, Henrik] Danish Meteorol Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bender, Michael] Deutsch Wetterdienst, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany","University of Sofia; Met Office - UK; Research Institute of Geodesy, Topography & Cartography; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Chalmers University of Technology; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI","Guerova, G (corresponding author), Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Sofia 1164, Bulgaria.",guerova@phys.uni-sofia.bg,"Dousa, Jan/V-5551-2017; Guerova, Guergana/D-1943-2013; Elgered, Gunnar/P-4215-2019; Dick, Galina/B-1022-2013; Bock, Olivier/B-7629-2018; Dousa, Jan/ABF-5859-2020; Elgered, Gunnar/B-7052-2016; Pottiaux, Eric/H-9466-2019","Dousa, Jan/0000-0002-6668-6207; Guerova, Guergana/0000-0001-5638-3387; Elgered, Gunnar/0000-0001-5711-0073; Bock, Olivier/0000-0001-5980-938X; Dousa, Jan/0000-0002-6668-6207; Elgered, Gunnar/0000-0001-5711-0073; Pottiaux, Eric/0000-0002-7347-7702",COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology; European Community; Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence (STCE) - Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BelSPO); NERC [BIGF010001] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [BIGF010001] Funding Source: researchfish,COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); European Community(European Commission); Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence (STCE) - Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BelSPO); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology for providing financial assistance for publication of the paper.

C,"Chomaz, JM",,,ACM,"Chomaz, Jean-Marc",,,Inventing Narratives of the Anthropocene: Microclimate Machines and Arts & Sciences Installations,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMEDIA (MM'19),,,English,Proceedings Paper,27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM),"OCT 21-25, 2019","Nice, FRANCE","Assoc Comp Machinery,ACM SIGMM",,,,"Since the creation of the Laboratoire d'Hydrodynamique (LadHyX) of the CNRS and the Ecole Polytechnique, I have been involved as a researcher and artist in arts & sciences projects in all disciplines (circus, theatre, design, contemporary art, music, etc.). My approach tries to give direct access to an imaginary using scientific language and concepts not to demonstrate, but to make sense. The works I have created alone or jointly with other artists such as Ana Rewakowicz and Camille Duprat, Anais Tondeur, Aniara Rodado, the duets Evelina Domnitch Dmitry Gelfand, HeHe, or within the Labofactory collective founded with Laurent Karst and Francois-Eudes Chanfrault, are not intended to show or demonstrate scientific phenomena, to provide formal evidence or to reveal established facts. Rather, they suggest a different point of view, a destabilizing transgression, an uncomfortable comparison, a bodily experience, a metaphor for physics that would use the scientific imagination to reinvent our perception of the world and question the truth in its relativity and in all its fragility. These shared adventures have led me to realize that my intention is closely linked to deeper meaning and commitment. The human species, which, on a geological scale, should have remained an ephemeral and marginal event, is confronted with a deadly threat directly linked to its own action and its casual use, without verbalization and questioning, of science and technology. The fascination that science exerts on everyone's mind, starting with scientists themselves, remains extremely powerful, as evidenced by media coverage of the likely observation of the Higgs Boson or the black hole in the centre of the giant Messier 87 galaxy. Science therefore does not need to be re-invested but to be reinvested by humans, in order to allow new stories to emerge in thought and speech and to constitute a modern song of gesture, entirely devoted to sustainable actions on a global scale and to the emergence of ethical paths of thought, generally accepted. Scientists are beginning to understand that science and the scientific approach itself may be powerless to solve or even grasp the reality and meaning of, for example, climate change or the new frontiers that today's questions of life and consciousness represent. Much of my scientific research and work combining art and science focuses on the question of climate change, and more specifically on how to predict, analyse and understand the scope, in the current state of knowledge, of the notion of the anthropocene; the controversial use of this term, which alone serves as a manifesto, calls into question the impact and ethics of mankind and requires a commitment both individually and collectively to define and build a new pact, an updated and shared new deal. Such global problems and challenges are beyond the realm of science alone, which is designed to divide a complex and sensitive problem into several small isolated systems, until it reaches a stage where the issue can be the subject of a laboratory experiment, computer study or modeling in a scientist's brain. Science was never designed to rebuild the fragile and complex system as a whole. We need a different protocol, another approach and a new analytical framework to address the challenges posed by the multiple, complex and transdisciplinary phenomena embedded in the concept of the anthropocene. Art and science encompass all the performances and narratives necessary for this confrontation, question our beliefs and observations, but also the nature, legitimacy and ethics of our scientific practice without the usual restrictions imposed on critical thinking by an almost sacred and therefore impossible to question protocol of proof. Once this judicious common vision has been constructed through art, scientific narratives and narratives resulting from the association of science with art, it should permeate all the actions of all individuals and communities and, secondarily, undoubtedly contribute to defining and attributing to science a more reasonable path to follow, or at the very least to bringing back to it the possibility of critical thinking. The possibility for arts & sciences research and creation to contribute to such a critical thinking and to construct alternative form of narratives of the anthropocene, will be illustrated on several examples of microclimate machines and installations.","[Chomaz, Jean-Marc] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Lab Hydrodynam, Palaiseau, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Chomaz, JM (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Lab Hydrodynam, Palaiseau, France.",chomaz@ladhyx.polytechnique.fr,"chomaz, Jean-Marc/AAY-6539-2020","chomaz, Jean-Marc/0000-0002-0477-0761",,,,,0,0,0,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-6889-6,,,,2019,,,,,1665,1666,,10.1145/3343031.3355513,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3355513,,,2,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BO2ZT,,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000509743400207,View Full Record in Web of Science

We applied the process-based model 4C and a wood product model to a forest district in Germany and evaluated both models for the period from 2002 to 2010, based on forest inventory data for the stands in the district. Then, we simulated the growth of the stands in the forest district under three different realizations of a climate change scenario, combined with different management regimes. Our simulations show that in 2099, between 630 and 1149 t C ha(-1) will be stored in this district. The simulations also showed that climate change affects carbon sequestration. The no management strategy sequestered the highest amount of carbon (8.7 t C ha(-1) year(-1)), which was greater than the management regimes. In the model, the possible fertilization effect of CO2 is an important factor. However, forest management remains the determining factor in this forest district.","[Borys, A.; Suckow, F.; Reyer, C.; Gutsch, M.; Lasch-Born, P.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Borys, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",Alexander.Borys@gmx.de,"Reyer, Christopher/A-5515-2013; Borys, Alexander/ABD-9754-2021","Reyer, Christopher/0000-0003-1067-1492; Lasch-Born, Petra/0000-0001-6468-4411",,,,,59,13,15,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In this study we calculated and compared the abatement costs of achieving multiple environmental targets with and without stacking under different policy regimes (emissions trading, charge, standards). To this end, a static mixed integer programming model was constructed. Theoretical analysis showed that, irrespective of policy regime, the cost of achieving predetermined emission targets is always lower when stacking is allowed. Another result was the excess abatement of pollutant under a no stacking system. Application to the Baltic Sea region showed that cost savings from stacking of pollutant abatement vary between policy regimes, being smallest for price regulation and highest for emission standards. However, the gains from stacking were unevenly distributed among the nine countries surrounding the Baltic Sea under all policy regimes, with Poland making the largest gain and Estonia, Russia and Latvia facing losses. Excess abatement without stacking in relation to the target was highest for nitrogen under all policy regimes, comprising up to 52% of the target abatement.","[Gren, Ing-Marie; Ang, Frederic] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ang, Frederic] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Wageningen University & Research,"Gren, IM (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",ing-marie.gren@slu.se; frederic.ang@wur.nl,,"Ang, Frederic/0000-0002-2323-7081",BONUS BaltCoast; Optimus projects by BONUS [Art 185]; European Union; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management,BONUS BaltCoast; Optimus projects by BONUS; European Union(European Commission); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management,"We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and for financial support from the BONUS BaltCoast and Optimus projects funded by BONUS (Art 185), which is funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration, and grants from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management.",,36,3,3,0,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Here we review the key components of this cycle, identifying critical uncertainties and priorities for future research.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Paris 07, Lab Interuniv Syst Atmospher, Paris, France; Univ Paris 12, CNRS, UMR 7583, Paris, France; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Ctr Chem & Phys Oceanog, Dept Chem, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Otago, Dept Chem, Dunedin, New Zealand; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Geol Survey Japan, Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, TR-33731 Erdemli Mersin, Turkey; Leibniz Inst Meereswissensch, IFM GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Concepcion, Dept Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile",University of East Anglia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; University of Otago; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Middle East Technical University; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Miami; University of British Columbia; Max Planck Society; Universidad de Concepcion,"Jickells, TD (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Duce, Robert A/A-9917-2010; Andersen, Katrine/B-4082-2016; Boyd, Philip W/J-7624-2014; LISS, Peter S./A-8219-2013; AN, Zhisheng/F-8834-2012; Baker, Alex R/D-1233-2011; LaRoche, Julie/A-1109-2010; Prospero, Joseph/AAT-6996-2020; Tegen, Ina/W-4299-2018; Ridgwell, Andy/AAD-9487-2021; Mahowald, Natalie M/D-8388-2013; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/F-9065-2016; Junji, Cao/D-3259-2014","Andersen, Katrine/0000-0003-4178-2195; Boyd, Philip W/0000-0001-7850-1911; Baker, Alex R/0000-0002-8365-8953; Tegen, Ina/0000-0003-3700-3232; Ridgwell, Andy/0000-0003-2333-0128; Mahowald, Natalie M/0000-0002-2873-997X; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/0000-0003-4236-7356; Junji, Cao/0000-0003-1000-7241; Torres, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0416-4291; Brooks, Nick/0000-0002-5073-9386; Bergametti, Gilles/0000-0002-0839-1048; an, zhi sheng/0000-0002-9538-9826; Prospero, Joseph/0000-0003-3608-6160; LaRoche, Julie/0000-0003-4809-6411",,,,,59,1932,2026,34,909,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,1-Apr,2005,5718,,,,67,71,,10.1126/science.1105959,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1105959,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,914IQ,15802595,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000228221500033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite diverse efforts to develop forecasting tools including autoregressive time series, climate-driven statistical, and mechanistic biological models, little work has been done to understand the contribution of different components to improved prediction. We developed a framework to assess and compare dengue forecasts produced from different types of models and evaluated the performance of seasonal autoregressive models with and without climate variables for forecasting dengue incidence in Mexico. Climate data did not significantly improve the predictive power of seasonal autoregressive models. Short-term and seasonal autocorrelation were key to improving short-term and long-term forecasts, respectively. Seasonal autoregressive models captured a substantial amount of dengue variability, but better models are needed to improve dengue forecasting. This framework contributes to the sparse literature of infectious disease prediction model evaluation, using state-of-the-art validation techniques such as out-of-sample testing and comparison to an appropriate reference model.","[Johansson, Michael A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Vector Borne Dis, Dengue Branch, San Juan, PR 00920 USA; [Johansson, Michael A.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Communicable Dis Dynam, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Reich, Nicholas G.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Hota, Aditi; Brownstein, John S.; Santillana, Mauricio] Boston Childrens Hosp, Computat Hlth Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brownstein, John S.; Santillana, Mauricio] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Santillana, Mauricio] Harvard Univ, JA Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Damage assessment typically relies on damage functions that translate the magnitude of extreme events to a quantifiable damage. In practice, the availability of damage functions is limited due to a lack of data sources and a lack of understanding of damage processes. The study of the characteristics of damage functions for different hazards could strengthen the theoretical foundation of damage functions and support their development and validation. Accordingly, we investigate analogies of damage functions for coastal flooding and for wind storms and identify a unified approach. This approach has general applicability for granular portfolios and may also be applied, for example, to heat-related mortality. Moreover, the unification enables the transfer of methodology between hazards and a consistent treatment of uncertainty. This is demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis on the basis of two simple case studies (for coastal flood and storm damage). The analysis reveals the relevance of the various uncertainty sources at varying hazard magnitude and on both the microscale and the macroscale level. Main findings are the dominance of uncertainty from the hazard magnitude and the persistent behaviour of intrinsic uncertainties on both scale levels. Our results shed light on the general role of uncertainties and provide useful insight for the application of the unified approach.","[Prahl, Boris F.; Rybski, Diego; Boettle, Markus; Kropp, Juergen P.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Kropp, Juergen P.] Univ Potsdam, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam,"Prahl, BF (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.",corr@prahl.net,"Prahl, Boris/N-9090-2015; Kropp, Juergen/D-8220-2012","Prahl, Boris/0000-0002-3022-7471; Kropp, Juergen/0000-0001-7791-3420; Rybski, Diego/0000-0001-6125-7705",European Community [308 497]; European Union EU-DEM layers,European Community(European Commission); European Union EU-DEM layers,We appreciate valuable discussions with U.

Computational image analysis of the backscattered electron images quantified the degree of the intact lead white pigment versus the nonpigmented and lead-rich areas (degraded lead white) in the paint layers. This new methodology was applied to a series of paint samples taken from four painted wall hangings (dated 1778), which makes it possible to study the influence of indoor climate on chemical degradation of aged oil paintings. The visual interpretation and computational image analysis of the backscattered electron images revealed clear trends. The highest degree of lead white degradation in the room was found in samples from the north wall close to the windows, whereas degradation diminished further away from the window. Lead white from the south wall was less degraded, but showed a similar trend as in the paintings on the north wall. These results imply a strong relationship between chemical degradation of paint and location of the paint in the room.","[Keune, Katrien; Hommes, Margriet H. van Eikema] Delft Univ Technol, Lab Mat Sci Mat Art & Archaeol, Mekelweg 2, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands; [Keune, Katrien] Univ Amsterdam, Vant Hoff Inst Mol Sci, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Keune, Katrien] Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, Conservat & Restorat, POB 74888, NL-1070 DN Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kramer, Rick P.; Huijbregts, Zara; Schellen, Henk L.] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, Den Dolech 2, NL-5612 AZ Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Stappers, Marc H.

An analysis of basic climatic parameters for each zone demonstrates the success of the scheme in identifying distinct climatic regions. Objective criteria were used to identify one representative 26-yeardaily meteorological series from a European dataset for each zone.

We forecast potential effects of climate change on the extent of the suitable habitat of the common frog, Rana temporaria, at the margin of its northern range. We investigated 179 potential breeding sites in subarctic Finland and subjected the data to detailed bioclimate envelope modelling using three state-of-the-art techniques: generalized additive models, maximum entropy and generalized boosting methods. Moreover, we included local environmental factors in the models to investigate whether they improve model performance. Under all tested climate change projections and irrespective of the modelling method, the suitable habitat for R. temporaria increased in warming climate. The inclusion of local abiotic variables significantly improved the performance of the models. However, June temperature appeared to be the most informative variable in all modelling approaches: a major increase in the extent of suitable habitat occurred when it increased by 1 degrees C. Overall, the modelling results indicate that the distribution of northern R. temporaria is likely to be very sensitive to climate warming. The results also highlight the fact that overlooking local abiotic variation can significantly bias bioclimatic modelling results.","[Blank, Lior; Merila, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Ecol Genet Res Unit, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Luoto, Miska] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Blank, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Ecol Genet Res Unit, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",liorblank@gmail.com,"Blank, Lior/M-3885-2017; Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Blank, Lior/E-5945-2013","Blank, Lior/0000-0002-8753-0113; Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Blank, Lior/0000-0002-8753-0113; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143",European Commission; Academy of Finland,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"We thank Kilpisjarvi Biological Station (University of Helsinki) for logistic support, Fredrik Soderman for help with the field-work, and Jacquelin De Faveri for comments that improved this manuscript.

In this study we quantify how long Arctic sea ice predictability is dominated by dependence on its initial conditions versus dependence on its secular decline in a state-of-the-art global circulation model (GCM) under a 'perfect model' assumption. We demonstrate initial-value predictability of pan-Arctic sea ice area is continuous for 1-2 years, after which predictability is intermittent in the 2-4 year range. Predictability of area at these longer lead times is associated with strong area-thickness coupling in the summer season. Initial-value predictability of pan-Arctic sea ice volume is significant continuously for 3-4 years, after which time predictability from secular trends dominates. Thus we conclude predictability of Arctic sea ice beyond 3 years is dominated by climate forcing rather than initial conditions. Additionally, we find that forecast of summer conditions are equally good from the previous September or January initial conditions. Citation: Blanchard-Wrigglesworth, E., C. M. Bitz, and M. M.

Production of hydrogen from natural gas pyrolysis has thus gained interest in research and energy technology in the near past. If the carbon by-product of this process can be used for material production or can be sequestrated, the produced hydrogen has a low carbon footprint.

By analyzing the results from the state-of-the-art global integrated assessment model, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, this paper aims to understand the future levels of financial investment needed for building and maintaining energy-related infrastructure in the two regions for fulfilling stringent targets consistent with well below 2 degrees C'. The results indicate that a rapid upscaling and structural change of these investments towards decarbonization are necessitated by the climate stringent scenarios. China and Europe need to increase their low carbon investments by 65% and 38% in a scenario reaching the 2 degrees target relative to their respective reference scenarios which assume no such target from 2016-2050. In a more stringent climate policy scenario of the 1.5 degrees target, these investment needs will increase by 149% and 79% for China and Europe respectively. Among all the energy sectors, energy efficiency, renewable electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution are the three largest investing targets for the two regions. However, those investments will not likely be realized without strong policy incentives. Implications for green finance and multilateral cooperation initiatives are discussed in the context of the scenario results.","[Zhou, Wenji; McCollum, David L.; Fricko, Oliver; Gidden, Matthew; Huppmann, Daniel; Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan] IIASA, Energy Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [McCollum, David L.] Univ Tennessee, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Krey, Volker] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol & Energy Transit Programmes, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Riahi, Keywan] Colorado Sch Mines, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Graz University of Technology; Colorado School of Mines,"Zhou, WJ; McCollum, DL (corresponding author), IIASA, Energy Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.;McCollum, DL (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",zhouw@iiasa.ac.at; mccollum@iiasa.ac.at,"Fricko, Oliver/ABE-5732-2020; Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011","Fricko, Oliver/0000-0002-6835-9883; Huppmann, Daniel/0000-0002-7729-7389; Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515; McCollum, David/0000-0003-1293-0179; Zhou, Wenji/0000-0001-8355-8357",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [642147],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,We acknowledge funding by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 642147 ('CD-LINKS' project).,,39,11,11,2,24,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Here we investigated these issues over North America based on a large ensemble of state-of-the-art gross primary production (GPP) models, including two solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)-based models (WECANN and GOPT), three remote sensing driven light-use efficiency (LUE) models, and 10 PB models. We found that the two SIF-based GPP estimates were bilaterally consistent in spatial patterns of peak growing season GPP (GPP PGS ; with the largest uptake at the Corn-Belt area in the United States) and climate extremes-driven responses. The simulations from three LUE models showed relatively consistent spatial patterns of GPP PGS and climate extremes-driven responses, which agreed well with SIF-based estimates and satellite based metrics. Obviously differed from SIF and LUE based estimates, the simulations from PB models exhibited noticeable divergences and mostly failed to reasonably replicate the spatial pattern of GPP PGS . In addition, satellite models and PB models were comparably able to capture the effects of climate extremes on GPP, but showing obvious divergences in the magnitude of impacts among different models, and the former outperformed the latter in locating GPP changes caused by climate extremes. We discussed the possible origins of such discrepancies in state-of-the-art models with focus on PB models. Improving the parameterizations of critical variables (e.g. leaf area index) and better characterizing environmental stresses could lead to more robust estimates of large-scale terrestrial GPP with PB models, thus serving for accurately assessing global carbon budget and better understanding the impacts of climate change on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Our study offers a baseline for improving large-scale estimation of terrestrial GPP.","[He, Wei; Ju, Weimin; Jiang, Fei] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Wei; Ju, Weimin; Jiang, Fei] Nanjing Univ, Key Lab Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci,Minist Nat Resources, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Parazoo, Nicholas] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Gentine, Pierre] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Gentine, Pierre] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wu, Xiaocui] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Spatial Anal, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhang, Chunhua] Ludong Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Yantai 264000, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiawen] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Viovy, Nicolas] CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, CNRS, UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England","Nanjing University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Nanjing University; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Columbia University; Columbia University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Ludong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Exeter; University of Exeter","Ju, WM; Jiang, F (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Ju, WM; Jiang, F (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Key Lab Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci,Minist Nat Resources, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",juweimin@nju.edu.cn; jiangf@nju.edu.cn,"Gentine, Pierre/C-1495-2013; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Jain, Atul/D-2851-2016; Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Jiang, Fei/A-9862-2014","Gentine, Pierre/0000-0002-0845-8345; Friedlingstein, Pierre/0000-0003-3309-4739; Jain, Atul/0000-0002-4051-3228; Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; Jiang, Fei/0000-0003-1744-7565; He, Wei/0000-0003-0779-2496","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0600204]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41907378, 41601054]; NASA [NNH17ZDA001N-THP]; Earth Science Division Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) program",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Earth Science Division Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) program,"This research is funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2016YFA0600204).

However, existing approaches for transdisciplinary collaboration tend to be limited to science-expert directions. Successful collaboration across disciplines and diverse contexts requires community agency, blurring disciplinary boundaries, and combining sciences and arts. We argue that traditional and emergent design practices provide a powerful mindset to support productive transdisciplinary collaborations for addressing complex societal problems such as climate change and social justice. Designers, historically, have struggled to translate the practices of arts and sciences into professional practice; and design can be understood as a third way of knowing that is unique from arts and sciences. Designers may use evidence, but they also generate proposals that are about preferred possibilities. We propose components of a design mindset (synthesis, modelling, speculation, facilitation, and implementation) for transdisciplinary teams to enhance future-oriented collaboration outcomes. These guidelines expand research-oriented approaches and can be used for co-designing futures in collaborative work.","[Mejia, G.

Forgoing the use of the humidity Jacobian as a weighting function, it is easier to apply than the traditional definition without compromising the retrieval accuracy. The same definition can be used to derive UTH from infrared observations, allowing for a more synergistic use of infrared and microwave UTH in the future.

These buildings require tight indoor temperature and moisture controls that demand significant energy from air handling units. Complex dynamic building systems, stringent conservation restrictions, and lack of detailed monitoring make diagnosing and optimising their energy use difficult. Building simulation software programmes have proven to be effective, but have tended to rely on data generated by simulation models. This study shows how artificial neural network (ANN) models trained with historical real data can predict a building's energy use and the optimal indoor microclimate necessary for conservation. Four ANN target-data scenarios were designed for optimised model predictions, and 12 ANN training algorithms were tested with six architectural scenarios collecting daily and hourly data. The ANN models used a randomised 80% sample of the database, with the remainder (20%) validating the models. The model displayed a high coefficient of correlation (0.99), with the mean square error and mean absolute error less than 0.1% and 2%, respectively. This ANN-based SID tool efficiently represents a complex building system and could be an ideal method for investigating optimisation strategies prior to their implementation.","[Ganguly, Shashwat; Ahmed, Afaq; Wang, Fan] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Ganguly, S (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",sg373@hw.ac.uk,"Ahmad, Afaq/O-5277-2019","Ahmad, Afaq/0000-0001-9427-4296; Wang, Fan/0000-0003-0020-1470",,,,,48,8,8,1,7,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

In this study, we investigate potential impacts of atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interaction on deep convection in the Southern Ocean (SO) of a climate system model (CSM) by changing sea ice-ocean stress. Sea ice-ocean stress plays a vital role in the horizontal momentum exchange between sea ice and the ocean, and can be parameterized as a function of the turning angle between sea ice and ocean velocity. Observations have shown that the turning angle is closely linked to the sea-ice intrinsic properties, including speed and roughness, and it varies spatially. However, a fixed turning angle, i.e., zero turning angle, is prescribed in most of the state-of-the-art CSMs. Thus, sensitivities of SO deep convection to zero and non-zero turning angles are discussed in this study. We show that the use of a non-zero turning angle weakens open-ocean deep convection and intensifies continental shelf slope convection. Our analyses reveal that a non-zero turning angle first induces offshore movement of sea ice transporting to the open SO, which leads to sea ice decrease in the SO coastal region and increase in the open SO. In the SO coastal region, the enhanced sea-ice divergence intensifies the formation of denser surface water descending along continental shelf by enhanced salt flux and reduced freshwater flux, combined with enhanced Ekman pumping and weakened stratification, contributing to the occurrence and intensification of continental shelf slope convection. On the other hand, the increased sea ice in the open SO weakens the westerlies, enhances sea-level pressure, and increases freshwater flux, whilst oceanic cyclonic circulation slows down, sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity decrease in the open SO response to the atmospheric changes. Thus, weakened cyclonic circulation, along with enhanced freshwater flux, reduced deep-ocean heat content, and increased stability of sea water, dampens the open-ocean deep convection in the SO, which in turn cools the sea surface temperature, increases sea-level pressure, and finally increases sea-ice concentration, providing a positive feedback. In the CSM, the use of a non-zero turning angle has the capability to reduce the SO warm bias. These results highlight the importance of an accurate representation of sea ice-ocean coupling processes in a CSM.","[Ma, Libin] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Libin; Cao, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Ningliu Rd 219,Meteorol Bldg, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, 1860 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, 1860 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Ma, LB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Ma, LB (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Ningliu Rd 219,Meteorol Bldg, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, 1860 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, 1860 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",malibin109@163.com; wangbin@hawaii.edu,,,National Major Research High Resolution Sea Ice Model Development Program of China [2018YFA0605904]; Basic Research Fund of CAMS [2018Z007]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2018r064],National Major Research High Resolution Sea Ice Model Development Program of China; Basic Research Fund of CAMS; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,This study is supported by the grant 2018YFA0605904 from the National Major Research High Resolution Sea Ice Model Development Program of China.

To this extent, the performance of the indoor environment is considered as part of the greenery criteria by green rating schemes such as the Green Building Index in Malaysia. This study aims to investigate and assess the quality of the indoor environment of Platinum-certified office buildings in a tropical climate. This research applied a case study approach over two Platinum-certified office buildings. Post-occupancy evaluation is employed integrating full-scale measurement with an occupants' survey. The measurement was carried out from May to August, and 112 questionnaires were retrieved to evaluate occupants' satisfaction with aspects of the indoor environment. Thermal comfort, indoor air quality, acoustic, lighting, furniture, and cleanliness are considered as the main study variables. The findings of full-scale measurement indicated high relative humidity, and low air velocity and illuminance. While occupants reported overall indoor environment quality (IEQ) comfort, a significant correlation of variables was observed. The main sources of dissatisfaction were identified as overcooling around 24 degrees C, high relative humidity (RH), around 70% RH, glare, and background noise around 51.9 dB. Statistically, a significant difference between occupants' responses to IEQ of two cases was identified, although both buildings are labelled with a Platinum certificate.","[Esfandiari, Masoud; Mohamed Zaid, Suzaini; Ismail, Muhammad Azzam] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Esfandiari, Masoud; Reza Hafezi, Mohammad] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran 69411, Iran; [Asadi, Iman] Univ Tehran, Sch Mech Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran 66191, Iran; [Mohammadi, Saleh] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural Engn & Technol, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Mohammadi, Saleh; Vaisi, Salah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Sanandaj 66177, Iran; [Aflaki, Ardalan] Univ Guilan, Fac Architecture & Art, Rasht 41996, Iran",Universiti Malaya; Shahid Beheshti University; University of Tehran; Delft University of Technology; University of Kurdistan; University of Guilan,"Esfandiari, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Esfandiari, M (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran 69411, Iran.;Mohammadi, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural Engn & Technol, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.;Mohammadi, S (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Sanandaj 66177, Iran.",m.esfandiari@um.edu.my; suzaini_zaid@um.edu.my; ma.ismail@um.edu.my; mr-hafezi@sbu.ac.ir; iman.asadi@ut.ac.ir; saleh.mohammadi@tudelft.nl; svaisi@uok.ac.ir; ar.aflaki@guilan.ac.ir,"Vaisi, Salah/AAZ-7985-2020; aflaki, ardalan/H-1427-2011; MOHAMED ZAID, NOOR SUZAINI/B-9282-2010; Ismail, Muhammad Azzam/F-8286-2011","Vaisi, Salah/0000-0002-9083-2737; MOHAMED ZAID, NOOR SUZAINI/0000-0002-4979-0555; Ismail, Muhammad Azzam/0000-0002-5341-7374; Esfandiari, Masoud/0000-0003-0587-3081; Mohammadi, Saleh/0000-0002-7623-6912; Asadi, Iman/0000-0001-8724-6916",University Malaya Research Fund Assistance (BKP) [BK061-2015],University Malaya Research Fund Assistance (BKP),"This research was funded by the University Malaya Research Fund Assistance (BKP), grant number BK061-2015.",,85,6,6,6,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2021,8,,,,,,2264,10.3390/en14082264,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14082264,,,25,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,RS9UH,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000644115200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Influence mechanisms and combating strategies towards them have similarities to some extent. Impacts of air pollution and climate change have long been studied under IUFRO Research Group 7.01 and state of the art findings are presented at biannual meetings. Monitoring, modelling, assessment of multiple stressors, ecophysiology, and nutrient cycles have been thoroughly studied aspects of climate change and air pollution research for a long time under the umbrella of IUFRO RG 7.01. Recently, social and economic issues together with water relations are gaining more attention in parallel with science requirements on adaptation. In this paper, we summarise the main research needs emphasized at the recent 24th IUFRO RG 7.01 Conference titled Adaptation of Forest Ecosystems to Air Pollution and Climate Change. One important conclusion of the conference was the need for information on nutritional status of forest stands for sustainable forest management. It has been suggested to maintain long-term monitoring programs and to account for the effects of extreme years, and past and present management practices. Long-term monitoring can also help to understand the effects of forestry treatments on the nutrient and water budgets of the ecosystems which may enable to improve management practices like water saving silviculture.","[Serengil, Y.] Istanbul Univ, Dept Watershed Management, Istanbul, Turkey; [Augustaitis, A.] Lithuanian Univ Agr, LT-53362 Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania; [Bytnerowicz, A.; Grulke, N.] USDA Forest Serv, Riverside, CA USA; [Kozovitz, A.

Setting realistic policy goals requires knowing the amount of different NBS types that can fit in the urban space and the benefits that can be expected. This research aims to assess the potential for a full-scale implementation of NBS for climate-change adaptation in European cities, the expected benefits and co-benefits, and how these quantities relate to the urban structure of the cities. We selected three case studies: Barcelona (Spain), Malmo (Sweden), and Utrecht (the Netherlands), and developed six scenarios that simulate the current condition, the full-scale implementation of different NBS strategies (i.e., installing green roofs, de-sealing parking areas, enhancing vegetation in urban parks, and planting street trees), and a combination of them. Then we applied spatially-explicit methods to assess, for each scenario, two climate change-related benefits, i.e. heat mitigation and stormwater regulation, and three co benefits, namely carbon storage, biodiversity potential, and overall greenness. Finally, by breaking down the results per land use class, we investigated how the potential and benefits vary depending on the urban form. Most scenarios provide multiple benefits, but each one is characterized by a specific mix. In all cities, a full-scale deployment of green roofs shows the greatest potential to reduce runoff and increase biodiversity, while tree planting-either along streets or in urban parks- produces the greatest impact on heat mitigation and greenness. However, these results entail interventions of different size and in different locations. Planting street trees maximizes interventions in residential areas, but key opportunities for integrating most NBS types also lie in commercial and industrial areas. The results on the pros and cons of each scenario can support policy-makers in designing targeted NBS strategies for climate change adaptation.","[Cortinovis, Chiara; Olsson, Peter; Boke-Olen, Niklas; Hedlund, Katarina] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci, Solvegatan 37, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Cortinovis, Chiara] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Lund University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Cortinovis, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci, Solvegatan 37, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",chiara.cortinovis@cec.lu.se,"Cortinovis, Chiara/AAN-7260-2020","Cortinovis, Chiara/0000-0002-9612-4731; Boke-Olen, Niklas/0000-0003-2441-7153",Horizon 2020 project NATURVATION [730243]; FORMAS project Nature-based solutions for urban challenges [2016-00324]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Horizon 2020 project NATURVATION; FORMAS project Nature-based solutions for urban challenges; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"This research received funding from the Horizon 2020 project NATURVATION (grant agreement 730243) and from the FORMAS project Nature-based solutions for urban challenges (n. 2016-00324) .

As the climate continues to warm, reliable future precipitation projections are needed to provide the best possible information to decision makers. However, future changes in the magnitude of extreme precipitation are uncertain, as current state-ofthe-art global climate models are typically run at relatively coarse horizontal resolutions that require the use of convective parameterization and have difficulty simulating observed extreme rainfall rates. Here, we performed ensembles of convection-permitting regional climate model simulations to investigate how five historically impactful extreme precipitation events over the San Francisco Bay Area could change if similar events occurred in future climates. We found that changes in storm-total precipitation depend strongly on storm type. Precipitation associated with an atmospheric river (AR) accompanied by an extratropical cyclone (ETC) is projected to increase at a rate exceeding (by up to 1.5 times) the theoretical Clausius Clapeyron scaling of 6-7% per ? warming. On the other hand, future precipitation changes are weak or negative for events characterized by an AR only, despite increases in precipitable water and integrated vapor transport that are similar to those of the co-occurring AR and ETC events. The differences in the sign of future precipitation change between AR-only events and co-occurring AR and ETC events is instead linked with changes in mid-tropospheric vertical velocity. Given that the majority of observed ARs are associated with an ETC, this research has important implications for future precipitation impacts over the Bay Area, as it indicates that storm-total precipitation associated with the most common type of storm event may increase by up to 26-37% in 2100 relative to historical.","[Patricola, Christina M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Patricola, Christina M.; Bercos-Hickey, Emily; Maciel, Flor Vanessa] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Wehner, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Computat Res Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Maciel, Flor Vanessa] San Jose State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Climate Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [May, Christine; Mak, Michael; Yip, Olivia] Pathways Climate Inst, San Francisco, CA USA; [Yip, Olivia] San Jose State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Roche, Anna M.] San Francisco Publ Util Commiss, San Francisco, CA USA; [Leal, Susan] Urban Water Works, San Francisco, CA USA",Iowa State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University,"Patricola, CM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, 3017 Agron Hall,716 Farm House Ln, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",cmp28@iastate.edu,"Bercos-Hickey, Emily/S-6121-2019; May, Christine/Y-5129-2018; Patricola, Christina/L-9902-2016; Wehner, Michael/F-7841-2015","Yip (Hoang), Olivia/0000-0002-9549-3623; May, Christine/0000-0003-0974-3778; Patricola, Christina/0000-0002-3387-0307; Wehner, Michael/0000-0001-5991-0082","County of San Francisco (CCSF) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [1541181]; National Science Foundation; FVM performed research under the Berkeley Lab Undergraduate Research (BLUR) pro-gram; City and County of San Francisco (CCSF); National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation [DE-AC02-05CH11231, 1541181, ACI-1548562, ATM190012];  [ATM190016]","County of San Francisco (CCSF); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); FVM performed research under the Berkeley Lab Undergraduate Research (BLUR) pro-gram; City and County of San Francisco (CCSF); National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ","This research was supported by the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) and used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC; https:// www.nersc.gov; DOI: 10.13039/100017223), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, operated under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Motivated by recent findings that the horizontal advection of the mean low-tropospheric moist static energy or moisture by the MJO winds plays a crucial role in the eastward propagation of the MJO, we investigate the relationship between lower tropospheric moisture patterns over the Indo-Pacific and MJO eastward propagation in a suite of 23 GCM simulations. Model capability of reproducing the observed November-April mean lower tropospheric moisture pattern over the Indo-Pacific, especially near the Maritime Continent (MC), is highly correlated with model skill in simulating MJO eastward propagation. In GCMs with difficulty capturing realistic MJO propagation, the amplitude of the mean low-level moisture over the MC is greatly underestimated, leading to weak horizontal moisture gradients and thus discrepancies in moisture advection, significantly affecting MJO propagation. This study suggests that the mean lower tropospheric moisture pattern over the MC can serve as an important diagnostic metric for MJO propagation in climate models.","[Gonzalez, Alex O.; Jiang, Xianan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Gonzalez, Alex O.; Jiang, Xianan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Gonzalez, AO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;Gonzalez, AO (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",alex.o.gonzalez@jpl.nasa.gov,"González, Alex/GYU-3220-2022","Gonzalez, Alex/0000-0001-8001-408X","National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-1228302]; NOAA Climate Program Office [NA12OAR4310075, NA15OAR4310098, NA15OAR4310177]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We acknowledge the insightful comments from A.

J,"Boulanger, JP; Martinez, F; Segura, EC",,,,"Boulanger, Jean-Philippe; Martinez, Fernando; Segura, Enrique C.",,,"Projection of future climate change conditions using IPCC simulations, neural networks and Bayesian statistics. Part 2: Precipitation mean state and seasonal cycle in South America",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODELS,"Evaluating the response of climate to greenhouse gas forcing is a major objective of the climate community, and the use of large ensemble of simulations is considered as a significant step toward that goal. The present paper thus discusses a new methodology based on neural network to mix ensemble of climate model simulations. Our analysis consists of one simulation of seven Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models, which participated in the IPCC Project and provided at least one simulation for the twentieth century (20c3m) and one simulation for each of three SRES scenarios: A2, A1B and B1. Our statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics computes a transfer function between models and observations. Such a transfer function was then used to project future conditions and to derive what we would call the optimal ensemble combination for twenty-first century climate change projections. Our approach is therefore based on one statement and one hypothesis. The statement is that an optimal ensemble projection should be built by giving larger weights to models, which have more skill in representing present climate conditions. The hypothesis is that our method based on neural network is actually weighting the models that way. While the statement is actually an open question, which answer may vary according to the region or climate signal under study, our results demonstrate that the neural network approach indeed allows to weighting models according to their skills. As such, our method is an improvement of existing Bayesian methods developed to mix ensembles of simulations. However, the general low skill of climate models in simulating precipitation mean climatology implies that the final projection maps (whatever the method used to compute them) may significantly change in the future as models improve. Therefore, the projection results for late twenty-first century conditions are presented as possible projections based on the state-of-the-art of present climate modeling. First, various criteria were computed making it possible to evaluate the models' skills in simulating late twentieth century precipitation over continental areas as well as their divergence in projecting climate change conditions. Despite the relatively poor skill of most of the climate models in simulating present-day large scale precipitation patterns, we identified two types of models: the climate models with moderate-to-normal (i.e., close to observations) precipitation amplitudes over the Amazonian basin; and the climate models with a low precipitation in that region and too high a precipitation on the equatorial Pacific coast. Under SRES A2 greenhouse gas forcing, the neural network simulates an increase in precipitation over the La Plata basin coherent with the mean model ensemble projection. Over the Amazonian basin, a decrease in precipitation is projected. However, the models strongly diverge, and the neural network was found to give more weight to models, which better simulate present-day climate conditions. In the southern tip of the continent, the models poorly simulate present-day climate. However, they display a fairly good convergence when simulating climate change response with a weak increase south of 45 degrees S and a decrease in Chile between 30 and 45 degrees S. Other scenarios (A1B and B1) strongly resemble the SRES A2 trends but with weaker amplitudes.","Univ Paris 06, CNRS, IRD, LODYC,UMR, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Comp, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; University of Buenos Aires,"Boulanger, JP (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jpb@lodyc.jussieu.fr,,,,,,,20,49,51,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The purpose of this study is to determine the time periods of a year most suitable for the use of a SC in terms of thermal comfort under the different climates of Bandar-Abbas (hot and humid), Yazd (hot and arid), Paris (mild and humid) and Toronto (cold and humid). To this aim, a thermosyphonic model - validated against published experimental data - was employed for running dynamic thermal simulations of a residential building using the EnergyPlus software. The optimal time periods of operation of the SC, driven by the values of the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) between -0.7 and +0.7 and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) below 15%, are found to be November and January to April in Bandar-Abbas (2265 h), while for the city of Yazd it comprises the months of April and May together with September and October (2145 h). As for Paris and Toronto, the period spans from June to August, for a total of 1065 and 1620 h respectively. Correlation coefficients disclosing the impact of the increased air mass flow rate revealed a positive impact everywhere during nighttime in terms of indoor air temperatures (from 0.02 in Bandar-Abbas to 0.77 in Yazd). On the other hand, the impact on indoor relative humidity is always negatively correlated, with a peak of -0.73 in Yazd. Year-long comfort conditions are finally displayed in psychometric charts against ASHRAE 55 Standard boundaries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here the radiative effects controlling an axisymmetric monsoon and its response to climate change are investigated using aquaplanet simulations. The influences of clouds, water vapor, and CO2 on the axisymmetric monsoon are decomposed using the radiation-locking technique. Seasonal variations in clouds and water vapor strongly modulate the axisymmetric monsoon, reducing net precipitation by approximately half. Warming and moistening of the axisymmetric monsoon by seasonal longwave cloud and water vapor effects are counteracted by a strong shortwave cloud effect. The shortwave cloud effect also expedites onset of the axisymmetric monsoon by approximately two weeks, whereas longwave cloud and water vapor effects delay onset. A conceptual model relates the timing of monsoon onset to the efficiency of surface cooling. In climate change simulations CO2 forcing and the water vapor feedback have similar influences on the axisymmetric monsoon, warming the surface and moistening the region. In contrast, clouds have a negligible effect on surface temperature yet dominate the monsoon circulation response. A new perspective for understanding how cloud radiative effects shape the monsoon circulation response to climate change is introduced. The radiation-locking simulations and analyses advance understanding of how radiative processes influence an axisymmetric monsoon, and establish a framework for interpreting monsoon-radiation coupling in observations, in state-of-the-art models, and in different climate states.","[Byrne, Michael P.] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Byrne, Michael P.; Zanna, Laure] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Zanna, Laure] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA",University of St Andrews; University of Oxford; New York University,"Byrne, MP (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.;Byrne, MP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",mpb20@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Zanna, Laure/L-3169-2019","Zanna, Laure/0000-0002-8472-4828; Byrne, Michael/0000-0001-9019-3915",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie Grant [794063]; UK Natural Environment Research Council's [NE/R000727/1],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie Grant(SKA South Africa); UK Natural Environment Research Council's,"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie Grant Agreement 794063 and the UK Natural Environment Research Council's Grant NE/R000727/1.

It designs and models 39 scenarios by integrating in situ measurement and ENVI-met numerical simulation and further compares cooling effects of various combinations of the cooling factors. The results show that (1) an increased number of trees and higher albedo are more effective compared to green roofs in reducing summer potential temperatures at street level (2 m high) in three LCZs. Negative correlations are observed in the pedestrian air temperature with trees and ground albedo; (2) the effects of cooling factors vary among different LCZ classes, with the increased 60% more trees leading to lower outdoor temperatures for LCZ-4 (0.28 degrees C), LCZ-5 (0.39 degrees C), and LCZ-6 (0.54 degrees C), while higher albedo of asphalt surface (increased by 0.4) is more effective in LCZ-4 (reaches to 0.68 degrees C) 14:00, compare to LCZ-5 (0.49 degrees C) and LCZ-6 (0.38 degrees C); (3) applying combined cooling methods can provoke air temperature reduction (up to 0.96 degrees C), especially when higher levels of tree quantities (increased by 60%) are coupled with cool ground materials (albedo increased by 0.4).

As most state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) are not capable of realistically representing processes determining the SMB, most studies of the SMB are limited to observations and regional climate models and cover the last century and near future only. Using transient simulations with the Max Planck Institute ESM in combination with an energy balance model (EBM), we extend previous research and study changes in the SMB and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) for the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets throughout the last deglaciation. The EBM is used to calculate and downscale the SMB onto a higher spatial resolution than the native ESM grid and allows for the resolution of SMB variations due to topographic gradients not resolved by the ESM. An evaluation for historical climate conditions (1980-2010) shows that derived SMBs compare well with SMBs from regional modeling. Throughout the deglaciation, changes in insolation dominate the Greenland SMB. The increase in insolation and associated warming early in the deglaciation result in an ELA and SMB increase. The SMB increase is caused by compensating effects of melt and accumulation: the warming of the atmosphere leads to an increase in melt at low elevations along the ice-sheet margins, while it results in an increase in accumulation at higher levels as a warmer atmosphere precipitates more. After 13 ka, the increase in melt begins to dominate, and the SMB decreases. The decline in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation after 9 ka leads to an increasing SMB and decreasing ELA. Superimposed on these long-term changes are centennialscale episodes of abrupt SMB and ELA decreases related to slowdowns of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) that lead to a cooling over most of the Northern Hemisphere.","[Kapsch, Marie-Luise; Mikolajewicz, Uwe; Ziemen, Florian A.; Schannwell, Clemens] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Rodehacke, Christian B.] Danish Meteorol Inst, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Rodehacke, Christian B.] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Ziemen, Florian A.] Deutsch Klimarechenzentrum, Bundesstr 45a, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Max Planck Society; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Kapsch, ML (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",marie.kapsch@mpimet.mpg.de,,"Ziemen, Florian Andreas/0000-0001-7095-5740; Kapsch, Marie-Luise/0000-0001-9551-5370; Rodehacke, Christian/0000-0003-3110-3857; Schannwell, Clemens/0000-0002-6160-2107","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LP1504C, 01LP1502A, 01LP1915, 01LP1917]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research has been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (grant nos. 01LP1504C, 01LP1502A, 01LP1915, and 01LP1917).",,92,2,2,0,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1994-0416,1994-0424,,CRYOSPHERE,Cryosphere,3-Mar,2021,2,,,,1131,1156,,10.5194/tc-15-1131-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1131-2021,,,26,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,QT0PX,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000626295900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been agreed that one source of this shortcoming is related to the poor relief representation in models. To resolve this need, a common method used is to enhance the spatial resolution of the model to retrieve a more complex surface elevation, at the expense of calculation time or surface area covered. This paper tackles the problem from a different angle by addressing the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generalization, that is, the altitudes generalization from a high-resolution DEM to a coarser resolution grid model. Most current climate models use DEM generalization methods that smooth the relief, a key controlling factor in Foehn events modelling. The aim of this study is to compare three original methods of DEM generalization (percentile 90 [P90], envelope maximum [EM], and thalweg and crests [TC]) and to evaluate their impact on simulated precipitation and temperature fields on the eastern part of Patagonia, where warm and dry air masses are expected. Thanks to MAR, a Regional Climate Model, we validate the models at 10 and 5 km resolutions against the Climate Research Unit and perform three sensitivity experiments involving a change in the DEM generalization. Our results show that (a) a finer spatial resolution can slightly improve the temperature biases, however, it cannot resolve the precipitation biases and (b) a more appropriate use of DEM generalization induces a significant decrease in precipitation for the P90 and EM methods and an increase in mean temperature for all three methods in the study area. This study serves as a recommendation for a better use of DEM generalization in climate models performing in Patagonia, but also regions sharing the same orographic features as the Patagonian relief.","[Damseaux, Adrien; Fettweis, Xavier; Lambert, Marius; Cornet, Yves] Univ Liege, Dept Geog, Liege, Belgium; [Damseaux, Adrien] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Lambert, Marius] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway",University of Liege; Simon Fraser University; University of Oslo,"Damseaux, A (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",adamseau@sfu.ca,,"Damseaux, Adrien/0000-0002-8465-9747; Lambert, Marius/0000-0001-7504-3548; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813",,,,,36,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

They consist of two sets of 10-yr-long ensemble hindcasts for two initial dates in 1965 and 1995 using either the external forcings from the correct decades or swapping the forcings between the two decades. By comparing the two sets of integrations, the impact of external forcing versus initial conditions on the predictability over multiannual time scales was estimated as the function of lead time of the hindcast. It was found that over time scales longer than about 1 yr, the predictability of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on a global scale arises mainly from the external forcing. However, the correct initialization has a longer impact on SST predictability over specific regions such as the North Atlantic, the northwestern Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. The impact of initialization is even longer and extends to wider regions when below-surface ocean variables are considered. For the western and eastern tropical Atlantic, the impact of initialization for the 700-m heat content (HTC700) extends to as much as 9 years for some of the models considered.

Stable isotope studies in speleothems have shifted away from attempting to provide palaco-tempcrature reconstructions to the attainable goal of providing precise estimates for the timing and duration of major O isotope-defined climatic events characterised by high signal to noise ratios (e.g. glacial/interglacial transitions, Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations, the '8200-year' event). Unlike the marine records, speleothem data sets Lire not 'tuned', and their independent chronology offers opportunities to critically assess leads and lags in the climate system, that in turn can provide important insights into forcing and feedback mechanisms. Improved procedures for the extraction and measurement of stable isotope ratios in fluid inclusions trapped in speleothems are likely to provide, in the near future, a much enhanced basis for the quantitative interpretation of O isotope ratios in spelcothem calcite. The latter developments open up once again the tantalising prospect of palaeo-temperature estimates, but more importantly perhaps, provide a direct test for a new generation of general circulation models whose hydrological cycles will incorporate the 'water isotopes'. The literature is reviewed briefly to provide for the reader a sense of the current state-of-the-art, and to provide some pointers for future research directions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This can be amplified if citizens are not meaningfully consulted in the planning and design decisions, with changes to greenspace having detrimental impacts on local communities, e.g., through green gentrification. These deficiencies can be addressed through inclusive landscape-level collaborative planning and design processes, where residents are fully engaged in the co-creation of urban greenspaces. A promising way to support co-creation efforts is gamifying technology-based interactive decision support systems (DSSs). Gamification, the incorporation of video game elements or play into non-game contexts, has previously been used for DSSs in urban planning and to inform the public about the impacts of climate change. However, this has yet to combine informational goals with design-play functionality in the redesign of urban greenspaces. We conducted a review of state-of-the-art video game DSSs used for urban planning engagement and climate education. Here, we propose that gamified DSSs should incorporate educational elements about climate change alongside the interactive and engaging elements of urban planning games, particularly for real-world scenarios. This cross-disciplinary approach can facilitate improved community engagement in greenspace planning, informing design and management strategies to ensure multiple benefits for people and the environment in climate-vulnerable cities.","[Fox, Nathan; Lindquist, Mark; Van Berkel, Derek; Serrano-Vergel, Ramiro] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Campbell-Arvai, Victoria] Univ Southern Calif, Environm Studies Program, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Southern California,"Fox, N (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",foxnat@umich.edu,,"Van Berkel, Derek/0000-0002-1001-783X",US National Science Foundation (NSF) [2033320],US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) through Grant No. 2033320 Designing High Performing Novel Landscapes to Tackle Climate Change Using Gamification & Crowdsourcing.,,97,1,1,4,4,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2022,2,,,,239,252,,10.17645/up.v7i2.4987,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v7i2.4987,,,14,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,2R2ZD,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000820979800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Paradoxically, animals are equally central to and yet marginalised by these discourses, both of which are thoroughly anthropocentric. Racist discourses thrive on animalising groups of people, which can only work if the status of nonhuman animals is diminished. Modern agribusiness values nonhuman animals merely as resources. The meat industry profits from killing hundreds of millions of animals daily and is one of the main drivers of climate change and environmental destruction. In its relentless pursuit of profit, Western capitalist modernity destroys not only indigenous cultures but also the environments that sustain them, including indigenous fauna and flora. Ng?g? argues that Africans prior to colonialism had rich oral literary traditions, often centred on animals, which colonialism dismembered. This article explores the animal figure central to traditional San rock art and myth to see if this can form an imaginative basis for regaining respect for nonhuman animals. Until nonhuman animal lives are respected the attitudes that fuel both racism and environmental destruction will persist.","[Northover, Richard Alan] Unisa, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Northover, RA (corresponding author), Unisa, Pretoria, South Africa.",northra@unisa.ac.za,"Northover, Richard/B-9426-2017","Northover, Richard/0000-0002-5699-9613",,,,,36,1,1,0,0,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",0256-4718,1753-5387,,J LIT STUD,J.

From the 1570s to the 1620s many professors in the faculty of arts pushed back against astrology and Jean Fernel's theories surrounding astral body. Girolamo Mercuriale, Alessandro Massaria and Eustachio Rudio thought that some forms of astral causation and Fernel's ideas were incompatible with their observations of disease, Aristotle's philosophy and Hippocratic theories. Later, Santorio Santorio and Cesare Cremonini, who were allied to the political circle of Paolo Sarpi, polemicized against astrology. Their writings show that at Padua medical theory was linked to Aristotelian cosmology, which emphasized the incommensurability between celestial and terrestrial elements. Their rejection of astrology, however, did not lead to the complete marginalization of astrology at Padua. By the middle of the 1620s, as the political climate changed in Venice, the University of Padua hired professors who promoted astrology and Fernel's theories about the celestial nature of innate heat. The diversity of opinions about astrology reflected Venice's divided politics and multiple approaches to interpreting Aristotle and other authorities.","[Martin, Craig] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Heritage, Cafoscari, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Martin, C (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Heritage, Cafoscari, Italy.",craigedwin.martin@unive.it,,"MARTIN, Craig/0000-0001-7663-4841",,,,,97,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0007-0874,1474-001X,,BRIT J HIST SCI,Br.

An additional indirect forcing from aerosols results from their involvement in nucleation and growth of cloud droplets, reducing droplet size and thereby potentially influencing cloud albedo. These studies have particular significance over tropics where the convective and dynamical processes associated with high-altitude thunderstorms greatly affect the vertical distributions of aerosols and pre-cursor gases. As the anthropogenic share of the total aerosol loading is quite substantial over many parts of the world, it is essential to monitor the aerosol features systematically over longer time scales. Such observations are very important for understanding the coupling processes that exist between physico-chemical, radiative, dynamical and biological phenomena in the Earth's environment, and provide valuable input information for modeling and simulation studies of climate and air quality. The multi-year aerosol number density data acquired during October 1986 - September 2000 with a computer-controlled lidar at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, an urban station in India have been utilized to investigate (i) climate variability, (ii) cloud macro-physical parameters and (iii) environmental pollution. The results reveal a long-term trend in aerosol loading, single and multiple layer clouds with low cloud-base during the south-west monsoon months, and high pollution potential during winter late evenings. The trends in aerosol loading and air quality are found to be changing from year to year depending upon meteorological parameters (precipitation in particular). Some of these parameters have also been compared with co-located complementary facilities such as solar radiometers. In order to enlarge the scope of these studies, a dual polarization micro pulse lidar (DPMPL) has been installed at IITM recently to investigate the cloud composition, and aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. The initial results obtained from this state-of-the-art lidar system showed interesting features in the time evolution of nocturnal (stable) boundary layer which have strong bearing on air pollution potential over the experimental station. The complete details of the lidar systems used in the above studies together with discussion of salient results are presented in this paper.","[Devara, Panuganti C.

This study has been conducted at three levels. At the first level, three context-based climatic solutions including shading, natural ventilation, and insulation of external walls and roofs were identified and selected based on bibliographic study. At the second level, a case study reflecting the current typology of common residential buildings in Bushehr city was selected. A combination of the mentioned climatic solutions was used in the baseline case to create a developed model. Based on the space layout of the developed model and some design criteria, a series of proposed models was also created and modeled. The selected case study building was also used to establish a local weather station at a height of 12 m based on the roof, collecting local climate data which were then used for simulation to improve simulation accuracy. Finally, all models were simulated with the use of Design Builder software under natural ventilation conditions during moderate climatic periods of the year while split air-conditioning systems were used during hot and humid periods. The results showed reductions of 16% in energy consumption and 22% in CO2 emissions for the developed model, and reductions of 24-26% in energy consumption and 32-34% in CO2 emissions for the proposed models, as compared with the baseline model. Furthermore, all proposed models achieved lower annual energy consumption when compared with a selection of international sustainable low energy standards and domestic energy performance references for the Middle East region. Further studies are also recommended, and there is potential for combining VCS with other solutions such as on-site renewable energies.","[Mohammadi, Amin; Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza; Nasrollahi, Farshad] Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Esfahan 8146834615, Iran; [Tahbaz, Mansoureh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tehran 1983969411, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University,"Mohammadi, A (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Esfahan 8146834615, Iran.",aminmohammadi.pgu@gmail.com; mrsaghafi@gmail.com; m58tahbaz@yahoo.com; nasrollahi@enef.co,"Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza/AAJ-3077-2020; Mohammadi, Amin/T-6866-2017; Tahbaz, Mansoureh/ABB-7994-2021; Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza/GRN-9697-2022","Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza/0000-0001-7779-7132; Mohammadi, Amin/0000-0001-7932-7011; Tahbaz, Mansoureh/0000-0003-3765-8407; ",Art University of Isfahan,Art University of Isfahan,This article is part of an unpublished Ph.D. thesis entitled The Effect of Passive Techniques on Reducing Energy Consumption in Hot and Humid Regions: The Case Study of Vernacular Cooling Methods in Common Residential Buildings of Bushehr City which was completed at Art University of Isfahan in 2017.

Here we use the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model, version 1, with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model as its atmospheric component (CESM1(WACCM)), to compare surface climate and stratospheric effects of two geoengineering strategies. In one, SO2 is injected into the tropical lower stratosphere at the equator to keep global mean temperature nearly constant under an RCP8.5 scenario, as has been commonly simulated in previous studies. In another, the Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS), SO2 is injected into the lower stratosphere at four different locations (30 degrees N/S and 15 degrees N/S) to keep global mean temperature, the interhemispheric temperature gradient, and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient nearly unchanged. Both simulations are effective at offsetting changes in global mean temperature and the interhemispheric temperature gradient that result from increased greenhouse gases, but only GLENS fully offsets changes in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. GLENS results in a more even aerosol distribution, whereas equatorial injection tends to result in an aerosol peak in the tropics. Moreover, GLENS requires less total injection than in the equatorial case due to different spatial distributions of the aerosols. Many other aspects of surface climate changes, including precipitation and sea ice coverage, also show reduced changes in GLENS as compared to equatorial injection. Stratospheric changes, including heating, circulation, and effects on the quasi-biennial oscillation are greatly reduced in GLENS as compared to equatorial injection.","[Kravitz, Ben] Indiana Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [MacMartin, Douglas G.; Cheng, Wei] Cornell Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY USA; [Tilmes, Simone; Mills, Michael J.; Glanville, Anne S.; Vitt, Francis] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Richter, Jadwiga H.; Dagon, Katherine; Lamarque, Jean-Francois; Simpson, Isla R.; Tribbia, Joseph] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Cornell University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kravitz, B (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Kravitz, B (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",bkravitz@iu.edu,"Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Simpson, Isla/AAI-7589-2020; MacMartin, Douglas/AAB-5314-2020; Mills, Michael/B-5068-2010; MacMartin, Douglas/A-6333-2016; Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014","Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Cheng, Wei/0000-0002-6499-0213; Simpson, Isla/0000-0002-2915-1377; Mills, Michael/0000-0002-8054-1346; Tilmes, Simone/0000-0002-6557-3569; MacMartin, Douglas/0000-0003-1987-9417; Dagon, Katherine/0000-0002-4518-8225; Glanville, Anne/0000-0002-5487-1229; Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; National Science Foundation; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation [1852977]; Prepared for Environmental Change grand challenge initiative,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation; Prepared for Environmental Change grand challenge initiative,"This research was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Therefore, it is important to require satisfactory durability of these materials, components and structures. In fact, one single material failure may jeopardize whole components as well as structures. Unfortunately, experience shows that building products too often do not satisfy the various requirements after a relatively short period of use, i.e. the expected service life is considerably shorter than foreseen. This results in increased and large costs due to increased maintenance, extensive replacements of the specific building products and any possible consequential building damages. In addition, health hazards with respect to both risk and consequence may also become an issue. To avoid this, the solution is to apply building products which have properly documented adequate and satisfactory long-term durability. That is, building products which have been subjected to long-term natural outdoor climate exposure or appropriate accelerated climate ageing in the laboratory. This study examines the main climate exposures and how these may be reproduced in the laboratory in various ways. Thus, crucial properties of building products and their durability towards climate strains may be investigated within a relatively short time frame compared with natural outdoor climate ageing. Examples of miscellaneous climate ageing laboratory apparatuses, ageing methods and building product properties to be tested before, during and after ageing are given. A calculation method for estimating acceleration factors is also discussed. Various ageing examples are shown and discussed. A special note is made towards accelerated climate ageing of new and advanced materials being developed. Hence, this study addresses durability and the versatile and powerful application of accelerated climate ageing which is an all too overlooked field within materials science and engineering.","[Jelle, Bjorn Petter] SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Jelle, Bjorn Petter] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Jelle, BP (corresponding author), SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",bjorn.petter.jelle@sintef.no,,"Jelle, Bjorn Petter/0000-0003-2026-6394",Research Council of Norway; AF Gruppen; Glava; Hunton Fiber as; Icopal; Isola; Jackon; maxit; Moelven ByggModul; Ramboll; Skanska; Statsbygg; Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe through the SIN-TEF; Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe through the NTNU,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); AF Gruppen; Glava; Hunton Fiber as; Icopal; Isola; Jackon; maxit; Moelven ByggModul; Ramboll; Skanska; Statsbygg; Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe through the SIN-TEF; Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe through the NTNU,"This work has been supported by the Research Council of Norway, AF Gruppen, Glava, Hunton Fiber as, Icopal, Isola, Jackon, maxit, Moelven ByggModul, Ramboll, Skanska, Statsbygg and Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe through the SIN-TEF and NTNU research project 'Robust Envelope Construction Details for Buildings of the 21st Century' (ROBUST).",,113,79,79,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2461,1573-4803,,J MATER SCI,J.

However, state-of-the-art long-term global climate simulations do not provide appropriate HR climate data. Deep learning models are often used to obtain high-resolution climate data. However, due to the fact that these models require sufficient low-resolution (LR) and HR data pairs for the training process, they cannot be applied to scenario with inadequate training data. In this paper, we explore the applicability of a single image generative adversarial network (SinGAN) in generating HR climate data. SinGAN relies on single LR input data to obtain the corresponding HR data. To improve the performance for extreme-value regions, we propose a SinGAN combined with the weighted patchGAN discriminator (WSinGAN). The proposed WSinGAN outperforms comparable models in generating HR precipitation data, and its results are close to real HR data with sharp gradients and more refined small-scale features. We also test the scalability of the pre-trained WSinGAN for unseen samples and show that although only a single LR sample is used to train WSinGAN, it can still produce reliable HR data for unseen data.","[Wang, Yang; Karimi, Hassan A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, Geoinformat Lab, 135 N Bellefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, Geoinformat Lab, 135 N Bellefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",yaw70@pitt.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2096-4471,2574-5417,,BIG EARTH DATA,Big Earth Data,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/20964471.2022.2140868,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964471.2022.2140868,,22-Nov,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science; Geology; Remote Sensing,6E3LN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000883281600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study takes advantage of the GSWP2 land surface reanalysis covering the 1986-1995 period. The GSWP2 forcings have been used to derive a global SM climatology that is fully consistent with the model used in this study. One ensemble of ten simulations has been forced by climatological SST and the simulated SM is relaxed toward the GSWP2 reanalysis. Another ensemble has been forced by observed SST and SM is evolving freely. The last ensemble combines the observed SST forcing and the relaxation toward GSWP2. Two complementary aspects of the predictability have been explored, the potential predictability (analysis of variance) and the effective predictability (skill score). An analysis of variance has revealed the effects of the SST and SM boundary forcings on the variability and potential predictability of near-surface temperature, precipitation and surface evaporation. While in the tropics SST anomalies clearly maintain a potentially predictable variability throughout the annual cycle, in the mid-latitudes the SST forced variability is only dominant in winter and SM plays a leading role in summer. In a similar fashion, the annual cycle of the hindcast skill (evaluated as the anomalous correlation coefficient of the three ensemble means with respect to the observations) indicates that the SST forcing is the dominant contributor over the tropical continents and in the winter mid-latitudes but that SM is supporting a significant part of the skill in the summer mid-latitudes. Focusing on boreal summer, we have then investigated different aspects of the SM and SST contribution to climate variations in terms of spatial distribution and time-evolution. Our experiments suggest that SM is potentially an additional source of climate predictability. A realistic initialization of SM and a proper representation of the land-atmosphere feedbacks seem necessary to improve state-of-the-art dynamical seasonal predictions, but will be actually efficient only in the areas where SM anomalies are themselves predictable at the monthly to seasonal timescale (since remote effects of SM are probably much more limited than SST teleconnections).","UDC, CNRM, GMGEC, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France",,"Conil, S (corresponding author), UDC, CNRM, GMGEC, 42 Av G Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France.",sebastien.conil@cnrm.meteo.fr,,,,,,,47,53,60,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

It requires the assessment of the mass reduction potential of automotive materials, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their production and recycling, and their impact on GHG emissions from vehicle use. The model presented in this paper is based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and completely parameterized, i.e., its computational structure is separated from the required input data, which is not traditionally done in LCAs. The parameterization increases scientific rigor and transparency of the assessment methodology, facilitates sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the results, and also makes it possible to compare different studies and explain their disparities. The state of the art of the modeling methodology is reviewed and advanced. Assessment of the GHG emission impacts of material recycling through consequential system expansion shows that our understanding of this issue is still incomplete. This is a critical knowledge gap since a case study shows that for materials such as aluminum, the GHG emission impacts of material production and recycling are both of the same size as the use phase savings from vehicle mass reduction.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Donald Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Geyer, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Donald Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",geyer@bren.ucsb.edu,,,International Iron and Steel Institute,International Iron and Steel Institute,"I thank Professor Atsushi Inaba, Professor Greg Keoleian, Dr. John Sullivan, and Dr. Gerald Rebitzer for their critical review of the methodology and the International Iron and Steel Institute for partial financial support of this research.",,39,45,46,8,28,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Here, we describe the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS)-ESM1, which comprises atmosphere (UM7.3), land (CABLE), ocean (MOM4p1), and sea-ice (CICE4.1) components with OASIS-MCT coupling, to which ocean and land carbon modules have been added. The land carbon model (as part of CABLE) can optionally include both nitrogen and phosphorous limitation on the land carbon uptake. The ocean carbon model (WOMBAT, added to MOM) simulates the evolution of phosphate, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity and iron with one class of phytoplankton and zooplankton. We perform multi-centennial preindustrial simulations with a fixed atmospheric CO2 concentration and different land carbon model configurations (prescribed or prognostic leaf area index). We evaluate the equilibration of the carbon cycle and present the spatial and temporal variability in key carbon exchanges. Simulating leaf area index results in a slight warming of the atmosphere relative to the prescribed leaf area index case. Seasonal and interannual variations in land carbon exchange are sensitive to whether leaf area index is simulated, with interannual variations driven by variability in precipitation and temperature. We find that the response of the ocean carbon cycle shows reasonable agreement with observations. While our model overestimates surface phosphate values, the global primary productivity agrees well with observations. Our analysis highlights some deficiencies inherent in the carbon models and where the carbon simulation is negatively impacted by known biases in the underlying physical model and consequent limits on the applicability of this model version. We conclude the study with a brief discussion of key developments required to further improve the realism of our model simulation.","[Law, Rachel M.; Ziehn, Tilo; Stevens, Lauren E.; Wang, Ying-Ping; Srbinovsky, Jhan; Bi, Daohua; Yan, Hailin] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic, Australia; [Matear, Richard J.; Lenton, Andrew; Chamberlain, Matthew A.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Vohralik, Peter F.] CSIRO Mfg, Lindfield, NSW, Australia; [Yan, Hailin] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Bureau of Meteorology - Australia,"Law, RM (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic, Australia.",rachel.law@csiro.au,"Lenton, Andrew/D-2077-2012; matear, richard J/C-5133-2011; Bi, Daohua/O-4508-2015; Wang, Yingping/A-9765-2011; Law, Rachel/AAV-1949-2020; Ziehn, Tilo/A-3094-2012; Law, Rachel/A-1969-2012; Chamberlain, Matthew/D-4805-2012","Lenton, Andrew/0000-0001-9437-8896; matear, richard J/0000-0002-3225-0800; Wang, Yingping/0000-0002-4614-6203; Law, Rachel/0000-0002-7346-0927; Ziehn, Tilo/0000-0001-9873-9775; Law, Rachel/0000-0002-7346-0927; Stevens, Lauren/0000-0002-1884-328X; Chamberlain, Matthew/0000-0002-3287-3282",Australian Government Department of the Environment; Bureau of Meteorology; CSIRO through the Australian Climate Change Science Programme; Australian Commonwealth Government,Australian Government Department of the Environment(Australian Government); Bureau of Meteorology(Bureau of Meteorology - Australia); CSIRO through the Australian Climate Change Science Programme; Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government),"This research was supported by the Australian Government Department of the Environment, the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO through the Australian Climate Change Science Programme.

The emphasis of these missions is on providing data to advance our understanding of these individual components, their interaction with each other and the impacts that human activities have on natural Earth processes. By involving the science community from the beginning and introducing a peer-reviewed selection process, this ongoing user-driven approach has given the Earth science community an efficient tool in their endeavor to better understand and monitor our planet. So far, this process has resulted in six missions currently under development: GOCE, Cryosat, ADM Aeolus, SMOS, Swarm and EarthCARE.

The effect of the surface movement of panel painting surfaces due to simulated changes in temperature and relative humidity is characteristic of structural deterioration and as such these effects are primarily monitored in the start-up of the reaction process. The environmentally-provoked spatial alteration is recorded in full-field surface coordinates using optical coherent out-of-plane digital interferometry in a geometry utilizing holographic speckle patterns. Results demonstrate the suitability of the method to follow the start-up simulated process in real time directly from the work of art and to follow the rate of reaction towards equilibrium. The effectiveness of the full surface assessment provided in real time is presented and provides significant advantages compared to alternative techniques which are based on fragmented solutions.","[Bernikola, E.; Nevin, A.; Tornari, V.] FORTH, Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, Iraklion 71110, Greece; [Nevin, A.] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Fis, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bernikola, E (corresponding author), FORTH, Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, POB 1527, Iraklion 71110, Greece.",ebern@iesl.forth.gr,,"Nevin, Austin/0000-0003-1911-1045",European Union 6th Framework Program Multiencode [FP6-2003-SSP3006427]; European Union 6th Framework Program Marie Curie Early Stage Training Fellowship as part of the ATHENA Project [MEST-CT-2004-504067],European Union 6th Framework Program Multiencode(European Commission); European Union 6th Framework Program Marie Curie Early Stage Training Fellowship as part of the ATHENA Project(European Commission),Research was supported by: European Union 6th Framework Program Multiencode: Multi- functional encoding system for assessment of movable cultural heritage (FP6-2003-SSP3006427).

The uncertain but potentially severe impacts of the recent climate change issue (e.g. sea level rise, extreme river discharges, salinisation) amplify the wicked and controversial character of flood safety policy issues. Policy proposals in this area generally involve drastic infrastructural works and long-term investments. They face the difficult challenge of framing problems and solutions in a publicly acceptable manner in ever changing circumstances. In this paper, we analyse and compare (1) how three key policy proposals publicly frame the flood safety issue, (2) the knowledge referred to in the framing and (3) how these frames are rhetorically connected or disconnected as statements in a long-term conversation. We find that (1) framings of policy proposals differ in the way they depict the importance of climate change, the relevant timeframe and the appropriate governance mode; (2) knowledge is selectively mobilised to underpin the different frames and (3) the frames about these proposals position themselves against the background of the previous proposals through rhetorical connections and disconnections. Finally, we discuss how this analysis hints at the importance of processes of powering and puzzling that lead to particular framings towards the public at different historical junctures.

The present study maps the impact of emerging pressures on museums and historic buildings in the Tokyo Area. We examine a context to the threat in terms of fluctuating levels of visitors as a response to environmental issues, from SARS and COVID-19, through to earthquakes. GIS mapping allows a range of natural and human-induced hazards to be expressed as the spatial spread of risk. Temperature is increasing and Tokyo has a heat island which makes the city hotter than its surroundings. This adds to the effects of climate change. Temperature increases and a decline in relative humidity alter the potential for mould growth and change insect life cycles. The region is vulnerable to sea level rise, but flooding is also a likely outcome of increasingly intense falls of rain, especially during typhoons. Reclamation has raised the risk of liquefaction during earthquakes that are relatively frequent in Japan. Earthquakes cause structural damage and fires after the rupture of gas pipelines and collapse of electricity pylons. Fires from lightning strikes might also increase in a future Tokyo. These are especially relevant, as many Japanese heritage sites use wood for building materials. In parallel, more natural landscapes of the region are also affected by a changing climate. The shifting seasons already mean the earlier arrival of the cherry blossom and a later arrival of autumn colours and a lack of winter snow. The mapping exercise should highlight the spatial distribution of risk and the way it is likely to change, so it can contribute to longer term heritage management plans.","[Brimblecombe, Peter] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Brimblecombe, Peter] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Brimblecombe, Peter] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Aerosol Sci Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hayashi, Mikiko] Tokyo Natl Res Inst Cultural Properties, Ctr Conservat Sci, Natl Inst Cultural Heritage, Tokyo 1108713, Japan; [Futagami, Yoko] Tokyo Natl Res Inst Cultural Properties, Dept Art Res Arch & Informat Syst, Tokyo 1108713, Japan",City University of Hong Kong; National Sun Yat Sen University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Brimblecombe, P (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Brimblecombe, P (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.;Brimblecombe, P (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Aerosol Sci Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",p.brimblecombe@uea.ac.uk; hayashiO3@tobunken.go.jp; futa@tobunken.go.jp,,"Futagami, Yoko/0000-0002-2998-0538; Brimblecombe, Peter/0000-0002-2233-8761; Hayashi, Mikiko/0000-0002-5157-3488",,,,,68,8,8,7,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JUL,2020,7,,,,,,680,10.3390/atmos11070680,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11070680,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,NS9HD,,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000572564800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To this end, a review of the state of the art of the subject was carried out, where 97 scientific articles from a period comprising 2006 to 2020, considered the most pertinent, were selected. The methodology consisted of analyzing these texts based on ten questions formulated to address the subject: their origins, current status and future projections regarding energy efficiency and sustainability. The questions refer to definitions (Q1), sustainability (Q2), technologies involved (Q3), emissions (Q5), energy (Q4) (Q6) (Q7), regulations (Q8), climate change (Q9), and future projections (Q10). The work allows concluding that ZEB are integrated in a holistic way in the transformation towards a renewable and sustainable future in terms of energy solutions and, in turn, they have the potential to be implemented in different geographical and climatic positions.","[D'Amanzo, Micaela; Victoria Mercado, Maria; Ganem Karlen, Carolina] Ctr Cient Tecnol CCT, Inst Ambiente Habitat & Energia INAHE, Mendoza, Argentina",,"D'Amanzo, M (corresponding author), Ctr Cient Tecnol CCT, Inst Ambiente Habitat & Energia INAHE, Mendoza, Argentina.",mdamanzo@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar; mvmercado@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar; cganem@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar,,"Ganem, Carolina/0000-0002-1431-1219; D'Amanzo, Micaela/0000-0002-1921-6827",National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET),National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),We would like to thank the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) for their financial backing to make this research.,,93,5,8,6,10,UNIV BIO-BIO,CONCEPCION,"DEPT WOOD ENGINEERING, AVENIDA COLLAO 1202, CASILLA 5-C, CONCEPCION, CHILE",0719-0700,,,REV HABITAT SUSTENTA,Rev.

Understanding the environmental impacts of collecting and processing these solar materials is imperative to informing the roll out of recycling infrastructure. This work cbmbines traditional life-cycle assessment, geospatial statistical modeling, and processing optimization to quantify direct human and ecological impacts of PV resource recovery under a broad range of scenarios. For a baseline scenario, the most environmentally benign path is to landfill all of the end-of-life photovoltaics; this is due both to the sheer number and thereby close proximity of available landfill sites as well as the environmental burdens associated with current state-of-the-art recycling technologies. Such a disposal structure was found to be highly decentralized. Under a case where all materials are required to be recycled, emissions range from 7 to 252 g CO2 eq/kW h depending on the region; highly distributed regions have equivalently larger environmental impacts. Credits for recycling decrease these impacts and make recycling more favorable for certain scenarios. Future processing facilities co-located near utility scale photovoltaic installations may make environmental sense assuming optimistic advancements in prospective resource recovery technologies.

These external nutrient load reductions interact with retention and removal processes (ecosystem services) in coastal and marine waters. Beside sedimentation, denitrification is the most important regulation ecosystem service provided by the sea, because it removes nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere and controls eutrophication. Denitrification is a spatially and temporally highly variable process and largely depends on temperature and N concentrations in the water. Climate change will have strong effects on denitrification. Increasing temperatures favour denitrification and changes in precipitation and discharge will alter the availability of N, with strong differences between river basins. We combine a 3D-ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea with economic marginal cost functions for three major Baltic river basins: Odra, Vistula and Neva. Objective is to calculate the monetary consequences of climate change (scenario A1B) for the implementation of water quality objectives, taking into account both, spatial changes in N loads and denitrification. In all regions over 90% of the entering N loads are subject to denitrification mainly in coastal waters. For the climate change scenario (A1B), our approach suggests reduced riverine N-loads of 7690 t/a (Odra), 6410 t/a (Vistula) and increased loads of 3200 t/a for the Neva. At the same time our model results suggest an increased denitrification of N-loads by 9.1% (Odra) and 9.9% (Neva) and minor changes with respect to the Vistula loads. In combination, in all three regions climate change helps to reach policy targets (lower N concentrations in the sea) at lower costs. The monetary benefit of load reduction measures that do not have to be implemented because of climate change are 11,270 million (sic)/a (Odra), 2000 million (sic)/a (Vistula) and 92 million (sic)/a (Neva). The valuations strongly depend on the assumed climate change scenario and the economic approach, but indicate that climate change effects differ much between river basins and should be taken into account in nutrient load reduction management plans.","[Allin, Alexander; Schernewski, Gerald; Friedland, Rene; Neumann, Thomas; Radtke, Hagen] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res IOW, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Schernewski, Gerald] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, H Manto 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania",Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Klaipeda University,"Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res IOW, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.;Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, H Manto 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",gerald.schernewski@io-warnemuende.de,"Neumann, Thomas/E-5476-2012; Friedland, Rene/AFK-5229-2022","Neumann, Thomas/0000-0002-5653-906X; Friedland, Rene/0000-0002-3690-666X; Schernewski, Gerald/0000-0002-4036-7646","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within project SECOS [03F0666A]; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within project MOSSCO [03F0367B]; BONUS BaltCoast project; BONUS (Art 185); European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea national funding institutions [BMBF 03F0717A]","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within project SECOS; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within project MOSSCO; BONUS BaltCoast project; BONUS (Art 185); European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea national funding institutions","The work has been supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within the projects SECOS (03F0666A) and MOSSCO (03F0367B).

To date, sources of predictability have not been sufficiently investigated at the seasonal scale in this region. To fill this gap, we explore sources of predictability using a weather regimes (WRs) framework. The role of WRs in influencing regional weather patterns in the climate state has generated interest in assessing the ability of climate models to reproduce them. We identify four Mediterranean WRs for the winter (DJF) season and explore their sources of predictability looking at teleconnections with sea surface temperature (SST). In particular, we assess how SST anomalies affect the WRs frequencies during winter focussing on the two WRs that are associated with the teleconnections in which the signal is more intense: the Meridional and the Anticyclonic regimes. These sources of predictability are sought in five state-of-the-art seasonal forecasting systems included in the Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) suite finding a weaker signal but an overall good agreement with reanalysis data. Finally, we assess the ability of the C3S models in reproducing the reanalysis data WRs frequencies finding that their moderate skill increases during ENSO intense years, indicating that this teleconnection is well reproduced by the models and yields improved predictability in the Mediterranean region.","[Giuntoli, Ignazio; Fabiano, Federico; Corti, Susanna] CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Giuntoli, Ignazio] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Birmingham,"Giuntoli, I (corresponding author), CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy.;Giuntoli, I (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",i.giuntoli@isac.cnr.it,"Corti, Susanna/AAG-7262-2021","Corti, Susanna/0000-0003-4456-6682; GIUNTOLI, Ignazio/0000-0001-8700-7026; Fabiano, Federico/0000-0002-2135-3978",Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union [ERA4CS-MEDSCOPE];  [690462],Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union; ,"We acknowledge financial support from the ERA4CS-MEDSCOPE Project, co-funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union (Grant agreement 690462).

We have seen and studied sites normally much visited and damaged, which are almost the only representatives of the Upper Palaeolithic of Meseta. During this period, we do not find in this area any dwelling sites or remains of industries. On this large surface only 8 decorated caves have been discovered, located about 1000 meters height on the margins of mountainous great systems. In these caves horses and stags prevail. Bovines are more rare and the representatives of the genuinely cold fauna as it were missing ; except an hypothetical mammoth and a woolly rhinoceros. These facts with others are specific to the Meseta where the current climate is hard and was certainly much severe in the past ; thus the fauna appears rather unaffected by the environment conditions. Also in this work, we present the settlements of Palaeolithic Art in the open-air sites. They consist in slate engravings.

Scholars describe this framing process as climatization. In our research, we conduct a qualitative content analysis of sector journal articles to investigate the climatization of drought within the three most affected policy fields in Germany: agriculture, water management, and forestry. The research objectives are to investigate how climatization processes evolve and take place within a specific policy field, and what different modes of climatization can be identified. The results are based on a framing analysis of 267 articles from journals published by political associations of farmers, water managers, and foresters at both the national and a state level, covering drought problematization relating to two major drought events in 2003 and 2011-2012. The article shows that four modes of climatization can be distinguished: scientification, securitization, technocratization, and transformation. With this empirically based heuristic, we contribute to advancing the concept of climatization by operationalizing it into a more profound, empirically grounded analytical concept that can be applied to critically investigate policymaking processes related to reducing disaster risks and achieving climate adaptation.","[Mueller, Wibke; Kruse, Sylvia] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Muller, W (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",wibke.mueller@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,"Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014","Muller, Wibke/0000-0002-5656-0408","Ministry of Science, Research, and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg","Ministry of Science, Research, and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg","Ministry of Science, Research, and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg",,51,0,0,6,14,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

In Santa Croce, the pulpit is a permanent preaching pulpit used for the seasonal cycles of Advent and Lent; it was specifically intended as a platform for popular preaching to the laity. Located in the lower nave, rather than near the altar, it is not a freestanding structure but part of the pier. The pulpit is examined in terms of its sources (visual and especially textual), its physical context within the church, its historical and cultural context (in particular as related to the sermons of San Bernardino and his followers), and the political and religious climate after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. The Franciscan cycle of this pulpit is associated with the veneration of Saint Francis in the 15(th) century, the conception of Francis as alter Christus, and crusade ideology.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Debby, NBA (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",,"Debby Ben Aryeh NiritDebby, NIRIT/F-1482-2012","Ben-Aryeh Debby, Nirit/0000-0003-1791-491X",,,,,95,4,5,0,0,IRSA PUBLISHING HOUSE,KRAKOW,"PLAC MATEJKI 7-8, KRAKOW, 31-157, POLAND",0391-9064,,,ARTIBUS HIST,Artibus Hist.,,2008,57,,,,75,+,,,,,,21,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,V11WQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000207562100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, Central Europe, including the Czech Republic, recently experienced a series of drought events with substantial impacts, especially on crop production. Because agriculture systems, and vegetation in general, have adapted to evenly distributed precipitation, the region is susceptible to even short-term droughts. The recent drought events may be the result of multi-decadal climate variability or a more general trend, with some studies showing a link to a more frequent occurrence of atmospheric circulation patterns that are conducive to drought. This study introduces an innovation to the standard methodological approaches in evaluating drought climatology by analysing soil moisture conditions over more than 50 years. This approach relies on state-of-the-art observed weather data and state-of-the-art soil moisture model data, and focuses on the dynamic simulation of soil moisture content with high temporal (daily) and spatial (500 m) resolution in a diverse landscape. Statistically significant trends of decreasing soil moisture content were found, notably during May and June between 1961 and 2012. In contrast, trends towards higher soil moisture content were noted during the October-March time period. When the periods of 2001-2012 and 1961-1980 were compared, the probability of drought between April and June was found to increase by 50%. This indicates a loading of the climate dice' towards drier conditions. The probability of extreme drought events has also been found to increase. These results support concerns about the potentially increased severity of drought events in Central Europe under projected climate change.","[Trnka, M.; Mozny, M.; Balek, J.; Hlavinka, P.; Zalud, Z.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Trnka, M.; Brazdil, R.; Stepanek, P.; Dobrovolny, P.; Zahradnicek, P.; Semeradova, D.; Dubrovsky, M.; Hlavinka, P.; Eitzinger, J.; Zalud, Z.] Global Change Res Ctr, Inst Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Brazdil, R.; Dobrovolny, P.] Masaryk Univ, Inst Geog, Brno, Czech Republic; [Mozny, M.] Czech Hydrometeorol Inst, Agrometeorol Observ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Stepanek, P.; Zahradnicek, P.] Reg Off Brno, Czech Hydrometeorol Inst, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dubrovsky, M.] Inst Atmospher Phys, Dept Climatol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Eitzinger, J.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol, Vienna, Austria; [Wardlow, B.] Univ Nebraska, Ctr Adv Land Management & Informat Technol, Lincoln, NE USA; [Svoboda, M.; Hayesi, M.] Univ Nebraska, Natl Drought Mitigat Ctr, Lincoln, NE USA","Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno; Czech Hydrometeorological Institute; Czech Hydrometeorological Institute; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln","Trnka, M (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Inst Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",mirek_trnka@yahoo.com,"Hlavinka, Petr/G-3661-2014; Dobrovolny, Petr/F-7722-2013; Dubrovsky, Martin/G-4526-2014; Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Semerádová, Daniela/H-4094-2013; Balek, Jan/AAG-1996-2021; Eitzinger, Josef/E-2150-2015; Zahradníček, Pavel/G-9447-2014; Stepanek, Petr/G-1614-2014; Zalud, Zdenek/G-3203-2014; Brazdil, Rudolf/H-3156-2014","Hlavinka, Petr/0000-0002-5604-5502; Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379; Semerádová, Daniela/0000-0002-2699-7924; Balek, Jan/0000-0002-2753-3777; Stepanek, Petr/0000-0001-8956-5590; Zalud, Zdenek/0000-0003-1882-9901; Wardlow, Brian/0000-0002-4767-581X","Project 'Establishment of International Scientific Team Focused on Drought Research' [OP VK CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0248]; project 'Partnership in Climate Research and Adaptation Strategies' [CZ.1.07/2.4.00/31.0056]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P209/11/0956, 13-04291S/P209]; National Agency for Agricultural Research [QI91C054]; Project KONTAKT [LH110010]",Project 'Establishment of International Scientific Team Focused on Drought Research'; project 'Partnership in Climate Research and Adaptation Strategies'; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); National Agency for Agricultural Research; Project KONTAKT,"Projects 'Establishment of International Scientific Team Focused on Drought Research' (no.

Both species are modulated by transport processes. Chemical and microphysical processes affect them differently. Thus, representing the different processes and their interactions is a challenging task for dynamical cores, chemical modules and microphysical parameterisations of state-of-the-art atmospheric model components. To test and improve the models, high-resolution measurements of the UT-LMS are required. Here, we use measurements taken in a flight of the GLORIA (Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere) instrument on HALO (High Altitude and LOng Range Research Aircraft). The German research aircraft HALO performed a research flight on 26 February 2016 that covered deeply subsided air masses of the aged 2015/16 Arctic vortex, high-latitude LMS air masses, a highly textured region affected by troposphere-to-stratosphere exchange and high-altitude cirrus clouds. Therefore, it provides a challenging multifaceted case study for comparing GLORIA observations with state-of-the-art atmospheric model simulations in a complex UT-LMS region at a late stage of the Arctic winter 2015/16. Using GLORIA observations in this manifold scenario, we test the ability of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) with the extension ART (Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) and the chemistry-climate model (CCM) EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry - fifth-generation European Centre Hamburg general circulation model/Modular Earth Submodel System) to model the UT-LMS composition of water vapour (H2O), ozone (O-3), nitric acid (HNO3) and clouds. Within the scales resolved by the respective model, we find good overall agreement of both models with GLORIA. The applied high-resolution ICON-ART set-up involving an R2B7 nest (local grid refinement with a horizontal resolution of about 20 km), covering the HALO flight region, reproduces mesoscale dynamical structures well. Narrow moist filaments in the LMS observed by GLORIA at tropopause gradients in the context of a Rossby wave breaking event and in the vicinity of an occluded Icelandic low are clearly reproduced by the model. Using ICON-ART, we show that a larger filament in the west was transported horizontally into the Arctic LMS in connection with a jet stream split associated with poleward breaking of a cyclonically sheared Rossby wave. Further weaker filaments are associated with an older tropopause fold in the east. Given the lower resolution (T106) of the nudged simulation of the EMAC model, we find that this model also reproduces these features well. Overall, trace gas mixing ratios simulated by both models are in a realistic range, and major cloud systems observed by GLORIA are mostly reproduced. However, we find both models to be affected by a well-known systematic moist bias in the LMS. Further biases are diagnosed in the ICON-ART O-3, EMAC H2O and EMAC HNO3 distributions. Finally, we use sensitivity simulations to investigate (i) short-term cirrus cloud impacts on the H2O distribution (ICON-ART), (ii) the overall impact of polar winter chemistry and microphysical processing on O-3 and HNO3 (ICON-ART and EMAC), (iii) the impact of the model resolution on simulated parameters (EMAC), and (iv) consequences of scavenging processes by cloud particles (EMAC). We find that changing the horizontal model resolution results in notable systematic changes for all species in the LMS, while scavenging processes play a role only in the case of HNO3. We discuss the model biases and deficits found in this case study that potentially affect forecasts and projections (adversely) and provide suggestions for further model improvements.","[Haenel, Florian; Woiwode, Wolfgang; Friedl-Vallon, Felix; Hopfner, Michael; Johansson, Soren; Khosrawi, Farahnaz; Kleinert, Anne; Oelhaf, Hermann; Orphal, Johannes; Ruhnke, Roland; Sinnhuber, Bjorn-Martin; Weimer, Michael; Braesicke, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Buchmuller, Jennifer; Kirner, Oliver; Weimer, Michael] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ungermann, Jorn] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Stratosphere IEK 7, Julich, Germany; [Weimer, Michael] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Haenel, F (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",florian.haenel@kit.edu,"Höpfner, Michael/A-7255-2013; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016; Ruhnke, Roland/J-8800-2012; 1294, HALO SPP/AAA-7658-2021; Kirner, Oliver/K-8815-2015; Sinnhuber, Bjorn-Martin/A-7007-2013","Höpfner, Michael/0000-0002-4174-9531; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Ruhnke, Roland/0000-0002-0353-1603; Ungermann, Jorn/0000-0001-9095-8332; Johansson, Soren/0000-0002-9642-1955; Friedl-Vallon, Felix/0000-0003-2016-2800; Kirner, Oliver/0000-0001-5668-6177; Khosrawi, Farahnaz/0000-0002-0261-7253; Sinnhuber, Bjorn-Martin/0000-0001-9608-7320","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SPP 1294, 316735585 (WO 2160/1-1)]; Helmholtz Association [ZT-0003]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),"This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), DFG Priority Programme SPP 1294, within the DFG project no. 316735585 (WO 2160/1-1), and by the Helmholtz Association within the project Advanced Earth System Modelling Capacity (ESM) with project no.

Some of these methods are as follows: solar orientation of the functional spaces in the buildings; functioning of the complex system of the air circulation between the wind-catcher, fountain, and interior spaces; designing special spaces for different seasons around the inner courtyard in private houses; creating special spaces for different seasons (for example, colonnade, garden, underground gardens, cellar); smart light control systems in openings.

In the absence of excavated faunal remains, many species that were present in the Levant and North Africa have been assumed to have been absent on the Arabian Peninsula. Here, we explore representations of four species that were identifiable in the rock art, but had not previously been reported in north-western Arabia. Location: Jubbah and Shuwaymis UNESCO world heritage rock art sites in Ha'il province, north-western Saudi Arabia. Methods: In total, the rock art panels surveyed and recorded in Jubbah and Shuwaymis contain 6,618 individual animal depictions. Species were identified based on diagnostic features of the anatomy. The resulting dataset was then compared to the faunal spectrum reported in the (archaeo) zoological literature. Results: The rock art dataset provides evidence that the distributions of lesser kudu (Tragelaphus imberbis), wild camel and African wild ass (Equus africanus) extended into the north-west of Arabia and that the engravers may have had knowledge of aurochs (Bos primigenius). Main conclusions: The presence of previously undocumented mammal species in Arabia provides new information regarding their distribution, as well as the types of habitat and vegetation that were available in prehistoric landscapes. Moreover, the presence of kudu on the Arabian Peninsula indicates that the identification of palaeo-distributions based exclusively on faunal remains may miss key species in the Afro-Eurasian faunal exchange.","[Guagnin, Maria; Ott, Florian; Petraglia, Michael D.] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany; [Guagnin, Maria] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England; [Shipton, Ceri] Univ Cambridge, McDonald Inst Archaeol Res, Cambridge, England; [Shipton, Ceri] British Inst Eastern Africa, Nairobi, Kenya; [el-Dossary, Sarah; Alsharekh, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Dept Archaeol, Coll Tourism & Archaeol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [al-Rashid, Moudhy] Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford, England; [Moussa, Fares] Univ Edinburgh, Old Med Sch, Archaeol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Stewart, Mathew] Univ New South Wales, Palaeontol Geobiol & Earth Arch Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Cambridge; King Saud University; University of Oxford; University of Edinburgh; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Guagnin, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany.",guagnin@shh.mpg.de,"Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021; Alsharekh, Abdullah M/AAH-3718-2019","Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727; Guagnin, Maria/0000-0002-7995-8611",European Research Council [295719]; Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage; Max Planck Society,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage; Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX),"FP7 Ideas: European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 295719; Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage; Max Planck Society",,67,17,17,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In addition to the mean climatological fields, we examine in detail the middle atmospheric momentum budget as well as several lower and upper atmosphere coupling phenomena including stratospheric sudden warmings, the 2-day wave, and the migrating diurnal tide. We find that in large part, differences between WACCM3 and observations and the mean state of the model at various horizontal resolutions are related to gravity wave drag, which is parameterized in WACCM3 (and similar models).

We derive an oblique stereographic projection and its inverse, which holds for any area at the Earth's surface, and which can be combined with two different interpolation methods. The first one is suited to interpolate the projected fields of a coarse GCM grid on a fine meshed IM grid. The second one is appropriate for the opposite case. Both grids are allowed to be arbitrary and irregularly spaced. Therefore the OBLIMAP technique is suitable for any GCM-IM combination. After a first scan of the GCM grid coordinates and the specification of the IM grid, fast mapping of various fields is possible. To and fro (GCM-IM-GCM) mapping tests with the Climate Community System Model (CCSM) at T42 resolution (similar to 313 km) and the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) at similar to 11 km and similar to 55 km, show average temperature differences of less than 0.1 K with small standard deviations. OBLIMAP, available at GMD, is an accurate, robust and well-documented mapping method for coupling an IM with a GCM or to map state of the art initial and forcing fields available at geographical coordinates to any local IM grid with an optimal centered oblique projection. Currently, the oblique stereographic and the oblique Lambert azimuthal equal-area projections for both the sphere and the ellipsoid are implemented in OBLIMAP.","[Reerink, T. J.; Kliphuis, M.

It has become painfully obvious that such protections no longer exist. Artists, like everyone else, are vulnerable to the inconsistencies, misunderstandings and deliberate legal manipulations of language and the interpretation of images, especially anything having to do with sex. Everyone from artists to institutions of higher learning and the art world (museums, galleries, public and private granting agencies) now engage in a process of self-censorship to avoid the incongruous logic of a corrupt and conservative political system. In this essay the author addresses the changing social climate and the impact it has had on the now heretical and somehow unpatriotic notion of the freedom of speech.

For example, large parts of the Southern Ocean, despite rapidly rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, depicted a surface cooling since the 1970s, whereas most of the planet has warmed considerably. In contrast, climate models generally simulate Southern Ocean surface warming when driven with observed historical radiative forcing. The mechanisms behind the surface cooling and other prominent changes in the Southern Ocean sector climate during the recent decades, such as expanding sea ice extent, abyssal warming, and CO2 uptake, are still under debate. Observational coverage is sparse, and records are short but rapidly growing, making the Southern Ocean climate system one of the least explored. It is thus difficult to separate current trends from underlying decadal to centennial scale variability. Here, we present the state of the discussion about some of the most perplexing decadal climate trends in the Southern Ocean during the recent decades along with possible mechanisms and contrast these with an internal mode of Southern Ocean variability present in state-of-the art climate models.","[Latif, Mojib; Martin, Torge; Reintges, Annika; Park, Wonsun] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Latif, Mojib] Ctr Excellence Future Ocean, Kiel, Germany",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel,"Latif, M (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.;Latif, M (corresponding author), Ctr Excellence Future Ocean, Kiel, Germany.",mlatif@geomar.de,"Martin, Torge/H-2613-2017; Park, Wonsun/J-8097-2012","Martin, Torge/0000-0002-0882-8780; Park, Wonsun/0000-0002-6345-8428; Reintges, Annika/0000-0003-0003-3200","CLIMPRE InterDec project - Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Germany [01LP1609B]; PALMOD project - Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Germany [01LP1503D]","CLIMPRE InterDec project - Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Germany; PALMOD project - Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Germany","We thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their very helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Like other strands of the style, especially in Spain, Germany and parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire, art nouveau in eastern France has been linked to long-standing regionalist sentiments that resisted centralised Parisian control over local affairs typical in nineteenth-century France. This article examines the evolving bank architecture in central Nancy, a major facet of the introduction of art nouveau in its urban environment, to show that the construction of the city's modern character was a negotiated process that involved careful planning among financial institutions, architects and decorative artists. The design and erection of modern banks in Nancy in the first decade of the twentieth century balanced generalised architectural principles emanating from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris with the employment of highly symbolic regional naturalist motifs and architectural elements.

This article explores the experiences of students during transition onto an Integrated Foundation Year in Art and Design Year (IFYAD) at one UK Higher Education Institution. The qualitative data used was gleaned from an analysis of student digital stories and has been used to inform course and module enhancements. Three research questions are outlined: Is digital storytelling an effective medium for student reflection? In what ways is the experience of IFYAD students unique? and What does an effective pedagogy for IFYAD need to consider? The research found that IFYAD students had a range of complex and diverse experiences pre-HE and during transition. It also found that digital storytelling provided an effective medium for students to convey these experiences, many of which were previously unknown to the course team. The discussion centres around a creative transition pedagogy which adapts the notion of 'transitions as becoming' to provide effective support for these students. The inherent value of this provision and the subject area for student identity, personal development and wellbeing leads the authors to champion the importance of the Foundation Year and encourage continued investment in this challenging higher education climate.","[Austen, Liz; Pickering, Nathaniel] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Directorate Student Engagement Evaluat & Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Judge, Marie] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Art & Design, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Sheffield Hallam University; Sheffield Hallam University,"Austen, L (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Directorate Student Engagement Evaluat & Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",l.austen@shu.ac.uk,,"Austen, Liz/0000-0002-2837-8297; Pickering, Nathaniel/0000-0002-9025-6426",,,,,34,6,6,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0309-877X,1469-9486,,J FURTH HIGHER EDUC,J.

For that reason, we discuss the age, preservation, and palaeoenvironmental context of petroglyphs discovered on the flat, almost vertical face of a large boulder fallen along the western slope of Jabal Hammah, a rocky hill that borders the oasis of Salut (northern Sultanate of Oman). Geoarchaeological investigation highlighted that, in the region, the preservation of petroglyphs is due to the interplay of two contrasting weathering processes. On one hand, karst dissolution - even if it is a very slow process in arid and semi-arid lands - gradually levels the surface of boulders. On the other hand, a biomineralized Mn- and Fe-rich rock varnish has developed inside the grooves of the engravings, thus sheltering them from extreme dissolution and promoting the preservation of the pristine shape of the representations. Moreover, organics trapped within the rock varnish have been radiocarbon dated to 2600 +/- 60 uncal. years BP. This result allows establishing a limit ante quem for the production of these specific engravings and to root it to the Bronze or Iron Age exploitation of the area. This result is of particular relevance in a region where well-dated rock art is virtually absent. Today, the biogeochemical processes leading to the formation of the protective crust are almost inactive, and not consistent with the present dry environmental settings. Their occurrence is in accordance with other local palaeoclimatic record, and suggests Bronze and Iron Age climatic conditions wetter than today. A broader implication of our work is that it shows how a multidisciplinary approach to the study of rock art provides the opportunity of understanding the age of rock art and its paleoenvironmental significance. We demonstrate that physical, chemical, and biological weathering processes are in charge of the preservation and/or destruction of rock art; such processes have to be seriously taken into account in projects of rock art field assessment.","[Zerboni, Andrea; Wu, Ying-Li; Brandolini, Filippo; Mariani, Guido S.; Lotti, Paolo; Gatta, G.

Spatial and temporal variations of past vegetation can be traced by fossil pollen data mapping. In this paper, we synthesized 57 continuous pollen records on the QTP covering the past 15 kyr to depict large-scale vegetation change and its response to climate variations. In order to minimize potential chronological biases, age-depth models were revised using a state-of-the-art and consistent method for all the records. The spatial and temporal variation of major pollen taxa were examined based on interpolated pollen maps at 1000-year intervals. The arboreal pollen (AP, mainly of Pinus, Betula and Abies/Picea) content expressed significant climate signals over a broad spatial and temporal gradient. During the late glacial period, high proportions of AP widely occurred in regions that are presently unforested owing to the sparse local vegetation coverage. For the Holocene period, AP showed relatively high contributions in records from the southeastern margin of the QTP, with a decreasing gradient in abundance towards the northwest. The transportation of AP to unforested regions corresponds closely to the intensity of monsoon wind, which can be used to track the Holocene evolution of the summer monsoon. The dominant shrub and herbaceous taxa (including Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Ephedra) generally represent developments of local vegetation responding to climate variations. In addition, the persistent increase in Poaceae pollen during the mid to late Holocene correlates possibly to regional human activities. The inferred spatial and temporal patterns of major pollen types on the QTP provide significant knowledge about long-term vegetation change and its potential response to climate variations.","[Li, Zhen; Wang, Yongbo] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Herzschuh, Ulrike] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Res Unit Potsdam, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Herzschuh, Ulrike] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Herzschuh, Ulrike] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Cao, Xianyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Alpine Paleoecol & Human Adaptat Grp ALPHA, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xianyong] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ni, Jian] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Capital Normal University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Potsdam; University of Potsdam; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Zhejiang Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wang, YB (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",yongbowang@cnu.edu.cn,"Zhao, Yan/B-1785-2014","Zhao, Yan/0000-0003-1693-9795; Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877282, 41861134030]; Capital Normal University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Capital Normal University,"We thank Dr. Xiaozhong Huang, Dr. Yun Zhang, Dr. Yunfa Miao, Dr. Bo Cheng, Dr. Enlou Zhang, Dr. Zhenyu Ni, and other palynologists for providing the original fossil pollen data.

This holds true for all types of historic artefacts, and even for art made of modern materials, in public buildings, museums and private art collections. The variety of biodeterioration phenomena observed on materials of cultural heritage is determined by several factors, such as the chemical composition and nature of the material itself, the climate and exposure of the object, in addition to the manner and frequency of surface cleaning and housekeeping in museums. This study offers a review of a variety of well-known biodeterioration phenomena observed on different materials, such as stone and building materials, objects exhibited in museums and libraries, as well as human remains and burial-related materials. The decontamination of infected artefacts, exhibition rooms and depots incurs high expenditure for museums. Nevertheless, the question has to be raised: whether the process of biodeterioration of cultural heritage can or should be stopped under all circumstances, or whether we have to accept it as a natural and an implicit consecution of its creation. This study also highlights critically the pros and cons of biocide treatments and gives some prominent examples of successful and unsuccessful conservation treatments. Furthermore, an outlook on the future research needs and developments in this highly interesting field is given.","[Sterflinger, Katja; Pinar, Guadalupe] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Biotechnol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Sterflinger, K (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Biotechnol, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",Katja.Sterflinger@boku.ac.at,"Pinar, Guadalupe/I-8959-2016","Pinar, Guadalupe/0000-0001-7881-8572; Sterflinger, Katja/0000-0002-0296-6728",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [V194-B20]; VIBT EQ GmbH; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [V 194] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); VIBT EQ GmbH; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),G.

This is at odds with state-of-the-art climate models, which typically simulate a receding Antarctic sea ice cover in response to increasing greenhouse forcing. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this discrepancy between models and observations occurs due to simulation biases in the sea ice drift velocity. As a control we use the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble, which has 40 realizations of past and future climate change that all undergo Antarctic sea ice retreat during recent decades. We modify CESM to replace the simulated sea ice velocity field with a satellite-derived estimate of the observed sea ice motion, and we simulate 3 realizations of recent climate change. We find that the Antarctic sea ice expands in all 3 of these realizations, with the simulated spatial structure of the expansion bearing resemblance to observations. The results suggest that the reason CESM has failed to capture the observed Antarctic sea ice expansion is due to simulation biases in the sea ice drift velocity, implying that an improved representation of sea ice motion is crucial for more accurate sea ice projections. Climate models typically fail to capture the observed Antarctic sea ice expansion during recent decades. Here, the authors show that the observed expansion is reproduced in a climate model after removing biases in the sea ice drift velocity.","[Sun, Shantong; Eisenman, Ian] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sun, Shantong] CALTECH, Environm Sci & Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; California Institute of Technology,"Sun, ST; Eisenman, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Sun, ST (corresponding author), CALTECH, Environm Sci & Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",shantong@caltech.edu; eisenman@ucsd.edu,"Sun, Shantong/AAL-8285-2021","Sun, Shantong/0000-0002-6932-5589; Eisenman, Ian/0000-0003-0190-2869",National Science Foundation [OPP-1643445],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Without implying their endorsement, we thank Ed Blanchard-Wrigglesworth, Till J.W.

We explore the mechanisms in which CCKWs modulate the propagation of precipitation from west to east over equatorial Africa. We examine a multiyear state-of-the-art Africa-wide climate simulation from a convection-permitting model (CP4A) along with a parameterized global driving-model simulation (G25) and evaluate both against observations (TRMM) and ERA-Interim (ERA-I), with a focus on precipitation and Kelvin wave activity. We show that the two important related processes through which CCKWs influence the propagation of convection and precipitation from west to east across equatorial Africa are 1) low-level westerly wind anomalies that lead to increased low-level convergence, and 2) westerly moisture flux anomalies that amplify the lower- to midtropospheric specific humidity. We identify Kelvin wave activity using zonal wind and geopotential height. Using lagged composite analysis, we show that modeled precipitation over equatorial Africa can capture the eastward-propagating precipitation signal that is associated with CCKWs. Composite analysis on strong (high-amplitude) CCKWs shows that both CP4A and G25 capture the connection between the eastward-propagating precipitation anomalies and CCKWs. In comparison to TRMM, however, the precipitation signal is weaker in G25, while CP4A has a more realistic signal. Results show that both CP4A and G25 generally simulate the key horizontal structure of CCKWs, with anomalous low-level westerlies in phase with positive precipitation anomalies.

We examined such linkage by seasons using state-of-the-art atmosphere and ocean/sea-ice reanalyses. The associated SAM related anomaly (SRA) fields of the climate variables, denoting anomalies corresponding to the same variation in SAM, are overall consistent across the reanalyses. Among the atmospheric products, 20CRV2 differs from ERA-interim and CFSR in the sea-level pressure SRAs over the Amundsen Sea, resulting in less warming over the Antarctic Peninsula. Among the ocean reanalyses, ORAP5 and C-GLORS exhibit the largest consistency. The major difference between them and the lower-resolution CFSR and SODA reanalyses is deeper penetration of anomalous meridional currents. Compared to the other ocean reanalyses, CFSR exhibits stronger and spatially more coherent surface-current SRAs, resulting in greater SRAs of sea-ice motion and ice thickness along the ice edges. The SRAs of sensible and total surface heat fluxes are reduced in CFSR due to ocean-atmosphere coupling. Significant sea-ice concentration SRAs are present on the west side of peninsulas along the east Antarctica coast in spring and winter, most notably in ORAP5 and C-GLORS, implying changes in new-ice production and shelf-water formation. Most atmosphere and ocean variables manifest an annular SRA pattern in summer and a non-annular pattern in the other seasons, with a wavenumber-3 structure strongest in autumn and weakest in summer. The wavenumber-3 structure should be related to the zonal wave three pattern of the SH circulation, the relation of which to SAM needs further exploration.","[Zhang, Zhaoru; Liu, Hailong; Zhong, Yisen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Oceanog, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Uotila, Petteri; Vihma, Timo] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Stoessel, Achim] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Zhang, ZR (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Oceanog, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",zrzhang@sjtu.edu.cn,"Vihma, Timo/ABC-9771-2020; Uotila, Petteri/A-1703-2012; Liu, Hailong/I-3869-2013","Uotila, Petteri/0000-0002-2939-7561; Liu, Hailong/0000-0001-8335-7272","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41406006]; Shanghai Sailling Program [15FY1406400]; Academy of Finland [263918, 264358]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) program; Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailling Program; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41406006).

Anthropogenic induced changes to climate, habitat, disease, species distributions, poaching, and unsustainable trade have accelerated extinction rates in all vertebrates, including reptiles. Preventing reptile extinctions will require humans to acknowledge these losses and develop ex situ and in situ plans to preserve them. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are management tools used to protect numerous vertebrate taxa; however, progress in developing ART for reptiles has lagged. Creating functional and sustainable reptile ART will strengthen our conservation capacity by capturing genetic material from select individuals to overcome natural or manmade boundaries. Utilising short-term gamete storage and genome resource banking, in conjunction with timed artificial insemination (AI) or ex ovo incubation, could lead to profound advances in reptile conservation, mitigating the loss of reptile biodiversity. In this article, we review ART reptile research completed since the 1970s. Topics include AI, hormonal control of reproduction, gamete collection, gamete storage, and genome resource banking. Additionally, we review the potential application of advanced reproductive methodologies, including in vitro/ex ovo fertilisation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, cloning (somatic cell nuclear transfer), and genetic editing.","[Perry, Sean M.; Mitchell, Mark A.] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Vet Med, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Skip Bertman Dr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Perry, Sean M.] Mississippi Aquarium, 2100 E Beach Blvd, Gulfport, MS 39501 USA",Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Perry, SM (corresponding author), Mississippi Aquarium, 2100 E Beach Blvd, Gulfport, MS 39501 USA.",seanmperry87@gmail.com,,,,,,,142,3,3,5,12,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1031-3613,1448-5990,,REPROD FERT DEVELOP,Reprod.

They are natural or synthetic substances with the peculiarity of storing and releasing thermal energy through their phase change. In the building sector, they can help regulate the temperature of rooms in which they are used. This article focuses on research mainly devoted to evaluating their thermal performance at a macroscopic scale. It proposes a presentation of the different concepts related to the PCMs and details the different types of PCMs studied according to the type of climate. Their behaviour under these various climatic conditions is also detailed and analysed. It then appears that some choices are made arbitrarily but often inadequately. It is also shown that there is no universal PCM at the scale of a single habitat, or efficient in all parts of the world. Then, the essential parameters necessary for choosing the PCM are revisited based on the compilation of data from the different articles. The value of combining PCMs with different characteristics is detailed, as is the need to have the suitable PCM in the right place in a habitat, coupled or not with an active heating or cooling system. Moreover, the analysis of the distribution of the studies on PCMs shows that they are not evenly distributed worldwide. The countries most concerned by global warming are not the most active, but rather those interested in increasing the comfort of their homes and/or who can afford the costs related to the corresponding research. Nevertheless, the scientific community is encouraged to take a broader interest in PCMs, as their application potential is very real, whether to reduce countries' energy dependence or provide relevant technical and scientific assistance to developing countries.","[Liu, Lisa; Hammami, Nadia; Trovalet, Lionel; Bigot, Dimitri; Malet-Damour, Bruno] Univ Reunion Isl, PIMENT Lab, F-97430 Le Tampon, Ile De La Reuni, France; [Liu, Lisa; Habas, Jean-Pierre] Univ Montpellier, Inst Charles Gerhardt, ICGM, CNRS,ENSCM, F-34000 Montpellier, Herault, France",University of La Reunion; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole nationale superieure de chimie de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Malet-Damour, B (corresponding author), Univ Reunion Isl, PIMENT Lab, F-97430 Le Tampon, Ile De La Reuni, France.;Habas, JP (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Inst Charles Gerhardt, ICGM, CNRS,ENSCM, F-34000 Montpellier, Herault, France.",jean-pierre.habas@umontpellier.fr; bruno.malet-damour@univ-reunion.fr,,"Liu, Lisa/0000-0002-0339-4784; Malet-Damour, Bruno/0000-0001-8216-265X; Habas, Jean-Pierre/0000-0001-5395-6290",Region Reunion and Europe,Region Reunion and Europe,This work was carried out within the framework of the FEDER MCP-iBAT project funded by Region Reunion and Europe.

This study investigates the impact of the used algorithm on the changing signal, not the robustness of the climate change signal itself. Using one single transient AOGCM simulation as standard input for eleven state-of-the-art identification methods, the patterns of model simulated present day climatologies are found to be close to those computed from re-analysis, independent of the method applied. Although differences in the total number of cyclones identified exist, the climate change signals (IPCC SRES A1B) in the model run considered are largely similar between methods for all cyclones. Taking into account all tracks, decreasing numbers are found in the Mediterranean, the Arctic in the Barents and Greenland Seas, the mid-latitude Pacific and North America. Changing patterns are even more similar, if only the most severe systems are considered: the methods reveal a coherent statistically significant increase in frequency over the eastern North Atlantic and North Pacific. We found that the differences between the methods considered are largely due to the different role of weaker systems in the specific methods.","[Ulbrich, Uwe; Grieger, Jens; Schuster, Mareike] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Leckebusch, Gregor C.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Akperov, Mirseid; Mokhov, Igor I.] Russian Acad Sci, AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Bardin, Mikhail Yu.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow V71, Russia; [Bardin, Mikhail Yu.] Inst Global Climate & Ecol, Roshydromet, Russia; [Bardin, Mikhail Yu.] Russian Acad Sci, Moscow, Russia; [Feng, Yang; Wang, Xiaolan L.] Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gulev, Sergey; Rudeva, Irina; Tilinina, Natalia D.] Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Gulev, Sergey; Tilinina, Natalia D.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Inatsu, Masaru] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Keay, Kevin] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Keay, Kevin] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kew, Sarah F.] Wageningen Univ, Earth Syst Sci Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Liberato, Margarida L.

Attention is paid to the South Asian high (SAH), western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) and Indian low (IL) at the upper, middle and lower troposphere, respectively. A total of 31 state-of-the-art climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are used as examples for the analysis. Most models can basically simulate the three closed-circulation systems (CCSs), although there is a certain inter-model spread and an underestimation of their intensity. In terms of geographic location, models demonstrated the best performance for SAH and the poorest performance for WNPSH. The latter shows a generally south-westward shift compared to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis. Five atmospheric fields (zonal and meridional wind at 850 hPa, geopotential height at 500 and 100 hPa and sea level pressure) are inspected and generally well reproduced in models, with Taylor-S indices all larger than 0.84 for 90% of the models. The best performance is for the geopotential height of 500 hPa with an average Taylor-S index of 0.98. Models' skill in simulating the sea level pressure is the lowest. However, a significant positive correlation with models' resolution is observed. Almost all models underestimate the 100 hPa geopotential height over East Asia, mainly due to the common cold bias in the troposphere. As a whole, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, CESM1-CAM5 and NorESM1-M are identified as high-skill models for simulating the East Asian atmospheric circulation. High-skill models also show better simulation of precipitations in East China, with a 21.3% decrease of dry biases in Southeast China. The physical explanation for this linkage is also reported to reside in the central position of the WNPSH, which determines the quality of 850 hPa winds and water vapour transport in Southeast China.","[Zhao, Can; Sun, Xiaojuan; Li, Wei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Can; Jiang, Zhihong; Sun, Xiaojuan; Li, Wei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhihong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Laurent] Sorbonne Univ, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Ecole Polytech, Ecole Normale Super,CNRS, Paris, France",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Jiang, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhjiang@nuist.edu.cn,"Li, Laurent/X-3278-2019; Li, Wei/ABF-6887-2020","Li, Laurent/0000-0002-3855-3976; Li, Wei/0000-0003-3561-7345; ZHAO, Can/0000-0001-8960-8503","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0600402, 2017YFA0603804]; State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230528]; Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYLX_0843]; China Scholarship Council [201608320196]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2016YFA0600402, 2017YFA0603804; State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41230528; Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, Grant/Award Number: KYLX_0843; Visiting Fellowship from China Scholarship Council, Grant/Award Number: 201608320196",,61,11,12,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

However, key aspects of the spatially and temporally varying contributions of ocean dynamics to such variability remain unclear. Here, the authors quantify the contributions of ocean dynamical processes to mixed layer temperature variability on monthly to multiannual time scales across the globe. To do so, they use two complementary but distinct methods: 1) a method in which ocean heat transport is estimated directly from a state-of-the-art ocean state estimate spanning 1992-2015 and 2) a method in which it is estimated indirectly from observations between 1980-2017 and the energy budget of the mixed layer. The results extend previous studies by providing quantitative estimates of the role of ocean dynamics in mixed layer temperature variability throughout the globe, across a range of time scales, in a range of available measurements, and using two different methods. Consistent with previous studies, both methods indicate that the ocean-dynamical contribution to mixed layer temperature variance is largest over western boundary currents, their eastward extensions, and regions of equatorial upwelling. In contrast to previous studies, the results suggest that ocean dynamics reduce the variance of Northern Hemisphere mixed layer temperatures on time scales longer than a few years. Hence, in the global mean, the fractional contribution of ocean dynamics to mixed layer temperature variability decreases at increasingly low frequencies. Differences in the magnitude of the ocean dynamical contribution based on the two methods highlight the critical need for improved and continuous observations of the ocean mixed layer.","[Patrizio, Casey R.; Thompson, David W.

Space is used as a general term to help understand particular characteristics of the environment. However, the definition and perception of space varies and these variations have to be harmonised. For example, space may have diverse definitions and classification, the same environment may be abstracted/modelled by contradicting notions of space, which can lead to inconsistencies and misunderstandings. In this paper, we seek to investigate and document the state-of-the-art in the research of space regarding its definition, classification, modelling and utilization (2D/3D) in spatial sciences and urban applications. We focus on positioning, navigation, building micro-climate and thermal comfort, landscape, urban planning and design, urban heat island, interior design and planning, transportation and intelligent space. We review 147 research papers, technical reports and on-line resources. We compare the presented space concepts with respect to five criteria-classification, boundary, modelling components, use of standards and granularity. The review inventory is intended for both scientists and professionals in the spatial industry, such as companies, national mapping agencies and governments, and aim to provide a reference to better understand and employ the space while working across disciplines.","[Zlatanova, Sisi; Yan, Jinjin; Diakite, Abdoulaye; Barton, Jack] UNSW Built Environm, GRID, Red Ctr Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wang, Yijing] Southeast Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210000, Peoples R China; [Isikdag, Umit] Mimar Sinan Fine Arts Univ, Dept Informat, TR-34427 Istanbul, Turkey; [Sithole, George] GeoVariant, 332 Upper Eastside,Brickfied Rd, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",Southeast University - China; Mimar Sinan Guzel Sanatlar University,"Yan, JJ (corresponding author), UNSW Built Environm, GRID, Red Ctr Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.zlatanova@unsw.edu.au; jinjin.yan@unsw.edu.au; yijing.wang816@gmail.com; a.diakite@unsw.edu.au; uisikdag@gmail.com; georgesithole76@gmail.com; jack.barton@unsw.edu.au,"Barton, Jack/U-2438-2019; Yan, Jinjin/AAD-7606-2021; Isikdag, Umit/A-3306-2012; Zlatanova, Sisi/P-5503-2014","Barton, Jack/0000-0002-4483-5179; Yan, Jinjin/0000-0003-3140-3462; Isikdag, Umit/0000-0002-2660-0106; Zlatanova, Sisi/0000-0002-8766-0487; Diakite, Abdoulaye A./0000-0003-0119-6124; Wang, Yijing/0000-0002-5306-4994",,,,,154,21,21,11,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Currently available optimization techniques focus on either buildings or energy systems, mostly neglecting the impact of their interactions, which limits the renewable energy integration and robustness of the energy infrastructure; particularly in extreme weather conditions. To move beyond the current state-of-the-art, this study proposes a novel methodology to optimize urban energy systems as interconnected urban infrastructures affected by urban morphology. A set of urban morphologies representing twenty distinct neighborhoods is generated based on fifteen influencing parameters. The energy performance of each urban morphology is assessed and optimized for typical and extreme warm and cold weather datasets in three time periods from 2010 to 2039, 2040 to 2069, and 2070 to 2099 for Athens, Greece. Pareto optimization is conducted to generate an optimal energy system and urban morphology. The results show that a thus optimized urban morphology can reduce the levelized cost for energy infrastructure by up to 30%. The study reveals further that the current building form and urban density of the modelled neighborhoods will lead to an increase in the energy demand by 10% and 27% respectively. Furthermore, extreme climate conditions will increase energy demand by 20%, which will lead to an increment in the levelized cost of energy infrastructure by 40%. Finally, it is shown that co-optimization of both urban morphology and energy system will guarantee climate resilience of urban energy systems with a minimum investment.","[Perera, A. T.

Using monthly dataset of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) for the period 1971-2016, the impacts of four large-scale teleconnection patterns on the climate variability over Southwest Asia are investigated. The large-scale features include the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic (EA) teleconnection patterns, as well as western tropical Indian Ocean (WTIO) sea surface temperature anomaly index. Results indicate that ENSO and EA are the first leading modes that explain variation of Southwest Asian precipitation, with positive (negative) anomalies during El Nino (La Nina) and the negative (positive) phase of EA. Variation of Southwest Asian near-surface temperature is most strongly related to WTIO index, with above-average (below-average) temperature during the positive (negative) phase of WTIO index, although the negative (positive) phase of NAO also favours the above-average (below-average) temperature. On the other hand, temperature (precipitation) over Southwest Asia shows the least response to ENSO (WTIO). ENSO and EA individually explain 13 percent annual variance of precipitation, while WTIO index explains 36 percent annual variance of near-surface temperature over Southwest Asia. Analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) data indicated establishments of negative (positive) geopotential height anomalies in the middle troposphere over Southwest Asia during El Nino (La Nina) or the negative (positive) phase of NAO, EA and WTIO. The response of precipitation variability over Southwest Asia to NAO is opposite to that expected from the geopotential height anomalies, but the correlation between precipitation and NAO is not statistically significant. Due to predictability of large-scale teleconnections, results of this study are encouraging for improvement of the state-of-the-art seasonal prediction of the climate over Southwest Asia.","[Alizadeh-Choobari, O.; Adibi, P.] Univ Tehran, Inst Geophys, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Alizadeh-Choobari, O (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Inst Geophys, Tehran, Iran.",omid.alizadeh@ut.ac.ir,,"Alizadeh, Omid/0000-0003-4801-6338",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [96008302],Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)),This work has been financially supported by Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) under grant number 96008302.,,40,12,12,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0377-0265,1872-6879,,DYNAM ATMOS OCEANS,Dyn.

Gridded climate products are frequently used to describe climate patterns but have been shown to perform poorly over data-sparse regions such as tropical forests. Often, they are uncritically employed in a wide range of studies linking tropical forest processes to large-scale climate variability. Here, we conduct an inter-comparison and assessment of near-surface air temperature fields supplied by four state-of-the-art reanalysis products, along with precipitation estimates supplied by four merged satellite-gauge rainfall products. Firstly, spatio-temporal patterns of temperature and precipitation anomalies during the 2015-2016 El Nino are shown for each product to characterize the impact of the El Nino on the tropical forest biomes of Equatorial Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. Using meteorological station data, a two-stage assessment is then conducted to determine which products most reliably model tropical climates during the 2015-2016 El Nino, and which perform best over the longer-term satellite observation period (1980-2016). Results suggest that eastern Amazonia, parts of the Congo Basin and mainland Southeast Asia all experienced significant monthly mean temperature anomalies during the El Nino, while northeastern Amazonia, eastern Borneo and southern New Guinea experienced significant precipitation deficits.

Soil, together with its ecosystem, stores vast amounts of carbon; it is also the construction material most widely used for the built environment. The expected impacts of climate change, such as extreme wetting-drying cycles, pose an urgent need to understand the interplay between soil deformation, root growth, and water/solute uptake. The key to this challenge lies in the extension of unsaturated soil mechanics to incorporate bio-hydrological processes, such as root growth and water uptake. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge of root-zone mechanics and bio-hydrology. We identify the main knowledge gaps and suggest an integrated, bottom-to-top approach to develop a multidisciplinary understanding of soil-water-root interaction. We explain how emerging experimental and numerical methods can be used to study rooted soil under wetting-drying cycles. We focus on the biophysical processes at the scale of plant roots, soil particles and their interfaces, and discuss potential up-scaling to the continuum/field scale. An outlook on possible further research involves effects of temperature and microbial activities.","[Cheng, H.; Anselmucci, F. A.

First, regional climate simulations were performed with a new version of the limited-area model of the ARPEGE-IFS system running at 4-km resolution called ALARO coupled with the Town Energy Balance scheme (TEB). Then, to further downscale the regional climate projections to an urban scale, at 1 km resolution, a stand-alone surface scheme was employed in offline mode. Downscaling simulations of present and future urban climate of the Brussels areas are conducted. The downscaling strategy was first evaluated for a 10-years period [2001-2010] using ERA-INTERIM re-analysis data. In a next step, a downscaling simulation for the period 2046-2055 under the A1B scenario was performed. Results from our simulations indicate that while both urban and rural areas warm substantially for the 2050s horizon (1.5 degrees C), climate change will have a neutral impact on annual mean urban heat island (UHI) intensity. The most important increase is noted for the nocturnal UHI during the winter (+15 %) and the most important decrease is noted for the daytime UHI during the summer (-43 %). However, the model projects an increase of stable situations in the lower atmosphere during winter which may tend to keep pollutants concentrated over urban areas, with the associated health effects. Two approaches have been used to examine meteorological conditions that are unfavorable for the dispersion of air pollution under climate change conditions: (i) a transport index, based on the wind speed and Brunt-Vaisala frequency, that characterizes a typical length of horizontal and vertical transport, (ii) state-of-the-art chemistry transport models CHIMERE coupled to the 4 km regional climate simulations. The results from both approaches will be compared to assess future concentrations at the urban scale.","[Delcloo, A.

For operational daily forecasts of pollutant concentrations, usually long-term emission averages are used which may differ significantly from real values for a certain day, especially in big cities with intense and variable human activities. The online coupled atmospheric chemical transport model COSMO-ART was implemented for the Moscow region, Russia. A method for calculation of pollutant emissions for short-term forecasting was suggested. In this method, actual emissions for a certain day are obtained from measurements of air pollutant concentrations. It is assumed that the pollutant concentration reflects the spatially averaged intensity of emission sources. We used the observational data of pollutant concentrations from the network of the State Ecological Monitoring System of Moscow City. In order to get a more homogeneous field of data, virtual stations (so-called bogus data) were added within the areas not covered with observations. The proposed method allows a transformation of the hourly measurements of air pollutant concentration to emission values just after the measurements are completed. We showed the application of this method for carbon monoxide. Verification of COSMO-ART results demonstrates that the forecasts based on emissions calculated by the new method are better than the ones based on climate mean emissions. The approach suggested in the study provides a possibility to issue more detailed operational short-term forecasts of pollutant concentrations for megacities depending on the real air pollution of the previous day. The main limitation of this methodology is that it can be applied to the chemical species that have longer chemical life-time compared to the frequency of concentration measurements.","[Revokatova, Anastasia; Kirsanov, Alexander] Hydrometctr Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Kislov, Alexander; Surkova, Galina] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Rivin, Gdaly] Moscow State Lomonosov Univ, Hydrometctr Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Vogel, Bernhard; Vogel, Heike] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Revokatova, A (corresponding author), Hydrometctr Russia, Moscow, Russia.",revokatova@gmail.com; avkislov@mail.ru; galina_surkova@mail.ru; heu3becteh@mail.ru; gdaly.rivin@mail.ru; bernhard.vogel@kit.edu; heike.vogel@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Kirsanov, Alexander/AAN-7113-2020; Rivin, Gdaliy/AAN-3930-2020","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Surkova, Galina/0000-0001-6096-0749; Kirsanov, Alexander/0000-0001-6017-1977",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-05-00509]; Russian Science Foundation [16-17-10275],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"We thank the State Ecological Monitoring System of Moscow (Russia) for observations.

We focus on the region where warm water flows poleward (i.e., the Atlantic water pathway to the Arctic) and on interannualto-decadal time scales. Observational studies demonstrate predictability several years in advance in this region, but we find that SST skill is low with significant skill only at a lead time of 1-2 years. To better understand why the prediction systems have predictive skill or lack thereof, we assess the skill of the systems to reproduce a spatiotemporal SST pattern based on observations. The physical mechanism underlying this pattern is a propagation of oceanic anomalies from low to high latitudes along the major currents, the North Atlantic Current and the Norwegian Atlantic Current. We find that the prediction systems have difficulties in reproducing this pattern. To identify whether the misrepresentation is due to incorrect model physics, we assess the respective uninitialized historical simulations. These simulations also tend to misrepresent the spatiotemporal SST pattern, indicating that the physical mechanism is not properly simulated. However, the representation of the pattern is slightly degraded in the predictions compared to historical runs, which could be a result of initialization shocks and forecast drift effects. Ways to enhance predictions could include improved initialization and better simulation of poleward circulation of anomalies. This might require model resolutions in which flow over complex bathymetry and the physics of mesoscale ocean eddies and their interactions with the atmosphere are resolved.","[Langehaug, H.

Simple adaptation options such as shifts in sowing dates and adjustments of production intensity are considered. In addition, irrigation is evaluated as an adaptation strategy. It shows that the impact of climate change on yield levels is small but yield variability increases in rainfed production. Even though the adoption of irrigation leads to higher and less variable maize yields in the future, economic benefits of this adoption decision are expected to be rather small. Thus, no shift from the currently used rainfed system to irrigated production is expected in the future.

This paper addresses this gap by applying a decision analysis perspective to identify what kind of mean sea level rise (SLR) information is needed for local coastal adaptation decisions. We first characterize these decisions, then identify suitable decision analysis approaches and the sea level information required, and finally discuss if and how these information needs can be met given the state of the art of sea level science. We find that four types of information are needed: (i) probabilistic predictions for short-term decisions when users are uncertainty tolerant; (ii) high-end and low-end SLR scenarios chosen for different levels of uncertainty tolerance; (iii) upper bounds of SLR for users with a low uncertainty tolerance; and (iv) learning scenarios derived from estimating what knowledge will plausibly emerge about SLR over time. Probabilistic predictions can only be attained for the near term (i.e., 2030-2050) before SLR significantly diverges between low and high emission scenarios, for locations for which modes of climate variability are well understood and the vertical land movement contribution to local sea levels is small. Meaningful SLR upper bounds cannot be defined unambiguously from a physical perspective. Low- to high-end scenarios for different levels of uncertainty tolerance and learning scenarios can be produced, but this involves both expert and user judgments. The decision analysis procedure elaborated here can be applied to other types of climate information that are required for mitigation and adaptation purposes.","[Hinkel, Jochen; van der Pol, Thomas D.] GCF, Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Div Resource Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Workshop Inst Anal Social Ecol Syst WINS, Berlin, Germany; [Church, John A.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gregory, Jonathan M.] Univ Reading, NCAS, Reading, Berks, England; [Gregory, Jonathan M.; Lowe, Jason] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Lambert, Erwin; van de Wal, Roderik] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Le Cozannet, Goneri] French Geol Survey, BRGM, Orleans, France; [Lowe, Jason] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [McInnes, Kathleen L.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Aspendale, Vic, Australia; [Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Sch Engn, Southampton, Hants, England; [van de Wal, Roderik] Univ Utrecht, Geosci, Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of New South Wales Sydney; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Utrecht University; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); University of Leeds; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Southampton; Utrecht University,"Hinkel, J (corresponding author), GCF, Berlin, Germany.;Hinkel, J (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Div Resource Econ, Berlin, Germany.;Hinkel, J (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin Workshop Inst Anal Social Ecol Syst WINS, Berlin, Germany.",hinkel@globalclimateforum.org,"Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Gregory, Jonathan/J-2939-2016; Lambert, Erwin/AAJ-6730-2020; Church, John A/A-1541-2012; McInnes, Kathleen L/A-7787-2012; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Lowe, Jason/GQI-4036-2022; van de wal, roderik/D-1705-2011","Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Gregory, Jonathan/0000-0003-1296-8644; Lambert, Erwin/0000-0001-7537-6385; Church, John A/0000-0002-7037-8194; McInnes, Kathleen L/0000-0002-1810-7215; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; van de wal, roderik/0000-0003-2543-3892; Le Cozannet, Goneri/0000-0003-2421-3003; Hinkel, Jochen/0000-0001-7590-992X; van der Pol, Thomas/0000-0001-6095-5130; Lowe, Jason/0000-0002-8201-3926","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [642018, 776479]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of the Special Priority Program (SPP)-1889 Regional Sea Level Change and Society; project INSeaPTION as part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET; JPI Climate; BMBF; MINECO; NWO; ANR; European Union [690462]; NERC [ncas10014] Funding Source: UKRI","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of the Special Priority Program (SPP)-1889 Regional Sea Level Change and Society(German Research Foundation (DFG)); project INSeaPTION as part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET; JPI Climate; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); MINECO(Spanish Government); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Union(European Commission); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","J.

Engaging visual mediums, artist-activists rendered a black feminist politics through cultural and aesthetic productions. In so doing, artists recast extant representations of black social life, demanded inclusion within cultural institutions, and created black-oriented spaces for artistic engagement. In the contemporary global political climate of anti-blackness, artists craft socially engaged practices that creatively intervene in public space and the cultural institutional landscape. Through a critical analysis of Carrie Mae Weems' Operation: Activate, Simone Leigh's The Waiting Room, and LaToya Ruby Frazier's Flint is Family, this essay concerns recent interventions that mobilize an expansive approach to art combined with activism. The myriad practices of Weems, Leigh, and Frazier recompose sites of political engagement and empowerment that enact a broader praxis of reimagining social worlds. These projects belie the representational fixity on which art economies hinge, gesturing to material formations that elicit tactile modes of relation, and challenge the bounds of subjects and objects in the world.","[Pena, Mary] Univ Michigan, Anthropol & Museum Studies Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Pena, M (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Anthropol & Museum Studies Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",marypena@umich.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2451-3474,,,OPEN CULT STUD,Open Cult.

The study is focused on variability around the long-term trends, so that all anomalies are detrended prior to analysis; the period of study is 1979-2013. The model linkages are detected by applying maximum covariance analysis. As also found in observational data, all the models considered here show a statistically significant link with sea-ice reduction over the eastern Arctic followed by a negative NAO/AO-like pattern. If the simulated relationship is found at a lag of one month, the results suggest that a stratospheric pathway could be at play as the driving mechanism; in observations this is preferentially shown for SIC in November. The interference of a wave-like anomaly over Eurasia, accompanying SIC changes, with the climatological wave pattern appears to be key in setting the mediating role of the stratosphere. On the other hand, if the simulated relationship is found at a lag of two months, the results suggest that tropospheric dynamics are dominant, presumably due to transient eddy feedback; in observations this is preferentially shown for SIC in December. The results shown here and previous evidence from atmosphere-only experiments emphasize that there could be a detectable influence of eastern Arctic SIC variability on mid-latitude atmospheric circulation anomalies. Even if the mechanisms are robust among the models, the timing of the simulated linkages strongly depends on the model and does not generally mimic the observational ones. This implies that the atmospheric sensitivity to sea-ice changes largely depends on the mean-flow and parameterizations, which could lead to misleading conclusions elsewhere if a multi-model ensemble-mean approach is adopted. It might also represent an important source of uncertainty in climate prediction and projection. Modelling efforts are hence further required to improve representation of the background atmospheric circulation and reduce biases, in order to attain more accurate covariability.","[Garcia-Serrano, J.; Frankignoul, C.] Sorbonne Univ UPMC CNRS IRD MNHN, LOCEAN IPSL, Paris, France; [Garcia-Serrano, J.; Guemas, V.] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC CNS, Dept Earth Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [King, M.

For example, production of odd nitrogen and odd hydrogen during strong events can decrease ozone by tens of percent. However, the standard ion chemistry parameterization used in atmospheric models neglects the effects on some important species, such as nitric acid. We present WACCM-D, a variant of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, which includes a set of lower ionosphere (D-region) chemistry: 307 reactions of 20 positive ions and 21 negative ions. We consider realistic ionization scenarios and compare the WACCM-D results to those from the Sodankyla Ion and Neutral Chemistry (SIC), a state-of-the-art 1-D model of the D-region chemistry. We show that WACCM-D produces well the main characteristics of the D-region ionosphere, as well as the overall proportion of important ion groups, in agreement with SIC. Comparison of ion concentrations shows that the WACCM-D bias is typically within 10% or less below 70 km. At 70-90 km, when strong altitude gradients in ionization rates and/or ion concentrations exist, the bias can be larger for some groups but is still within tens of percent. Based on the good agreement overall and the fact that part of the differences are caused by different model setups, WACCM-D provides a state-of-the-art global representation of D-region ion chemistry and is therefore expected to improve EPP modeling considerably. These improvements are demonstrated in a companion paper by Andersson et al.","[Verronen, P. T.; Andersson, M. E.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Earth Observat, Helsinki, Finland; [Marsh, D.

Model performance is compared with two state-of-the-art downscaling methods: statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and generalized linear modeling (GLM). The downscaled precipitation is evaluated with reference to recorded precipitation at 57 gauging stations located within the study region. The spatial and temporal robustness of the downscaling methods is evaluated using seven precipitation based indices. Results indicate that SP method-based models perform best in downscaling precipitation followed by GLM, followed by the SDSM model. Best performing models are thereafter used to downscale future precipitations made by three global circulation models (GCMs) following two emission scenarios: representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 over the twenty-first century. The downscaled future precipitation projections indicate an increase in mean and maximum precipitation intensity as well as a decrease in the total number of dry days.

Our results indicate that the United States should expect an additional 3.2 [2.1-4.5] or 2.3 [1.5-3.2] million violent crimes between 2020 and 2099, depending on greenhouse gas emissions scenario. We also reveal critical dependencies of these violent crime projections on various global warming targets, such as those associated with the Paris Agreement (1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C). These results emphasize the often-overlooked socially-mediated impacts of climate change on human health, with an estimated economic cost of $5 billion annually.","[Harp, Ryan D.; Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Harp, Ryan D.; Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Harp, Ryan D.; Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Univ Colorado, Earth Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Aurora, CO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Colorado School of Public Health,"Harp, RD (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Harp, RD (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Harp, RD (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Earth Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ryan.harp@colorado.edu,,"Harp, Ryan/0000-0002-2872-8541",University of Colorado Boulder Earth Lab - University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,University of Colorado Boulder Earth Lab - University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,The authors extend gratitude to the University of Colorado Boulder Earth Lab for funding support.

Hence, the uncertainty in the projected reduction of oceanic heat transport is a main source of uncertainty in projections of Western European climate change.

Over the terrestrial regions of a quasi-global domain, we assess the representation of annual maxima of daily precipitation (Rx1day) in 22 observational products gridded at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution and clustered into four categories: station-based in situ, satellite observations with or without a correction to rain gauges, and reanalyses (5, 8, 4 and 5 datasets, respectively). We also evaluate the interproduct spread across the ensemble and within the four clusters, as a measure of observational uncertainty. We find that reanalyses present a heterogeneous representation of Rx1day in particular over the tropics, and their interproduct spread is the highest compared to any other cluster. Extreme precipitation in satellite data broadly compares well with in situ-based data. We find a general better agreement with in situ-based observations and less interproduct spread for the satellite products with a correction to rain gauges compared to the uncorrected products. Given the level of uncertainties associated with the estimation of Rx1day in the observations, none of the datasets can be thought of as the best estimate. Our recommendation is to avoid using reanalyses as observational evidence and to consider in situ and satellite data (the corrected version preferably) in an ensemble of products for a better estimation of precipitation extremes and their observational uncertainties. Based on this we choose a subsample of 10 datasets to reduce the interproduct spread in both the representation of Rx1day and its timing throughout the year, compared to all 22 datasets. We emphasize that the recommendations and selection of datasets given here may not be relevant for different precipitation indices, and other grid resolutions and time scales.","[Bador, Margot; Alexander, Lisa V.] CLEX ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bador, Margot; Alexander, Lisa V.] UNSW Sydney, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sch BEES, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Contractor, Steefan] UNSW Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Roca, Remy] Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales, Toulouse, France",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales,"Bador, M (corresponding author), CLEX ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Bador, M (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sch BEES, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.bador@unsw.edu.au,"Alexander, Lisa V/A-8477-2011; ROCA, Remy/X-9325-2019","Alexander, Lisa V/0000-0002-5635-2457; ROCA, Remy/0000-0003-1843-0204; Bador, Margot/0000-0003-3976-6946; Contractor, Steefan/0000-0002-3987-2311",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP160103439]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [CE170100022]; CNES through the Megha-Tropiques program,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes; CNES through the Megha-Tropiques program,"The data (FROGS database, Roca et al (2019a)) that support the findings of this study are openly available at https://doi.org/10.14768/06337394-73A9-407C9997-0E380DAC5598.All analyses and graphics have been done using the NCAR Command Language (NCL 2013).

In particular, it is of paramount importance to understand to what extent the systematic error of global climate models affects the processes driving such variability. This is done by performing a set of simulations (ROCK experiments) with an intermediate complexity atmospheric model (SPEEDY), in which the Rocky Mountains orography is modified (increased or decreased) to influence the structure of the North Pacific jet stream. For each of these modified-orography experiments, the climatic response to idealized sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies of varying intensity in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region is studied. ROCK experiments are characterized by variations in the Pacific jet stream intensity whose extension encompasses the spread of the systematic error found in state-of-the-art climate models. When forced with ENSO-like idealised anomalies, they exhibit a non-negligible sensitivity in the response pattern over the Pacific North American region, indicating that a change/bias in the model mean state can affect the model response to ENSO. It is found that the classical Rossby wave train response generated by ENSO is more meridionally oriented when the Pacific jet stream is weaker, while it exhibits a more zonal structure when the jet is stronger. Rossby wave linear theory, used here to interpret the results, suggests that a stronger jet implies a stronger waveguide, which traps Rossby waves at a lower latitude, favouring a more zonally oriented propagation of the tropically induced Rossby waves. The shape of the dynamical response to ENSO, determined by changes in the intensity of the Pacific Jet, affects in turn the ENSO impacts on surface temperature and precipitation over Central and North America. Furthermore, a comparison of the SPEEDY results with CMIP6 models behaviour suggests a wider applicability of the results to more resources-demanding, complete climate GCMs, opening up to future works focusing on the relationship between Pacific jet misrepresentation and response to external forcing in fully-fledged GCMs.","[Di Carlo, Emanuele; Corti, Susanna] CNR Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Di Carlo, Emanuele; Ruggieri, Paolo] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Davini, Paolo] CNR Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Turin, Italy; [Tibaldi, Stefano] Fdn CentroEuromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Bologna,"Di Carlo, E (corresponding author), CNR Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy.;Di Carlo, E (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",emanuele.dicarlo3@unibo.it,"Tibaldi, Stefano/AAF-2964-2019; Ruggieri, Paolo/X-6334-2018","Tibaldi, Stefano/0000-0001-8643-0164; Ruggieri, Paolo/0000-0003-1996-7206; Di Carlo, Emanuele/0000-0001-6212-5579",,,,,77,0,0,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Continental configurations and mountain topography transitioned toward modern conditions, and many flora and fauna evolved into the same taxa that exist today. Miocene climate was dynamic: long periods of early and late glaciation bracketed a similar to 2 Myr greenhouse interval-the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO). Floras, faunas, ice sheets, precipitation, pCO(2), and ocean and atmospheric circulation mostly (but not ubiquitously) covaried with these large changes in climate. With higher temperatures and moderately higher pCO(2) (similar to 400-600 ppm), the MCO has been suggested as a particularly appropriate analog for future climate scenarios, and for assessing the predictive accuracy of numerical climate models-the same models that are used to simulate future climate. Yet, Miocene conditions have proved difficult to reconcile with models. This implies either missing positive feedbacks in the models, a lack of knowledge of past climate forcings, or the need for re-interpretation of proxies, which might mitigate the model-data discrepancy. Our understanding of Miocene climatic, biogeochemical, and oceanic changes on broad spatial and temporal scales is still developing. New records documenting the physical, chemical, and biotic aspects of the Earth system are emerging, and together provide a more comprehensive understanding of this important time interval. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in Miocene climate, ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycling, ice sheet dynamics, and biotic adaptation research as inferred through proxy observations and modeling studies.","[Steinthorsdottir, M.; Kiel, S.; Mors, T.] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeobiol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Steinthorsdottir, M.; Coxall, H.

Global meridional fluxes of moisture and sensible heat are calculated by integrating surface and top-of-the-atmosphere vertical fluxes from one pole to the other. The parametrisations include an eddy-diffusion term, representing down-gradient transport of specific humidity and temperature due to the transient atmospheric eddies at mid- and high latitudes, and simple representations of the mean meridional circulation. Qualitative and quantitative agreement between the increased hydrological cycle in the 2 x CO2-run from the GCM and the parametrisation is found. The performance for the sensible heat flux shows larger differences to the GCM results, particularly at low latitudes. Seasonal variations of the moisture and sensible heat transport are well captured by parametrisations including the influence of the mean meridional circulation. Interannual variability cannot be simulated. An examination of the parametrisations on different spatial scales suggests that they should not be used for small scales. Furthermore, two closures for the zonal distribution of precipitation were examined. They are used in zonally averaged atmosphere models coupled to an ocean model with different ocean basins at one latitudinal belt. An assessment of both the reanalysis data and the GCM results shows that both closures exhibit very similar behaviour and are valid in the long-term mean and seasonal cycle. Interannual variability is not captured well. They become invalid for spatial scales smaller than 10 degrees.","Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Schmittner, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",,"Appenzeller, Christof/AAA-8989-2022; Schmittner, Andreas/A-3101-2008; Appenzeller, Christof/B-3015-2013; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Schmittner, Andreas/O-9647-2015","Appenzeller, Christof/0000-0002-9939-9845; Appenzeller, Christof/0000-0002-9939-9845; Schmittner, Andreas/0000-0002-8376-0843",,,,,29,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Efforts to adapt these systems to the rapidly warming Arctic climate require high-quality climate projections. Here, a state-of-the-art regional climate model is used to perform simulations at 4-km resolution over the eastern and central Canadian Arctic. These include, for the first time over this region, high-resolution climate projections extending to the year 2040. Validation shows that the model adequately simulates base climate variables, as well as variables hazardous to northern engineering and transportation systems, such as degrading permafrost, extreme rainfall, and extreme wind gust. Added value is found over coarser resolution simulations. A novel approach integrating climate model output and machine learning is used for deriving fog-an important, but complex hazard. Hotspots of change to climatic hazards over the next two decades (2021-2040) are identified. These include increases to short-duration rainfall intensity extremes exceeding 50%, suggesting Super-Clausius-Clapeyron scaling. Increases to extreme wind gust pressure are projected to reach 25% over some regions, while widespread increases in active layer thickness and ground temperature are expected. Overall fog frequency is projected to increase by around 10% over most of the study region by 2040, due to increasing frequency of high humidity conditions. Given that these changes are projected to be already underway, urgent action is required to successfully adapt northern transportation and engineering systems located in regions where the magnitude of hazards is projected to increase.","[Teufel, B.; Sushama, L.] McGill Univ, Trottier Inst Sustainabil Engn & Design, Dept Civil Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Teufel, B (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Trottier Inst Sustainabil Engn & Design, Dept Civil Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",bernardo.teufel@mail.mcgill.ca,,,Transport Canada (Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED); McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative (MSSI),Transport Canada (Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED); McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative (MSSI),"This research was funded by Transport Canada (Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED) and the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative (MSSI).

As such, the non-destructive or minimally destructive nature of operator-artwork interactions has been considered as essential in this field. The complete diagnosis of the status of the art object signifying a full knowledge of invisible defects and their morphology allows its timely and correct maintenance and ensures its durability. It is herein presented the basic technical information on the development of a portable system termed Digital Holographic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DHSPI) for the structural diagnosis of works of art. DHSPI has been tested on a variety of conservation problems over the years. It is a completely portable and fully PC driven automated system for the detection and non-destructive diagnosis of the structural alterations of an artwork, whether they are defects lying on the subsurface or between the layers below it, the fringe number information allows the depth estimation and the complete documentation. The system exploits the benefits of a highly coherent laser beam as essential presupposition for remote on-field access-that is the main emphasis given here-to immovable/movable art objects. It takes advantage of a CCD camera as photosensitive medium to record the interference of the retro reflected object laser beam from the object under consideration with a twin reference laser beam. The device allows micro projections of the defects on the surface of the object to be detected with a resolution that corresponds to half the wavelength of the laser beam. Local disparities, in relation to the total response of the object, are directly correlated to the detected microdisplacement of object surface as structural defects. Special tailor-made software allows full control of the system, processing of the data, and extraction of anomalies. Direct visual qualitative observation of the displacement processes is followed as captured in the monitor. A second custom-made software-not presented in detail here-enables further processing of the results to improve their imaging, quantification, and dimensioning. The final result is a quantitative map of alterations, the coordinates, and the classification of their risks which can be also extracted if further information is necessary. The qualitative or quantitative documentation map can be used as a guide to the conservator for maintenance and restoration work. Further on, the system also allows observation of the object's response to climate changes in order to predict the formation of alterations or the evolution of existing ones providing the only known direct tool for scheduling preservation strategies.","[Tornari, Vivi] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, N Plastira 100, Iraklion, Crete, Greece",Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH),"Tornari, V (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, N Plastira 100, Iraklion, Crete, Greece.",vivitor@iesl.forth.gr,,"Tornari, Vivi/0000-0001-7198-9504","CHARISMA project [INFRA-2008-1.1.1, 228330]; CLIMATE for CULTURE [FP7-ENV-2008-1]; LASERACT project [EVK4-CT-2002-00096]; MULTIENCODE project [SSPI-CTOO-6427]; Ultraviolet Laser Facility IESL-FORTH; IPERION CH [654028]",CHARISMA project; CLIMATE for CULTURE; LASERACT project; MULTIENCODE project; Ultraviolet Laser Facility IESL-FORTH; IPERION CH,"CHARISMA project, Grant/Award Number: INFRA-2008-1.1.1 Grant agreement no: 228330; CLIMATE for CULTURE, Grant/Award Number: FP7-ENV-2008-1; LASERACT project, Grant/Award Number: EVK4-CT-2002-00096 (2002-2005); MULTIENCODE project, Grant/Award Number: SSPI-CTOO-6427 (2005-2008); Ultraviolet Laser Facility IESL-FORTH; IPERION CH, Grant/Award Number: 654028",,40,7,7,8,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0039-2103,1475-1305,,STRAIN,Strain,APR,2019,2,,SI,,,,e12288,10.1111/str.12288,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/str.12288,,,16,"Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,HP1MJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000461430700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present an example of such an analysis, scrutinizing the effects of winter and spring hydroclimate on the abundance of small-sized dominant calanoid copepods (Eurytemora affinis and Acartia spp.), using data from 2080 zooplankton samples collected over 55 years (1957-2012) from a shallow coastal habitat (Parnu Bay, Gulf of Riga) in the Baltic Sea. Our results indicated that the milder winters brought about higher abundances, and reduced seasonality of small-sized copepods, whereas ambient sea surface temperature (SST) mostly affected the relative abundance of adult stages. The sliding window correlation tests revealed temporal shifts in the effects of controlling variables: with the continuous increase in SST, the effect of winter temperature on the abundance of Acartia spp. weakened. In contrast, E. affinis was consistently affected by SST, but the effect of winter temperature was more pronounced during the period of on average colder winters.","[Klais, Riina; Teder, Marilyn; Simm, Mart; Ojaveer, Henn] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Otto, Saskia A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; University of Hamburg,"Klais, R (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",riina.klais@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273",BONUS (Art 185) - EU; Estonian Research Council; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0180005s10],"BONUS (Art 185) - EU; Estonian Research Council; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)","We thank Dr. Timo Arula for helpful comments on the manuscript, and the two anonymous reviewers for very helpful, thorough and inspiring comments on our manuscript.

J,"Robin, L",,,,"Robin, Libby",,,Environmental humanities and climate change: understanding humans geologically and other life forms ethically,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HISTORY; FUTURE,"The task of reconceptualizing planetary change for the human imagination calls on a wide range of disciplinary wisdom. Environmental studies were guided by the natural sciences in the 1960s, and in the 1970s broadened to include policy and the social sciences. By the 1990s, with global environmental changes well-documented, various humanist initiatives emerged, expanding the idea of ethics, responsibility and justice within the transdisciplinary mode of environmental studies. Shared problems, places, and scales form the basis for collaborative work in the environmental humanities, sometimes in partnerships with natural sciences and the creative arts. Experiential learning and trust in judgments based on different methods typically guide humanities interventions. Shifting the frameworks of environmental research to be more consciously inclusive and diverse is enabling concepts of the physical world that better include humans and taking ethics beyond humans to consider more-than-human Others. This review considers historically how the environment and the humanities became conceptualized together. It then explores three emerging fields in transdisciplinary environmental scholarship where environmental humanities are playing major leadership roles: (1) climate and biodiversity justice, both for humans and for other forms of life; (2) the Anthropocene as a metaphor for living with planetary changes and (3) life after the end of nature,' including rewilding and restoration. While environmental humanities also work in many other fields, these cases exemplify the crucial tasks of situating the human in geological and ecological terms and other life forms (the more-than-human') in ethical terms.

Museum staff often select class AA, presuming to gain the best overall preservation result that is possible. However, the exact consequences on the energy demand are unknown and therefore barely taken into account when selecting a class. This study quantifies the energy demand of four museum zones with different quality of envelopes (ranging from historical to state-of-the-art museum envelopes), conditioned according to ASHRAE's climate classes. The lower and upper limits of indoor temperature and relative humidity, and the resulting energy demand are determined using building simulations. The conclusions: (i) conditioning according to class B significantly saves energy compared to class A, while class B is still considered as precision control and protects most artefacts; (ii) moving down one class, e. g. from class AA to A, saves relatively more energy for a state-of-the-art building than for a historical building; (iii) Subclasses Ad (larger daily fluctuations) and As (seasonal adjustments, but smaller daily fluctuations) pose the same risk on the collection, but subclass Ad requires less humidification and dehumidification than As, so larger daily fluctuations may be preferred above seasonal adjustments.

The physics package of the global ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework has been extended to simulate passive moisture tracers and the stable isotopologues HDO and (H2O)-O-18. The extension builds on the infrastructure provided by ICON-ART, which allows for high flexibility with respect to the number of related water tracers that are simulated. The physics of isotopologue fractionation follow the model COSMOiso. We first present a detailed description of the physics of fractionation that have been implemented in the model. The model is then evaluated on a range of temporal scales by comparing with measurements of precipitation and vapor. A multi-annual simulation is compared to observations of the isotopologues in precipitation taken from the station network GNIP (Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation). ICON-ART-Iso is able to simulate the main features of the seasonal cycles in delta D and delta O-18 as observed at the GNIP stations. In a comparison with IASI satellite retrievals, the seasonal and daily cycles in the isotopologue content of vapor are examined for different regions in the free troposphere. On a small spatial and temporal scale, ICON-ART-Iso is used to simulate the period of two flights of the IAGOS-CARIBIC aircraft in September 2010, which sampled air in the tropopause region influenced by Hurricane Igor.

The data were simulated using the geographic information systems (GIS) and computer software MATLAB. The output results were converted into geographical maps. Three parameters were analyzed: annual mean maximum temperature, annual mean minimum temperature, and mean annual rainfall during the period (1979-2008). The analyzed results were also used to forecast for the period (2009-2018). The results show that no change has occurred in the mean annual rainfall in both northern and eastern part, while it has increased in the central region of Jordan. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, but over the past 50 years, the mean local temperature in Jordan has increased rapidly since 1992 by 1.5-2 degrees C. It is noticed from the data that the change in both maximum and minimum temperatures has clearly begun after 1991, in which this phenomenon may give an indication of changing point in climate of Jordan. As for prediction is concern, the show continuous increase in both maximum and minimum temperatures in the eastern, northern and southern regions of Jordan. The application of GIS in this study was successfully used to analyze the data and to produce 'easy to use' maps to understand the impact of global warming. This application is the first in terms of its applicability in Jordan. The authors believe that the results of this study will be of great help to the decision makers in the field of environment in Jordan. (C) 2013 Taibah University.

The goals of AgMIP are to improve substantially the characterization of world food security due to climate change and to enhance adaptation capacity in both developing and developed countries. Analyses of the agricultural impacts of climate variability and change require a transdisciplinary effort to consistently link state-of-the-art climate scenarios to crop and economic models. Crop model outputs are aggregated as inputs to regional and global economic models to determine regional vulnerabilities, changes in comparative advantage, price effects, and potential adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. Climate, Crop Modeling, Economics, and Information Technology Team Protocols are presented to guide coordinated climate, crop modeling, economics, and information technology research activities around the world, along with AgMIP Cross-Cutting Themes that address uncertainty, aggregation and scaling, and the development of Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs) to enable testing of climate change adaptations in the context of other regional and global trends. The organization of research activities by geographic region and specific crops is described, along with project milestones. Pilot results demonstrate AgMIP's role in assessing climate impacts with explicit representation of uncertainties in climate scenarios and simulations using crop and economic models. An intercomparison of wheat model simulations near Obregon, Mexico reveals inter-model differences in yield sensitivity to [CO2] with model uncertainty holding approximately steady as concentrations rise, while uncertainty related to choice of crop model increases with rising temperatures. Wheat model simulations with mid-century climate scenarios project a slight decline in absolute yields that is more sensitive to selection of crop model than to global climate model, emissions scenario, or climate scenario downscaling method. A comparison of regional and national-scale economic simulations finds a large sensitivity of projected yield changes to the simulations' resolved scales. Finally, a global economic model intercomparison example demonstrates that improvements in the understanding of agriculture futures arise from integration of the range of uncertainty in crop, climate, and economic modeling results in multi-model assessments.

However, insights into those valuable state-of-the-art solutions are usually not shared with researchers due to the strict nondisclosure policies of electric vehicle manufacturers. Many studies, therefore, rely on assumptions, best-guess estimates, or insider knowledge. This article presents an in-depth multi-scale analysis of the electric powertrain characteristics of a Volkswagen ID.3 Pro Performance. The focus is set on the range, power, and lifetime perceivable by the user. Thorough experimental tests are performed from the battery cell to vehicle level, following the energy conversion from source to sink. Energy densities are determined at all levels and the absolute electric range is quantified under varying operating conditions. Power capability and efficiency is evaluated at cell level by quantifying the battery cell and pack performance with current rate tests in charge/discharge scenarios and impedance determination, as well as by determining powertrain energy conversion efficiency with in-vehicle measurements. Moreover, accelerated aging tests of the lithium-ion battery cells are performed with close to real-world conditions and projected to vehicle level, demonstrating that the lithium-ion battery pack achieves mileages outperforming the warranty information of the manufacturer under real-world operation. Overall, the results provide valuable insights into the current state of the art and can serve as a reference for automotive engineering in academia. Over 10 GB of lithium-ion battery cell, pack, and overall powertrain measurement data from the lab and real-world environment is available as open source alongside the article. (c) 2022 The Authors.

A multi-model EURO-CORDEX regional ensemble of bias-adjusted wave climate projections in eleven locations of the Mediterranean are used for the assessment of future seasonal changes in the directional wave spectra under the high-emission scenario RCP8.5. This analysis allows us to identify climate change effects on the spectral energy of the swell and wind-sea systems and their seasonal variability which cannot be captured with the standard integrated wave parameters, such as significant wave height and mean wave direction. The results show an overall robust decrease in the predominant wave systems, resulting in a likely decrease in the significant wave height that is in agreement with previous studies. However, the results depict a robust increase in other less energetic frequencies and directions leading to a projected behavioral change from unimodal to bimodal/multimodal wave climate in many locations which has strong repercussions on the vulnerability of coastal assets and ports operability.","[Lira-Loarca, Andrea; Besio, Giovanni] Univ Genoa, Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Via Montallegro 1, I-16145 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Lira-Loarca, A (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Via Montallegro 1, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",andrea.lira.loarca@unige.it,"Lira Loarca, Andrea/A-6712-2017","Lira Loarca, Andrea/0000-0003-2251-6684; Besio, Giovanni/0000-0002-0522-9635",University of Genoa (UniGE); Compagnia San Paolo Foundation,University of Genoa (UniGE); Compagnia San Paolo Foundation(Compagnia di San Paolo),"A.L.L has been funded by the University of Genoa (UniGE) and Compagnia San Paolo Foundation under the framework of the Seal of Excellenceattrazione di talenti@UniGeinitiative.The authors acknowledge the CINECA ISCRA-C IsC66-WACCS, IsC78-FUWAME, IsC87-UNDERSEA and IsC87FUWAMEBI projects for the computing resources to perform the GCM-RCMs wave climate projections.

These rainfall changes will lead to increases in the magnitude and frequency of flood events that will, in turn, affect patterns of erosion and deposition within river basins. These geomorphic changes to river systems may affect flood conveyance, infrastructure resilience, channel pattern, and habitat status as well as sediment, nutrient and carbon fluxes. Previous research modelling climatic influences on geomorphic changes has been limited by how climate variability and change are represented by downscaling from global or regional climate models. Furthermore, the non-linearity of the climatic, hydrological and geomorphic systems involved generate large uncertainties at each stage of the modelling process creating an uncertainty 'cascade'. This study integrates state-of-the-art approaches from the climate change and geomorphic communities to address these issues in a probabilistic modelling study of the Swale catchment, UK. The UKCP09 weather generator is used to simulate hourly rainfall for the baseline and climate change scenarios up to 2099, and used to drive the CAESAR landscape evolution model to simulate geomorphic change. Results show that winter rainfall is projected to increase, with larger increases at the extremes. The impact of the increasing rainfall is amplified through the translation into catchment runoff and in turn sediment yield with a 100% increase in catchment mean sediment yield predicted between the baseline and the 2070-2099 High emissions scenario. Significant increases are shown between all climate change scenarios and baseline values. Analysis of extreme events also shows the amplification effect from rainfall to sediment delivery with even greater amplification associated with higher return period events. Furthermore, for the 2070-2099 High emissions scenario, sediment discharges from 50-yr return period events are predicted to be 5 times larger than baseline values.","[Coulthard, T.

In this study, we focused on impacts of Asian low-latitude irrigation on regional and global climates during boreal wintertime. A state-of-the-art Earth system model is used to simulate the land-air interaction processes affected by irrigation and the consequent responses in atmospheric circulation. Perturbed experiments show that wet soil moisture anomalies at low latitudes can reduce the surface temperature on a continental scale through atmospheric feedback. The intensity of prevailing monsoon circulation becomes stronger because of larger land-sea thermal contrast. Furthermore, anomalous upper level convergence over South Asia and midlatitude climatic changes indicate tropical-extratropical teleconnections. The wintertime Aleutian low is deepened and an anomalous warm surface temperature is found in North America. Previous studies have noted this warming but left it unexplained, and we provide plausible mechanisms for these remote impacts coming from the irrigation over Asian low-latitude regions.","[Wey, Hao-Wei; Lo, Min-Hui] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Lee, Shih-Yu; Hsu, Huang-Hsiung] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Yu, Jin-Yi] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA",National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Lo, MH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",minhuilo@ntu.edu.tw,"Yu, Jin-Yi/G-3413-2011; LEE, SHIH-YU/AAP-3128-2021; Hsu, Huang-Hsiung/AAP-3878-2021; Yu, Jin-Yi/AAU-9089-2020","Yu, Jin-Yi/0000-0001-6156-7623; Hsu, Huang-Hsiung/0000-0001-9919-4404; Yu, Jin-Yi/0000-0001-6156-7623; LO, MIN-HUI/0000-0002-8653-143X","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2111-M-002-006, MOST 100-2119-M-001-029-MY5]; US National Science Foundation [AGS-1233542, AGS-1505145]; Directorate For Geosciences [1505145] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1233542] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","We are grateful to John C.

AIRS analysis results produced at the GODDARD/DAAC, based on Versions 4 & 53 of the AIRS retrieval algorithm, are currently available for public use. Here, first we present an assessment of interrelationships of anomalies (proxies of climate variability based on 5 full years, since Sept. 2002) of various climate parameters at different spatial scales. We also present AIRS -retrievals-based global, regional and I x I degree grid-scale trend-analyses of important atmospheric parameters for this 5-year period. Note that here trend simply means the linear fit to the anomaly (relative the mean seasonal cycle) time series of various parameters at the above-mentioned spatial scales, and we present these to illustrate the usefulness of continuing AIRS-based climate observations. Preliminary validation efforts, in terms of intercomparisons of interannual variabilities with other available satellite data analysis results, will also be addressed. For example, we show that the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) interannual spatial variabilities from the available stateof-the-art CERES measurements and from the AIRS computations are in remarkably good agreement. Version 6 of the AIRS retrieval scheme (currently under development) promises to further improve bias agreements for the absolute values by implementing a more accurate radiative transfer model for the OLR computations and by improving surface emissivity retrievals.","[Molnar, Gyula I.] GEST UMBC, Code 613-5, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Susskind, Joel] NASA GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Molnar, GI (corresponding author), GEST UMBC, Code 613-5, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,4,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-7157-4,PROC SPIE,,,2008,,,,,,,696612,10.1117/12.775446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.775446,,,9,Remote Sensing; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Remote Sensing; Optics,BHZ01,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000257540900025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two methods were applied for the analysis of aerosol samples collected inside and outside the churches: energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. The results show that all the heating systems re-suspend the particulate matter brought from outside. However, the extent of re-suspension of the systems is different. It is also shown that the hot air blow heating, - the oldest design of the studied systems, - warming the church by blowing in hot air could generate organic particles. Such particles can cause soiling, and/or blackening of works of art present in the church. The application of this heating system also provoked the deterioration of the plastered walls, thus leading to the creation of an extra internal source of Ca. The other two heating systems (more modern) demonstrate less influence on the works of art regarding aerosol deposition. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present paper we focus on precipitation (mainly rain) over the Baltic Sea as a part of the BAL-TEX project to examine the present state of the art concerning different precipitation estimates over that area. Several methods are used, with the focus on 1) interpolation of available synoptic stations; 2) a mesoscale analysis system including synoptic, automatic, and climate stations, as well as weather radar and an atmospheric model; and 3) measurements performed on ships. The investigated time scales are monthly and yearly and also some long-term considerations are discussed. The comparison shows that the differences between most of the estimates, when averaged over an extended period and a larger area, are in the order of 10-20%, which is in the same range as the correction of the synoptic gauge measurements due to wind and evaporation losses. In all data sets using gauge data it is important to include corrections for high winds. To improve the structure of precipitation over sea more focus is to be put on the use of radar data and combinations of radar data and other data. Interpolation methods that do not consider orographic effects must treat areas with large horizontal precipitation gradients with care. Due to the large variability in precipitation in time and space, it is important to use long time periods for climate estimates of precipitation. Ship measurements are a valuable contribution to precipitation information over sea, especially for seasonal and annual time scales.","Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; Inst Meereskunde, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Gothenburg Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Uppsala University; University of Gothenburg,"Rutgersson, A (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",anna.rutgersson@smhi.se,"Lindau, Ralf/AAE-2845-2019",,,,,,33,17,18,0,9,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,,,NORD HYDROL,Nord.

In response to global warming, ENSO-driven rainfall variability is projected to intensify over the central-eastern Pacific but weaken over the western Pacific, whereas ENSO-related sea surface temperature variability is projected to decrease(6-14). Here, we explore the mechanisms that lead to changes in ENSO-driven rainfall variability in the tropical Pacific in response to global warming, with the help of a moisture budget decomposition for simulations from eighteen state-of-the-art climate models(15). We identify two opposing mechanisms that approximately offset each other: the increase in mean-state moisture content associated with surface warming strengthens ENSO-related rainfall anomalies(7), whereas the projected reduction in ENSO-related variability of sea surface temperatures suppresses rainfall. Two additional effects-spatially non-uniform changes in background sea surface temperatures and structural changes in sea surface temperature related to ENSO-both enhance central-eastern Pacific rainfall variability while dampening variability in the western Pacific, in nearly equal amounts.

Here, future changes of pan evaporation E-pan, a measurable indicator for atmospheric evaporative demand, are first projected and attributed over China through a physically based approach, namely, the PenPan model, forced with outputs from 12 state-of-the-art climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. An equidistant quantile mapping method was also used to correct the biases in GCMs outputs to reduce uncertainty in E-pan projection. The results indicated that E-pan would increase during the periods 2021-50 and 2071-2100 relative to the baseline period 1971-2000 under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, which can mainly be attributed to the projected increase in air temperature and vapor pressure deficit over China. The percentage increase of E-pan is relatively larger in eastern China than in western China, which is due to the spatially inconsistent increases in air temperature, net radiation, wind speed, and vapor pressure deficit over China. The widely reported pan evaporation paradox'' was not well reproduced for the period 1961-2000 in the climate models, before or after bias correction, suggesting discrepancy between observed and modeled trends. With that caveat, it was found that the pan evaporation has been projected to increase at a rate of 117-167 mm yr(-1) K-1 (72-80 mm yr(-1) K-1) over China using the multiple GCMs under the RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario with increased greenhouse gases and the associated warming of the climate system.","[Liu, Wenbin; Sun, Fubao] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Fubao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Fubao] Hexi Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Zhangye City, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hexi University","Sun, FB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, FB (corresponding author), Hexi Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Zhangye City, Peoples R China.",sunfb@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Sun, Fubao/Q-2421-2019; Sun, Fubao/G-4441-2010; Liu, Wenbin/AAB-2665-2021","Sun, Fubao/0000-0003-3358-8229; Liu, Wenbin/0000-0002-9569-6762","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0401401, 2016YFA0602402]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology in Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); National Science Foundation of China [41330529, 41401037]; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program; Initial Founding of Scientific Research from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resource Research, CAS [Y5V50019YE]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology in Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program; Initial Founding of Scientific Research from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resource Research, CAS","Wenbin Liu and Fubao Sun were financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0401401 and 2016YFA0602402).

However, most current forecasting approaches do not incorporate species-specific, process-based biological information, which limits their ability to inform actionable strategies. Mechanistic approaches, incorporating quantitative information on functional traits, can potentially predict species- and population-specific responses that result from the cumulative impacts of small-scale processes acting at the organismal level, and can be used to infer population-level dynamics and inform natural resources management. Here we present a proof-of-concept study using the European anchovy as a model species that shows how a trait-based, mechanistic species distribution model can be used to explore the vulnerability of marine species to environmental changes, producing quantitative outputs useful for informing fisheries management. We crossed scenarios of temperature and food to generate quantitative maps of selected mechanistic model outcomes (e.g., Maximum Length and Total Reproductive Output). These results highlight changing patterns of source and sink spawning areas as well as the incidence of reproductive failure. This study demonstrates that model predictions based on functional traits can reduce the degree of uncertainty when forecasting future trends of fish stocks. However, to be effective they must be based on high spatial- and temporal resolution environmental data. Such a sensitive and spatially explicit predictive approach may be used to inform more effective adaptive management strategies of resources in novel climatic conditions.","[Mangano, M.

Despite failing, an urgent pedagogical case remains for reimagining ethical relations on campus.

Without the prior knowledge of ZIKV being already present in South America, and given the lack of understanding of key epidemiologic processes and long-term records of ZIKV cases in the continent, the best related prediction could be carried out for the potential risk of a generic Aedes-borne disease epidemic. Here we use a recently published two-vector basic reproduction number model to assess the predictability of the conditions conducive to epidemics of diseases like zika, chikungunya, or dengue, transmitted by the independent or concurrent presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We compare the potential risk of transmission forcing the model with the observed climate and with state-of-the-art operational forecasts from the North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME), finding that the predictive skill of this new seasonal forecast system is highest for multiple countries in Latin America and the Caribbean during the December-February and March-May seasons, and slightly lower-but still of potential use to decision-makers-for the rest of the year. In particular, we find that above-normal suitable conditions for the occurrence of the zika epidemic at the beginning of 2015 could have been successfully predicted at least 1 month in advance for several zika hotspots, and in particular for Northeast Brazil: the heart of the epidemic. Nonetheless, the initiation and spread of an epidemic depends on the effect of multiple factors beyond climate conditions, and thus this type of approach must be considered as a guide and not as a formal predictive tool of vector-borne epidemics.","[Munoz, Angel G.; Vecchi, Gabriel A.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Munoz, Angel G.; Yang, Xiaosong] Princeton Univ, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Munoz, Angel G.; Thomson, Madeleine C.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Thomson, Madeleine C.; Moran, Zelda] Columbia Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Thomson, Madeleine C.] Columbia Univ, Collaborating Ctr Early Warning Syst Malaria & Ot, WHO, New York, NY USA; [Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Ctr Global Hlth & Translat Sci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Med, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Vecchi, Gabriel A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Vecchi, Gabriel A.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Chourio, Xandre] Univ Zulia, Ctr Modelado Cient, Latin Amer Observ Climate Events, Maracaibo, Venezuela; [Najera, Patricia] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Communicable Dis & Hlth Anal Dept, Int Hlth Regulat Epidem Alert & Response & Water, Washington, DC USA",Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; World Health Organization; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; Princeton University; Princeton University; Pan American Health Organization,"Munoz, AG (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Munoz, AG (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Munoz, AG (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY 10027 USA.",agms@princeton.edu,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Moran, Zelda/0000-0002-1493-5734; Stewart-Ibarra, Anna/0000-0002-3383-4672; Munoz, Angel G/0000-0002-2212-6654",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceanic; Atmospheric Research; auspices of the National Earth System Prediction Capability; Centro de Modelado Cientifico's project CMC-CC-Dat-2016; IRIWHO Collaborating Center (430) Malaria Early Warning and Other Climate Sensitive Diseases; Division Of Environmental Biology [1518681] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceanic; Atmospheric Research; auspices of the National Earth System Prediction Capability; Centro de Modelado Cientifico's project CMC-CC-Dat-2016; IRIWHO Collaborating Center (430) Malaria Early Warning and Other Climate Sensitive Diseases; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"AM was supported by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, under the auspices of the National Earth System Prediction Capability.

This paper addresses the underwater light climate, with reference to effects of suspended solids and growth responses of autotrophs with emphasis on phytoplankton. Effects of the most important factors contributing to the absorption and scattering of light in surface waters were described. A comparison between spectral and scalar approaches to underwater light climate modeling was made and examples of linear approximations to light attenuation equations were presented. It was demonstrated that spectral and scalar photosynthesis models may converge to similar values in spectral-flat, high photon flux environments, but that scalar PAR models may overestimate biomass-specific production by 70%. Such differences can lead to serious overestimates of habitat suitability for the growth and survival of submersed macrophytes, particularly in relatively turbid, coastal waters. Relationships between physical and optical properties of suspended sediments were described theoretically, and illustrated with modeling examples and measurements. It was found that the slowly settling particulate fraction contributed substantially to the suspended solids concentration, and greatly to light attenuation within the water column. It was concluded that distinguishing particles by fall velocity and concomitant light attenuation properties in the modeling of underwater light conditions allowed the establishment of useful, although not simply linear, relationships. In eutrophic, shallow lakes, the largest contribution to light attenuation often originates from phytoplankton on a seasonal basis (months-years), but from suspended solids behavior on a shorter time scale (days-weeks), particularly when water bodies are wind-exposed. Temporal and spatial variabilities in wave height, suspended solids concentrations, and light attenuation within the water column, and their importance for autotrophic growth were described, and illustrated with a case study pertaining to Markermeer, The Netherlands. The influence of underwater light conditions on phytoplankton succession was briefly discussed and illustrated with a case study pertaining to Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands. It was concluded that modeling the underwater light climate in a water body on a few sites only can indicate how important various components are for the attenuation of light, but based on the current state of the art, it can not be expected that this will provide accurate predictions of the underwater light climate, and of phytoplankton and submersed macrophyte growth.","Waterboard Rijnland, NL-2300 AA Leiden, Netherlands; RWS RIZA, Inst Water Qual Management & Waste Water Treatmen, NL-3316 AV Dordrecht, Netherlands; Delft Hydraul Lab, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; USA, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Environm Lab, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA",Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); Geospatial Research Laboratory (GRL),"Van Duin, EHS (corresponding author), Waterboard Rijnland, POB 156, NL-2300 AA Leiden, Netherlands.",,,"Zimmerman, Richard/0000-0002-9399-4264",,,,,50,109,116,4,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,FEB,2001,3-Jan,,,,25,42,,10.1023/A:1017512614680,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017512614680,,,18,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,426DK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000168334400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Debates about the sustainable city are too often dominated by a technological discourse conducted among professional experts, but this technocratic framing is open to challenge. For some critics, sustainability is a meaningless notion, yet for others its semantic pliability opens up discursive spaces through which to explore interconnections across time, space, and scale. Thus, while enacting sustainability in policy and practice is an arduous task, we can productively ask how cultural imaginations might be stirred and shaken to make sustainability accessible to a wider public who might join the conversation. What role, we ask, can and should the arts play in wider debates about sustainability in the city today? We explore a coproduced artwork in the northeast of England in order to explain how practice-led research methods were put into dialogue with the social sciences to activate new perspectives on the politics, aesthetics, and practices of sustainability. The case is presented to argue that creative material experimentations can be used as an active research inquiry through which ideas can be tested without knowing predefined means or ends. The case shows how such creativity acts as a catalyst to engage a heterogeneous mix of actors in the redefinition of urban spaces, juxtaposing past and present, with the ephemeral and the (seemingly) durable.","[Connelly, Angela] Univ Manchester, Manchester Architecture Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Guy, Simon C.] Univ Lancaster, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Lancaster, England; [Wainwright, Edward] Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Weileder, Wolfgang; Wilde, Marianne] Newcastle Univ, Sch Arts & Cultures, Fine Art, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Manchester; Lancaster University; Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK,"Connelly, A (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Architecture Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,"Connelly, Angela/AAG-5127-2019","Guy, Simon Charles/0000-0003-1507-5067; Connelly, Angela/0000-0003-1040-8678",Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK) [AH/K006932/1]; AHRC [AH/K006932/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/K006932/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This research was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK) as The Jetty Project (http://www.jetty-project.info) with the grant reference: AH/K006932/1.

The depth-age relationship of the sediment core was established using 14 AMS C-14 dates and the Laacher See Tephra. While stable isotopes of bulk carbonates may have been affected by detrital input and, therefore, only indirectly reflect climatic changes, isotopes measured on ostracod shells provide unambiguous evidence for major environmental changes. Oxygen isotope ratios of ostracod shells (delta O-18(C)) increased by similar to 6 parts per thousand at the onset of the Bolling (similar to 14,650 cal BP) and were similar to 2 parts per thousand lower during the Younger Dryas (similar to 12,850 to 11,650 cal BP), indicating a temporal pattern of climate changes similar to the North Atlantic region. However, in contrast to records in that region, delta O-18(C) gradually decreased during the early Holocene, suggesting that compared to the Younger Dryas more humid conditions occurred and that the lake received gradually increasing input of O-18-depleted groundwater or river water.","[Finsinger, Walter; Lotter, Andre F.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Biol, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Blockley, Simon P.

We analyzed current and future technology routes leading to 15 bulk chemicals using industrial biotechnology and calculated their CO2 emissions and fossil energy use. Savings of more than 100% in nonrenewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are already possible with current state of the art biotechnology. Substantial further savings are possible for the future by improved fermentation and downstream processing. Worldwide CO2 savings in the range of 500-1000 million tons per year are possible using future technology. Industrial biotechnology hence offers excellent opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing dependence on fossil energy sources and therefore has the potential to make inroads into the existing chemical industry.,"Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Hermann, BG (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.g.hermann@uu.nl,"Blok, Kornelis/D-9532-2014; Patel, Martin/N-6853-2013","Patel, Martin/0000-0002-3983-6003; Blok, Kornelis/0000-0003-4869-6927",,,,,33,155,157,2,47,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Nevertheless, several approaches can be used to allow for the impact of the urban environment on the dynamic behavior of a building, its heating and cooling demands, and thermal comfort. This state of the art review provides a critical overview of the different methods currently used to take into account the urban microclimate in building design simulations. First, both the microclimate and building models are presented, focusing on their assumptions and capabilities. Second, a few examples of coupling, performed between both modeling scales are analyzed. Last, the discussion highlights the differences obtained between simulations that take the urban context into consideration and those that simplify or neglect urban heat fluxes.

Thus, selecting appropriate Architectural Design Features (ADFs) at the early design stage provides significant opportunities to control heat flows, maximize building energy performance, reduce excessive energy consumption cost, and preserve a comfortable temperature for occupants. In this research, an ArchitecturalBased Energy Impact Scoring System (AEISS) was developed based on inputs from 10 expert architects, and it consists of seven ADFs and 40 multiple design options. The proposed system provides a simple decision scoring system for designers to evaluate design alternatives and optimize the energy consumption of buildings in the early design phase. A simple user-friendly program for the AEISS was developed to assist the designers in generating the design alternatives scores. Energy simulation analyses were performed to validate the applicability of the proposed AEISS by integrating 3-D BIM models of three different design alternatives of a residential building in Saudi Arabia with Ecotect analysis software. A detailed analysis was performed to evaluate the energy impact of the selected ADFs and to compare the alternatives in terms of energy consumptions and cost-efficiency. The simulation results proved that the proposed AEISS gave responsive results and is capable of providing stakeholders with the optimum decision to select the design alternative with high energy performance and low consumption cost.

The methodology proposed combines the SWAN and SWASH wave models to resolve the wave processes from deep waters up to the swash zone in two micro-tidal sandy beaches in Mallorca island, western Mediterranean. In a first step, the modelling approach has been validated with observations from wave gauges and from the shoreline inferred from video monitoring stations, showing a good agreement between them. Afterwards, the modelling set-up has been applied to the 21st century sea level and wave projections under two different climate scenarios, representative concentration pathways RCP45 and RCP85. Sea level projections have been retrieved from state-of-the-art regional estimates, while wave projections were obtained from regional climate models. Changes in the shoreline position have been explored under mean and extreme wave conditions. Our results indicate that the studied beaches would suffer a coastal retreat between 7 and up to 50 m, equivalent to half of the present-day aerial beach surface, under the climate scenarios considered.","[Enriquez, Alejandra R.; Marcos, Marta; Orfila, Alejandro; Gomis, Damia] Univ Illes Balears, CSIC, IMEDEA, Esporles, Spain; [Alvarez-Ellacuria, Amaya] Balearic Isl Coastal Observing & Forecasting Syst, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Mediterraneo de Estudios Avanzados (IMEDEA); Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Enriquez, AR (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears, CSIC, IMEDEA, Esporles, Spain.",a.rodriguez@uib.es,"Marcos, Marta/C-7053-2012","R.

Emissions from wastewater treatment processes and the industrial production of nitric and adipic acid represent nowadays the most important anthropogenic point sources of N2O. Therefore, state-of-the-art strategies to mitigate the generation and release to the atmosphere of this greenhouse and O-3-depleting gas in the waste treatment and industrial sectors are also reviewed. An updated review of the end-of-the-pipe technologies for N2O abatement, both in the waste treatment and industrial sectors, is herein presented and critically discussed for the first time. Despite the consistent efforts recently conducted in the development of cost-efficient and eco-friendly N2O abatement technologies, physical/chemical technologies still constitute the most popular treatments for the control of industrial N2O emissions at commercial scale. The recent advances achieved on biological N2O abatement based on heterotrophic denitrification have opened new opportunities for the development of ecofriendly alternatives for the treatment of N2O emissions. Finally, the main limitations and challenges faced by these novel N2O abatement biotechnologies are identified in order to pave the way for market implementation.","[Frutos, Osvaldo D.; Aizpuru, Aitor; Munoz, Raul] Univ Valladolid, Dept Chem Engn & Environm Technol, Dr Mergelina S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Frutos, Osvaldo D.] Univ Nacl Asuncion, Fac Ciencias Agr, Campus San Lorenzo, San Lorenzo, Paraguay; [Quijano, Guillermo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Unidad Acad Juriquilla, Lab Res Adv Proc Water Treatment, Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Aizpuru, Aitor] Univ Mar, Cuerpo Acad Biotecnol Ambiental, Campus Puerto Angel, San Pedro Pochutla 70902, Mexico",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad Nacional de Asuncion; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Munoz, R (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Chem Engn & Environm Technol, Dr Mergelina S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",mutora@iq.uva.es,"Quijano, Guillermo/H-9827-2019; Aizpuru, Aitor/N-1214-2019; González, Osvaldo David Frutos/H-3300-2015; Muñoz, Raul/E-6493-2010","Quijano, Guillermo/0000-0002-5821-4234; Aizpuru, Aitor/0000-0001-9212-6513; González, Osvaldo David Frutos/0000-0002-8663-4922; Muñoz, Raul/0000-0003-1207-6275",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2015-70442-R]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Red NOVEDAR projects); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT (Paraguay) [PVCT17-249]; European Commission through the Erasmus Mundus Program BABEL [BA12FD1059]; FEDER,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Red NOVEDAR projects); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT (Paraguay)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); European Commission through the Erasmus Mundus Program BABEL; FEDER(European Commission),"This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (CTM2015-70442-R and Red NOVEDAR projects), Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT (PVCT17-249) (Paraguay) and the European Commission (BA12FD1059) through the Erasmus Mundus Program BABEL and FEDER Funding Program.",,103,28,30,17,112,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0734-9750,1873-1899,,BIOTECHNOL ADV,Biotechnol.

MFM supports sustainable economic approaches referring to closed materials cycles as well as the implementation of zero-emission strategies in order to reach a Circular Economy. According to the principles of sustainable development, MFM must consider environmental, economic and social aspects. The advantages of a Circular Economy with the MFM approach are: (1) More profits through higher system efficiency; (2) Less ecological impact through new technologies and intelligent concepts; (3) Optimized utilization of own potentials; (4) Enhancement of regional added value.

The assessment is done with the ESP-r whole building integrated simulation program in order to account for the dynamic optical properties of thermochromic glass in integrated simulations. The glazing systems are assessed for hot, cold and significantly varying between hot and cold climates. Annual heating and cooling energy requirements were quantified and short-period simulations were also run to assess the effect of the glazing systems on indoor temperatures. It was found that thermochromic glazing could significantly reduce cooling loads in hot climates and where cooling could be a significant building energy load (by approximately 30% in comparison with the other glazing systems). On the other hand, thermochromic glass could have a negative impact in cold climates where the use of heat mirror glazing systems could offer the highest energy savings even when compared with the triple glazed window. In seasonally varying climates and for highly glazed office buildings in which simultaneous high internal and solar heat gains are likely to occur, the use of thermochromic glass is an appropriate technique for saving energy and improving thermal comfort.

A standalone fire model (SFM) based on a state-of-the-art large-scale forest fire modelling algorithm is used to explore fuel removal through prescribed burnings and improved fire suppression as adaptation options. The climate change projections are provided by three climate models reflecting the SRES A2 scenario. The SFM's modelled burned areas for selected test countries in Europe show satisfying agreement with observed data coming from two different sources (European Forest Fire Information System and Global Fire Emissions Database). Our estimation of the potential increase in burned areas in Europe under no adaptation scenario is about 200 % by 2090 (compared with 2000-2008). The application of prescribed burnings has the potential to keep that increase below 50 %. Improvements in fire suppression might reduce this impact even further, e.g. boosting the probability of putting out a fire within a day by 10 % would result in about a 30 % decrease in annual burned areas. By taking more adaptation options into consideration, such as using agricultural fields as fire breaks, behavioural changes, and long-term options, burned areas can be potentially reduced further than projected in our analysis.","[Khabarov, Nikolay; Krasovskii, Andrey; Obersteiner, Michael] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Swart, Rob] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dosio, Alessandro; Durrant, Tracy; Camia, Andrea] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Wageningen University & Research; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Max Planck Society,"Khabarov, N (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",khabarov@iiasa.ac.at,"Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017; Migliavacca, Mirco/J-9986-2019","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; Krasovskiy, Andrey/0000-0003-0940-9366; Obersteiner, Michael/0000-0001-6981-2769","European Commission [244012]; EU [226701, 282746, 603906]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); EU(European Commission),"We thank Anatoly Shvidenko, Brian Walsh, Sandy Bisaro, Silvia Kloster, Christian Siderius, and Dan Ward for discussion, reviews, useful comments, and help.

In this study, 11 hybrid grapevines grown in cold climates were assessed in terms of flowering biology and pollination efficiency. The flowers were evaluated for the number of anthers and pollen grains in the flower; pollen viability and pollen grain size, the number of ovules in the ovary, and, consequently, the size and the weight of berries and the number of seeds in the berries were also analyzed. The flowers of Vitis vinifera L. usually have 5 stamens and 5 petals in their structure; this number for hybrid varieties ranged from 4 to 7, and in the case of the variety 'Seyval Blanc', it was 4 to 11 stamen and petals. Pollen grain size varied and ranged from 17.01 to 22.25 mu m, while pollen grain pro-duction in flowers ranged from 5073 to 34,976 grain, which was calculated using a Burker hemocytometer. The number of ovules in the ovary for the cultivars in question was highly variable, ranging from 3 to 7. One of the most important factors affecting flower pollination is stigma receptivity. Stigma receptivity appeared when the cap starts to fall off and disappeared at the browning of the cap. In connection with climatic changes, grapevine production is expanding to cool-climate countries. The aim of this study was to expand our knowledge about the flower morphology of 11 hybrid grapevine varieties most commonly cultivated in Poland. Knowledge of the flowering process can be important for improving yield and its quality.","[Kowalczyk, Barbara Anna] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Ornamental Plants & Garden Art, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Bieniasz, Monika] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Hort, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Kostecka-Gugala, Anna] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Plant Biol & Biotechnol, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow,"Kowalczyk, BA (corresponding author), Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Ornamental Plants & Garden Art, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland.",barbara.kowalczyk@urk.edu.pl; bieniasz.monika@urk.edu.pl; anna.kostecka-gugala@urk.edu.pl,"Kostecka-Gugała, Anna/M-7712-2019","Kostecka-Gugała, Anna/0000-0002-8298-9419; Kowalczyk, Barbara Anna/0000-0002-2051-6421",Ministry of Education and Science of Poland,Ministry of Education and Science of Poland,This research was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of Poland as a part of a research subsidy to the University of Agriculture in Krakow.,,68,0,0,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAY,2022,5,,,,,,655,10.3390/agriculture12050655,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12050655,,,18,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,1Q3AL,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000802564700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is accomplished by integrating skill-building lessons and tools so that teachers and students develop their emotional literacy. In a clustered randomized control trial, we tested the hypothesis that RULER improves the social and emotional climate of classrooms. Depending upon condition assignment, 62 schools either integrated RULER into fifth- and sixth-grade English language arts (ELA) classrooms or served as comparison schools, using their standard ELA curriculum only. Multi-level modeling analyses showed that compared to classrooms in comparison schools, classrooms in RULER schools were rated as having higher degrees of warmth and connectedness between teachers and students, more autonomy and leadership among students, and teachers who focused more on students' interests and motivations.

If such instability occurs, there would be considerable uncertainty in future sea-level rise projections due to imperfectly modeled ice sheet processes and unpredictable climate variability. In this study, we use mathematical and computational approaches to identify the ice sheet processes that drive uncertainty in sea-level projections. Using stochastic perturbation theory from statistical physics as a tool, we show mathematically that the marine ice sheet instability greatly amplifies and skews uncertainty in sea-level projections with worst-case scenarios of rapid sea-level rise being more likely than best-case scenarios of slower sea-level rise. We also perform large ensemble simulations with a state-of-the-art ice sheet model of Thwaites Glacier, a marine-terminating glacier in West Antarctica that is thought to be unstable. These ensemble simulations indicate that the uncertainty solely related to internal climate variability can be a large fraction of the total ice loss expected from Thwaites Glacier. We conclude that internal climate variability alone can be responsible for significant uncertainty in projections of sea-level rise and that large ensembles are a necessary tool for quantifying the upper bounds of this uncertainty.","[Robel, Alexander A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA; [Seroussi, Helene] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Roe, Gerard H.] Univ Washington, Earth & Space Sci Dept, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Robel, AA (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA.",robel@eas.gatech.edu,"Seroussi, Helene/AAX-5342-2021","Seroussi, Helene/0000-0001-9201-1644; Robel, Alexander/0000-0003-4520-0105","NASA Cryospheric Science and Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Programs; NSF [PLR-1643299, PLR-1735715]","NASA Cryospheric Science and Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Programs; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","M.

In a warmer climate, increasing rainfall and changing snowmelt rates could lead to significant shifts in flood-generating mechanisms. Here, projected changes to flood-generating mechanisms in terms of the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall are assessed across Canada, based on an ensemble of transient climate change simulations performed using a state-of-the-art regional climate model. Changes to flood-generating mechanisms are assessed for both a late 21st century, high warming (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) scenario, and in a 2 degrees C global warming context. Under 2 degrees C of global warming, the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to streamflow peaks is projected to remain close to that of the current climate, despite slightly increased rainfall contribution. In contrast, a high warming scenario leads to widespread increases in rainfall contribution and the emergence of hotspots of change in currently snowmelt-dominated regions across Canada. In addition, several regions in southern Canada would be projected to become rainfall dominated. These contrasting projections highlight the importance of climate change mitigation, as remaining below the 2 degrees C global warming threshold can avoid large changes over most regions, implying a low likelihood that expensive flood adaptation measures would be necessary.","[Teufel, Bernardo; Sushama, Laxmi] McGill Univ, Trottier Inst Sustainabil Engn & Design, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada",McGill University,"Teufel, B (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Trottier Inst Sustainabil Engn & Design, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada.",bernardo.teufel@mail.mcgill.ca; laxmi.sushama@mcgill.ca,,"Teufel, Bernardo/0000-0003-1331-2030",Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was funded by the Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,50,1,1,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2021,11,,,,,,1494,10.3390/w13111494,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13111494,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,SR1QQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000660819700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both ensembles were integrated for seven months (November-May) over a 12-yr period from 1987 to 1998. Examination of the sea surface temperature and precipitation show that while deterministic skill scores are slightly better for the multicoupled model ensemble the probabilistic skill scores favor the multimodel approach. Combining the two ensembles to create a larger ensemble size increases the probabilistic skill score compared to the multimodel. This altering physics approach to create a multimodel ensemble is seen as an easy way for small modeling centers to generate ensembles with better reliability than by only varying the initial conditions.","Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"LaRow, TE (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",larow@coaps.fsu.edu,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

To provide useful insights for the 2018 UNFCCC Talanoa facilitative dialogue, we use eight state-of-the-art climate-energy-economy models to assess the effectiveness of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in meeting high probability 1.5 and 2 degrees C stabilization goals. We estimate that the implementation of conditional INDCs in 2030 leaves an emissions gap from least cost 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C pathways for year 2030 equal to 15.6 (9.0-20.3) and 24.6 (18.5-29.0) GtCO(2)eq respectively. The immediate transition to a more efficient and low-carbon energy system is key to achieving the Paris goals. The decarbonization of the power supply sector delivers half of total CO2 emission reductions in all scenarios, primarily through high penetration of renewables and energy efficiency improvements. In combination with an increased electrification of final energy demand, low-carbon power supply is the main short-term abatement option. We find that the global macroeconomic cost of mitigation efforts does not reduce the 2020-2030 annual GDP growth rates in any model more than 0.1 percentage points in the INDC or 0.3 and 0.5 in the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C scenarios respectively even without accounting for potential co-benefits and avoided climate damages. Accordingly, the median GDP reductions across all models in 2030 are 0.4%, 1.2% and 3.3% of reference GDP for each respective scenario. Costs go up with increasing mitigation efforts but a fragmented action, as implied by the INDCs, results in higher costs per unit of abated emissions. On a regional level, the cost distribution is different across scenarios while fossil fuel exporters see the highest GDP reductions in all INDC, 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C scenarios.","[Vrontisi, Zoi; Saveyn, Bert; Keramidas, Kimon; Kitous, Alban] European Commiss, JRC, Seville 41092, Spain; [Luderer, Gunnar; Baumstark, Lavinia; Bertram, Christoph; Kriegler, Elmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Leibniz Assoc, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [de Boer, Harmen Sytze; van Vuuren, Detlef] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, The Hague, Netherlands; [Reisa, Lara Alelui; Drouet, Laurent] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Reisa, Lara Alelui; Drouet, Laurent] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Fragkiadakis, Kostas; Paroussos, Leonidas] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Inst Commun & Comp Syst, Lab E3M, 9 Iroon Politech St,Zografou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece; [Fricko, Oliver; Krey, Volker] IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Guivarch, Celine; Broin, Eoin O.] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Cired, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [de Boer, Harmen Sytze; van Vuuren, Detlef] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, Utrecht, Netherlands",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Fondazione Mattei; National Technical University of Athens; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Utrecht University,"Saveyn, B (corresponding author), European Commiss, JRC, Seville 41092, Spain.",bert.saveyn@ec.europa.eu,"Luderer, Gunnar/ABF-2346-2020; Bertram, Christoph/AAT-9651-2020; Drouet, Laurent/J-9894-2019; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; van Vuuren, Detlef P./A-4764-2009; Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012; Fricko, Oliver/ABE-5732-2020; Guivarch, Celine/D-9772-2019; Kriegler, Elmar/I-3048-2016; Broin, Eoin Ó/AAF-6032-2021; Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Fragkiadakis, Kostas/AAG-9660-2020","Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Bertram, Christoph/0000-0002-0933-4395; Drouet, Laurent/0000-0002-4087-7662; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; van Vuuren, Detlef P./0000-0003-0398-2831; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Fricko, Oliver/0000-0002-6835-9883; Guivarch, Celine/0000-0002-9405-256X; Kriegler, Elmar/0000-0002-3307-2647; Broin, Eoin Ó/0000-0003-0447-2032; Fragkiadakis, Kostas/0000-0002-1129-0360; Aleluia Reis, Lara/0000-0002-6676-7007; Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515; VRONTISI, ZOI/0000-0003-3767-0617; Paroussos, Leonidas/0000-0001-8251-7270",European Union's Seventh Programme FP7 [308329],European Union's Seventh Programme FP7,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no. 308329 (ADVANCE).

Detecting small changes in signal over decades is a major challenge not only to the retrieval of geophysical parameters from satellite observations, but more importantly to the current state-of-the-art calibration, since such small changes can easily be obscured by erroneous variations in the calibration, especially for instruments with no onboard calibration, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Without dependable FCDRs, its derivative Thematic Climate Data Records (TCDRs) are bound to produce false trends with questionable scientific value. This has been increasingly recognized by more and more remote sensing scientists. In this study we analyzed the consistency of calibrated reflectance from the operational L1B data between AVHRR on NOAA-16 and -17 and between NOAA-16/AVHRR and Aqua/MODIS, based on Simultaneous Nadir Overpass (SNO) observation time series. Analyses suggest that the NOAA-16 and -17/AVHRR operationally calibrated reflectance became consistent two years after the launch of NOAA-17, although they still differ by 9% from the MODIS reflectance for the 0.63 mm band. This study also suggests that the SNO method has reached a high level of relative accuracy (similar to 1.5%) for estimating the consistency for both the 0.63 and 0.84 mm bands between AVHRRs, and a 0.9% relative accuracy between AVHRR and MODIS for the 0.63 mm band. It is believed that the methodology is applicable to all historical AVHRR data for improving the calibration consistency, and work is in progress generating FCDRs from the nearly 30 years of AVHRR data using the SNO and other complimentary methods. A more consistent historical AVHRR L1B data set will be produced for a variety of geophysical products including aerosol, vegetation, cloud, and surface albedo to support global climate change detection studies.","[Cao, Changyong; Wu, Xiangqian] Off Res & Applicat, NOAA, NESDIS, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA; [Wu, Aisheng] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD 20706 USA; [Xiong, Xiaoxiong] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Sci Explorat Directorate Code 614 4, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Science Systems and Applications Inc; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Cao, CY (corresponding author), Off Res & Applicat, NOAA, NESDIS, E RA1,Room 810,WWB,5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.",changyong.cao@noaa.gov,"Wu, Xiangqian/F-5634-2010; Cao, Changyong/AAP-7605-2021; Cao, Changyong/F-5578-2010","Wu, Xiangqian/0000-0002-7804-5650; Cao, Changyong/0000-0003-3572-6525; Cao, Changyong/0000-0003-3572-6525",,,,,19,73,75,0,15,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The paper outlines the latest state-of-the-art approaches to assess loss and damage and the risk of loss and damage. Against this background, a more in-depth analysis is provided on how to assess the risk of loss and damage in different country groups (i.e., World Bank income groups) focusing on selected slow- and sudden-onset climate-related hazards using the concept of the WorldRiskIndex. The results underscore that the risks of loss and damage for low- and high-income countries are significantly different, but also that global risk patterns differ significantly regarding sudden-onset versus slow-onset hazards. In the first step of analysis, the results show that not only does exposure to extreme events influence the risk of loss and damage, but equally important are the vulnerability and adaptive capacities of societies. The second step of analysis shows that target-oriented adaptive strategies to the various impacts of climate-related hazards are crucial in reducing the respective risk of loss and damage.","[Birkmann, Joern; Welle, Torsten] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",,"Birkmann, J (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, UN Campus Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",birkmann@ehs.unu.edu; welle@ehs.unu.edu,"Birkmann, Joern jb/J-5736-2015","Birkmann, Joern/0000-0001-8733-3964",,,,,24,42,44,5,28,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-2083,1758-2091,,INT J GLOBAL WARM,Int.

Such interventions could reduce risks in novel ways, but are controversial because they present an uncertain, high-stakes mix of potential benefits and risks. Solar geoengineering poses especially acute international governance needs, particularly in the case of potential future demands to use it. Many aspects of geoengineering present deep, ill structured uncertainties that carry high stakes for near-term decisions, and are thus suitable for exploration through scenarios. This collection of papers reports on a major scenario exercise examining governance challenges and potential responses for solar geoengineering, held at the International Summer School on Geoengineering Governance in Banff, Canada in 2019.

The article tracks the tactics used by what became the BPC (British Phosphate Commissioners) in extracting phosphate from the island, resulting in the removal of 90 per cent of its soil and simultaneously alienating Banabans from their land, livelihoods and culture. This process took place over 80 years, finally ending in 1981. In the course of this extraction, Banabans were removed from what was fast becoming an uninhabitable environment in 1945, when they began life on the Fijian island of Rabi. This article reflects on the ongoing legacy of bitterness and grief experienced by Banabans, together with their attempts at obtaining restitution from the Company and the governments it represented. In this context, the art installation Project Banaba (2017; 2019) by Katerina Teaiwa is considered as a response to these histories. The article concludes with an examination of the literature that considers the removal of Banabans as a test case for climate-induced migration, noting that the singularity of the Banaban experience is not likely to be repeated, while also acknowledging the ongoing legacy of loss and grief for Banabans.","[Treagus, Mandy] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Treagus, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",,,,,,,,34,0,0,4,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",1759-7188,1759-7196,,J HUM RIGHTS ENVIRON,J.

Biases in simulation of the amplitude and northward propagation of MISOs and related dry rainfall bias over ISM region in climate models are limiting the current skill of monsoon prediction. Recent observations indicate that the convective microphysics of clouds may be critical in simulating the observed MISOs. The hypothesis is strongly supported by high fidelity in simulation of the amplitude and space-time spectra of MISO by a coupled climate model, when our physically based modified cloud microphysics scheme is implemented in conjunction with a modified new Simple Arakawa Schubert (nSAS) convective parameterization scheme. Improved simulation of MISOs appears to have been aided by much improved simulation of the observed high cloud fraction and convective to stratiform rain fractions and resulted into a much improved simulation of the ISM rainfall, monsoon onset, and the annual cycle.","[Hazra, Anupam; Chaudhari, Hemantkumar S.; Saha, Subodh Kumar; Pokhrel, Samir] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Goswami, B.

In the analysis, a set of independent climatological, satellite, soil-and vegetation-specific data was used. Soil-and plant-specific data were taken from the literature. Of plant-specific data, the plant coefficient data determined by evapotranspirometer measurements were used. The soil texture at Szarvas is clay. The estimation method of r(c) is based on calculating the ratio between the actual and potential evapotranspiration, which is a proven method for climatological applications. It is found that r(c) is mainly governed by the changes of the available water in the soil. It is also found that r(c) variations induced by variations of the available water in the soil are much larger than r(c) variations induced by plant species changes represented by plant coefficients. The analysis showed that some results obtained in the faraway past can also be successfully used for state of the art biophysical modeling purposes in the meteorology.","[Breuer, Hajnalka; Acs, Ferenc] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, H-1518 Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University,"Breuer, H (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, POB 32, H-1518 Budapest, Hungary.",bhajni@nimbus.elte.hu; acs@caesar.elte.hu,"Breuer, Hajnalka/H-6895-2012; Ács, Ferenc/H-7876-2012; Breuer, Hajni/AAK-3599-2020","Breuer, Hajnalka/0000-0002-0271-095X; Breuer, Hajni/0000-0002-0271-095X",,,,,33,1,1,0,5,HUNGARIAN METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE,BUDAPEST,"PO BOX 39, BUDAPEST, H-1675, HUNGARY",0324-6329,,,IDOJARAS,Idojaras,JUL-SEP,2010,3,,,,203,215,,,,,,13,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,650HI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000281839400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we investigate how hydrological low flows are affected under different levels of future global warming (i.e. 1.5, 2, and 3K with respect to the pre-industrial period) in rivers with a contributing area of more than 1000 km(2). The analysis is based on a multi-model ensemble of 45 hydrological simulations based on three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP6.0, RCP8.5), five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs: GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, NorESM1-M) and three state-of-the-art hydrological models (HMs: mHM, Noah-MP, and PCR-GLOBWB). High-resolution model results are available at a spatial resolution of 5 km across the pan-European domain at a daily temporal resolution. Low river flow is described as the percentile of daily streamflow that is exceeded 90% of the time. It is determined separately for each GCM/HM combination and warming scenario. The results show that the low-flow change signal amplifies with increasing warming levels. Low flows decrease in the Mediterranean region, while they increase in the Alpine and Northern regions. In the Mediterranean, the level of warming amplifies the signal from -12% under 1.5 K, compared to the baseline period 1971-2000, to 35% under global warming of 3 K, largely due to the projected decreases in annual precipitation. In contrast, the signal is amplified from +22 (1.5 K) to +45% (3 K) in the Alpine region due to changes in snow accumulation. The changes in low flows are significant for regions with relatively large change signals and under higher levels of warming. However, it is not possible to distinguish climate-induced differences in low flows between 1.5 and 2K warming because of (1) the large inter-annual variability which prevents distinguishing statistical estimates of period-averaged changes for a given GCM/HM combination, and (2) the uncertainty in the multi-model ensemble expressed by the signal-to-noise ratio. The contribution by the GCMs to the uncertainty in the model results is generally higher than the one by the HMs. However, the uncertainty due to HMs cannot be neglected. In the Alpine, Northern, and Mediterranean regions, the uncertainty contribution by the HMs is partly higher than those by the GCMs due to different representations of processes such as snow, soil moisture and evapotranspiration. Based on the analysis results, it is recommended (1) to use multiple HMs in climate impact studies and (2) to embrace uncertainty information on the multi-model ensemble as well as its single members in the adaptation process.","[Marx, Andreas; Kumar, Rohini; Thober, Stephan; Rakovec, Oldrich; Zink, Matthias; Samaniego, Luis] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany; [Wanders, Niko] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Wanders, Niko; Wood, Eric F.; Pan, Ming] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Sheffield, Justin] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Rakovec, Oldrich] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Utrecht University; Princeton University; University of Southampton; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Marx, A (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany.",klima@ufz.de,"Samaniego, Luis/G-8651-2011; Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013; Zink, Matthias/L-2497-2016; Wanders, Niko/AAJ-2334-2021; Pan, Ming/B-6841-2011; Rakovec, Oldrich/N-5512-2015","Samaniego, Luis/0000-0002-8449-4428; Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037; Zink, Matthias/0000-0003-4085-7626; Wanders, Niko/0000-0002-7102-5454; Pan, Ming/0000-0003-3350-8719; Rakovec, Oldrich/0000-0003-2451-3305; Marx, Andreas/0000-0001-8173-2569; Thober, Stephan/0000-0003-3939-1523; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LS1611A]; Copernicus Climate Change Service; NWO Rubicon [825.15.003]; EU FP6 integrated project ensembles [505539],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Copernicus Climate Change Service; NWO Rubicon(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); EU FP6 integrated project ensembles(European Commission),"This study was funded within the scope of the HOKLIM project (www.ufz.de/hoklim) by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, grant no. 01LS1611A).

However, there is a shortage of freshwater in many areas worldwide. Desalination seems to be the most suitable solution. Major conventional desalination processes, such as distillation and reverse osmosis, consume a large amount of energy derived from oil and natural gas as heat and electricity, which is responsible for harmful CO2 emission. Solar desalination has emerged as a promising renewable energy-powered technology for producing freshwater. Solar membrane distillation (MD) is the best option in decentralized regions with scattered population and lack of infrastructures jointly with hard climate conditions make it difficult or at least not cost-effective to scale down bigger desalination technologies, such as RO or MSF, designed for very big water productions. Moreover, MD compared to conventional thermal desalination is less demanding regarding vapor space and building material's quality leading to potential lower construction costs. The aim of this paper is to present the state-of-the-art review of developments in solar MD technology. In this review, membrane configurations, module design, and recent applications of this technology were discussed in detail.","[Zhani, K.; Zarzoum, K.; Ben Bacha, H.] Natl Engn Sch Sfax, LASEM LAb Syst Electromecan, BP W3038, Sfax, Tunisia; [Ben Bacha, H.] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Coll Engn Alkharj, POB 655, Alkharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Koschikowski, J.] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energie Syst ISE, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Pfeifle, D.] SolarSpring GmbH, Hanferstr 28, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany",Universite de Sfax; Ecole Nationale dIngenieurs de Sfax (ENIS); Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Zhani, K (corresponding author), Natl Engn Sch Sfax, LASEM LAb Syst Electromecan, BP W3038, Sfax, Tunisia.",zhani_khalifa@yahoo.fr; hbacha@Ksu.edu.sa; joachim.koschikowski@ise.fraunhofer.de; Daniel.pfeifle@solarspring.de,"ben bacha, habib/GRR-2164-2022; zhani, khalifa/ABC-8767-2020",,,,,,38,15,16,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

This study evaluated the capability of 30 state-of-the-art climate models among the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in simulating its association with the atmospheric circulations over the Asian-Pacific region and the precipitation over East Asia. Furthermore, their future connections under the RCP8.5 scenario were examined. The evaluation results show that 5 out of 30 climate models can well capture the observed APO-related features in a comprehensive way, including the strengthened South Asian high (SAH), deepened North Pacific trough (NPT) and northward East Asian jet (EAJ) in the upper troposphere; an intensification of the Asian low and the North Pacific subtropical high (NPSH) as well as a northward shift of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) in the lower troposphere; and a decrease in East Asian summer rainfall (EASR) under the positive APO phase. Based on the five CMIP5 models' simulations, the dynamic linkages of the APO to the SAH, NPT, AL, and NPSH are projected to maintain during the second half of the twenty-first century. However, its connection with the EASR tends to reduce significantly. Such a reduction might result from the weakening of the linkage of the APO to the meridional displacement of the EAJ and WPSH as a response to the warming scenario.","[Zhou, Botao; Xu, Ying; Shi, Ying] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Botao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Zhou, BT (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Zhou, BT (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhoubt@cma.gov.cn,,,"U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41275078, 41675069]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0600701]; Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology) [GYHY201306026]",U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Program's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and thank climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output.

In many ways, the VINCERA project was intended to be a continental scale extension of the US-focused Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP; VEMAP members, 1995; http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/vemap/) carried out by a large group of researchers in the late 1990s. Two dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) (MC1 and SDGVM) were compared, each driven by the same suite of six scenarios of future climate taken from the projections simulated by three state-of-the-art global climate models (CSIRO, CGCM2, HadCM3). A continental soils dataset was also constructed from available data to ensure as much consistency as possible in the forcing datasets. Results showed that differences in the results of the two vegetation models resulting from their different treatments of the CO 2 fertilization effect (moderate enhancement of water use efficiency in MC1, large effect in SDGVM) and their simulation of wildfires (fixed annual burn rate in SDVM, climate- and fuel-type-driven fire events in MC1) were larger than differences in their responses to climate futures and emission scenarios.

One school of thought maintains that these processes lasted several thousand years ('protracted model' with 'gathering', 'cultivation' and 'domestication' as three stages of a continuum, each taking up to several thousand years), while another favors the view that domestication occurred much more quickly, over several hundred years at most ('rapid transition'). Our study focuses on one of these crops, 1-grained domesticated Einkorn wheat, incorporating data from geology, vegetation history, and climate. In the Karacadag region of southeastern Turkey, where 1-grained Einkorn wheat was domesticated, the climate was severe (i.e. cold and dry) during the Younger Dryas. The climate of the Younger Dryas acted as boundary during which a) conditions were not suitable for 'cultivation', and b) Einkorn would have retreated to refugia exhibiting more suitable moisture-bearing soils that would have made 'gathering' difficult. Around 11600 cal. b.p., the Younger Dryas ended and a very rapid climatic amelioration commenced at the beginning of the Early Holocene, enabling grasses to spread throughout the region. A ritual PPNA/PPNB site (Gobekli Tepe) and associated PPNB settlements such as Nevali Cori and Cayonu were established at this time. In the settlements of Nevali Cori and Cafer Hoyuk, the oldest domesticated Einkorn was found in the earliest archaeological layers. This confirms that the inhabitants made use of domesticated 1-grained Einkorn from the very beginning of settlement activity, although they continued to practice a mixed lifestyle as hunter-gatherers and farmers. For Cayonu the issue is more complex, but here domesticated Einkorn also appears around the same time. In summary, by 10400 cal. b.p. domesticated 1-grained Einkorn was present in large quantities at a variety of sites. This would give a maximum window of time lasting approximately 1,200 years and is therefore not in agreement with the 'protracted' model but would be consistent with a 'rapid transition'. It is improbable that the 'cultivation' of wild Einkorn was practiced in the Karacadag region, since wild Einkorn was plentiful during the favorable growing conditions following the Younger Dryas, making it more likely that 'gathering' would have been practiced. Because Einkorn has not been found in early settlements in the southern Levant, this crop cannot have been 'gathered' and 'cultivated' there but instead was 'domesticated' independently and solely in southeastern Turkey. Therefore, the YD acts as a boundary, providing a maximum time frame for 1-grained Einkorn domestication.","[Haldorsen, Sylvi; Heun, Manfred] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, N-1430 As, Norway; [Akan, Hasan; Celik, Bahattin] Harran Univ, Sci & Art Fac, TR-63200 Osmanbey, Sanliurfa, Turkey",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Harran University,"Heun, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, POB 5003, N-1430 As, Norway.",manfred.heun@umb.no,"ÇELİK, Bahattin/AAB-7032-2020; Akan, Hasan/ABF-5092-2020","ÇELİK, Bahattin/0000-0003-2630-3379; Akan, Hasan/0000-0002-3033-4349",,,,,94,27,27,2,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0939-6314,1617-6278,,VEG HIST ARCHAEOBOT,Veg.

The simulated chlorophyll concentrations can feedback onto the ocean by modifying the vertical distribution of radiant heating. This fully interactive biological-ocean-atmosphere experiment is compared to a reference experiment that uses a constant chlorophyll concentration (0.06 mg m(-3)). It is shown that introducing an interactive biology acts to warm the surface eastern equatorial Pacific by about 0.5 degrees C. Two competing processes are involved in generating this warming: (a) a direct 1-D biological warming process in the top layers (0-30 m) resulting from strong chlorophyll concentrations in the upwelling region and enhanced by positive dynamical feedbacks ( weaker trade winds, surface currents and upwelling) and (b) a 2-D meridional cooling process which brings cold off-equatorial anomalies from the subsurface into the equatorial mixed layer through the meridional cells. Sensitivity experiments show that the climatological horizontal structure of the chlorophyll field in the upper layers is crucial to maintain the eastern Pacific warming. Concerning the variability, introducing an interactive biology slightly reduces the strength of the seasonal cycle, with stronger SST warming and chlorophyll concentrations during the upwelling season. In addition, ENSO amplitude is slightly increased. Similar experiments performed with another coupled general circulation model (IPSL-CM4) exhibit the same behaviour as in HadOPA, hence showing the robustness of the results.","LOCEAN, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Univ Reading, Ctr Global Atmospher Modeling, Reading, Berks, England; Lab Sci Climat & Envrionm, Saclay, France",Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of Reading; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lengaigne, M (corresponding author), LOCEAN, Couloir 45-55,4Eme Etage,Case 100,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",lengaign@lodyc.jussieu.fr,"Lengaigne, Matthieu/K-4345-2013; bopp, laurent/ABF-5302-2020; menkes, christophe/X-6073-2019; madec, gurvan/E-7825-2010; Aumont, Olivier/G-5207-2016; menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016; Gorgues, Thomas/G-4544-2010","Lengaigne, Matthieu/0000-0002-0044-036X; bopp, laurent/0000-0003-4732-4953; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; madec, gurvan/0000-0002-6447-4198; Aumont, Olivier/0000-0003-3954-506X; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Gorgues, Thomas/0000-0003-0091-0314",,,,,45,98,101,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The objective of this work is to analyse the recharge of groundwater systems in a region with traditional agriculture and current transformations in northern Morocco (Sehoul region) ill response to future climate change and land degradation. Models were used to simulate climate change and effects on surface runoff and groundwater recharge. The climate models indicated increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation in all seasons in 2050 compared to 1990, and all increasing variability of autumn precipitation. Because most cultivated fields are freshly ploughed and sown in autumn, this Will increase the risk of desertification due to declining groundwater recharge and increased surface runoff and erosion. This is confirmed by the results of the event-based surface runoff simulation for the 2050 climate. Surface runoff is mainly produced in ancient grazing fields and fallow fields. In view of the current transformation of collective grazing fields into cultivated land, problems with loss of rainfall in surface runoff and soil erosion could be mitigated by 1. early tillage of cultivated fields along the slope contour, followed by leveling, 2. locating cultivated fields downslope of grazing fields to enable the capturing of diffuse surface runoff coining from the grazing fields, and 3. leaving fallow fields untilled and covered with crop remnants. The groundwater modeling results indicate a decrease of the annual groundwater recharge by rainfall of 40-68% from the climate centered in 1990 to the climate centered in 2050. As a result, groundwater levels are predicted to fall up till 2005, but the results are unreliable due to model errors. However, the decreases in precipitation, infiltration and groundwater recharge predicted in this study may be expected to add to the observed trend of groundwater level decrease in the study area, and to continuing desertification.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra Soil Sci Ctr, NL-6700 HB Wageningen, Netherlands; University Mohammed V, Fac Human Sci & Literature, Rabat, Morocco; Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, Aveiro, Portugal; Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Aveiro, Dept Phys, Aveiro, Portugal",Wageningen University & Research; Mohammed V University in Rabat; Universidade de Aveiro; Utrecht University; Universidade de Aveiro,,,"Schipper, Aafke M/C-2758-2011; Carvalho, Ana Vania/ABB-7776-2020",,European Union-funded CLIMED [ICA3-2000-30005],European Union-funded CLIMED,This work was carried out in the framework of the European Union-funded CLIMED project (ICA3-2000-30005).,,46,17,17,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1871-4668,,1-4020-3758-9,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,NATO Sci.

Mechanically clearing snow and ice wears down the installations more quickly and may present a hazard to the people carrying out the clearing.

This study covers two gaps in the literature: first, the lack of indicating separate hindrances to different types of GRs; second, the dearth of research related to the hindrances on GR adoption in any climate of Iran. This research aims to identify and analyze the importance of hindrances to GR adoption by considering the two major types of GRs using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP), respectively. The results indicated that eight out of twenty-five identified hindrances to GR adoption were rejected using FDM. Moreover, it was found that although financial hindrances are significant for both types of GRs, public awareness is the most important hindrance to extensive GR adoption. As the first research of its kind in a semi-arid climate of Iran, the findings of this research provide an insight for the researchers and policymakers regarding the hindrances to GR adoption for further research and action.","[Zakeri, Seyed Mohammad Hossein] Shiraz Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Shiraz 7194684334, Iran; [Mahdiyar, Amir] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town 11800, Penang, Malaysia",Shiraz University; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Zakeri, SMH (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Shiraz 7194684334, Iran.;Mahdiyar, A (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",zakeri@shirazu.ac.ir; amirmahdiyar@usm.my,"Mahdiyar, Amir/N-8558-2016","Mahdiyar, Amir/0000-0002-8075-5918",Universiti Sains Malaysia,Universiti Sains Malaysia(Universiti Sains Malaysia),"This research was funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia, under short term grant, grant number 304/PPBGN/6315356.

The majority of the world's freshwater area is shallow, typically <= 3 m deep, and polymictic. Freshwaters are rather versatile in their use and have great economical and conservation value. They can be/are often dominated by littoral communities as the water depth is generally shallow enough to support the growth of submerged macrophytes, and the species richness of invertebrates, fish and waterfowl communities is more diverse than in deep lakes. Eutrophication or nutrient enrichment affects the entire aquatic system by altering trophic structure, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, as well as seasonal dynamics. In shallow lakes with low nutrient concentrations (<0.025 mg TP L-1), a clear state dominated by submerged plants often occurs as phytoplankton is nutrient limited. In north temperate shallow lakes, the TP range for coexistence of alternative states varies from ca. 0.025 to ca. 0.15 mg TP L-1. In these lakes, submerged plants stabilize the clear water state through several physico-chemical buffer mechanisms of which some have proven to be weak in warm lakes. An abrupt shift to a turbid state may occur after surpassing a lake-specific nutrient threshold. In warm lakes, internal nutrient cycling is relatively more important and external loading relatively less important than in cold temperate lakes. Warm lakes tend to be more productive than cold lakes with similar nutrient concentrations. With a diverse and abundant omnivorous fish community, the predation pressure on zooplankton is strong, top-down control becomes less important and nutrient control thus emerges as a decisive factor for the water clarity. For cold lakes, restoration methods encompass both bottom-up and top-down controls; however, for warm lakes bottom-up or nutrient control methods appear to be most significant for eutrophication control. As for climate change, warming is likely to exacerbate some symptoms of eutrophication in both cold and warm climates. The structure and functioning of cold temperate shallow lakes are expected to become more similar to those of (sub)tropical shallow lakes, as the temperature increase will enhance the top-down controls of omnivorous and benthivorous fish as well as the nutrient cycling.","[Beklioglu, Meryem; Jeppesen, Erik] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Limnol Lab, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Meerfhoff, Mariana; Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Freshwater Ecol, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Meerfhoff, Mariana] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Meerfhoff, Mariana] Asociac Civil Invest & Desarrollo ID, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Plant Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Middle East Technical University; Aarhus University; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Aarhus University","Beklioglu, M (corresponding author), Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Limnol Lab, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",meryem@metu.edu.tr; mm@dmu.dk,"Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019","Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Søndergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482",,,,,138,38,42,0,24,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-90-481-9624-1,,,,2011,,,,,91,108,,10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8_4,10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8,,18,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BRT36,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000283620400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas earlier SSI observations and models provided a qualitatively consistent picture of the SSI variability, recent measurements by the SORCE (SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment) satellite suggest a significantly stronger variability in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral range and changes in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands in anti-phase with the solar cycle. A number of recent chemistry-climate model (CCM) simulations have shown that this might have significant implications on the Earth's atmosphere. Motivated by these results, we summarize here our current knowledge of SSI variability and its impact on Earth's climate. We present a detailed overview of existing SSI measurements and provide thorough comparison of models available to date. SSI changes influence the Earth's atmosphere, both directly, through changes in shortwave (SW) heating and therefore, temperature and ozone distributions in the stratosphere, and indirectly, through dynamical feedbacks. We investigate these direct and indirect effects using several state-of-the art CCM simulations forced with measured and modelled SSI changes. A unique asset of this study is the use of a common comprehensive approach for an issue that is usually addressed separately by different communities. We show that the SORCE measurements are difficult to reconcile with earlier observations and with SSI models. Of the five SSI models discussed here, specifically NRLSSI (Naval Research Laboratory Solar Spectral Irradiance), SATIRE-S (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstructions for the Satellite era), COSI (COde for Solar Irradiance), SRPM (Solar Radiation Physical Modelling), and OAR (Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma), only one shows a behaviour of the UV and visible irradiance qualitatively resembling that of the recent SORCE measurements. However, the integral of the SSI computed with this model over the entire spectral range does not reproduce the measured cyclical changes of the total solar irradiance, which is an essential requisite for realistic evaluations of solar effects on the Earth's climate in CCMs. We show that within the range provided by the recent SSI observations and semi-empirical models discussed here, the NRLSSI model and SORCE observations represent the lower and upper limits in the magnitude of the SSI solar cycle variation. The results of the CCM simulations, forced with the SSI solar cycle variations estimated from the NRLSSI model and from SORCE measurements, show that the direct solar response in the stratosphere is larger for the SORCE than for the NRLSSI data. Correspondingly, larger UV forcing also leads to a larger surface response. Finally, we discuss the reliability of the available data and we propose additional coordinated work, first to build composite SSI data sets out of scattered observations and to refine current SSI models, and second, to run coordinated CCM experiments.","[Ermolli, I.] Osserv Astron Roma, INAF, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy; [Matthes, K.] GEOMAR I Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [de Wit, T.

NASA's global-gridded IMERG product, which combines spaceborne microwave radiometer, infrared sensor, and ground-based gauge measurements, provides high-spatiotemporal-resolution (0.1 degrees and half-hourly) estimates that are suitable for evaluating the diurnal cycle in models, as determined against the ground-based radar network over the conterminous United States. IMERG estimates are coarsened to the spatial and hourly resolution of the state-of-the-art CMIP6 and ERA5 products, and their diurnal cycles are compared across multiple decades of June-August in the 60 degrees N-60 degrees S domain (IMERG and ERA5: 2000-19; NCAR and CNRM: 1979-2008). Low-precipitation regions (and weak-amplitude regions when analyzing the diurnal phase) are excluded from analyses so as to assess only robust diurnal signals. Observations identify greater diurnal amplitudes over land (26%-134% of the precipitation mean; 5th-95th percentile) than over ocean (14%-66%). ERA5, NCAR, and CNRM underestimate amplitudes over ocean, and ERA5 overestimates over land. IMERG observes a distinct diurnal cycle only in certain regions, with precipitation peaking broadly between 1400 and 2100 LST over land (2100-0600 LST over mountainous and varying-terrain regions) and 0000 and 1200 LST over ocean. The simulated diurnal cycle is unrealistically early when compared with observations, particularly over land (NCAR-CESM2 AMIP: -1 h; ERA5: -2 h; CNRM-CM6.1 AMIP: -4 h on average) with nocturnal maxima not well represented over mountainous regions. Furthermore, ERA5's representation of the diurnal cycle is too simplified, with less interannual variability in the time of maximum relative to observations over many regions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Identifying and addressing climate model errors in representing the diurnal cycle of precipitation are critical to improving their accuracy. This study provides an update on the diurnal cycle performance of state-of-the-art climate models and reanalysis against state-of-the-art satellite observations. The models and reanalysis have varying biases in diurnal amplitude over land, where amplitudes are stronger, and they underestimate amplitudes over ocean. They also simulate precipitation over land to peak too early in the day, from -1 to -4 h on average depending on the model. Nocturnal maxima in mountainous regions are not well simulated, although the reanalysis outperforms the models in this case. Future work can use these findings to improve realism in the next generation of climate models.","[Watters, Daniel; Battaglia, Alessandro] Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci Grp, Leicester, Leics, England; [Watters, Daniel; Battaglia, Alessandro] Univ Leicester, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester, Leics, England; [Battaglia, Alessandro] Politecn Torino, DIATI, Turin, Italy; [Allan, Richard P.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Allan, Richard P.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Reading, Berks, England",University of Leicester; Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; University of Reading,"Watters, D; Battaglia, A (corresponding author), Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci Grp, Leicester, Leics, England.;Watters, D; Battaglia, A (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester, Leics, England.;Battaglia, A (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, DIATI, Turin, Italy.",dcw17@leicester.ac.uk; ab474@leicester.ac.uk,"Allan, Richard/B-5782-2008","Allan, Richard/0000-0003-0264-9447; Battaglia, Alessandro/0000-0001-9243-3484",Natural Environment Research Council studentship through the Central England NERC Training Alliance (CENTA) [NE/L002493/1]; University of Leicester; European Space Agency under the activity RainCast [4000125959/18/NL/NA]; National Centre for Earth Observation Grant [NE/RO16518/1]; CMIP6; ESGF,Natural Environment Research Council studentship through the Central England NERC Training Alliance (CENTA); University of Leicester; European Space Agency under the activity RainCast; National Centre for Earth Observation Grant; CMIP6; ESGF,"Daniel Watters was funded by a Natural Environment Research Council studentship awarded through the Central England NERC Training Alliance (CENTA; Grant NE/L002493/1) and by the University of Leicester.

Our results showed that climate in 2050, as projected from anthropogenic forcings using the Hadley Centre HadCM3 general circulation model, were sufficient to create novel environmental conditions even where ecoregions remained spatially stable; cluster number was found to be of paramount importance in detecting novelty.

Assessing particle shape often involves either qualitative descriptors or time-consuming measurements of shape parameters by a human operator. This study employs a state-of-the-art, quantitative shape analysis instrument known as the Morphologi G3 from Malvern Instruments, an automated microscope system capable of determining quantitative shape parameters via static image analysis of > 1000 particles in less than two hours. This instrument captures 2D projected images of particles and provides information on grain size measurements such as circle-equivalent diameter, length, width, perimeter, and area, as well as shape parameters such as circularity and convexity. As a case study, we conducted analyses on mud- and sand-sized particles collected from fluvial/alluvial systems of end-member climates to assess variations in sediment particle morphology potentially related to climate and/or transport distance and processes. Sediment samples were collected from fluvial systems in four contrasting climates: hot-arid (southeastern California, USA), hot-humid (eastern Puerto Rico), glacial-arid (proglacial stream of the Dry Valleys, Antarctica), and glacial-humid (Austerdalen proglacial stream, Norway). Results provide quantitative constraints on shape differences that relate to climate and transport, even for very fine-grained sand and mud size fractions. Comparison of the circularity of sediment particles from the four end-member climates indicates that the very fine sand fractions reflect differential physical abrasion and transport processes, whereas the morphology of the mud fraction seemingly imprints chemical weathering processes. We conclude that this new technique has great potential to further document impacts of climate on particle shape with applications to both modern and deep-time depositional systems.","[Joo, Young Ji] Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Polar Paleoenvironm, 26 Songdomirae Ro, Incheon 21990, South Korea; [Soreghan, Anastasia M.; Madden, Megan E.

To simulate realistic physical states of snowpack, SMAP incorporates a state-of-the-art physically based snow albedo model, which calculates snow albedo and solar heating profile in snowpack considering effects of snow grain size and snow impurities explicitly. We evaluated the performance of SMAP with meteorological and snow impurities (black carbon and dust) input data measured at Sapporo, Japan during two winters: 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, and found SMAP successfully reproduced all observed variations of physical properties of snowpack for both winters. We have thus confirmed that SMAP is suitable for climate simulations. With SMAP, we also investigated the effects of snow impurities on snowmelt at Sapporo during the two winters. We found that snowpack durations at Sapporo were shortened by 19 days during the 2007-2008 winter and by 16 days during the 2008-2009 winter due to radiative forcings caused by snow impurities. The estimated radiative forcings due to snow impurities during the accumulation periods were 3.7 W/m(2) (it corresponds to albedo reduction in 0.05) and 3.2 W/m(2) (albedo reduction in 0.05) for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 winters, respectively. While during the ablation periods they were 25.9 W/m(2) (albedo reduction in 0.18) and 21.0 W/m(2) (albedo reduction in 0.17) for each winter, respectively.","[Niwano, Masashi; Aoki, Teruo; Kuchiki, Katsuyuki] Meteorol Res Inst, Phys Meteorol Res Dept, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Hosaka, Masahiro] Meteorol Res Inst, Climate Res Dept, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Kodama, Yuji] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Hokkaido University,"Niwano, M (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, Phys Meteorol Res Dept, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",mniwano@mri-jma.go.jp,"Niwano, Masashi/N-6723-2016","Niwano, Masashi/0000-0003-3121-3802","Ministry of the Environment of Japan; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [23221004]","Ministry of the Environment of Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","We are grateful to Michael Lehning at WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF, for providing us with the SNOWPACK model, from which we learned the essence of snow metamorphism processes.

We used a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to investigate potential future changes in size and location of potential habitats of marine species during the 21(st) century in a large, eutrophicated brackish sea (the Baltic Sea, northern Europe). We conducted scenario projections under the combined impact of nutrient load and climate change. Possible future changes of the eutrophication state of this sea were also assessed through two policy-relevant indicators. The results imply a physiologically more stressful environment for marine species by the end of the 21(st) century: volumes of higher salinity water become more hypoxic/anoxic and the volumes of low salinity, oxic water increase. For example, these results impact and reduce cod reproductive habitats. The decrease is mainly climate change induced in the Baltic basins less directly influenced by inflows of saline, oxic water to the Baltic Sea (E Gotland and Gdansk Basins). In basins more directly influenced by such inflows (Arkona and Bornholm Basins), the combined effect from climate change and nutrient loads is of importance. The results for the eutrophication state indicators clearly indicate a more eutrophic sea than at present without a rigorous nutrient reduction policy, that is, the necessity to implement the Baltic Sea Action Plan. The multidisciplinary, multiscenario assessment strategy presented here provides a useful concept for the evaluation of impacts from cumulative stresses of changing climate and socioeconomic pressures on future eutrophication indicators and habitats of marine species.","[Wahlstrom, Irene; Hoglund, Anders; Almroth-Rosell, Elin; Groeger, Matthias; Eilola, Kari; Andersson, Helen C.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Wahlstrom, Irene; Hoglund, Anders; Almroth-Rosell, Elin; Groeger, Matthias; Eilola, Kari; Andersson, Helen C.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [MacKenzie, Brian R.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Lyngby, Denmark; [Groeger, Matthias] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res IOW, Rostock, Germany; [Plikshs, Maris] Res Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm, Riga, Latvia",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Technical University of Denmark; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde,"Wahlstrom, I (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden.",irene.wahlstrom@smhi.se,"MacKenzie, Brian R./T-9379-2019; Gröger, Matthias/G-6758-2015; Wahlstrom, Irene/K-8130-2014","MacKenzie, Brian R./0000-0002-4798-0363; Gröger, Matthias/0000-0002-9927-5164; Wahlstrom, Irene/0000-0001-8735-268X","BONUS project BIO-C3; Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [219-2013-2041]; ClimeMarine project [2017-01949]; EU Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation Programme [678193]","BONUS project BIO-C3; Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); ClimeMarine project; EU Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation Programme","This study was funded by BONUS project BIO-C3, the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS, grant 219-2013-2041).

However, controlling the amount of growth is costly. Therefore, in this Article, we focus on urban warming and investigate whether climate-conscious urban growth planning (CUGP), that is, urban growth with the same magnitude but optimized spatial arrangements, brings significant mitigation effects. First, the classical spatial multiobjective land-use optimization (SMOLA) model is improved by integrating the spatially, diurnally, and compositionally varying associations between land-use and their warming impacts. We then solve the improved model using the nondominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to generate urban growth plans with minimal warming impacts and minimal cost of change without reducing the amount of urban growth. Results show that climate-conscious urban growth brings 33.3 +/- 4.6% less warming impacts as compared to unplanned urban growth in Shenzhen, China, and suggest a compact and spatially equalized development pattern. This study provides evidence that spatial planning tools such as the CUGP can help mitigate human impacts on the environment. Meanwhile, the improved SMOLA model could be applied to balance urban development and other environmental consequences such as air pollution.","[Zhou, Yulun; Huang, Bo] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bo; Wang, Jionghua] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jionghua] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kong, Hui] SMART, Singapore 138602, Singapore; [Norford, Leslie] MIT, Dept Architecture, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Southwest Jiaotong University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Huang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Huang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bohuang@cuhk.edu.hk,"Chen, Bin/ABD-5074-2021; Huang, Bo/H-9874-2014","Chen, Bin/0000-0003-3496-2876; Kong, Hui/0000-0001-6048-9440; Yulun, ZHOU/0000-0002-9607-2185; Huang, Bo/0000-0002-5063-3522; WANG, Jionghua/0000-0001-8265-3985",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0503605],National Key R&D Program of China,"This study was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFB0503605), which is gratefully acknowledged.

However, the economic boom came at a certain cost of depleting air quality. In the study, we aimed to examine the burden of air pollution and its association with climatic factors and health outcomes using data from Chinese national and city-level air quality and public health surveillance systems. City-level daily air pollution index (API, a sum weighted index of SO2, NO2, PM10, CO, and Ozone) in 120 cities in 2012 and 2013, and its association with climate factors were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis, spatial auto-correlation analysis, and panel fixed models. City-level ecological association between annual average API and total mortality were examined using univariate and partial correlation analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by taking the consideration of time-lag effect between exposures and outcomes. The results show that among the 120 cities, annual average API significantly increased from 2012 to 2013 (65.05 vs. 75.99, p < 0.0001). The highest average API was in winter, and the lowest in summer. A significantly spatial clustering of elevated API was observed, with the highest API in northwest China in 2012 and with the highest in east China in 2013. In 2012, 5 (4%) of the 120 cities had >= 60 days with API >100 (defined as slightly polluted), however, it increased to 21 cities (18%) that experienced API >100 for >= 60 days in 2013. Furthermore, 16 cities (13%) in 2012 and 35 (29%) in 2013 experienced a maximum API >300 (defined as severely polluted). API was negatively and significantly correlated with heat index, precipitation, and sunshine hours, but positively with air pressure. Cities with higher API concentrations had significantly higher total mortality rates than those with lower API. About a 4-7% of the variation in total mortality could be explained by the difference in API across the nation. In conclusion, the study highlights an increased trend of air pollution from 2012 to 2013 in China. The magnitude of air pollution varied by seasons and regions and correlated with climatic factors and total mortality across the country.","[Liu, Longjian; Yang, Xuan; Liu, Hui; Welles, Seth] Drexel Univ, Dornsife Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Mingquan] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Marquez, Shannon; Frank, Arthur] Drexel Univ, Dornsife Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Haas, Charles N.] Drexel Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Drexel University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, CAS; Drexel University; Drexel University","Liu, LJ (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dornsife Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",longjian.liu@drexel.edu,"Liu, Longjian/Q-4774-2018",,"Drexel University Office of International Programs (U.S.); Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI) of the Chinese Academy of Science (China) (Drexel University [282582, Y426474231]; NIH [R25 MD006792-01]; NSF-China [51308525]; CAS-STS [KFJ-EW-STS-140]; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities [R25MD006792] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Drexel University Office of International Programs (U.S.); Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI) of the Chinese Academy of Science (China) (Drexel University; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF-China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS-STS; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD)),"AC This study was supported by a joint grant of Drexel University Office of International Programs (U.S.) and Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI) of the Chinese Academy of Science (China) (Drexel University grant #: 282582, SARI grant #: Y426474231).

The results were compared with an EnergyPlus computer model to verify the calculations and improve decision making. The model considers the envelope's thermal inertia, the characteristics of the enclosure, and the passive systems for performing thermal analysis. The cathedral's indoor environment is very stable. Because of a high capability of thermal-energy accumulation, a one-month thermal lag between indoor and outdoor temperatures exists. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum temperatures are dampened, with a two-degree variation above or below the outdoor average, depending on the season. The outdoor humidity can vary from 40% to 100% daily, whereas the indoor humidity variation is around 5%. This indoor stable condition protects the artistic objects in the building.

S. surface ozone levels is investigated. We simulated two 10 year periods using the global chemical transport model MOZART-2 ( Model of Ozone and Related chemical Tracers version 2): 1990 - 2000 and 2090 - 2100. In each case, MOZART-2 is driven by meteorology from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) coupled Climate Systems Model (CSM) 1.0 forced with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1 scenario. During both periods the chemical emissions are fixed at 1990s levels, so that only changes in climate are allowed to impact ozone. The simulated surface ozone concentration during the 1990s is compared with observations from the Environmental Protection Agency's Aerometric Information Retrieval System (EPA AIRS) monitoring sites. Model-measurement correlations are high, but MOZART-2 overpredicts ozone especially over the eastern United States. The impact of climate change is calculated separately for background ozone and for the ozone generated through U. S. NOx emissions. Our results show that the response of ozone to climate change in polluted regions is not the same as in remote regions. MOZART-2 predicts a 0 - 2 ppbv decrease in background ozone in the future simulation over the United States but an increase in ozone produced internally within the United States of up to 6 ppbv. The decrease in background ozone is attributed to a future decrease in the lifetime of ozone in regions of low NOx. Over the western United States the decrease in background ozone approximately cancels the increase in locally produced ozone. As a result, the main impact of future climate change on ozone is centered over the eastern United States, where future ozone increases up to 5 ppbv.

First discussed are Herbert Marcuse's theorisations concerning the potential function of art to precipitate social change. What also receives emphasis is Marcuse's and other theorists' related stress on the importance of memory and time to critical thought. The amnesiac mainstream culture that prevents revolt and perpetuates social and ecological harm is challenged through various arguments advancing the necessity of remembering past horrors, non-industrial/non-capitalist times, and alternative futures in order to instigate the transformation of subjectivities and societies. Against this theoretical backdrop The 11th Hour is analysed, first considering published criticisms of the film, before critiquing the film on the grounds that while it evokes alternative registers of time in an environmentally progressive manner, it blunts its critical edge by proposing certain solutions to the climate crisis that dovetail with the ethos and accelerated time of the capitalist-consumerist status quo. Further reflections are then offered on the potential role of film in addressing the climate crisis, and on how an adjusted Marcusean-ecological frame might help to hone the critical edge of such environmentally-centred film art.","[Konik, Inge] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Konik, I (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",KonikI@ufs.ac.za,,"Konik, Inge/0000-0002-2844-6624",,,,,36,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0256-0046,1992-6049,,CRIT ARTS,Crit.

The precipitation and circulation responses to rising greenhouse gases involve a fast component associated with direct radiative forcing and a slow component associated with sea surface temperature (SST) warming; the relative importance of the two may contribute to model discrepancies. In this study, regional hydroclimate responses to greenhouse warming are assessed using output from coupled general circulation models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) and idealized atmospheric general circulation model experiments from the Atmosphere Model Intercomparison Project. The thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms causing the rainfall changes are examined using moisture budget analysis. Results show that direct radiative forcing and SST change exert significantly different responses both over land and ocean. For most part of the Asian monsoon region, the summertime rainfall changes are dominated by the direct CO2 radiative effect through enhanced monsoon circulation. The response to SST warming shows a larger model spread compared to direct radiative forcing, possibly due to the cancellation between the thermodynamical and dynamical components. While the thermodynamical response of the Asian monsoon is robust across the models, there is a lack of consensus for the dynamical response among the models and weak multi-model mean responses in the CMIP5 ensemble, which may be related to the multiple physical processes evolving on different time scales.","[Li, Xiaoqiong] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 61 Rt 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Li, Xiaoqiong; Ting, Mingfang] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Rt 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Li, XQ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 61 Rt 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.;Li, XQ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Rt 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",xqli@ldeo.columbia.edu,,"Li, Xiaoqiong (Sage)/0000-0001-8871-0776","National Science Foundation [AGS16-07348]; Office of Naval Research MURI Grant [511 N00014-12-1-0911]; Climate Center Award at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program [NNX15AP01H]; Directorate For Geosciences [1607348] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Naval Research MURI Grant; Climate Center Award at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","The authors would like to thank Naomi Henderson for helping with the moisture budget calculations, Haibo Liu for downloading and pre-processing the CMIP5 data used in this study, and Michela Biasutti, Yochanan Kushnir, Tiffany Shaw, and Yutian Wu for helpful discussions.

We examined collection inventory change over time using records at Montgomery Botanical Center (MBC), to formulate a plant collection half-life concept. This half-life was used to project changes in MBC's plant collection over the next 100 years within the context of sea level changes. Comparing predicted rates of collection change with projected rates of loss due to sea level rise, we expect plant collection development to keep pace with climate change.

Daily precipitation with amount larger than 10 mm showed significant (95%, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) agreement with the in-situ data, especially TMPA, followed by CHIRPS and MSWEP. At monthly scales, there were significant correlations (R) between the GPPs and in-situ records, suggesting similar dynamics; however, statistical metrics suggested that the performance of these products varies from north towards south.

Here we examine the climatic impact of oceanic gateway changes at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition by implementing detailed paleogeographic reconstructions with realistic paleobathymetric models for the Atlantic-Arctic basins in a state-of-the-art earth system model (the Norwegian Earth System Model [NorESM-F]). We demonstrate that the warm Eocene climate is highly sensitive to depth variations of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge and the proto-Fram Strait as they control the freshwater leakage from the Arctic to the North Atlantic. Our results, and proxy evidence, suggest that changes in these gateways controlled the ocean circulation and played a critical role in the growth of land-based ice sheets, alongside CO2-driven global cooling. Specifically, we suggest that a shallow connection between the Arctic and North Atlantic restricted the southward flow of fresh surface waters during the Late Eocene allowing for a North Atlantic overturning circulation. Consequently, the Southern Hemisphere cooled by several degrees paving the way for the glaciation of Antarctica. Shortly after, the connection to the Arctic deepened due to weakening dynamic support from the Iceland Mantle Plume. This weakened the North Atlantic overturning and cooled the Northern Hemisphere, thereby promoting glaciations there. Our study points to a controlling role of the Northeast Atlantic gateways and decreasing atmospheric CO2 in the onset of glaciations in both hemispheres.","[Straume, Eivind O.; Nummelin, Aleksi; Gaina, Carmen; Nisancioglu, Kerim H.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Earth Evolut & Dynam, Dept Geosci, N-0371 Oslo, Norway; [Straume, Eivind O.] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Nummelin, Aleksi; Nisancioglu, Kerim H.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr AS, N-5838 Bergen, Norway; [Gaina, Carmen] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nisancioglu, Kerim H.] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-7803 Bergen, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Bergen,"Straume, EO (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Earth Evolut & Dynam, Dept Geosci, N-0371 Oslo, Norway.;Straume, EO (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",e.o.straume@geo.uio.no,,"Nummelin, Aleksi/0000-0002-7591-3504; Straume, Eivind/0000-0003-2787-0906","Research Council of Norway through its Centers of Excellence funding scheme [223272, 246929]; MatNat Faculty at the University of Oslo; Jackson School of Geosciences at University of Texas at Austin;  [EAR-1853856]",Research Council of Norway through its Centers of Excellence funding scheme; MatNat Faculty at the University of Oslo; Jackson School of Geosciences at University of Texas at Austin; ,"O.S., C.G., A.N., and K.H.N. acknowledge support from the Research Council of Norway through its Centers of Excellence funding scheme, Project 223272 (The Centre for Earth Evolution and Dynamics), and Project 246929 (Coupled climate, volcanism, and ocean tectonics in deep time [ClimVoTe]).

We use a state-of-the-art regional Earth system model, RCAO-GUESS, which comprises a dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS), a regional atmosphere model (RCA), and an ocean sea ice model (RCO), to explore the dynamic coupling between vegetation and sea ice during 1989-2011. Our results show that RCAO-GUESS captures recent trends in observed sea ice concentration and extent, with the inclusion of vegetation dynamics resulting in larger, more realistic variations in summer and autumn than the model that does not account for vegetation dynamics. Vegetation feedbacks induce concomitant changes in downwelling longwave radiation, near-surface temperature, mean sea level pressure, and sea ice reductions, suggesting a feedback chain linking vegetation change to sea ice dynamics. This study highlights the importance of including interactive vegetation dynamics in modeling the Arctic climate system, particularly when predicting sea ice dynamics. Plain Language Summary Recent accelerated warming over the Arctic is associated with dramatic changes in the physical environment, among which unprecedented sea ice decline has received particular attention. In this study, we use a regional Earth system model accounting for interactive coupling between the atmosphere, land vegetation, and sea ice dynamics to explore their potential links. Our model simulates observed spatiotemporal patterns of sea ice thickness and extent reasonably well. Furthermore, the results show that feedbacks of warming-driven vegetation changes on the near-surface radiation balance can cause greater variations in sea ice between seasons, which can contribute to an accelerated trend of sea ice reduction. The changes in mean sea level pressure caused by vegetation changes can alter the transport of energy and warm the land, sea, and sea ice surfaces. Downwelling longwave radiation is the dominant factor contributing to the near-surface warming and increased sea ice melting. Our study highlights the importance of adopting fully coupled Earth system models that account for interactive effects of vegetation dynamics on the physical climate system, in particular when analyzing the reduction of sea ice in the Arctic.","[Zhang, W.; Miller, P.

Since predicted climate change and its likely impacts are under discussion, the assessment of possible implications on wine production, including changes in bioclimatic indices and viticultural zoning is plainly justified, setting the basis for defining adaptation/mitigation strategies. In this context, the main objectives of present study are the determination of four bioclimatic indices ( length of the growing season, Huglin index, cool night index and dryness index) for Iberian winegrowing regions, the assessment of their variations under an emission scenario by using a state-of-the-art climate model, and the definition of regions with diverse viticultural potentials. For their calculation, mostly precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperatures on a daily basis are used. Then in order to identify spatial changes in their patterns, the indices are calculated for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 using data from the climate model COSMO-CLM ( regional atmospheric model) and for the A1B SRES emission scenario. Data from COSMO-CLM has a high-resolution grid (0.165 degrees latitude x 0.165 degrees longitude) allowing a detailed characterization of viticultural regions and the assessment of the impacts of different climatic scenarios on Iberia. Maps of these indices for recent-past periods and for future scenarios are considered. Furthermore, a validation methodology highlighted the high skill of this regional model in reproducing the recent-past climate patterns in both precipitation and temperature fields throughout the Iberian Peninsula. According to the model simulations, there is a projected significant adverse impact on wine quality, namely in Southern Iberia, by increased dryness and cumulative thermal effects. This scenario represents an important constraint to grapevine growth and development, making it crucial that adaptation strategies be adopted. This approach provides a macro-characterization of Iberian areas where grapevines may preferentially grow, as well as their projected changes under human-induced forcing. As such, it can be a useful tool for viticultural zoning in a changing climate.","[Malheiro, A. C.; Santos, J.

The sensitivity simulations involve 2-K increases to the SSTs of the Aegean, eastern Mediterranean and Black seas individually as well as collectively. All the simulations are integrated over a 10-year period between 1990 and 2000. The model simulations of this study indicate that the precipitation of the peninsula is sensitive to the variations of the SSTs of the surrounding seas. In general, increased SSTs lead to increases in the precipitation of the peninsula as well as that of the seas considered. The statistically significant increases at 95% confidence levels largely occur along the coastal areas of the peninsula that are in the downwind side of the seas. Significant increases do also take place in the interior areas of the peninsula, especially in the eastern Anatolia in winter. The simulations reveal that eastern Mediterranean Sea has the biggest potential to affect the precipitation in the peninsula. They also demonstrate that taking all three seas into account simultaneously enhances the effect of SSTs on the peninsula's precipitation, and extends the areas with statistically significant increases.","[Bozkurt, Deniz; Sen, Omer Lutfi] Istanbul Tech Univ, Eurasia Inst Earth Sci, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Sen, OL (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Eurasia Inst Earth Sci, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.",senomer@itu.edu.tr,"Bozkurt, Deniz/AAC-4563-2021; Sen, Omer Lutfi/K-7734-2018; Bozkurt, Deniz/C-9797-2013","Bozkurt, Deniz/0000-0003-1021-8241; Sen, Omer Lutfi/0000-0002-8186-8594; ","TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [105Y341, 106G015]",TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This study is partly supported by grants (105Y341 and 106G015) from TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey).

At a time when political parties were banned and public gatherings considered illegal, Chileans found alternative ways to oppose the military government. In this climate, I argue that artistic expression took on political meaning. The fact that the No Campaign of 1988 was able to oust the dictator with an optimistic message of joy and hope, attests to the point that Chileans were able to shed their fears and change their outlook. Throughout the decade, the arts-innovations in poetry, music, theater, narrative and the audiovisual media-had offered people a much-needed forum for expression.","[Cronovich, Paula Thorrington] Point Loma Nazarene Univ, San Diego, CA 92106 USA",,"Cronovich, PT (corresponding author), Point Loma Nazarene Univ, San Diego, CA 92106 USA.",,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,0,VERVUERT VERLAG,FRANKFURT AM MAIN,"ELISABETHENSTR 3-9, FRANKFURT AM MAIN, 60594, GERMANY",1577-3388,2255-520X,,IBEROAMERICA,Iberoamericana,,2013,51,,,,119,137,,,,,,19,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,V13VX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000214442000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present work investigated the snow reliability of 175 ski resorts in France (Alps and Pyrenees), Spain and Andorra under past and future conditions using state-of-the-art snowpack modelling and climate projections using Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The natural snow reliability (i.e. without snowmaking) elevation showed a significant spatial variability in the reference period (1986-2005) and was shown to be highly impacted by the ongoing climate change. The reliability elevation using snowmaking is projected to rise by 200 to 300 m in the Alps and by 400 to 600 m in the Pyrenees in the near future (2030-2050) compared to the reference period for all climate scenarios. While 99 of ski lift infrastructures exhibit adequate snow reliability in the reference period when using snowmaking, a significant fraction (14 to 25 %) may be considered in a critical situation in the near future. Beyond the mid-century, climate projections highly depend on the scenario with either steady conditions compared to the near future (RCP2.6) or continuous decrease in snow reliability (RCP8.5). Under RCP8.5, our projections show that there would no longer be any snow-reliable ski resorts based on natural snow conditions in the French Alps and Pyrenees (France, Spain and Andorra) at the end of the century (2080-2100). For this time period and this scenario, only 24 resorts are projected to remain reliable with snowmaking, all being located in the Alps.","[Spandre, Pierre; Francois, Hugues; George, Emmanuelle] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, UR LESSEM, Grenoble, France; [Spandre, Pierre; Verfaillie, Deborah; Vernay, Matthieu; Lafaysse, Matthieu; Morin, Samuel] Univ Toulouse, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Ctr Etud Neige,Meteo France,CNRM, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Verfaillie, Deborah] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Pons, Marc] IEA, Snow & Mt Res Ctr Andorra, St Julia De Loria, Andorra",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Meteo France; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS),"Morin, S (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Ctr Etud Neige,Meteo France,CNRM, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",samuel.morin@meteo.fr,"Pons, Marc/AHA-2722-2022; Pons, Marc/GYR-1419-2022; Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011","Pons, Marc/0000-0001-9105-0772; Pons, Marc/0000-0001-9105-0772; Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X",Region RhoneAlpes; French Ministry for Ecology (MTES); Interreg project POCTEFA/Clim'Py (OPCC2); IDEX Univ.

In fact, such generalizations might be quite problematic. For instance, models used to predict shifts in the ranges of species during climate change rarely incorporate data resolved to < 1 km(2), although most organisms integrate climatic drivers at much smaller scales. Empirical studies alone suggest that the operative temperatures of many organisms vary by as much as 10-20 degrees C on a local scale, depending on vegetation, geology, and topography. Furthermore, this variation in abiotic factors ignores thermoregulatory behaviors that many animals use to balance heat loads. Through a set of simulations, we demonstrate how variability in elevational topography can attenuate the effects of warming climates. These simulations suggest that changing climates do not always impact organisms negatively. Importantly, these simulations involve well-known relationships in biophysical ecology that show how no two organisms experience the same climate in the same way. We suggest that, when coupled with thermoregulatory behavior, variation in topographic features can mask the acute effect of climate change in many cases.","[Sears, Michael W.; Raskin, Evan] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA; [Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Bryn Mawr College; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Sears, MW (corresponding author), Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, 101 N Merion Ave, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA.",msears@brynmawr.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DBI-0204484, IOS-0616176, IOS 0616344, CCF-0939370]; National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,"The National Science Foundation (DBI-0204484, IOS-0616176, IOS 0616344, CCF-0939370).; We thank the physiological ecologists who pioneered the conceptual advances that led to our work, including Raymond Huey, Art Dunham, George Bakken, Richard Tracy, and Warren Porter.

The implementation of targeted strategies to manage stress antecedents and outcomes represents a global challenge with relevant implications for workers well-being and business success. Despite the direct and indirect costs of work-related stress are well established, companies often fail to find adequate strategies to manage stress and the use of large sums of money not always reach the goal of improving a conflictual environment. One of the most important determinants of work-related stress onset is the lack of a supportive work climate, in terms of poor support provided by colleagues, supervisors or organizations. Improving organizational support can represent a target for both managers and workers who want to mitigate the negative consequences of stress, both in economic and health terms. The aim of this study was to investigate, through a narrative literature review, how a poor organizational support can affect a work organization, and which strategies are now available to improve a supportive climate.

We employ this population-based metric as a rough index for the potential exposure of the largely immovable built environment embodying cultures and economies as they exist today. Based on median sea level projections, at least one large nation on every continent but Australia and Antarctica would face exceptionally high exposure: land home to at least one-tenth and up to two-thirds of current population falling below tideline. Many small island nations are threatened with near-total loss. The high tide line could encroach above land occupied by as much as 15% of the current global population (about one billion people). By contrast, meeting the most ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will likely reduce exposure by roughly half and may avoid globally unprecedented defense requirements for any coastal megacity exceeding a contemporary population of 10 million.","[Strauss, Benjamin H.; Kulp, Scott A.] Climate Cent, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; [Rasmussen, D.

A large number of different studies have been carried out over recent decades focusing on various aspects of the broad field of comfort, well-being and health at workplaces. Two main methodical approaches can be identified analysing the history of comfort research: laboratory tests in climate chambers, and field tests in running buildings. Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are pointed out in this paper and some of the most well-known studies from Europe and the US are described with respect to their specific objectives and methodologies. No difference is made between pure comfort field studies and more general post-occupancy evaluations because the borderline is vague in most cases and the purpose of this paper is to collect as much useful information as possible on comfort research methods.

It includes a number of modules for assessing the internal energy budget, the hydrological cycle, the Lorenz energy cycle and the material entropy production. The routine takes as inputs energy fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which allows for the computation of energy budgets at the TOA, the surface and in the atmosphere as a residual. Meridional enthalpy transports are also computed from the divergence of the zonal mean energy budget from which the location and intensity of the maxima in each hemisphere are calculated. Rainfall, snowfall and latent heat fluxes are received as inputs for computation of the water mass and latent energy budgets. If a land-sea mask is provided, the required quantities are separately computed over continents and oceans. The diagnostic tool also computes the annual Lorenz energy cycle (LEC) and its storage and conversion terms by hemisphere and as a global mean. This is computed from three-dimensional daily fields of horizontal wind velocity and temperature in the troposphere. Two methods have been implemented for the computation of the material entropy production: one relying on the convergence of radiative heat fluxes in the atmosphere (indirect method) and the other combining the irreversible processes occurring in the climate system, particularly heat fluxes in the boundary layer, the hydrological cycle and the kinetic energy dissipation as retrieved from the residuals of the LEC (direct method). A version of these diagnostics has been developed as part of the Earth System Model eValuation Tool (ESMValTool) v2.0a1 in order to assess the performances of CMIP6 model simulations, and it will be available in the next release. The aim of this software is to provide a comprehensive picture of the thermodynamics of the climate system, as reproduced in the state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models. This can prove useful for better understanding anthropogenic and natural climate change, paleoclimatic climate variability, and climatic tipping points.","[Lembo, Valerio; Lunkeit, Frank; Lucarini, Valerio] Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany; [Lucarini, Valerio] Univ Reading, Dept Math & Stat, Reading, Berks, England; [Lucarini, Valerio] Univ Reading, Ctr Math Planet Earth, Dept Math & Stat, Reading, Berks, England",University of Hamburg; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Lembo, V (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany.",valerio.lembo@uni-hamburg.de,"Atmosphere and Ocean, Collaborative Research Center TRR 181- Energy Transfers in/AAY-2721-2020; Lembo, Valerio/Q-1501-2019; Lucarini, Valerio/C-3795-2009","Lembo, Valerio/0000-0001-6085-5914; Lunkeit, Frank/0000-0002-7854-8282; Lucarini, Valerio/0000-0001-9392-1471",DFG [274762653],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research has been supported by the DFG (grant no. 274762653).,,105,15,15,1,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Here we show that the same model improvements produce only a small surface warming increase in a realistic 21st century emissions scenario. The small 21st century warming increase is attributed to extratropical ocean heat uptake. Southern Ocean mean-state circulation takes up heat while a slowdown in North Atlantic circulation acts as a feedback to slow surface warming. Persistent heat uptake by extratropical oceans implies that extratropical cloud biases may not be as important to 21st century warming as biases in other regions. Observational constraints on cloud phase and shortwave radiation that produce a large ECS increase do not imply large changes in 21st century warming.","[Frey, W. R.; Maroon, E. A.; Kay, J.

It used the Glasgow School of Art (GSA) building as its research vehicle where key variables related to sound, light and heat were measured and user attitudes toward them and the building in general were surveyed and the results were statistically analysed. Preliminary recordings of sound level showed an evidence of noise nuisance in one of the GSA offices. This was largely due to the nature of sound rather than its level. This has been confirmed by user returns from them questionnaire. Also, L-eq levels were high in the library. Daylight levels in one of the north-facing studios were higher than required in summer and lower than the recommended standards in winter. Surprisingly, no evidence, from the questionnaire returns, was found to suggest visual and/or thermal discomfort in the Studios from the very large single glazed windows. Almost all occupants attached great importance to the issue of living inside a historic building. However, this was not the preferred option when it was examined in relation to other building use issues. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To achieve this goal, a series of single- and multi-parameter simulations which followed an orthogonal design of experiments (ODOE) were conducted. The physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was adopted to assess the results of microclimate simulations for different urban models. The main findings are as follows: 1) The aspect ratio and orientation of urban canyons and ART play significant roles in influencing microclimate variables at the pedestrian level. 2) There is an inverse relationship between the street aspect ratio and T-mrt, and likewise for ART; the highest wind velocity was obtained when the aspect ratio of canyons was 2 and 3, which consequently developed the channeling phenomenon (when the domain wind is prevailing with street direction). 3) The East-West streets and canyons with an HW = 0.5 incur the warmest thermal conditions and longest extreme discomfort durations. 4) Results for the PET and meteorological parameters exhibit less significant variation obtained from different values of LAD than those observed in the other three parameters.","[Peng, Mingxi; Huang, Haijing] Chongqing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Haijing] Minist Educ, Key Lab Mt Town Construct & New Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Huang, HJ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Huang, HJ (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Mt Town Construct & New Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",cqhhj@126.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [19BGL004]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018CDQYJZ0032],National Social Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Funding This project was financially supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 19BGL004) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018CDQYJZ0032).,,69,2,2,21,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

They also form within the generally stable environment of caves, and thus may remain remarkably well preserved for many millions of years and, most important, can be dated radiometrically to provide robust chronologies that do not rely on orbital tuning, ice-flow modeling, or estimates of sediment deposition rates. The recent adaptation of the U-Pb dating technique to speleothems has greatly extended their potential as paleoclimate recorders back into the more distant geological past, well beyond the similar to 500 k.y. limit previously imposed by U-series techniques, but the opportunities presented by these new methods have yet to be fully explored. As an extreme example, here we report on samples recovered from Permian cave fills, the oldest radiometrically dated speleothems so far documented. Using state of the art analytical techniques it is possible to determine not only their age and state of preservation, but also to extract apparently nearly pristine climate proxy data. Armed with these methods, it now seems reasonable to apply the lessons learned from more recent speleothems to ancient materials, wherever they can be found, and of whatever age, to generate snapshots of paleoclimate that can be used to greatly refine the records preserved within the sediments and fossils of the time.","[Woodhead, Jon; Hellstrom, John; Maas, Roland] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Reisz, Robert] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Fox, David; Cheng, Hai; Edwards, R.

The thermal response of built-up areas in comparison to natural areas is quantified in terms of surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity. The work presented here evaluates the seasonal SUHI intensities in Delhi using local climate zones (LCZs) and conventional SUHI indicators in parallel. Statistical analyses are carried out to determine the relationship between them and to delineate heat stressed zones in the Delhi city region. The present study is the first one that utilizes LCZs for seasonal SUHI analysis in Delhi. The land surface temperature (LST) is assessed using a hundred and five night-time images from MODIS. Unambiguous night-time SUHI effect is seen for all seasons. The maximum night-time SUHI intensity is 3.5 degrees C, between compact low-rise (LCZ 3) and low plants (LCZ D) in summer and winter. The conventional indicator Inside urban-Inside rural gives the highest night-time SUHI intensity of 3.3 degrees C, in autumn. Statistical analyses show that compact low-rise (LCZ3) and large low-rise (LCZ8) are the most heat-stressed LCZs. The largest number of distinct thermal zones is created in the monsoon, followed by summer and winter. The results suggest that in order to minimize the UHI effect, further urban expansion in the Delhi region should be restricted to LCZ 5 (open mid-rise) and LCZ 6 (open low-rise).","[Budhiraja, Bakul] Shiv Nadar Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Greater Noida 201314, India; [Gawuc, Lech] Natl Res Inst, Inst Environm Protect, Natl Ctr Emiss Management, PL-00805 Warsaw, Poland; [Agrawal, Girish] OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Sch Art & Architecture, Sonipat 131001, India",Shiv Nadar University; Institute of Environmental Protection - National Research Institute; O.P.

SDG 13 needs to align with the Paris Agreement, given that UNFCCC negotiations set the framework for climate change actions. Food system actions can have synergies and trade-offs, as illustrated by the case for nitrogen fertiliser. SDG 13 actions that reduce emissions can have positive impacts on other SDGs (e. g. 3, 6, 12, 14, 15); but such actions should not undermine the adaptation goals of SDG 13 and SDGs 1, 2, 5 and 10. Balancing trade-offs is thus crucial, with SDG 12 central: responsible consumption and production. Transformative actions in food systems are needed to achieve SDG 13 (and other SDGs), involving technical, policy, capacity enhancement and finance elements. But transformative actions come with risks, for farmers, investors, development agencies and politicians. Likely short and long term impacts need to be understood.","[Campbell, Bruce M.] Univ Copenhagen, Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Rolighedsvej 21, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Campbell, Bruce M.; Hansen, James] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Lamont Campus,POB 1000, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Rioux, Janie] Green Climate Fund, 175 Art Ctr Daero, Incheon 22004, South Korea; [Stirling, Clare M.] CIMMYT, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico; [Twomlow, Stephen] Int Fund Agr Dev, Via Paolo Dono 44, I-00142 Rome, Italy; [Wollenberg, Eva (Lini)] Univ Vermont UVM, Burlington, VT USA",CGIAR; University of Copenhagen; Columbia University; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Campbell, BM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Rolighedsvej 21, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.;Campbell, BM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Lamont Campus,POB 1000, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",b.campbell@cgiar.org,"Campbell, Bruce/ABF-5579-2020; Hansen, James W/M-1449-2015","Hansen, James W/0000-0002-8599-7895",CGIAR Fund Donors,CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements (https://ccafs.cgiar.org/donors).

We provide a new approach that dynamically merges height-age functions prevalent in forest growth models with transfer functions prevalent in population adaptation research to better represent changes to forest productivity as climates gradually change. Our simulations with data from an extensive provenance test of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in British Columbia, Canada, suggest that climate change will reduce production in lodgepole pine forests established today by at least 7-13% at the end of this century considerably less than most predictions based solely on transfer or response functions, which do not integrate impacts as climate gradually changes. This work illustrates the need for forest productivity models to consider the changing climate in which a population is growing relative to the static climate of its origin. It also demonstrates the value of long-term provenance trials in assessing the dynamic impact of climate change on forest productivity, and serves as an example of how provenance trials may be exploited in other forest productivity models or other research fields to assess plant responses to climate.","[O'Neill, Gregory A.] BC Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resource Operat, Kalamalka Res Stn, Improvement Branch, Vernon, BC V1B 2C7, Canada; [O'Neill, Gregory A.] Univ No British Columbia, Coll Sci & Management, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Nigh, Gordon] BC Minist Forests, Forest Anal & Inventory Branch, Victoria, BC V8W 9C3, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia,"O'Neill, GA (corresponding author), BC Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resource Operat, Kalamalka Res Stn, Improvement Branch, 3401 Reservoir Rd, Vernon, BC V1B 2C7, Canada.",Greg.ONeill@gov.bc.ca,,,,,,,56,29,29,1,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In particular, most West African states explicitly focus on hybrid mixes of variable renewable power sources-solar, wind and hydropower-in their targets for the electricity sector. Hydropower, the main current RE resource in West Africa, is strongly sensitive to monsoon rainfall variability, which has led to power crises in the past. Therefore, solar and wind power could play a stronger role in the future as countries move to power systems with high shares of RE. Considering the policy focus on diversified RE portfolios, there is a strong need to provide climate services for assessing how these resources could function together in a power mix. In this study, climate data from the state-of-the-art ERA5 reanalysis is used to assess the synergies of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power potential in West Africa at hourly resolution. A new metric, the stability coefficient. Cstab, is developed to quantify the synergies of solar PV and wind power for achieving a balanced power output and limiting storage needs. Using this metric, it is demonstrated that there is potential for exploiting hybrid solar/wind power in a larger area of West Africa, covering more important centers of population and closer to existing grid structures, than would be suggested by average maps of solar and wind resource availability or capacity factor for the region. The results of this study highlight why multi-scale temporal synergies of power mixes should be considered in RE system planning from the start.","[Sterl, Sebastian; Thiery, Wim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Sterl, Sebastian; van Lipzig, Nicole P.

Based on a long-term state-of-the-art hindcast product recently completed by the authors' group, this work investigates the decadal variation of the MC rainfall predictability in the wet season for the first time. The prediction skills were relatively high before 1940 and after 1980, but relatively low between these years. In a diagnostic analysis of the controlling factors of the decadal variation, the signal strength represented by the variance of the rainfall variability was identified as the dominant factor. Further analysis concluded that the phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are the key controlling sources. The MC rainfall was more predictable during periods dominated by El Nino events than during periods dominated by La Nina events because El Nino elicits stronger ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropics, providing a stronger signal of MC rainfall than La Nina events.","[Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Ting] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Youmin] Univ Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Tang, Youmin] HoHai Univ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaojing; Tang, Youmin; Liu, Ting] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; University of Northern British Columbia; Hohai University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory,"Tang, YM (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada.;Tang, YM (corresponding author), HoHai Univ, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Tang, YM (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",ytang@unbc.ca,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706009, 42006034]; Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction II project [GASI-04-QYQH-01]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction II project,"This work is supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0604202), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41730535), the Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction II project (GASI-04-QYQH-01), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41706009 and 42006034).",,46,0,0,6,6,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

However, because of limitations inherent to the time integration schemes used in present-day ocean models, state-of-the-art climate change simulations resolve the oceans only very coarsely. With an aim to enable long-term simulations of ocean circulation at the high resolutions required for a better representation of global ocean dynamics, we have implemented fully-implicit time integration schemes in a version of the popular ocean general circulation model POP (Parallel Ocean Program), employing Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov techniques. Here, we describe the numerical principles underlying iPOP in some detail and present a few computational results. While there are many advantages to this approach, including a consistent and uniform treatment of the terms in the governing equations, the primary advantage lies in the ability to take time steps that are of relevance to the physical phenomenon that is being studied. The time step is not limited (for stability reasons) by the fastest modes of the system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This model was modified to study atmospheric change effects in the watershed. Water balance modelling techniques, modified for assessing climate effects, were developed and tested for a watershed using atmospheric change scenarios from both state of the art general circulation models and a series of hypothetical scenarios. The model computed daily surface, inter- and groundwater hows from the watershed. The moisture, infiltration and recharge rate are also computed in the soil reservoirs. The thirty years of simulated data can be used to evaluate the effects of climatic change on soil moisture, recharge rate and surface and subsurface flow systems. The interaction between surface and subsurface water is discussed in relation to climate change. These hydrological results raise the possibility of major environmental and socioeconomic difficulties and have significant implications for future water resource planning and management.

It is universally applicable to cities worldwide and capable of supporting various urban studies. Although optical and dual-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data continue to push the frontiers of this task, the potential of quad-pol SAR data for LCZ classification is not yet explored. In this article, we propose a novel complex-valued convolutional neural network (CNN), SAR4LCZ-Net, to tackle this challenge. SAR4LCZ-Net improves the state-of-the-art by exploiting two facts of this specific task: the semantic hierarchical structure of the LCZ classification scheme and the complex-valued nature of quad-pol SAR data. To validate the performance of our algorithm, we generate a Chinese Gaofen-3 quad-pol SAR dataset for LCZ which covers 31 cities around the world. Results show that the proposed SAR4LCZ-Net improves 2.4% on overall accuracy (OA) and 4.5% on average accuracy (AA) compared with the real-valued CNN with the same structure. Gaofen-3 quad-pol SAR data also showed its advantage over the dual-pol Sentinel-1 data. It enhanced 5.0% on OA and 7.2% on AA in LCZ classification, under a fair comparison with a model trained by Sentinel-1 of the same area.","[Zhang, Rui; Yang, Wei; Chen, Jie] Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanyuan; Hu, Jingliang; Zhu, Xiao Xiang] Tech Univ Munich, Data Sci Earth Observat, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Wang, Yuanyuan; Zhu, Xiao Xiang] German Aerosp Ctr, Remote Sensing Technol Inst, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Yang, Wei; Chen, Jie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Technical University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Zhu, XX (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Data Sci Earth Observat, D-80333 Munich, Germany.;Chen, J (corresponding author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",zrui201@buaa.edu.cn; yuanyuan.wang@dlr.de; jingliang.hu@dlr.de; yangweigigi@sina.com; chenjie@buaa.edu.cn; xiaoxiang.zhu@dlr.de,"Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; Lv, Yuanjie/AER-0767-2022; Wang, Yu/GZL-9655-2022; wangwangwang, yuanyaun/HHN-6432-2022; Wang, Yuan/GRF-3621-2022","Zhang, Rui/0000-0002-7162-6751; Hu, Jingliang/0000-0002-0690-5260; Zhu, Xiao Xiang/0000-0001-5530-3613","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61861136008, 61701012]; Technical University of Munich-Beihang Doctoral Exchange Program; China Scholarship Council [CSC 202006020127]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [ERC-2016-StG-714087]; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Excellent Professorship Data Science in Earth Observation-Big Data Fusion for Urban Research",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Technical University of Munich-Beihang Doctoral Exchange Program; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Helmholtz Excellent Professorship Data Science in Earth Observation-Big Data Fusion for Urban Research,"Manuscript received June 21, 2021; revised November 15, 2021 and December 12, 2021; accepted December 20, 2021.

Vapor baths were popular medical devices used to fortify a patient's health by passing hot or cold air charged with steam over the skin, a vital membrane through which impurities were thought to be excreted from the body. This essay discusses vapor bathing's role in establishing environmental mediation as an underlying principle of modern British architecture. It shows how bathing practices were adapted to deliver localized forms of atmospheric medicine inside buildings, making architectural interiors a key site for the formulation of Victorian ideas of public health. Bathing offers evidence of how the climate-controlled interior emerged out of a confluence of medical ecology, moral demography, and technical innovation.","[Valen, Dustin] Concordia Univ, Dept Hist, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Valen, D (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Hist, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,Paul Mellon Centre for British Art; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Paul Mellon Centre for British Art; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR),"Travel, research, and writing for this essay was supported by the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) in the form of a postdoctoral fellowship.

The different photovoltaic cells developed up to date can be classified into four main categories called generations (GEN), and the current market is mainly covered by the first two GEN. The 1GEN (mono or polycrystalline silicon cells and gallium arsenide) comprises well-known medium/low cost technologies that lead to moderate yields. The 2GEN (thin-film technologies) includes devices that have lower efficiency albeit are cheaper to manufacture. The 3GEN presents the use of novel materials, as well as a great variability of designs, and comprises expensive but very efficient cells. The 4GEN, also known as inorganics-in-organics, combines the low cost/flexibility of polymer thin films with the stability of novel inorganic nanostructures (i.e., metal nanoparticles and metal oxides) with organic-based nanomaterials (i.e., carbon nanotubes, graphene and its derivatives), and are currently under investigation. The main goal of this review is to show the current state of art on photovoltaic cell technology in terms of the materials used for the manufacture, efficiency and production costs. A comprehensive comparative analysis of the four generations is performed, including the device architectures, their advantages and limitations. Special emphasis is placed on the 4GEN, where the diverse roles of the organic and nano-components are discussed.

Adverse weather events create challenges for energy systems such as wind turbines and photovoltaics. To maintain energy efficiently and operational fidelity, snow, frost, and ice need to be removed efficiently and rapidly. State-of-the-art removal methods are energy-intensive (energy density > 30 J cm(-2)) and slow (>1 min). Here, pulsed Joule heating is developed on transparent self-cleaning interfaces, demonstrating interfacial desnowing, defrosting, and deicing with energy efficiency (energy density < 10 J cm(-2)) and rapidity (approximate to 1 s) beyond what is currently available. The transparency and self-cleaning are tailored to remove both snow and dust while ensuring minimal interference with optical light absorption. It is experimentally demonstrated a multi-functional coating material on a commercial photovoltaic cell, demonstrating efficient energy generation recovery and rapid ice/snow removal with minimal energy consumption. Through the elimination of accretion, this technology can potentially widen the applicability of photovoltaics and wind technologies to globally promising locations, potentially further reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change.","[Li, Longnan; Khodakarami, Siavash; Yan, Xiao; Rabbi, Kazi Fazle; Gunay, Ahmet Alperen; Miljkovic, Nenad] Univ Illinois, Mech Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Li, Longnan] Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Opt Fine Mech & Phys, State Key Lab Appl Opt, GPL Photon Lab, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China; [Stillwell, Andrew; Miljkovic, Nenad] Univ Illinois, Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Miljkovic, Nenad] Univ Illinois, Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Miljkovic, Nenad] Kyushu Univ, Int Inst Carbon Neutral Energy Res WPI I2CNER, Nishi Ku, 744 Moto Oka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics & Physics, CAS; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Kyushu University","Miljkovic, N (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Mech Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Miljkovic, N (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Miljkovic, N (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Miljkovic, N (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Int Inst Carbon Neutral Energy Res WPI I2CNER, Nishi Ku, 744 Moto Oka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",nmiljkov@illinois.edu,"Gunay, Ahmet/AAZ-3867-2021; Fazle Rabbi, Kazi/AAM-8488-2021; Fazle Rabbi, Kazi/AAM-3753-2021","Gunay, Ahmet/0000-0002-2013-9101; Fazle Rabbi, Kazi/0000-0003-3630-1625","National Science Foundation [1554249]; Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center; International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER) - Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center; International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER) - Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1554249 and the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center.

Therefore, gridded products are frequently used as the only available climate data source in peripheral regions. However, associated evaluations are commonly biased towards well observed areas and consequently, station-based datasets. As evaluations on vegetation monitoring abilities are lacking for regions with poor data availability, we analyzed the potential of several state-of-the-art climate datasets (CHIRPS, CRU, ERA5-Land, GPCC-Monitoring-Product, IMERG-GPM, MERRA-2, MODIS-MOD10A1) for assessing NDVI anomalies (MODIS-MOD13Q1) in two particularly suitable remote conservation areas. We calculated anomalies of 156 climate variables and seasonal periods during 2001-2018, correlated these with vegetation anomalies while taking the multiple comparison problem into consideration, and computed their spatial performance to derive suitable parameters. Our results showed that four datasets (MERRA-2, ERA5-Land, MOD10A1, CRU) were suitable for vegetation analysis in both regions, by showing significant correlations controlled at a false discovery rate<5% and in more than half of the analyzed areas. Cross-validated variable selection and importance assessment based on the Boruta algorithm indicated high importance of the reanalysis datasets ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 in both areas but higher differences and variability between the regions with all other products. CHIRPS, GPCC and the bias-corrected version of MERRA-2 were unsuitable and not important in both regions. We provide evidence that reanalysis datasets are most suitable for spatiotemporally consistent environmental analysis whereas gauge- or satellite-based products and their combinations are highly variable and may not be applicable in peripheral areas.","[Zandler, Harald; Senftl, Thomas] Univ Bayreuth, Working Grp Climatol, Dept Geog, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Zandler, Harald] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany; [Vanselow, Kim Andre] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Zandler, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Working Grp Climatol, Dept Geog, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.;Zandler, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany.",harald.zandler@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Zandler, Harald/0000-0001-5505-2455",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,114,10,11,3,23,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,31-Dec,2020,1,,,,,,22446,10.1038/s41598-020-79480-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79480-y,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,PP1HA,33384431,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000605618400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most recent candidate-replacement compounds have atmospheric lifetimes shorter than 1 year in order to limit their environmental effects. Especially for chemicals with extremely short lifetimes, on the order of several to tens of days, the stratospheric halogen loading and ozone loss from Such gases strongly depend on the location of emissions. Using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional global chemistry-transport model (CTM) of the troposphere and the stratosphere, we have calculated the potential effects of very short-lived Substances (VSLS) such as n-propyl bromide (nPB), iodotrifluoromethane (CF3I), and methyl iodine (CH3I) on atmospheric ozone. The model-derived lifetimes and ODPs of these halogenated compounds for mid-latitude emissions and of CF3I for tropical emissions are presented in this chapter. On the other hand, ozone depletion due to emission of bromochlorofluorocarbons, or Halons, leads to cooling of the climate system in the opposite direction to direct warming contribution of the Halons as greenhouse gases. This cooling is a key indirect effect of Halons on radiative forcing or climate. Using atmospheric models, CTMs and a radiative transfer model, we have explicitly calculated the indirect GWPs of Halon-1211 and -1301 for a 100-year time horizon. The calculated indirect effects of Halon-1211 are much smaller than those published in earlier studies. Nevertheless, our new model-based assessment of the indirect GWPs of the two major Halons confirms the importance of indirect effects on climate.","[Wuebbles, Donald J.] 105 S Gregory St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Youn, Daeok; Patten, Ken; Wang, Dong] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Martinez-Aviles, Monica] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Wuebbles, DJ (corresponding author), 105 S Gregory St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",wuebbles@atmos.uiuc.edu,"YOUN, DAEOK/D-1905-2009","YOUN, DAEOK/0000-0003-0770-9330",University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA); U.S. Department of Energy; Global Change Education Program-Graduate Research Environmental Fellowship,University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Global Change Education Program-Graduate Research Environmental Fellowship,"This research was partially supported by the University of Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and utilized NCSAs Copper and Cobalt.

With increasing flood risk, it is becoming more important to be able to assess the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies. To guide the design of such strategies, policy makers need tools to prioritize where adaptation is needed and how much adaptation funds are required. In this country-scale study, we show how flood risk analyses can be used in cost-benefit analyses to prioritize investments in flood adaptation strategies in Mexico under future climate scenarios. Moreover, given the often limited availability of detailed local data for such analyses, we show how state-of-the-art global data and flood risk assessment models can be applied for a detailed assessment of optimal flood-protection strategies. Our results show that especially states along the Gulf of Mexico have considerable economic benefits from investments in adaptation that limit risks from both river and coastal floods, and that increased flood-protection standards are economically beneficial for many Mexican states. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to modelling uncertainties, the transferability of our modelling approach and policy implications.

Orpen was not only a colonial official but also a keen scholar. In response to his questions Qing commented on some of the rock paintings they saw on their short journey and recounted folklore. A year later Qing's narratives and his comments on rock art were published along with Orpen's account of the journey and remarks' by the celebrated linguist and collector of |Xam narrative, Wilhelm Bleek in an article in the Cape Monthly Magazine (CMM). Orpen's piece has enjoyed a seminal position in San studies ever since, especially in the field of rock art. The encounter between Qing and Orpen occurred in a context of colonial violence. Not only was the campaign that was being pursued against Langalibalele and his men unnecessary but the San had been subject to genocidal attacks by both regular and irregular colonial forces for a considerable period of time, and the studies of San rock art and narrative at the time were largely carried out in an intellectual climate that saw the extinction of the San as inevitable. This article will locate the CMM article more firmly in its colonial context by combining a close reading of elements of the CMM article itself with a consideration of a wider body of writing that relates to Orpen's piece.","[Wessels, Michael] Univ Western Cape, English Literature, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Wessels, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, English Literature, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",mwessels@uwc.ac.za,,,NRF,NRF,The research on which this article is based was conducted with the help of NRF funding for rated researchers.

We used a space-for-time substitution approach to assess the response of trophic and community structures as well as the richness and evenness of multiple trophic levels to temperature, hydrological, and nutrient constraints. We selected 41 lakes covering wide climatic, hydrological, and nutrient gradients within a short distance for reducing the effect of biogeographical factors in the western Anatolian plateau of Turkey. Generalized linear model analyses revealed that temperature was overall the most important driving variable, followed by total nitrogen (TN) and salinity. The chlorophylla:total phosphorus ratio, the cyanobacteria:total phytoplankton biovolume ratio, the fish:zooplankton biomass ratio, the proportion of small fish, and fish richness increased with increasing temperature, whereas macrophyte plant volume inhabited (PVI, %), richness, and evenness decreased. Grazing pressure, macrophyte coverage, piscivore biomass, phytoplankton richness, and evenness decreased significantly with both increasing TN and temperature. Temperature and nutrients also separated the northern highland lakes from other lakes in a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Additionally, salinity reduced richness and evenness of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Our results indicate major changes in lake structure and functioning with warming and eutrophication, and highlight the need for strict control of nutrients and water use.","[Beklioglu, Meryem; Bucak, Tuba; Levi, Eti E.; Erdogan, Seyda; Ozen, Arda; Filiz, Nur; Bezirci, Gizem; Cakiroglu, Ayse Idil; Tavsanoglu, U.

Using the retrospective forecasts of six-state-of-the-art coupled models and their multi-model ensemble (MME) for December-January-February during the period of 1972-2005 along with corresponding observed and reanalyzed data, we examine the climate regime shift that occurred in the winter of 1988/1989 and how the shift affected interannual variability and predictability of two types of ENSO for the two periods of 1972-1988 (hereafter PRE) and 1989-2005 (hereafter POST). The result first shows substantial interdecadal changes of observed sea surface temperature (SST) in mean state and variability over the western and central Pacific attributable to the significant warming trend in the POST period. In the POST period, the SST variability increased (decreased) significantly over the western (eastern) Pacific. The MME realistically reproduces the observed interdecadal changes with 1- and 4-month forecast lead time. It is found that the CP-type ENSO was more prominent and predictable during the POST than the PRE period while there was no apparent difference in the variability and predictability of the EP-type ENSO between two periods. Note that the second empirical orthogonal function mode of the Pacific SST during the POST period represents the CP-type ENSO but that during the PRE period captures the ENSO transition phase. The MME better predicts the former than the latter. We also investigate distinctive regional impacts associated with the two types of ENSO during the two periods.","[Jeong, Hye-In] APEC Climate Ctr APCC, Pusan, South Korea; [Jeong, Hye-In; Ahn, Joong-Bae] Pusan Natl Univ, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Lee, June-Yi] Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Environm Studies, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Alessandri, Andrea] Agenzia Nazl Nuove Tecnol Energia & Sviluppo Econ, Rome, Italy; [Alessandri, Andrea] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Hendon, Harry H.] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Pusan National University; Pusan National University; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; University of Hawaii System; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lee, JY (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Environm Studies, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",juneyi@pusan.ac.kr,"Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021; Jeong, Hyein/AAW-3494-2020; Alessandri, Andrea/I-9077-2014; Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Alessandri, Andrea/0000-0002-2153-7961; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Jeong, Hyein/0000-0002-2235-7188; Hendon, Harry H./0000-0002-4378-2263","Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), Republic of Korea; Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development, Republic of Korea [PJ009953]; European Commission [303208, 308378]; IPRC; JAMSTEC; NOAA; NASA","Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), Republic of Korea; Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development, Republic of Korea; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); IPRC; JAMSTEC; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","We appreciate the anonymous three reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

A clear understanding of the underlying causes driving these monsoon hydroclimatic signals has remained elusive. Using a state-of-the-art global climate model with high-resolution zooming over South Asia, we demonstrate that a juxtaposition of regional land-use changes, anthropogenic-aerosol forcing and the rapid warming signal of the equatorial Indian Ocean is crucial to produce the observed monsoon weakening in recent decades. Our findings also show that this monsoonal weakening significantly enhances occurrence of localized intense precipitation events, as compared to the global-warming response. A 21st century climate projection using the same high-resolution model indicates persistent decrease of monsoonal rains and prolongation of soil drying. Critical value-additions from this study include (1) realistic simulation of the mean and long-term historical trends in the Indian monsoon rainfall (2) robust attributions of changes in moderate and heavy precipitation events over Central India (3) a 21st century projection of drying trend of the South Asian monsoon. The present findings have profound bearing on the regional water-security, which is already under severe hydrological-stress.","[Krishnan, R.; Sabin, T.

COMET is derived from the MVIRI and SEVIRI imagers aboard geostationary Meteosat satellites and features a Cloud Fractional Cover (CFC) climatology in high temporal (1 h) and spatial (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees) resolution. The CM SAF long-term cloud fraction climatology is a unique long-term dataset that resolves the diurnal cycle of cloudiness. The cloud detection algorithm optimally exploits the limited information from only two channels (broad band visible and thermal infrared) acquired by older geostationary sensors. The underlying algorithm employs a cyclic generation of clear sky background fields, uses continuous cloud scores and runs a naive Bayesian cloud fraction estimation using concurrent information on cloud state and variability. The algorithm depends on well-characterized infrared radiances (IR) and visible reflectances (VIS) from the Meteosat Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR) provided by EUMETSAT. The evaluation of both Level-2 (instantaneous) and Level-3 (daily and monthly means) cloud fractional cover (CFC) has been performed using two reference datasets: ground-based cloud observations (SYNOP) and retrievals from an active satellite instrument (CALIPSO/CALIOP). Intercomparisons have employed concurrent state-of-the-art satellite-based datasets derived from geostationary and polar orbiting passive visible and infrared imaging sensors (MODIS, CLARA-A2, CLAAS-2, PATMOS-x and CC4CL-AVHRR). Averaged over all reference SYNOP sites on the monthly time scale, COMET CFC reveals (for 0-100% CFC) a mean bias of -0.14%, a root mean square error of 7.04% and a trend in bias of -0.94% per decade. The COMET shortcomings include larger negative bias during the Northern Hemispheric winter, lower precision for high sun zenith angles and high viewing angles, as well as an inhomogeneity around 1995/1996. Yet, we conclude that the COMET CFC corresponds well to the corresponding SYNOP measurements, and it is thus useful to extend in both space and time century-long ground-based climate observations.","[Bojanowski, Jedrzej S.] Inst Geodesy & Cartog, Ctr Remote Sensing, Kaczmarskiego 27, PL-02679 Warsaw, Poland; [Bojanowski, Jedrzej S.; Stockli, Reto; Duguay-Tetzlaff, Anke] Operat Ctr 1, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Climate Serv, POB 257, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland; [Finkensieper, Stephan; Hollmann, Rainer] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany",Institute of Geodesy & Cartography; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Bojanowski, JS (corresponding author), Inst Geodesy & Cartog, Ctr Remote Sensing, Kaczmarskiego 27, PL-02679 Warsaw, Poland.;Bojanowski, JS (corresponding author), Operat Ctr 1, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Climate Serv, POB 257, CH-8058 Zurich, Switzerland.",jedrzej.bojanowski@igik.edu.pl; Reto.Stoeckli@meteoswiss.ch; Anke.Duguay-Tetzlaff@meteoswiss.ch; Stephan.Finkensieper@dwd.de; Rainer.Hollmann@dwd.de,"Bojanowski, Jedrzej/B-4358-2011","Bojanowski, Jedrzej/0000-0001-8460-4183; Finkensieper, Stephan/0000-0002-7343-661X",EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF); Polish National Science Centre under the POLONEZ grant [2015/19/P/ST10/03990]; European Union [665778],EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF); Polish National Science Centre under the POLONEZ grant; European Union(European Commission),This work was supported by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and the Polish National Science Centre under the POLONEZ grant No 2015/19/P/ST10/03990 that received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 665778.,,52,9,9,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2018,5,,,,,,804,10.3390/rs10050804,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10050804,,,23,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,GJ3MA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000435198400146,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our understanding of the synoptic conditions on the TP is, however, still limited due to the paucity of meteorological measurements and proxy-based, high-resolution climate reconstructions. Here, we use state-of-the-art dendroclimatological techniques to investigate the paleoclimatic potential of drought-sensitive Picea likiangensis var. balfouriana forests between 4000 and 4500m asl on the southeastern TP (SETP). The newly developed tree-ring width chronology correlates significantly with yearly changes in regional relative air humidity (RH) (r=0.85, P<0.001, 1978-2011). A new 407-year-long reconstruction of RH over the hydrological year from previous year August to July of the year of ring formation shows that, despite the generally humid conditions, four of the ten driest years are observed in the twentieth century with 1983 having been the driest. On the other hand, seven out of the ten most humid years were found in the eighteenth century. Our reconstruction reveals that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is the dominant climate driver at multi-decadal scales, but the relationships are not stable over time, with unknown underlying mechanisms. Although our study demonstrates the importance of the PDO for hydroclimate projections on the TP, caution is advised when considering only its most recent fluctuations.","[Lyu, Lixin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Lixin; Buentgen, Ulf; Treydte, Kerstin; Reinig, Frederick; Nievergelt, Daniel; Li, Mai-He; Cherubini, Paolo] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Buentgen, Ulf] Global Change Res Ctr CzechGlobe, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Buentgen, Ulf] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Yu, Kailiang] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Liang, Hanxue] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, 723 Xingke Rd, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Cambridge; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS","Lyu, LX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Lyu, LX (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",lixinlv@ibcas.ac.cn,"Lyu, Lixin/D-4976-2009; Cherubini, Paolo/AAC-3121-2021; Cherubini, Paolo/N-9702-2013; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013","Cherubini, Paolo/0000-0002-9809-250X; Cherubini, Paolo/0000-0002-9809-250X; Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; Lyu, Lixin/0000-0002-4996-7867; Treydte, Kerstin/0000-0001-8399-6517","Natural Science Foundation of China [31330015, 41771060]; China Scholarship Council [201770490418]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 31330015 and 41771060) and the China Scholarship Council (No. 201770490418).

In both models, under abrupt CO2 forcing, we find an asymmetric response in surface temperature and S-G. The surface global warming at 8xCO(2) is more than one third larger than the corresponding cooling at 1/8xCO(2), and S-G is CO2 dependent, increasing non-monotonically from 1/8xCO(2) to 8xCO(2). We find similar CO2 dependence in the transient runs, forced with -1%yr(-1)CO(2) and +1%yr(-1)CO(2) up to 1/8xCO(2) and 8xCO(2), respectively. The non-logarithmic radiative forcing-not the changing feedbacks-primarily explains the dependence of S-G on CO2, particularly at low CO2 levels.

This study comprehensively evaluates the performances of state-of-the-art satellite-based and model-based precipitation products, including the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), ERA5, and ERA5-Land, over mainland China from 2016 to 2019. The main findings are as follows: (1) Satellite-based products generally outperform model-based products, but the latter significantly perform better than the former over high-latitude regions and in winter. (2) ERA5 and ERA5-Land share similar spatio-temporal patterns and have their own advantages in terms of different types of metrics. (3) Satellite-based products perform best over subregions of subtropical and tropical monsoon climate (ST), whereas model-based products show highest performance over subregions of temperate monsoon climate (TM) and temperate continental climate (TC); both types of products show the poorest performance over subregions of plateau mountain climate (PM). (4) IMERG-Final performs best in terms of precipitation events, while GSMaP-Gauge tends to overestimate the duration of precipitation events, and model-based products tend to underestimate the mean precipitation rate of the events. These findings provide valuable insights into the error characteristics of state-of-the-art model-based and satellite-based precipitation products in the recent years, and will also serve as useful reference for the potential improvement of precipitation retrieval algorithms in the next generation.","[Xu, Jintao; Ma, Ziqiang; Yan, Songkun] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ziqiang] China Meteorol Adm, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, Jie] Tarim Univ, Coll Plant Sci, Alar, Peoples R China",Peking University; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tarim University,"Ma, ZQ; Peng, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ziqma@pku.edu.cn; pjzky@taru.edu.cn,"Ma, Ziqiang/GQI-2532-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901343]; Key R&D Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2018YFC1506500]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M630037, 2019T120021]; Open Grants of the State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather [2021LASW-B12]; Research on Key Technologies of Early Warning and Forecast using Satellite-based and Ground-based Spatio-temporal data [RB2003]; Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China [OFSLRSS201909]; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, China; Research and development of real-time monitoring of water quality of large areas based on remote sensing technology [20190365]; Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Plan Project [[2020] 1Y155]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key R&D Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Open Grants of the State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather; Research on Key Technologies of Early Warning and Forecast using Satellite-based and Ground-based Spatio-temporal data; Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, China; Research and development of real-time monitoring of water quality of large areas based on remote sensing technology; Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Plan Project","We appreciate the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and insightful suggestions.

Internationally, a great deal of research has been dedicated to this topic. In the face of climate change, New Zealand, like other countries in the world, is paying attention to this topic, which, however, is often considered a secondary aspect of the design process. This is reflected in the design of some buildings, especially residential developments, where there is a lack of consideration of optimal orientation. This research aims to extend our knowledge of state-of-the-art solar shadings in contemporary New Zealand architecture in order to determine what possible future improvements might be. In total, 339 products and 215 facades built between 2005 and 2021 were studied to achieve this objective.

However, studies to date have focused on terrestrial fauna and there is little understanding of how marine species responded to past climate change. Here we show that a true Arctic species, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), shifted its range and tracked its core suitable habitat northwards during the rapid climate change of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Late Pleistocene lineages survived into the Holocene and effective female population size increased rapidly, concurrent with a threefold increase in core suitable habitat. This study highlights that responses to climate change are likely to be species specific and difficult to predict. We estimate that the core suitable habitat of bowhead whales will be almost halved by the end of this century, potentially influencing future population dynamics.","[Foote, Andrew D.; Schultze, Sebastian E.; Stokowska, Catherine; Gregersen, Kristian; Willerslev, Eske; Gilbert, M.

This trend empowered us to deepen our understanding of urban-scale climatology with much finer spatial-temporal details. However, these high-resolution models would also be particularly sensitive to model uncertainties, especially in urbanizing cities where natural surface texture is changed artificially into impervious surfaces with extreme rapidity. These artificial changes always lead to dramatic changes in the land surface process. While models capturing detailed meteorological processes are being refined continuously, the input data quality has been the primary source of biases in modeling results but has received inadequate attention. To address this issue, we first examine the quality of the incoming static data in two cities in China, i e , Shenzhen and Hong Kong SAR, provided by the WRF ARW model, a widely applied stateof-the-art mesoscale numerical weather simulation model. Shenzhen has gone through an unprecedented urbanization process in the past 30 years, and Hong Kong SAR is another well-urbanized city. A significant proportion of the incoming data is outdated, highlighting the necessity of conducting incoming data quality control in the region of Shenzhen and Hong Kong SAR. Therefore, we proposed a so- phisticated methodology to develop a high-resolution land surface dataset in this region. We conducted urban climate simulations in this region using both the developed land surface dataset and the original dataset utilizing the WRF ARW model coupled with Noah LSM/SLUCM and evaluated the performance of modeling results. The performance of modeling results using the developed high-resolution urban land surface datasets is significantly improved compared to modeling results using the original land surface dataset in this region. This result demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Our results provide evidence of the effects of incoming land surface data quality on the accuracy of high-resolution urban climate simulations and emphasize the importance of the incoming data quality control.","[Li, Zhiqiang] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Wan, Bingcheng] Glarun Technol Co Ltd, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yulun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Wong, Hokit] City Univ Hong Kong, Enterprise Solut Off, Hong Kong 999097, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong,"Li, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",paterlee@hku.hk,"; Li, Zhiqiang/P-4076-2018","Wong, Ho Kit/0000-0002-4439-9653; Li, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-4827-5516; Yulun, ZHOU/0000-0002-9607-2185",,,,,22,0,0,0,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The early thermometers had unknown scales and temperature units, with deviations due to the bulb shape or the thermometric liquid, but it is possible to interpret them after comparison between parallel readings. Historical sources and the analysis of the data fingerprints and their variability permit recognition of where instruments were located and who the observers were. It is also possible to relate the indoor climate of historical buildings to the outdoor one, and transform indoor readings as they were taken outdoors, expressed in Celsius. The Bologna series has been compared with the contemporary observations in Padua, Venice and Milano. The climate analysis shows that the temperature fluctuated but with an increasing trend. The 1730-1770 decades constituted the coldest period and 1980-today the warmest one. The eighteenth century was generally cold and had an impressive frequency of extremely severe winters that exceeded the rest of the series.

The capability of different state-of-the-art RCMs (with and without spectral nudging applied) to add value for surface marine wind speed in comparison to the reanalysis wind speed forcing is assessed by the comparison with observations in the eastern North Atlantic in 1998. Added value is elaborated on instantaneous wind speeds and their frequency distribution. The observations are discriminated into groups according to their proximity to land and assimilation status, meaning whether they are assimilated into the reanalysis or not. For instantaneous wind speeds RCMs do not show added value both in open ocean'' areas and the German Bight. However, in the English Channel, where local topography and associated local wind regimes become important, the regional models show an added value for instantaneous wind speeds. Concerning the wind speed distribution there is a clear indication for an added value of the RCMs in coastal regions, especially for higher wind speed percentiles, while in open-ocean areas no added value is found. In comparison to the unnudged simulation, the spectrally nudged simulations better represent both instantaneous wind speeds and their frequency distribution. These results hold independently of the measurements' assimilation status. Strictly the findings of this study only hold for hindcast studies, the results may differ for other areas and years.","[Winterfeldt, Joerg; Weisse, Ralf] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Winterfeldt, Joerg] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, IMPRS, ESM, Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Max Planck Society,"Winterfeldt, J (corresponding author), GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",j_winterfeldt@hotmail.com,"Weisse, Ralf/E-7550-2013","Weisse, Ralf/0000-0001-7449-6166",DFG,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was funded by the DFG within the special research project 512.

In order to maintain their immediate energy levels and restore the atmosphere, coal-based countries need alternative fuels. For example, wonder inclusion to renewable energy are biofuels derived from crop residues devoid of sacrificing on food production. Annually, about 65 million tonnes (or 280 million metric tonnes) of energy crop-based ethanol are generated, which itself is equal to China's present gasoline ethanol output (2 million tonnes per year). The adverse effects of bioenergy production can vary highly depending on biological sources, land locations and management practices. Replacing fossil fuels with biofuels can significantly reduce these harmful effects arising from various fossil fuels. Identifying crop growing areas, appropriate bioenergy cultivars and appropriate management practices will contribute to the rig environment and biochemical sustainable development. Improved farm management and landscape planning are valuable for ecological services. This paper discusses several biofuels induced patterns of land managements, and generations of biofuel resources practices, cultivation of bioenergy crops environmental implications, and prospective techniques for establishing ecologically friendly biomass energy programmes.

Nineteenth-century authors and scientists, faced with their own long temporal spans, devised strategies for representing the slow causalities of geological and generational processes, for which empirical evidence was often scarce. For writers like Charles Lyell, Charles Babbage, Samuel Smiles, and George Eliot, slowness served not only as a description but also as a narrative strategy, a means of inviting belief in, and consent to, the act of tracing causes to their distant ends. They use narrative to reimagine the relationship between evidence and causality, with the potential to influence the way we think about climate change debates today.","[Choi, Tina Young] York Univ, English, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Choi, Tina Young] York Univ, Grad Fac Sci & Technol Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Leckie, Barbara] Carleton Univ, Dept English, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Leckie, Barbara] Carleton Univ, Inst Comparat Study Literature Art & Culture, Ottawa, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; Carleton University; Carleton University,"Choi, TY (corresponding author), York Univ, English, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Choi, TY (corresponding author), York Univ, Grad Fac Sci & Technol Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",tinayc@yorku.ca; barbara_leckie@carleton.ca,,,,,,,58,2,2,0,1,INDIANA UNIV PRESS,BLOOMINGTON,"601 N MORTON STREET, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47404-3797 USA",0042-5222,1527-2052,,VICTORIAN STUD,Vic.

Eco-hydrological simulation is an important approach to study the interaction between ecological and hydrological processes.

The two main properties of the building envelope to look at in this perspective are thermal transmittance (U, W/m(2)K(1)) and thermal inertia, which is often expressed by a metric called periodic thermal transmittance (Y-ie, W/m(2)K(1)). These two properties are also traditionally connected to two different energy demands: while thermal transmittance is crucial to reduce heating energy demand, thermal inertia has an impact on energy demand for cooling. However, a question may rise about the impact of each property on the other demand - i.e. the impact of thermal insulation on the cooling energy demand and the impact of thermal inertia on the heating demand. A parametric analysis on the influence of the thermal inertia on the energy performance of a single family house in a Nordic climate has been carried out to answer to this question.  Ideal envelopes have been modelled and simulated, meaning that used thermophysical properties do not represent any specific configuration, but the entire spectrum of technological configurations. The results show that the influence of the thermal inertia on the heating energy need is very limited. Solutions characterized by very high thermal inertia do not allow heating energy demand to be sensibly decreased. Periodic thermal transmittance has instead an impact on the heating load. The impact of the thermal inertia is also assessed in the warmer season, and the results show that this parameter does not significantly contribute to a better behavior (especially when the upper limit of the indoor air temperature is controlled). Limitations to value of thermal transmittance are also pointed out to avoid non-energy effective conditions when the total (heating plus cooling) annual performance is considered.

Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science.","[Li, Francis G.

The ensemble mean compares well against present day observations. The seasonal cycle correlates well, except for some locations in the tropical upper troposphere. Most (75%) of the models are encompassed with a range of global mean tropospheric ozone column estimates from satellite data, but there is a suggestion of a high bias in the Northern Hemisphere and a low bias in the Southern Hemisphere, which could indicate deficiencies with the ozone precursor emissions. Compared to the present day ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden of 337 +/- 23 Tg, the ensemble mean burden for 1850 time slice is similar to 30% lower. Future changes were modelled using emissions and climate projections from four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Compared to 2000, the relative changes in the ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden in 2030 (2100) for the different RCPs are: -4% (-16%) for RCP2.6, 2% (-7%) for RCP4.5, 1% (-9%) for RCP6.0, and 7% (18%) for RCP8.5. Model agreement on the magnitude of the change is greatest for larger changes. Reductions in most precursor emissions are common across the RCPs and drive ozone decreases in all but RCP8.5, where doubled methane and a 40-150% greater stratospheric influx (estimated from a subset of models) increase ozone. While models with a high ozone burden for the present day also have high ozone burdens for the other time slices, no model consistently predicts large or small ozone changes; i.e. the magnitudes of the burdens and burden changes do not appear to be related simply, and the models are sensitive to emissions and climate changes in different ways. Spatial patterns of ozone changes are well correlated across most models, but are notably different for models without time evolving stratospheric ozone concentrations. A unified approach to ozone budget specifications and a rigorous investigation of the factors that drive tropospheric ozone is recommended to help future studies attribute ozone changes and inter-model differences more clearly.","[Young, P.

Newly formed nanoparticles affect human health, air quality, weather, and climate. This review provides a brief history, synthesizes recent significant progresses, and outlines the challenges and future directions for research relevant to NPF. New developments include the emergence of state-of-the-art instruments that measure prenucleation clusters and newly nucleated nanoparticles down to about 1 nm; systematic laboratory studies of multicomponent nucleation systems, including collaborative experiments conducted in the Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets chamber at CERN; observations of NPF in different types of forests, extremely polluted urban locations, coastal sites, polar regions, and high-elevation sites; and improved nucleation theories and parameterizations to account for NPF in atmospheric models. The challenges include the lack of understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms responsible for aerosol nucleation and growth under diverse environments, the effects of SO2 and NOx on NPF, and the contribution of anthropogenic organic compounds to NPF. It is also critical to develop instruments that can detect chemical composition of particles from 3 to 20 nm and improve parameterizations to represent NPF over a wide range of atmospheric conditions of chemical precursor, temperature, and humidity. Plain Language Summary In the atmosphere, invisible to the human eye, there are many microscopic particles, or nanoparticles, that affect human health, air quality, and climate. We do not fully understand the chemical processes that allow these fine particles to form and be suspended in the air nor how they influence heat flow in Earth's atmosphere. Laboratory experiments, field observations, and modeling simulations have all shown different results for how these particles behave. These inconsistencies make it difficult to accurately represent the processes of new particle formation in regional and global atmospheric models. Scientists still need to develop instruments that can measure the smallest range of nanoparticles and to find ways to describe particle formation that allow for differences in temperature, humidity, and level of pollution.","[Lee, Shan-Hu; Haley, Ryan] Univ Alabama, Dept Atmospher Sci, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Lee, Shan-Hu] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gordon, Hamish] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Yu, Huan] China Univ Geosci, Dept Atmospher Sci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lehtipalo, Katrianne] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Fac Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Lehtipalo, Katrianne] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Li, Yixin; Zhang, Renyi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zhang, Renyi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; Fudan University; University of Leeds; China University of Geosciences; University of Helsinki; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Atmospher Sci, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.;Lee, SH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",shanhu.lee@uah.edu,"Zhang, Renyi/A-2942-2011; Lee, Shan-Hu/F-9913-2014; Li, Yixin/AAJ-7247-2021","Zhang, Renyi/0000-0001-8708-3862; Li, Yixin/0000-0001-7937-7385; Lehtipalo, Katrianne/0000-0002-1660-2706; Gordon, Hamish/0000-0002-1822-3224","National Science Foundation [AGS-1649694]; UK National Environmental Research Council [NE/L013479/1]; National Science Foundation of China [41675124, 41875143]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0203100]; Robert A.

This work develops thermodynamically-compatible water use effectiveness (WUE) and power usage effectiveness (PUE) ranges needed for direct and indirect water use analysis for 10 different DC archetypes in 15 U.S. climate zones, using a hybrid physical-statistical approach that is validated with real-world data. The ranges further capture variabilities between best and poor DC efficiency practices, showing that PUE and WUE values can have relative difference as much as 62% and 100% respectively, depending on cooling technologies, efficiencies, and locations. PUE results indicate significant climate effects, whereas WUE results indicate the strongest climate effects for airside economizers with either adiabatic or water-cooled chiller systems. Collectively, the results underscore the importance of considering technology, efficiency, and climate effects when estimating PUE and WUE for direct and indirect DC water use analysis. Results also identify variables leading to best-achievable PUE and WUE values by climate zone and cooling system type-including operational set points, use of free cooling, and cooling tower equipment and operational factors-which can support DC water- and energy-efficiency policy initiatives.","[Lei, Nuoa; Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL USA; [Masanet, Eric] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lei, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nuoaLei2021@u.northwestern.edu,,,Leslie; Mac McQuown,Leslie; Mac McQuown,The authors acknowledge financial support for NL provided by Leslie and Mac McQuown.,,77,1,1,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

There is consensus in energy research that political and societal framework conditions will play a pivotal role in shaping energy transitions. In energy scenario construction, this perspective is increasingly acknowledged through the approach of informing model-based energy analysis with storylines about societal futures, an exercise we call socio-technical energy scenario construction in this article. However, there is a dispute about how to construct the storylines in a traceable, consistent, comprehensive, and reproducible way. This study aims to support energy researchers considering the use of the concept of socio-technical scenarios in two ways: first, we provide a state-of-the-art analysis of socio-technical energy scenario construction by comparing 16 studies with respect to five categories. Second, we address the dispute regarding storyline construction in energy research and examine 13 reports using the Cross-Impact Balances method.

Here vegetation strongly interacts with climate and other environmental factors, such as herbivory and humans. Fire-enabled Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) display high uncertainty in predicting the distribution of current tropical biomes and the associated transitions, mainly due to the way they represent the main ecological processes and feedbacks related to water and fire. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of two state-of-the-art DGVMs, LPJ-GUESS and JSBACH, also currently used in two Earth System Models (ESMs), in order to assess which key ecological processes need to be included or improved to represent realistic interactions between vegetation cover, precipitation and fires in sub-Saharan Africa. To this end, we compare models and remote-sensing data, analyzing the relationships between tree and grass cover, mean annual rainfall, average rainfall seasonality and average fire intervals, using generalized linear models, and we compare the patterns of grasslands, savannas, and forests in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis suggests that LPJ-GUESS (with a simple fire-model and complex vegetation description) performs well in regions of low precipitation, while in humid and mesic areas the representation of the fire process should probably be improved to obtain more open savannas. JSBACH (with a complex fire-model and a simple vegetation description) can simulate a vegetation-fire feedback that can maintain open savannas at intermediate and high precipitation, although this feedback seems to have stronger effects than observed, while at low precipitation JSBACH needs improvements in the representation of tree-grass competition and drought effects. This comparative process-based analysis permits to highlight the main factors that determine the tropical vegetation distribution in models and observations in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting possible improvements in DGVMs and, consequently, in ESM simulations for future projections. Given the need to use carbon storage in vegetation as a climate mitigation measure, these models represent a valuable tool to improve our understanding of the sustainability of vegetation carbon pools as a carbon sink and the vulnerability to disturbances such as fire.","[D'Onofrio, Donatella; von Hardenberg, Jost] CNR, ISAC, Natl Res Council, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Turin, Italy; [D'Onofrio, Donatella; Baudena, Mara] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lasslop, Gitta] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Nieradzik, Lars Peter; Warlind, David] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [von Hardenberg, Jost] Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn DIATI, Turin, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Utrecht University; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Lund University; Polytechnic University of Turin,"von Hardenberg, J (corresponding author), CNR, ISAC, Natl Res Council, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Turin, Italy.;von Hardenberg, J (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn DIATI, Turin, Italy.",jost.hardenberg@polito.it,"Wårlind, David/AAF-1153-2021; Baudena, Mara/F-4906-2011","Wårlind, David/0000-0002-6257-0338; Baudena, Mara/0000-0002-6873-6466","European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [641816]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [338130981]","European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","DD'O and JH acknowledge funding by the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no. 641816 (CRESCENDO).

For instance, increased heat stress in cows is causing average-sized dairy farms losing thousands of milk gallons each year; drastic climate change, especially in developing countries, pushing small farmers, farmers with less than 10 to 25 cattle, below the poverty line and is triggering suicides due to economic stress and social stigma. It's profoundly clear that current dairy agriculture practices are falling short to counter the impacts of climate change. What we need are innovative and intelligent dairy farming techniques that employ best of traditional practices with data infused insights to counter negative effects of climate change. To achieve innovative and intelligent dairy farming techniques, we need to disseminate state of art data science to masses. In other word, provide the state of art data science algorithms to every food harvesting citizen data scientist, farmer. The democratization of artificial intelligence to farmers, importantly, is not only empowers farmers to understand the patterns and signatures of climate change but also provides the ability to forecast the impending climate change adverse events and recommends data driven insights to counter the negative effects of climate change. With the availability of new data tools, farmers can not only improve their standard of life but also conquer, importantly, perennial climate change related suicide issue. It's our staunch believe that the gold standard for the success of the democratization of artificial intelligence is no farmer life loss due to negative effects of climate change. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning Sensor edge approach that considers the impact of climate change and develops artificial intelligent (AI) models that is validated globally but enables localized solution to thwart impacts of climate change.

The animal engravings of the Wadi al-Ajal in south-western Libya are used to isolate some of the environmental and cultural /symbolic components that make up the pictorial record. A comparison between the depicted animals and the faunal remains recovered in the area identifies a number of characteristics. The engraving repertoire is dominated by a small number of frequently depicted animals that were of symbolic or economic importance to the engravers. Rare and singular depicted species extend this record to a diverse species spectrum. Although a preferential depiction of herbivores is evident in the data, there is a close match between faunal record and engravings which shows that all larger animals (over ca. 10 kg) that were present in the area were also depicted. The selection of animals in the rock art appears to reflect their visibility in the landscape while also providing a record of changing climatic conditions from savanna to desert habitats.

The emission module processes external flux data sets and increments the tracer volume mixing ratios in the boundary layer accordingly. The performance of the emission module is illustrated with simulations of acetone, using a simplified chemical depletion mechanism based on a reaction with OH and photolysis only. In our model setup, we calculate a tropospheric acetone lifetime of 33 days, which is in good agreement with the literature. We compare our results with ground-based as well as with airborne IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UTLS) in terms of phase and amplitude of the annual cycle. In all our ICON-ART simulations the general seasonal variability is well represented but uncertainties remain concerning the magnitude of the acetone mixing ratio in the UTLS region. In addition, the module for online calculations of biogenic emissions (MEGAN2.1) is implemented in ICON-ART and can replace the offline biogenic emission data sets. In a sensitivity study we show how different parametrisations of the leaf area index (LAI) change the emission fluxes calculated by MEGAN2.1 and demonstrate the importance of an adequate treatment of the LAI within MEGAN2.1. We conclude that the emission module performs well with offline and online emission fluxes and allows the simulation of the annual cycles of emissions-dominated substances.","[Weimer, Michael; Kirner, Oliver] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Weimer, Michael; Schroeter, Jennifer; Eckstein, Johannes; Deetz, Konrad; Neumaier, Marco; Fischbeck, Garlich; Rieger, Daniel; Vogel, Heike; Vogel, Bernhard; Reddmann, Thomas; Ruhnke, Roland; Braesicke, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Hu, Lu] Univ Montana, Dept Chem & Biochem, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Millet, Dylan B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Weimer, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.;Weimer, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",michael.weimer@kit.edu,"Millet, Dylan B/G-5832-2012; Ruhnke, Roland/J-8800-2012; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Kirner, Oliver/K-8815-2015; Hu, Lu/O-9959-2017","Ruhnke, Roland/0000-0002-0353-1603; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Kirner, Oliver/0000-0001-5668-6177; Hu, Lu/0000-0002-4892-454X; Weimer, Michael/0000-0002-1004-4002","Ministry of Science, Research; Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)","Ministry of Science, Research; Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank Christoph A.

By 2030, when California's light-duty vehicle stock has been substantially replaced by regulation-compliant vehicles, total emissions from regulated vehicles are projected to be reduced by 27% relative to business-as-usual, but are nevertheless expected to be 8.7% higher than 2004 emissions. If an 8.7% increase truly represents the maximum feasible and cost-effective emissions reduction from transportation vehicles, then global climate stabilization clearly will not be attained within limits of feasibility and cost-effectiveness, and climate sustainability will only be achievable through severely draconian measures. On the other hand, if significantly greater emissions reduction would be feasible and cost-effective, then the AB 1493 regulations fail to satisfy the legislative policy mandate and the task is to find a regulatory mechanism that will. The thesis of this paper is that the regulations do not satisfy the mandate for several reasons, the most important being the conflicting policy objectives of the cost-constrained legislative mandate and the  quantity-con strained, standard-based regulatory instrument. Art alternative policy instrument that would better fit legislative policy and environmental objectives would be a feebate-type system (although not necessarily a conventional vehicle feebate).

However, state-of-the-art ocean biogeochemical models include many advected tracers, that significantly increase the computational resources required, forcing a trade-off with spatial resolution. Here, we compare a state-of-the art model with 30 prognostic tracers (TOPAZ) with two reduced-tracer models, one with 6 tracers (BLING), and the other with 3 tracers (miniBLING). The reduced-tracer models employ parameterized, implicit biological functions, which nonetheless capture many of the most important processes resolved by TOPAZ. All three are embedded in the same coupled climate model. Despite the large difference in tracer number, the absence of tracers for living organic matter is shown to have a minimal impact on the transport of nutrient elements, and the three models produce similar mean annual preindustrial distributions of macronutrients, oxygen, and carbon. Significant differences do exist among the models, in particular the seasonal cycle of biomass and export production, but it does not appear that these are necessary consequences of the reduced tracer number. With increasing CO2, changes in dissolved oxygen and anthropogenic carbon uptake are very similar across the different models. Thus, while the reduced-tracer models do not explicitly resolve the diversity and internal dynamics of marine ecosystems, we demonstrate that such models are applicable to a broad suite of major biogeochemical concerns, including anthropogenic change. These results are very promising for the further development and application of reduced-tracer biogeochemical models that incorporate sub-ecosystem-scale parameterizations.","[Galbraith, Eric D.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Galbraith, Eric D.; Bianchi, Daniele; Claret, Mariona] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dunne, John P.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Gnanadesikan, Anand; Marvasti, Seyedehsafoura Sedigh] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Slater, Richard D.; Sarmiento, Jorge L.; Dufour, Carolina O.; de Souza, Gregory F.; Rodgers, Keith B.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Marvasti, Seyedehsafoura Sedigh] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Marine Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Bianchi, Daniele] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA; McGill University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Johns Hopkins University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; Islamic Azad University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Galbraith, ED (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",eric.d.galbraith@gmail.com,"Claret, Mariona/AAB-7962-2021; Gnanadesikan, Anand/A-2397-2008; Rodgers, Keith/AAL-4329-2021; Dunne, John P/F-8086-2012; Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014","Claret, Mariona/0000-0002-0647-8617; Gnanadesikan, Anand/0000-0001-5784-1116; Dunne, John P/0000-0002-8794-0489; Dufour, Carolina/0000-0002-1441-3880; Bianchi, Daniele/0000-0002-6621-0858; Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232",National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX14AL40G]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0006848]; NSF's Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) Project [PLR-1425989]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom,National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF's Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) Project; ICREA(ICREA),"Computational resources were provided to E.D.G by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and Compute Canada.

Since climate-induced impacts such as changes in regional temperature and precipitation will influence crop yields, this study accommodates the estimated yield changes and subsequently develops a two stage stochastic programming with recourse model to investigate the economic and environmental effects of biofuel production. The results indicate that the utilization of sweet potato, along with its by-products, can result in the maximum amount of ethanol production. At higher levels of gasoline and greenhouse gas (GHG) prices, 441.2 million liters of ethanol can be produced, of which 70 million liters come from utilization of by-products. In general, economic factors such as gasoline and GHG prices have larger impacts on biofuel production than yield changes. However, although biofuel production is relative stable in the face of crop yield change, a shift in cultivars and land-use pattern is likely to occur. We show that the net emission reduction is relatively low compared to Taiwan's total emission and the aggregate value of emission reduction merits more investigation. These concerns, as well as resource reallocation and policy reformulation are also discussed in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This method uses the cool of the night to release the warmth stored in the thermal mass during the day. That is, this system optimizes the energy storage properties of thermal masses to provide thermal comfort in interior spaces. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the use of night purge ventilation in conjunction with PCMs on the indoor thermal conditions of a typical office building located in hot-arid climates. In this article, the impacts of optimal night ventilation on the heat flushing operation, inside room temperature and element thermal conditions are all evaluated. It was found that combining PCMs with night ventilation will significantly improve indoor thermal conditions; however, results vary for different days in general and different structural elements in particular. Moreover, the application of PCMs can reduce night ventilation system problem of occupants feeling cold in the morning, whereas in the majority of work hours the temperature of inside element faces is approximately 0.5 degrees C lower than the room temperature, both of which improve thermal comfort.

One of the major issues that the aviation industry is facing today is pollution around the airports, which has an effect both on human health and on the climate. Although noise emissions do not have a direct impact on climate, variations in departure and arrival procedures influence both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions. In addition, design choices made to curb noise might increase CO2 and vice versa. Thus, multidisciplinary modeling is required for the assessment of these interdependencies for new aircraft and flight procedures. A particular aspect that has received little attention is the quantification of the extent to which early design choices influence the trades of CO2, NOx, and noise. In this study, a single aisle thrust class turbofan engine is optimized for minimum installed SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption). The installed SFC metric includes the effect of engine nacelle drag and engine weight. Close to optimal cycles are then studied to establish how variation in engine cycle parameters trade with noise certification and LTO (Landing and Take-Off) emissions. It is demonstrated that around the optimum a relatively large variation in cycle parameters is allowed with only a modest effect on the installed SFC metric. This freedom in choosing cycle parameters allows the designer to trade noise and emissions. Around the optimal point of a state-of-the-art single aisle thrust class propulsion system, a 1.7 dB reduction in cumulative noise and a 12% reduction in EINOx could be accomplished with a 0.5% penalty in installed SFC.","[Thoma, Evangelia Maria; Gronstedt, Tomas; Zhao, Xin] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Fluid Dynam, Dept Mech & Maritime Sci, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Thoma, EM (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Fluid Dynam, Dept Mech & Maritime Sci, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",marily@chalmers.se; tomas.gronstedt@chalmers.se; xin.zhao@chalmers.se,"Zhao, Xin/AAM-8804-2021","Zhao, Xin/0000-0001-9250-1002",Swedish Transport Administration [TRV 2019/95826],Swedish Transport Administration,We acknowledge gratefully the Swedish Transport Administration (TRV 2019/95826) for the funding and support of this work.,,36,3,3,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2226-4310,,AEROSPACE-BASEL,Aerospace,OCT,2020,10,,,,,,148,10.3390/aerospace7100148,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/aerospace7100148,,,16,"Engineering, Aerospace",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,OJ7DM,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000584117100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The IRF is computed through the application of an observationally constrained instantaneous radiative forcing kernels (IRFK) to the difference between TES and model-predicted ozone. The IRFK represent the sensitivity of outgoing longwave radiation to the vertical and spatial distribution of ozone under all-sky condition. Through this technique, we find total tropospheric IRF biases from -0.4 to + 0.7 W/m(2) over large regions within the tropics and midlatitudes, due to ozone differences over the region in the lower and middle troposphere, enhanced by persistent bias in the upper troposphere-lower stratospheric region. The zonal mean biases also range from -30 to + 50 mW/m(2) for the models. However, the ensemble mean total tropospheric IRF bias is less than 0.2 W/m(2) within the entire troposphere.","[Aghedo, A.

The rapid growth of global climate changes along with the fear of energy supply shortage is creating a large consensus about the potential benefits of a hydrogen economy coming from renewable energy sources. The interesting perspectives are over-shadowed by uncertainties about the development of key technologies, such as renewable energy sources, advanced production processes, fuel cells, metal hydrides, nanostructures, standards and codes, and so on. The availability of critical technologies can create a base for the start of the hydrogen economy, as a fuel and energy carrier alternative, to the current fossil resources. This paper will explore the rationale for such a revolution in the energy sector, will describe the state-of-the-art of major related technologies (fuel cell, storage systems, fuel cell vehicles) and current niche applications, and will sketch scientific and technological challenges and recommendations for research and development (R&D) initiatives to accelerate the pace for the widespread introduction of a hydrogen economy.

We apply state-of-the-art interpretation techniques from the machine learning literature to attribute particular regions of interest or potential teleconnections relevant for any given weather cluster prediction or regime transition. We demonstrate superior forecasting performance relative to several classical meteorological benchmarks, as well as logistic regression and random forests. Due to its wider field of view, we also observe deCNN achieving considerably better performance than regular convolutional neural networks at lead times beyond 5-6 days.

However, the state of the art technologies are energy intensive in their production, like monocrystalline photovoltaic, or even consist of not recyclable composite material, in the case of wind turbine blades. Despite a lack in efficiency and stability, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have a high potential to supplement the state of the art green energy technology in future. With low production costs and no necessity for toxic compounds DSSCs are a potential product, which could circulate in the loops of a circular economy. Therefore, with this paper, we provide the status of research on DSSC recycling and an outlook on how recycling streams could be realized in the future for glass-based DSSCs without toxic components. The overview includes work on using recycled material to build DSSCs and extending the life of a DSSC, e.g., through rehydration. We also illustrate the state of sustainability research for DSSCs using the VOSviewer tool. To date, the term sustainability appears in 35 of 24,441 publications on DSSCs. In view of the global challenges, sustainability should be researched more seriously because it is as important as the efficiency and stability of DSSCs.","[Schoden, Fabian; Dotter, Marius; Knefelkamp, Doerthe; Schwenzfeier Hellkamp, Eva] Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany; [Dotter, Marius] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Phys, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Blachowicz, Tomasz] Silesian Tech Univ, Inst Phys, Ctr Sci & Educ, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences; University of Bielefeld; Silesian University of Technology,"Schoden, F (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany.",fabian.schoden@fh-bielefeld.de; marius.dotter@fh-bielefeld.de; doerthe.knefelkamp@fh-bielefeld.de; tomasz.blachowicz@polsl.pl; eva.schwenzfeier-hellkamp@fh-bielefeld.de,"Schoden, Fabian/AAN-7282-2020","Schoden, Fabian/0000-0002-2481-7141; Dotter, Marius/0000-0001-8398-1809; BLACHOWICZ, Tomasz/0000-0002-6569-124X",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); State of NRWin scope of the project CirQuality OWL; project NanoDSSC; University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld,European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission); State of NRWin scope of the project CirQuality OWL; project NanoDSSC; University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld,The project was partly funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as well as from the State of NRWin scope of the project CirQuality OWL and the project NanoDSSC (progress.nrw).

Here, we compare estimates of Mediterranean Sea heat and water budgets from a range of observational datasets and discuss the main differences between them. Taking into account the closure hypothesis at the Gibraltar Strait, we have built several observational estimates of water and heat budgets by combination of their different observational components. We provide then three estimates for water budget and one for heat budget that satisfy the closure hypothesis. We then use these observational estimates to assess the ability of an ensemble of ERA40-driven high resolution (25 km) Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the FP6-EU ENSEMBLES database, to simulate the various components, and net values, of the water and heat budgets. Most of the RCM Mediterranean basin means are within the range spanned by the observational estimates of the different budget components, though in some cases the RCMs have a tendency to overestimate the latent heat flux (or evaporation) with respect to observations. The RCMs do not show significant improvements of the total water budget estimates comparing to ERA40. Moreover, given the large spread found in observational estimates of precipitation over the sea, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the performance of RCM for the freshwater budget and this underlines the need for better precipitation observations. The original ERA40 value for the basin mean net heat flux is -15 W/m(2) which is 10 W/m(2) less than the value of -5 W/m(2) inferred from the transport measurements at Gibraltar Strait. The ensemble of heat budget values estimated from the models show that most of RCMs do not achieve heat budget closure. However, the ensemble mean value for the net heat flux is -7 +/- A 21 W/m(2), which is close to the Gibraltar value, although the spread between the RCMs is large. Since the RCMs are forced by the same boundary conditions (ERA40 and sea surface temperatures) and have the same horizontal resolution and spatial domain, the reason for the large spread must reside in the physical parameterizations. To conclude, improvements are urgently required to physical parameterizations in state-of-the-art regional climate models, to reduce the large spread found in our analysis and to obtain better water and heat budget estimates over the Mediterranean Sea.","[Sanchez-Gomez, E.] CERFACS CNRS, SUC URA1875, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Somot, S.; Dubois, C.; Deque, M.] Meteo France CNRS, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France; [Josey, S.

Confidence in global climate model (GCM) projections of temperature extremes and associated impacts therefore relies on the realism of simulated temperature distribution tail behavior under current climate conditions. This study evaluates the ability of the latest state-of-the-art ensemble of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six (CMIP6), to capture historical global surface temperature distribution tail shape in hemispheric winter and summer seasons. Comparisons with a global reanalysis product reveal strong agreement on coherent spatial patterns of longer- and shorter-than-Gaussian tails for both sides of the temperature distribution, suggesting that CMIP6 GCMs are broadly capturing tail behavior for plausible physical and dynamical reasons. On a global scale, most GCMs are reasonably skilled at capturing historical tail shape, exhibiting high pattern correlations with reanalysis and low values of normalized centered root mean square difference, with multi-model mean values generally outperforming individual GCMs in these metrics. A division of the domain into sub-regions containing robust shift ratio patterns indicates higher performance over Australia and an overestimation of the degree to which tails deviate from Gaussian over southeastern Asia in all cases, whereas model skill over other regions varies depending on season and tail of the temperature distribution. For example, model performance during boreal winter indicates robust agreement (>85% models) with reanalysis for shorter-than-Gaussian warm tails over the Northern Hemisphere, whereas cold-tail shape is generally mischaracterized by GCMs over western Russia. Although there is spatial and model variability, overall, results highlight the capability of the CMIP6 ensemble in capturing seasonal temperature distribution deviations from Gaussianity, boosting confidence in model utility and providing insight into the complexity of future changes in temperature extremes.","[Catalano, A.

Some of the key factors that affect the risks to urban areas include climate change, the densification of assets within cities and the general expansion of urban areas. In this paper, we examine and compare quantitatively the impact of climate change and recent urban development patterns on the exposure of four European cities to pluvial flooding. In particular, we investigate the degree to which pluvial floods of varying severity and in different geographical locations are influenced to the same extent by changes in urban land cover and climate change. We have selected the European cities of Odense, Vienna, Strasbourg and Nice for analyses to represent different climatic conditions, trends in urban development and topographical characteristics. We develop and apply a combined remote-sensing and flood-modelling approach to simulate the extent of pluvial flooding for a range of extreme precipitation events for historical (1984) and present-day (2014) urban land cover and for two climate-change scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Changes in urban land cover are estimated using Landsat satellite imagery for the period 1984-2014. We combine the remote-sensing analyses with regionally downscaled estimates of precipitation extremes of current and expected future climate to enable 2-D overland flow simulations and flood-hazard assessments. The individual and combined impacts of urban development and climate change are quantified by examining the variations in flooding between the different simulations along with the corresponding un certainties. In addition, two different assumptions are examined with regards to the development of the capacity of the urban drainage system in response to urban development and climate change. In the stationary approach, the capacity resembles present-day design, while it is updated in the evolutionary approach to correspond to changes in imperviousness and precipitation intensities due to urban development and climate change respectively. For all four cities, we find an increase in flood exposure corresponding to an observed absolute growth in impervious surfaces of 7-12% during the past 30 years of urban development. Similarly, we find that climate change increases exposure to pluvial flooding under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The relative importance of urban development and climate change on flood exposure varies considerably between the cities. For Odense, the impact of urban development is comparable to that of climate change under an RCP 8.5 scenario (2081-2100), while for Vienna and Strasbourg it is comparable to the impacts of an RCP 4.5 scenario. For Nice, climate change dominates urban development as the primary driver of changes in exposure to flooding. The variation between geographical locations is caused by differences in soil infiltration properties, historical trends in urban development and the projected regional impacts of climate change on extreme precipitation. Developing the capacity of the urban drainage system in relation to urban development is found to be an effective adaptation measure as it fully compensates for the increase in runoff caused by additional sealed surfaces. On the other hand, updating the drainage system according to changes in precipitation intensities caused by climate change only marginally reduces flooding for the most extreme events.","[Kaspersen, Per Skougaard; Drews, Martin] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Ravn, Nanna Hoegh] LNH Water, DK-3080 Tikoeb, Denmark; [Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Madsen, Henrik] DHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Technical University of Denmark,"Kaspersen, PS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",pskk@dtu.dk,"Kaspersen, Per Skougaard/T-1677-2017; Drews, Martin/E-8081-2017; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Kaspersen, Per Skougaard/0000-0002-1709-0183; Drews, Martin/0000-0002-3532-4780; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; Madsen, Henrik/0000-0001-8934-0834",,,,,53,77,78,11,95,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

However, the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on fluvial floods in such regions have not been taken into account in current global assessments of future flood risk, due to the difficulties in modeling channel bifurcation and the backwater effect. We used a state-of-the-art global river routing model to demonstrate how these complexities contribute to future flood hazard associated with changing climate and SLR in the world's largest mega-delta region, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta. The model demonstrated that flood water in the main channels flows into tributaries through bifurcation channels, which resulted in an increase in inundation depth in deltaic regions. We found that there were large areas that experienced an increase in inundation depth and period not directly from the SLR itself but from the backwater effect of SLR, and the effect propagated upstream to locations far from the river mouth. Projections under future climate scenarios as well as SLR indicated that exposure to fluvial floods will increase in the last part of the 21st century, and both SLR and channel bifurcation make meaningful contributions.","[Ikeuchi, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Yukiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Ikeuchi, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Yukiko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamazaki, Dai] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Integrated Climate Change Project Res, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Kiguchi, Masashi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Koirala, Sujan] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, D-07745 Jena, Thuringen, Germany; [Nagano, Takanori] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Kotera, Akihiko] Natl Inst Humanities, Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038047, Japan; [Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo; Max Planck Society; Kobe University; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN); Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Ikeuchi, H (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",ikeaki@hydra.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ikeuchi, Hiroaki/P-9002-2016; Kotera, Akihiko/AAE-1957-2020; Nagano, Takanori/L-6659-2019; Hirabayashi, Yukiko/E-5628-2010; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Kiguchi, Masashi/AAS-2465-2020; Kiguchi, Masashi/GQP-0111-2022; Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012","Ikeuchi, Hiroaki/0000-0002-4824-0594; Kotera, Akihiko/0000-0002-3474-8784; Hirabayashi, Yukiko/0000-0001-5693-197X; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Kiguchi, Masashi/0000-0002-8952-6855; Yamazaki, Dai/0000-0002-6478-1841","Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund [S-10, S-14]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Program for Risk Information on Climate Change by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15H04047]","Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund; Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Program for Risk Information on Climate Change by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This paper was partly supported by the Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund (S-10 and S-14) by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (ID: 15H04047) by Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS).

Our study screened peer-reviewed articles, published within the last decade, on recent climate variability in Spain, with a particular focus on a range of the essential atmospheric variables. The review focusses on the recent evolution of precipitation and air temperature, but also on other meteorological variables such as solar radiation, wind speed, surface humidity and evapotranspiration. While this review highlights results on changes in the mean state of climate in Spain, it also gives equal attention to findings on extreme weather events like rainstorms, heat waves and droughts. A detailed review of studies focusing on recent changes in the surface climate of Spain revealed some key findings. Studies demonstrate an overall increase of solar radiation since the 1980s. A similar behaviour was observed for surface air temperature since the 1960s, on the order of +0.3 degrees C decade(-1), with rapid warming rates during summer. Different seasonal trend patterns of wind speed were noted over Spain, with declines in winter-spring and increases in summer-autumn. A remarkable decrease (-5%) in relative humidity was observed from 1961 to 2011. For precipitation, studies suggested a strong variability over both space and time, with a moderate decrease of the annual total precipitation. In accordance with changes in the mean conditions of climate, studies of extreme weather events stressed a notable warming in warm extremes, while changes in cold extremes were generally insignificant.","[Vicente-Serrano, S.

We hypothesize that a major influence on C-3/C-4 distribution may be the seasonal timing of water availability with respect to the different C-3 and C-4 growing seasons. An algorithm expressing this hypothesis (the SAW hypothesis for Seasonal Availability of Water), estimates C-3 versus C-4 grass biomass from climate data. Sensitivity analysis indicated that temperatures used to delineate the start and end of the C-3 and C-4 grass growing seasons were more important than photosynthetic responses to temperature. To evaluate the SAW hypothesis, this algorithm was applied globally on a 1degrees x 1degrees latitude-longitude grid. When compared with vegetation survey data at 141 locations in North America, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa, SAW algorithm predictions yielded art R-2 of 0.71. Error resulted primarily from comparing large grid cells to plot data, interannual variability of climate, and from gridding measured climate to data-sparse locations with a single lapse rate of air temperature with elevation. Application of the SAW algorithm to a climate change scenario suggested that changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could offset C-3 photosynthetic advantages offered by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These results underscored the importance of accurately representing the timing and spatial distribution as well as the magnitude of temperature and precipitation in scenarios of future climate.

A common vertical discretization scheme for the soil moisture and for the soil temperature is adopted. In addition to the heat conduction process, the heat transported by liquid water into the soil is modeled. The thermal conductivity and the heat capacity are parameterized as a function of the soil moisture and the texture. Preliminary tests are performed in an idealized 1-D (one-dimensional) framework and the full model is then evaluated in the coupled land-atmospheric module of the IPSL ESM. A nudging approach is used in order to avoid the time-consuming long-term simulations required to account for the natural variability of the climate. Thanks to this nudging approach, the effects of the modified parameterizations can be modeled. The dependence of the soil thermal properties on moisture and texture lead to the most significant changes in the surface energy budget and in the surface temperature, with the strongest effects on the surface energy budget taking place over dry areas and during the night. This has important consequences on the mean surface temperature over dry areas and during the night and on its short-term variability. The parameterization of the soil thermal properties could therefore explain some of the temperature biases and part of the dispersion over dry areas in simulations of extreme events such as heat waves in state-of-the-art climate models.","[Wang, F.; Cheruy, F.; Dufresne, J. -L.] CNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Tour 45-55,3eme Etage,Case Postale 99,4 Pl Jussi, F-75252 Paris 05, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Wang, F (corresponding author), CNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Tour 45-55,3eme Etage,Case Postale 99,4 Pl Jussi, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",fuxing.wang@lmd.jussieu.fr,"Dufresne, Jean-Louis/I-5616-2015; WANG, Fuxing/E-7245-2016","Dufresne, Jean-Louis/0000-0003-4764-9600; WANG, Fuxing/0000-0001-7582-2752; cheruy, frederique/0000-0003-2833-7273",European Union [282672],European Union(European Commission),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support provided by the EMBRACE project (grant no. 282672) within the Framework Program 7 (FP7) of the European Union.

Recent posthuman scholarship emphasizes these qualities but, surprisingly, no sustained analysis has been undertaken of this interrelation. Here we do so by theorizing water as a time-substance to reposition human hydrological struggles (including those exacerbated by climate change) around the topologies and temporalities rather than the spatialities of water. This innovative approach opens up new areas of geographical enquiry based on hydrosocial forms, hydrosocial transformations, and hydrosocial information (collectively referred to here as hydrosocialities). We contend that hydrosocialities enable the tracing of human-water relations that transcend times and scales and the matricial categories of subject and object to overcome the situated-agential binary of water. Drawing on two years of fieldwork in Mustang, Nepal, this conceptual framework is deployed to examine hydrosocialities in two remote mountain communities. We show hydrosocialities that comprise diverse water knowledge practices constituted from multiple points of proximity between the social and the hydrological in space and time. In turn, this conceptual framework underscores the importance of boundary objects in mediating water's situated-agential qualities. The article concludes that consequently boundary objects can play a crucial role in producing new practical hydrosocial politics of climate change mitigation and adaptation.","[Clark, Julian; Mao, Feng] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Gurung, Praju; Regmi, Santosh; Bhusal, Jagat K.] Soc Hydrologists & Meteorologists, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Chapagain, Prem Sagar] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geog, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Karpouzoglou, Timothy; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Birmingham; Tribhuvan University; Wageningen University & Research,"Clark, J (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",j.r.a.clark@bham.ac.uk; ps.chapagain@gmail.com; sregmi11@yahoo.com; bhusaljagat@yahoo.com; timothy.karpouzoglou@wur.nl; art.dewulf@wur.nl,"Mao, Feng/B-8280-2019; Chapagain, Prem Sagar/AAI-5748-2020; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Karpouzoglou, Timos/P-6216-2015; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010","Chapagain, Prem Sagar/0000-0001-7316-8769; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Karpouzoglou, Timos/0000-0001-9568-9813; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Mao, Feng/0000-0002-5889-1825",UK Research Council ESRC/NERC/DFID ESPA program [NE-K010239-1]; NERC [NE/K010123/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K010123/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Research Council ESRC/NERC/DFID ESPA program; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors acknowledge funding received from the UK Research Council ESRC/NERC/DFID ESPA program under Project NE-K010239-1, Adaptive Governance of Mountain Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation Enabled by Environmental Virtual Observatories, Mountain-EVO.",,63,15,15,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

Little is however known on whether and how global warming may affect the atmosphere's predictability and thus our ability to produce accurate weather forecasts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art climate and a state-of-the-art ensemble weather prediction model to show that, in a business-as-usual 21st century setting, global warming could significantly change the predictability of the atmosphere, defined here via the expected error of weather predictions. Predictability of synoptic weather situations could significantly increase, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. This can be explained by a decrease in the meridional temperature gradient. Contrarily, summertime predictability of weekly rainfall sums might significantly decrease in most regions. Plain Language Summary Due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, it is impossible to make weather forecasts that are completely accurate. Therefore, all weather forecasts are inherently uncertain to a certain degree. However, this uncertainty-and thus the difficulty of making good forecastsis not the same for all forecasts. This opens up the highly important question whether global warming will affect the difficulty of weather forecasts. Due to the enormous socioeconomic importance of accurate weather forecasts, it is essential to know whether climate change adaption policies also need to take into account potential changes in the difficulty and accuracy of weather forecasts. We show that in a warmer world, it will be easier to predict fields such as temperature and pressure. Contrarily, it will be harder to make accurate precipitation forecasts, which might strongly affect both disaster prevention and rainfall-dependent industries such as the energy sector, all of which heavily rely on accurate precipitation forecasts. Additionally, we show that the uncertainty of predictions of pressure fields is to a large extent controlled by fluctuations in the temperature difference between the North Pole and the equator. This is a new and important insight into the fundamentals of weather forecast uncertainty.","[Scher, S.; Messori, G.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Scher, S.; Messori, G.] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Messori, G.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Uppsala University,"Scher, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden.;Scher, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",sebastian.scher@misu.su.se,,,Department of Meteorology of Stockholm University; Vetenskapsra det grant [2016-03724],Department of Meteorology of Stockholm University; Vetenskapsra det grant,"We thank Erland Kallen, Rodrigo Caballero, and HeiniWernli for their input in discussing the results of this study, and Glenn Carver from the openIFS support for his help in running the openIFS model.

This article is a literature review on the state of the art of methane / natural gas pyrolysis process developments.","[Schneider, Stefan; Bajohr, Siegfried; Graf, Frank; Kolb, Thomas] Karlsruher Inst Technol KIT, Teilinst Chem Energietrager Brennstofftechnol, Engler Bunte Inst EBI, Engler Bunte Ring 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Graf, Frank; Kolb, Thomas] Karlsruher Inst Technol KIT, Engler Bunte Inst, DVGW Forsch Stelle, Engler Bunte Ring 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Schneider, S (corresponding author), Karlsruher Inst Technol KIT, Teilinst Chem Energietrager Brennstofftechnol, Engler Bunte Inst EBI, Engler Bunte Ring 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",stefan.schneider@kit.edu,,"Kolb, Thomas/0000-0003-3475-0216",,,,,56,8,8,11,31,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0009-286X,1522-2640,,CHEM-ING-TECH,Chem.

Here, the atmosphere and ocean conditions that drive this continuum of drought variability in southwestern North America (SWNA) are studied using the latest observationally based products, paleoclimate reconstructions, and state-of-the-art Earth system model simulations of the last millennium. A novel application of the self-organizing maps (SOM) methodology allows for a visualization of the continuum of climate states coinciding with thousands of droughts of varying lengths in last millennium simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS E2-R), and eight other members from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). It is found that most droughts are associated with a cool Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) pattern, but persistent droughts can coincide with a variety of ocean-atmosphere states, including time periods showing a warm PDO or weak ocean-atmosphere anomalies. Many CMIP5 models simulate similar SWNA teleconnection patterns, but the SOM analysis demonstrates that models simulate different continuums of ocean-atmosphere states coinciding with droughts of different lengths, suggesting fundamental differences in their drought dynamics. These findings have important implications for our understanding and simulation of the drivers of persistent drought, and for their potential predictability.","[Parsons, Luke A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Coats, Sloan] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Overpeck, Jonathan T.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Parsons, Luke A.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Arizona; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Parsons, LA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Parsons, LA (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lakp@uw.edu,,,National Science Foundation EaSM2 Grant [AGS1243125],National Science Foundation EaSM2 Grant,"The National Science Foundation EaSM2 Grant (AGS1243125) supported this work.

In this paper we show the necessity to complement the dominant technical approaches with research that take a wider interest in specific contexts, social practices, and negotiated decisions. The objective of the paper is to illustrate how the interactions between perceptions and experiences of different professional groups are pivotal for the management of the indoor climate. An ethnographic study of decision making in an historic house museum was carried out in 2009 and 2012. Interviews were made with individuals who either took part in management or were affected by the indoor climate. The findings show how discussions among social actors and the way their respective priorities are negotiated are essential features of the management of the indoor climate and have a strong impact on the ability to modify it. It turns out that a hegemonic discourse about preservation as the dominant rationale for indoor climate control in tandem with acceptable conditions with respect to preservation have reinforced a state of stability. This explorative study opens up for a re-framing of how a more sustainable management of historic buildings can be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To more realistically represent street-level heat stress, we propose a new urban climate -human coupling system by integrating an advanced urban canopy model (UCM) with a new human -environment adaptive thermal stress (HEATS) module. The coupled UCM-HEATS system features a state-of-the-art solution to complicated human-street radiative exchanges and incorporates dynamic human thermo-regulatory responses to microclimatic changes. The UCM-HEATS system was evaluated in a typical hot and humid city, Hong Kong, and then applied to investigate street-level thermal stress in various urban settings and under different personal conditions. By explicitly resolving shading effects of buildings and trees on human radiation budgets, our study emphasizes the marked effectiveness of active shade management using green and gray infrastructure on daytime heat mitigation, proposing a right shade, right place, right time paradigm for regulating important street canyon geometries (building height, road width, and tree crown width) and orien-tations. Additionally, human evaporative heat dissipation can be hindered by urban moisture islands and wind impediments; thus, a detailed urban ventilation strategy is suggested considering different temperature-humidity combinations. For personal heat protection, we identified an evident cooling effect of high-albedo clothing and a thermal-comfort-optimal walking speed. Special attention is paid to heat-vulnerable groups, especially older people who suffer from notably higher heat risks during pandemics with facemask-induced heat burden. Bridging urban climate and human ergonomics, this study aims to advance human-centric urban design toward future smart, resilient, and inclusive cities.","[Huang, Xinjie; Song, Jiyun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Song, Jiyun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenghao] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA USA; [Chan, Pak Wai] Hong Kong Observ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Song, Jiyun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech Engn, Haking Wong Bldg 7-F, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; Stanford University; University of Hong Kong,"Song, JY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech Engn, Haking Wong Bldg 7-F, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jsong90@hku.hk,"Wang, Chenghao/O-7961-2017; Chan, Pak Wai/C-8447-2011","Wang, Chenghao/0000-0001-8846-4130; Chan, Pak Wai/0000-0003-2289-0609; Song, Jiyun/0000-0002-9483-0501",Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) General Research Fund; Hong Kong RGC Early Career Scheme Fund;  [17208021];  [27208220],Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) General Research Fund; Hong Kong RGC Early Career Scheme Fund; ; ,This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) General Research Fund (Project number: 17208021) and Hong Kong RGC Early Career Scheme Fund (Project number: 27208220) .,,77,0,0,15,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

In the absence of population monitoring, we investigated the temporal development and geospatial pattern of the habitat of Harting's vole (Microtus hartingi) in southeast Europe (SEE) by relying on data regarding its presence, the most recent freely available geospatial datasets and state-of-the-art presence-only Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques. Results indicate that (1) the potential habitat of Harting's vole was perhaps stable over the last 6000 years - modelling predictions are in conjunction with scarce fossil evidence, which points to repeated colonisations from Asia Minor punctuated by extinctions in SEE; (2) fragmentation of the potential habitat in SEE, which may have already begun in the Last Glacial Maximum, and will most likely continue in the near future; and (3) Harting's vole could disappear by the end of the century if more pessimistic climate change scenarios become reality. While climate change is suppressing the population dynamics of the keystone grass-eating voles from temperate and boreal ecosystems, it is about to annihilate their Mediterranean counterpart. This will result in a far more severe impact on community restructuring in the Mediterranean ecosystems than elsewhere. Long-term population monitoring is desperately needed in SEE to hone the ability to more accurately predict the impacts of climate change.","[Krystufek, Boris] Slovenian Museum Nat Hist, Presernova 20, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Zorenko, Tanya] Univ Latvia, Krovald Bulv 4, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia; [Bontzorlos, Vasileios] Inst Bioecon & Agri Technol iBO, Ctr Res & Technol Hellas CERTH, Dimarhou Georgiadi Nikolaou 118, Volos 38333, Greece; [Mahmoudi, Ahmad] Pasteur Inst Iran, Res Ctr Emerging & Reemerging Infect Dis, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tehran, Iran; [Atanasov, Nasko] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Res, Tsar Osvboditel Blvd 1, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria; [Ivajnsic, Danijel] Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Koroska 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Latvia; Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; Le Reseau International des Instituts Pasteur (RIIP); Pasteur Institute of Iran; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; University of Maribor,"Ivajnsic, D (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Koroska 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",dani.ivajnsic@um.si,"Atanasov, Nasko/N-1835-2019; Mahmoudi, Ahmad/AAM-1736-2021; Zorenko, Tanya/W-2091-2019","Mahmoudi, Ahmad/0000-0003-4698-137X",Slovenian Research Agency [P1-0255],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),We would like to thank Karolyn Close for editing for grammar and style.

State-of-the-art building energy simulations require information on the urban microclimate, but typically rely on ad-hoc numerical simulations, expensive in-situ measurements, or data from nearby weather stations. As such, they do not account for the full range of possible urban microclimate variability and findings cannot be generalized across urban morphologies. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes two data-driven models to downscale climate variables from the meso to the micro scale in arbitrary urban morphologies, with a focus on extreme climate conditions. The models are based on a feedforward and a deep neural network (NN) architecture, and are trained using results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow over a series of idealized but representative urban environments, spanning a realistic range of urban morphologies. Both models feature a relatively good agreement with corresponding CFD training data, with a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.91 (R-2 = 0.89) and R-2 = 0.94 (R-2 = 0.92) for spatially-distributed wind magnitude and air temperature for the deep NN (feedforward NN). The models generalize well for unseen urban morphologies and mesoscale input data that are within the training bounds in the parameter space, with a R-2 = 0.74 (R-2 = 0.69) and R-2 = 0.81 (R-2 = 0.74) for wind magnitude and air temperature for the deep NN (feedforward NN). The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed CFD-NN models makes them well suited for the design of climate-resilient buildings at the early design stage.","[Javanroodi, Kavan; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Lund, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Giometto, Marco G.] Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, New York, NY 10027 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Lund University; Chalmers University of Technology; Columbia University,"Javanroodi, K (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.",kavan.javanroodi@epfl.ch; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se; mg3929@columbia.edu; jean-louis.scartezzini@epfl.ch,"Giometto, Marco/GPF-9246-2022",,"joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970]; SAFE project, BRIDGE programme by the Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse) [187149]","joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; SAFE project, BRIDGE programme by the Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse)","This research work was supported by the joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970], and the SAFE project as part of the BRIDGE programme by the Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse) [187149].",,111,1,1,18,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

In observations, more (fewer) GuamTCs occur in El Nino (LaNina) years, and the ENSO-GuamTC connections arise from TC genesis locations in ENSO phases. The observed ENSO-GuamTC connections are realistically simulated in the two control experiments that use two versions of FLOR: the standard version and another with flux adjustments (FLOR-FA). The ENSO-GuamTC connections in FLOR-FA are closer to observations than those in FLOR because of a better representation of TC genesis during ENSO phases. The physical mechanisms underlying the observed ENSO-GuamTC connections are further supported in the long-term control experiments with FLOR and FLOR-FA. The ENSO-GuamTC connections in sea surface temperature (SST)-and sea surface salinity (SSS)-restoring experiments with FLOR 1990 strongly resemble the observations, suggesting the ENSO-GuamTC connections arise substantially from the forcing of SST. The prediction skill of FLOR-FA forGuamTC frequency is quite promising in terms of correlation and root-mean-square error and is higher than that of FLOR for the period 1980-2014. This study shows the capability of global climate models (FLOR and FLOR-FA) in simulating the linkage between ENSO and TC activity near a highly localized region (i.e., Guam) and in predicting the frequency of TCs at the subbasin scale.","[Zhang, Wei; Vecchi, Gabriel A.; Murakami, Hiroyuki; Delworth, Thomas; Jia, Liwei; Gudgel, Richard; Zeng, Fanrong] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, 201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Zhang, Wei; Vecchi, Gabriel A.; Murakami, Hiroyuki; Delworth, Thomas; Jia, Liwei] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Zhang, Wei; Villarini, Gabriele] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; [Zhang, Wei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; University of Iowa; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Zhang, W (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, 201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",wei.zhang@noaa.gov,"Delworth, Thomas L/C-5191-2014; Villarini, Gabriele/F-8069-2016; Jia, li/GPW-8015-2022; Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; li, jia/GVT-7587-2022; Murakami, Hiroyuki/L-5745-2015; Zhang, Wei/L-5743-2015; Zhang, Wei/J-3155-2019","Delworth, Thomas L/0000-0003-4865-5391; Villarini, Gabriele/0000-0001-9566-2370; Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Murakami, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1816-3452; Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-8134-6908; Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-8134-6908","National Science Foundation [AGS-1262091, AGS-1262099]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

However, the projections of different models vary, resulting in high uncertainty. Much of the inter-model spread is driven by responses to surface heat perturbations. This study mainly focuses on the response of the ocean to a surface heat flux perturbation F, as prescribed by the Flux-Anomaly-Forced Model Intercomparison Project (FAFMIP). The results of ocean model were compared with those of a CGCM with the same ocean component. On the global scale, the changes in global mean temperature, ocean heat content (OHC), and steric sea level (SSL) simulated in the OGCM are generally consistent with CGCM simulations. Differences in changes in ocean temperature, OHC, and SSL between the two models primarily occur in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans (AA) and the Southern Ocean (SO) basins. In addition to the differences in surface heat flux anomalies between the two models, differences in heat exchange between basins also play an important role in the inconsistencies in ocean climate changes in the AA and SO basins. These discrepancies are largely due to both the larger initial value and the greater weakening change of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in CGCM. The greater weakening of the AMOC in the CGCM is associated with the atmosphere-ocean feedback and the lack of a restoring salinity boundary condition. Furthermore, differences in surface salinity boundary conditions between the two models contribute to discrepancies in SSL changes.","[Jin, Jiangbo; Dong, Xiao; He, Juanxiong; Zeng, Qingcun; Zhang, He; Gao, Xin; Zhou, Guangqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci ICCES, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jiangbo; Yu, Yi] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hailong; Wang, Yaqi] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hailong; Wang, Yaqi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Minghua] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook","Liu, HL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Liu, HL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",lhl@lasg.iap.ac.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19020202, XDB42000000]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDBS-LY-DQC010]; State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography [QNHX2017]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706028]","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The constructive suggestions and comments from the two anonymous reviewers and Editor are highly appreciated.

To further understand the effects of BCs on the regional climate, the warming effects of BCs from residential, industrial, power and transportation emissions are investigated in Asian regions during summer using the state-of-the-art regional climate model RegCM4. BC emissions from these four sectors have very different rates and variations. Residential and industrial BCs account for approximately 85% of total BC emissions, while power BCs account for only approximately 0.19% in Asian regions during summer. An investigation suggests that both the BC aerosol optical depth (AOD) and direct radiative forcing (DRF) are highly dependent on emissions, while the climate effects show substantial nonlinearity to emissions. The total BCs AOD and clear-sky top of the atmosphere DRF averaged over East Asia (100-130 degrees E, 20-50 degrees N) are 0.02 and +1.34 W/m(2), respectively, during summer. Each sector's BC emissions may result in a warming effect over the region, leading to an enhanced summer monsoon circulation and a subsequent local decrease (e.g., northeast China) or increase (e.g., south China) in rainfall in China and its surrounding regions. The near surface air temperature increased by 0.2 K, and the precipitation decreased by approximately 0.01 mm/day in east China due to the total BC emissions. The regional responses to the BC warming effects are highly nonlinear to the emissions, which may be linked to the influences of the perturbed atmospheric circulations and climate feedback. The nonuniformity of the spatial distribution of BC emissions may also have significant influences on climate responses, especially in south and east China. The results of this study could aid us in better understanding BC effects under different emission conditions and provide a scientific reference for developing a better BC reduction strategy over Asian regions.","[Zhuang, B.

This study provides varied assessments of errors associated with GRACE water storage estimates. Thirteen monthly GRACE gravity solutions from August 2002 to December 2004 are examined, along with synthesized GRACE gravity fields for the same period that incorporate simulated errors. The synthetic GRACE fields are calculated using numerical climate models and GRACE internal error estimates. We consider the influence of measurement noise, spatial leakage error, and atmospheric and ocean dealiasing (AOD) model error as the major contributors to the error budget. Leakage error arises from the limited range of GRACE spherical harmonics not corrupted by noise. AOD model error is due to imperfect correction for atmosphere and ocean mass redistribution applied during GRACE processing. Four methods of forming water storage estimates from GRACE spherical harmonics ( four different basin filters) are applied to both GRACE and synthetic data. Two basin filters use Gaussian smoothing, and the other two are dynamic basin filters which use knowledge of geographical locations where water storage variations are expected. Global maps of measurement noise, leakage error, and AOD model errors are estimated for each basin filter. Dynamic basin filters yield the smallest errors and highest signal-to-noise ratio. Within 12 selected basins, GRACE and synthetic data show similar amplitudes of water storage change. Using 53 river basins, covering most of Earth's land surface excluding Antarctica and Greenland, we document how error changes with basin size, latitude, and shape. Leakage error is most affected by basin size and latitude, and AOD model error is most dependent on basin latitude.","Univ Texas, Ctr Space Res, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Geol Sci, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Seo, KW (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, MS 183-501,4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",weon.seo@jpl.nasa.gov; kiweon@geo.utexas.edu; jfamigli@uci.edu; chen@csr.utexas.edu; matthew.rodell@nasa.gov,"Rodell, Matthew/E-4946-2012; Famiglietti, James S/G-7383-2017","Rodell, Matthew/0000-0003-0106-7437; Famiglietti, James S/0000-0002-6053-5379; Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441",,,,,17,84,94,4,20,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

The natural flows (floods, ephemeral flows) in arid hill regions result in potential hydrological fluctuations caused by climate change. However, the feasibility of eventual storage in remote hilly catchments would force a more sudden change. The current study was conducted in the lower part of the Khirthar National Range in the Sindh province of Pakistan, with the aim to explore spatial runoff storage sites for sustainable development to mitigate the impacts of climate change in arid areas. In total, 83 years of precipitation data were used to estimate water availability, along with satellite imagery for LULC pre- and post-monsoon conditions, delineation of watersheds, and identification of potential runoff storage locations and return periods, using Remote Sensing (RS)/Geographical Information System (GIS) 10.5.1, HEC-HMS 3.1, and Origin Pro 9.0 for statistical approaches. The model delineated two potential watersheds: Goth Sumar, covering an area of 61.0456 km(2), wherein ten cascading reservoirs were identified, and Goth Baro, covering an area of 14,236 km(2), wherein two cascading reservoirs were identified. Different storage capacities were determined for the cascade-type reservoirs. The maximum live volumetric potential storage of the reservoirs varies from 0.25 to 1.32 million cubic meters (MCM) in the villages of Baro and Sumar. The return periods have been estimated at 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 75 years, corresponding to 12.35, 16.47, 21.43, 21.72, 25.21, and 40.53 MCM for Goth Sumar, while Goth Baro's storage capacity has been estimated at 2.88, 3.84, 5.00, 5.06, 5.88, and 9.45 MCM, respectively. All results obtained were authenticated using accuracy assessment, validation, and sensitivity analysis. The proposed potential storage sites were recommended for a planning period of five years. The live storage capacity of the identified cascade reservoirs can be improved by raising the marginal banks and developing the spillways to control inlet and outlet flow in order to maintain internal pressure on the reservoir banks. The stored water can be used for climate-friendly agricultural activities to increase crop production and productivity. The proposed study area has extensive experience with flood irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting to sustain agriculture due to rainfall being the only water resource (WR) in the region. However, the study area has enormous potential for surface runoff WRs, especially during the rainy season (monsoon); the current 2022 monsoon is showing flooding. The modeling approaches of Remote Sensing, GIS, and HEC-HMS play an important role in delineating watershed areas, developing hydrographs, and simulating water availability for different return periods by minimizing cost and time.","[Soomro, Abdul Ghani] Pakistan Agr Res Council, Natl Sugar & Trop Hort Res Inst, Islamabad 45500, Pakistan; [Shah, Sabab Ali] Hanyang Univ ERICA, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Shah, Sabab Ali] Aror Univ Art Architecture Design & Heritage, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Sukkur 65200, Pakistan; [Memon, Anila Hameem] Pakistan Agr Res Council, Water & Agr Waste Management Inst, Islamabad 45500, Pakistan; [Alharabi, Raied Saad] King Saud Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Riyadh 11421, Saudi Arabia; [Panhwar, Sallahuddin] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Balochistan Campus, Quetta 87300, Pakistan; [Keerio, Hareef Ahmed] Quaid e Awan Univ Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Nawabshah 67459, Pakistan",National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan; Hanyang University; National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan; King Saud University,"Shah, SA (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ ERICA, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.;Shah, SA (corresponding author), Aror Univ Art Architecture Design & Heritage, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Sukkur 65200, Pakistan.;Keerio, HA (corresponding author), Quaid e Awan Univ Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Nawabshah 67459, Pakistan.",sayedsabab@hanyang.ac.kr; hareefkeerio@quest.edu.pk,,"Keerio, Hareef Ahmed/0000-0003-2541-3613; Shah, Sabab Ali/0000-0001-5721-7997; panhwar, sallahuddin/0000-0001-9938-6369","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [275 (RSP-2021/310)]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research was supported by Researcher Supporting Project number 275 (RSP-2021/310), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,38,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,20,,,,,,13538,10.3390/su142013538,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142013538,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5T4TE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000875860200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An important ingredient in measures of the potential for intense thunder storms is the convective available potential energy (CAPE). Climate models project increases in summertime mean CAPE in the tropics and subtropics in response to global warming, but the physical mechanisms responsible for such increases and the implications for future thunderstorm activity remain uncertain. Here, we show that high percentiles of the CAPE distribution (CAPE extremes) also increase robustly with warming across the tropics and subtropics in an ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models, implying strong increases in the frequency of occurrence of environments conducive to intense thunderstorms in future climate projections. The increase in CAPE extremes is consistent with a recently proposed theoretical model in which CAPE depends on the influence of convective entrainment on the tropospheric lapse rate, and we demonstrate the importance of this influence for simulated CAPE extremes using a climate model in which the convective entrainment rate is varied. We further show that the theoretical model is able to account for the climatological relation ship between CAPE and a measure of lower-tropospheric humidity in simulations and in observations. Our results provide a physical basis on which to understand projected future increases in intense thunderstorm potential, and they suggest that an important mechanism that contributes to such increases may be present in Earth's atmosphere.","[Singh, Martin S.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Kuang, Zhiming] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Maloney, Eric D.; Wolding, Brandon O.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hannah, Walter M.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA",Monash University; Harvard University; Colorado State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Singh, MS (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",martin.singh@monash.edu,"Maloney, Eric D/A-9327-2008; Wolding, Brandon/N-4467-2018","Maloney, Eric D/0000-0002-2660-2611; Singh, Martin/0000-0002-4584-0885; Wolding, Brandon/0000-0001-7516-7081","NSF Grant [AGS-1441916]; National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant [AGS-1552385]; US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Australian Government; NOAA Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections Grants [NA15OAR4310099, NA12OAR4310077]; NOAA Earth Systems Sciences Grant [NA13OAR4310163]","NSF Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR); NOAA Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections Grants; NOAA Earth Systems Sciences Grant","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

VolImpact was recently funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and started in spring 2019. The main goal of the research unit is to improve our understanding of how the climate system responds to volcanic eruptions. Such an ambitious program is well beyond the capabilities of a single research group, as it requires expertise from complementary disciplines including aerosol microphysical modelling, cloud physics, climate modelling, global observations of trace gas species, clouds and stratospheric aerosols. The research goals will be achieved by building on important recent advances in modelling and measurement capabilities. Examples of the advances in the observations include the now daily near-global observations of multi-spectral aerosol extinction from the limb-scatter instruments OSIRIS, SCIAMACHY and OMPS-LP. In addition, the recently launched SAGE III/ISS and upcoming satellite missions EarthCARE and ALTIUS will provide high resolution observations of aerosols and clouds. Recent improvements in modeling capabilities within the framework of the ICON model family now enable simulations at spatial resolutions f ne enough to investigate details of the evolution and dynamics of the volcanic eruptive plume using the large-eddy resolving version, up to volcanic impacts on larger-scale circulation systems in the general circulation model version. When combined with state-of-the-art aerosol and cloud microphysical models, these approaches offer the opportunity to link eruptions directly to their climate forcing. These advances will be exploited in VolImpact to study the effects of volcanic eruptions consistently over the full range of spatial and temporal scales involved, addressing the initial development of explosive eruption plumes (project VolPlume), the variation of stratospheric aerosol particle size and radiative forcing caused by volcanic eruptions (VolARC), the response of clouds (VolCloud), the effects of volcanic eruptions on atmospheric dynamics (VolDyn), as well as their climate impact (VolClim).","[von Savigny, Christian] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Phys, Felix Hausdorff Str 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Timmreck, Claudia; Giorgetta, Marco; Schmidt, Hauke] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Buehler, Stefan A.; Horvath, Akos] Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Burrows, John P.; Malinina, Elizaveta; Rozanov, Alexei] Univ Bremen, Inst Umweltphys, Bremen, Germany; [Hegerl, Gabriele] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hoshyaripour, Gholam Ali; Hoose, Corinna; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Quaas, Johannes] Univ Leipzig, Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany; [Thomason, Larry] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA; [Toohey, Matthew] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Phys & Phys Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg; University of Bremen; University of Edinburgh; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Leipzig University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; University of Saskatchewan,"von Savigny, C (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Phys, Felix Hausdorff Str 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",csavigny@physik.uni-greifswald.de,"Buehler, Stefan Alexander/A-4056-2009; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Toohey, Matthew/AAL-1896-2021; Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009; Horvath, Akos/A-2453-2008; Quaas, Johannes/I-2656-2013","Buehler, Stefan Alexander/0000-0001-6389-1160; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Toohey, Matthew/0000-0002-7070-405X; Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789; Horvath, Akos/0000-0002-5860-2368; Quaas, Johannes/0000-0001-7057-194X; Hegerl, Gabriele/0000-0002-4159-1295; Rozanov, Alexei/0000-0003-4525-3223; von Savigny, Christian/0000-0001-7926-3986",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR 2820],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are deeply indebted to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for funding the VolImpact research unit proposal (FOR 2820).

As a result, growing interest in the development of effective solutions for enhancement of the sustainable energy performance of buildings has been observed in recent years. Along this line, building envelopes that separate the indoor from the outdoor environments, and in particular building facades, play a substantial role for energy saving in buildings. Nevertheless, this study argues that there is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the available literature regarding the energy and thermal performance of building facades based on the various possible design and technical configurations, especially in hot and humid climates. Important decisions should be made by architects and engineers during the early design stages of buildings with viewpoints to the ultimate impacts of building physics on the overall energy performance and indoor comfort conditions of buildings. With such a research gap in existing literature, in these early stages many key facade attributes may be overlooked. Hence, this study attempts to develop a state-of-the-art analysis of the existing literature about the circumstances of optimizing the performance of building facades, particularly in hot and humid climates. Likewise, the study extracts practical lessons learned from AEC industry and demonstrates the current status of utilizing energy efficient building facades in recent construction developments in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) and Australia (Darwin). Finally, the study draws attention to the emerging innovative solutions for the design of building facades towards improving the energy efficiency of building sector and contributing to the sustainable development of cities.","[Halawa, Edward; Trombley, Jeremy; Baig, Mirza] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Ctr Renewable Energy, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Ghaffarianhoseini, Amirhosein] Ryerson Univ, Fac Engn & Architectural Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ghaffarianhoseini, Amirhosein; Hassan, Norhaslina; Yusoff, Safiah Yusmah] Univ Malaya, Dept Geog, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ghaffarianhoseini, Ali] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm Engn, Sch Engn Comp & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Ismail, Muhammad Azzam] Univ Malaya, Dept Architecture, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Charles Darwin University; Toronto Metropolitan University; Universiti Malaya; Auckland University of Technology; Universiti Malaya,"Ghaffarianhoseini, A (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Fac Engn & Architectural Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",amirhosein.ghaffaria@ryerson.ca,"Ismail, Muhammad Azzam/F-8286-2011; Hassan, Norhaslina/B-9362-2010","Ismail, Muhammad Azzam/0000-0002-5341-7374; Hassan, Norhaslina/0000-0003-0867-1581; GhaffarianHoseini, Ali/0000-0002-0787-8399",IRU-MRUN programme [RU025-2015],IRU-MRUN programme,The authors would like to acknowledge the support from IRU-MRUN programme (Research University Grant RU025-2015) based on the collaboration between University of Malaya in Malaysia and Charles Darwin University in Australia.,,195,41,41,3,71,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

It provides the opportunity to formalize discussions and to store their content in a synthetic format, as well as to collect experiences and evaluate the impacts they had at their respective scales of implementation and on different parameters. The major aim of the ESPREssO-ADB tool, and its main innovation, is to deal with multi-hazard and multi-challenge actions, in an international context and notably in a cross-border initiative. The ESPREssO project aimed at contributing to a new strategic vision on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) in Europe. To do so, stakeholders working with CCA and/or DRR in Europe were consulted to identify measures boosting adaptation or societies' resilience. Each idea, measure or comment was stored and ranked in the ADB using qualitative criteria based on the Sendai Priorities and the SHIELD model proposed by the ESPREssO Team. Each action was assessed through multi-criteria analysis and effectiveness was approached under two different angles. The first one in line with the priorities of the Sendai Framework; and the second one with the SHIELD model. This model incorporate recommendations on how to optimize risk management capabilities through DRR. Positive actions had fed the Vision Paper and Guidelines produced by the project.

With the increasing number and capacity of biogas plants also, adequate treatment technologies for whole digestate - the residue from anaerobic digestion - are gaining attention. In this study the state of the art of digestate processing is analysed, and currently used treatment schemes and the various technological processes involved are evaluated. The study combines data and experiences from existing large-scale digestate processing facilities in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, as well as know-how from technology providers and relevant research projects. However, the field of digestate processing is still quite new and little detailed information about the performance of different technologies at industrial scale is available. Digestate processing is gaining importance since digestate utilisation can become an important bottleneck when increasing biogas production. In addition, the production of renewable fertiliser from digestate is increasingly of interest to replace fossil fertilisers. This study is the first profound attempt to establish an assessment of the state-of-the-art technologies in use.","[Fuchs, W.; Drosg, B.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Environm Biotechnol, Dept Agrobiotechnol IFA Tulln, A-3430 Vienna, Tulln, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Drosg, B (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Environm Biotechnol, Dept Agrobiotechnol IFA Tulln, Konrad Lorenz Str 20, A-3430 Vienna, Tulln, Austria.",bernhard.drosg@boku.ac.at,,,Climate and Energy Fund of the Austrian Federal Government,Climate and Energy Fund of the Austrian Federal Government,"This study was supported by the Climate and Energy Fund of the Austrian Federal Government.

However, the model is far from being a realistic representation of something. How can it be of any help here? In philosophy of science, it is often argued that models can provide explanations of the phenomenon they are said to approximate, in virtue of the truth they contain, and in spite of the idealisations they are made of. On this view, idealisations are not supposed to contribute to any explaining, and should not affect the global representational function of the model. But the Kac ring is a toy model that is only made of idealisations, and is still used trustworthily to understand the treatment of irreversible phenomena in statistical mechanics. In the paper, my aim is to argue that each idealisation ingeniously designed by the mathematician maintains the representational function of the Kac ring with the general properties of macroscopic irreversibility under scrutiny. Such an active role of idealisations in the representing has so far been overlooked and reflects the art of modelling.","[Jebeile, Julie] Univ Bern, Inst Philosophy, Bern, Switzerland; [Jebeile, Julie] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern,"Jebeile, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Philosophy, Bern, Switzerland.;Jebeile, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",julie.jebeile@gmail.com,,"Jebeile, Julie/0000-0002-7164-5848",University of Bern; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P1_170460],University of Bern; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),Open access funding provided by University of Bern.

HydroTrend generates daily discharge values through: snow accumulation and melt, glacier growth and ablation, surface runoff, and groundwater evaporation, retention and recharge. The long-term sediment load is predicted either by the ART-QRT module based on drainage area, discharge, relief, and temperature, or the BQART module that also incorporates basin-average lithology and anthropogenic influences on soil erosion. Sediment trapping efficiency of reservoirs is based on reservoir location in the river network and its volume that determines the residence time of water within the reservoir. Glacial influence is based on the extent of ice cover, equilibrium altitude, and freezing line mobility. HydroTrend v.3.0 captures the inter- and intra-annual variability of sediment flux by using either high-resolution climate observations or a stochastic climate generator for simulations over longer geological intervals. A distributary channel module simulates the flow conditions and transport capacity across a multiple deltaic channel system. Simulations of the Metauro and the Po rivers, in Italy, are used as case studies to demonstrate the applicability of the new model.

Compared with the origin nudging scheme of NMEFC, the new scheme adds a nudge assimilation for wind components, and increases the nudging weight at the subsurface. Increasing the nudging weight at the subsurface directly improved the simulation performance of the ocean component, while assimilating low-level wind components not only affected the atmospheric component but also benefited the oceanic simulation. Hindcast experiments showed that the new scheme remarkably improved both ENSO and IOD prediction skills. The skillful prediction lead time of ENSO was up to 11 months, 1 month longer than a hindcast using the original nudging scheme.

We use two different liquid water observation products from CloudSat and MODIS, for CLWP and their combined product for LWC with a method to remove the contribution from precipitating and convective core hydrometeors so that more meaningful model-observation comparisons can be made. Considering the CloudSat's limitations of CLWC retrievals due to contamination from the precipitation and from radar clutter near the surface, an estimate CLWC is synergistically constructed using MODIS CLWP and CloudSat CLWC. The model-observation comparison shows that most of the CMIP3/CMIP5 annual mean CLWP values are overestimated by factors of 2 - 10 compared to observations globally. There are a number of CMIP5 models, including CSIRO, MPI, and the UCLA GCM that perform well compared to the other models. For the vertical structure of CLWC, significant systematic biases are found with many models biased significantly high above the mid-troposphere. In the tropics, systematic high biases occur at all levels above 700 hPa. Based on the Taylor diagram, the ensemble performance of CMIP5 CLWP simulation shows little or no improvement relative to CMIP3.","[Li, Jui-lin F.; Lee, Seungwon; Stephens, Graeme; Guan, Bin] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ma, Hsi-Yen] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA USA; [Guan, Bin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Li, JLF (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",jli@jpl.nasa.gov,"Guan, Bin/F-6735-2010","Guan, Bin/0000-0002-8428-5984; Ma, Hsi-Yen/0000-0002-9628-1278",U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344],U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank Anthony Del Genio/NASA GISS, Ken Lo/NASA GISS, Voldoir Aurore/CNRM, Masahiro Watanabe and Shingo Watanabe/MIROC, Leon Rotstayn/CSIRO, Knut von Salzen/CCCma, Gary Strand/NCAR, Alf Kirkevag/NCC, Seiji Yukimoto/MRI, Dufresne Jean-Louis/IPSL, Tongwen Wu/BCC-CMA, and many other colleagues from climate modeling centers for providing model information.

The CNOP-P, as a type of climate perturbation to bring variation in climatology and climate variability of the reference climate condition, causes the maximal impact on the simulated NPP in China. A linear climate perturbation that induces variation in climatology, as another possible climate scenario, is also applied to explore the role of variation in climate variability in the simulated NPP. It is shown that NPP decreases in northern China and increases in northeastern and southern China when the temperature changes as a result of a CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario. A similar magnitude of change in the spatial pattern variations of NPP is caused by the CNOP-P-type and the linear temperature change scenarios in northern and northeastern China, but not in southern China. The impact of the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario on magnitude of change of NPP is more intense than that of the linear temperature change scenario. The numerical results also show that in southern China, the change in NPP caused by the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario compared with the reference simulated NPP is sensitive. However, this sensitivity is not observed under the linear temperature change scenario. The seasonal simulations indicate that the differences between the variations in NPP due to the two types of temperature change scenarios principally stem from the variations in summer and autumn in southern China under the LPJ model. These numerical results imply that NPP is sensitive to the variation in temperature variability. The results influenced by the CNOP-P-type precipitation change scenario are similar to those under the linear precipitation change scenario, which cause the increasing NPP in arid and semi-arid regions of the northern China. The above findings indicate that the CNOP-P approach is a useful tool for exploring the nonlinear response of NPP to climate variability.","[Sun, Guodong; Mu, Mu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Mu, Mu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Wave, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS","Sun, GD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",sungd@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Sun, Guodong/AAK-3355-2020",,"LASG State Key Laboratory Special Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40905050, 40830955]",LASG State Key Laboratory Special Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank Prof. Weidong Guo for the valuable discussion and recommendation.

There are opposing views as to whether or not human populations and activities were directly 'forced' by climate change, based on different comparisons between archaeological and environmental data. We review the geochronological assumptions and approaches on which data comparisons have been attempted in the past, and argue that the uncertainties presently associated with age models based on calibrated radiocarbon dates preclude robust testing of the competing models, particularly when comparing the data to non-radiocarbon-based timescales such as the Greenland ice core records. The paper concludes with some suggestions as to the steps that will be necessary if more robust tests of the models are to be developed in the future.

Current state-of-the-art advancements in material technology and concrete pavement design have allowed for implementation of improved materials and concrete pavement sections that are more resistant to rutting. The addition of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) has been identified as one effective way to produce concrete pavements with better abrasion resistance. The objective of this study was to identify and develop concrete pavement mix designs containing SCMs that can provide excellent abrasion resistance and durability to address rutting from studded tire wear and accommodate extreme climate conditions in cold regions. This study involved two phases of work. During Phase I, a series of ternary mixes containing silica fume with either slag or class F fly ash were produced and tested. The results were statistically analyzed using Minitab version 19.2.0 to identify mix designs with good performance in terms of workability, compressive strength, and flexural strength requirements for pavement applications. In Phase II, the mechanical properties and durability of concrete specimens with selected mix designs from Phase I were further evaluated to identify the optimum mix design with SCMs. This included tests for compressive strength, drying shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and other dualities such as scaling resistance to deicer salts, freeze-thaw resistance, and chloride ion penetration resistance. In terms of the properties evaluated within this study along with a cost analysis, five mixes, including four optimal mixes and the control, all provided good performance, but a quaternary mix design containing primarily silica fume and slag (SL12 SF4 FA1 mix) appeared to provide the overall best performance considering strength, durability, abrasion resistance, and cost.","[Murph, Diane; Liu, Jenny] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [Liu, Jun] Louisiana Transportat Res Ctr, 4101 Gourrier Ave, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA",University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology,"Liu, J (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",dmmctc@mst.edu; junliu@lsu.edu; jennyliu@mst.edu,"Liu, Jun/GNP-7414-2022",,,,,,47,0,0,3,4,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",,2573-5438,,J TRANSP ENG B-PAVE,J.

Climate conditions and their changes play a role in the inter-relationship between these agents, the vectors and the host (or hosts). This review is focused on arthropod-borne viruses (Arboviruses). These viruses are transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by blood-feeding arthropods, and may be transmitted by blood transfusion, tissue and organ transplantation and breast feeding. The lifecycle of arboviruses is influenced by changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, length of day, average daily solar radiation and/or storm patterns, as well as changes in the frequency or rare events such as floods or droughts. A plethora of studies have suggested that climate changes, particularly temperature changes, are likely to be induced by increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, such as methane, carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and chlorofluorocarbons, which deplete ozone in the atmosphere leading to an increase in ultraviolet radiation. Current models predict that ambient temperature will increase by 3-5 degrees C on average with a doubling in CO(2) concentration in the atmosphere. Vectors, pathogens and hosts each survive and reproduce within a range of optimal climatic conditions: temperature and precipitation being most important, while sea level elevation, wind and daylight duration are also important. Climate changes may affect important determinants of vector-borne disease transmission including (i) vector survival and reproduction, (ii) the vector's biting rate, and (iii) the pathogen's incubation rate within the vector organism. Droughts can increase the dissemination of arboviral diseases in urban areas by allowing a boost in the population of mosquitoes in foul water concentrated in catch basins where they breed. Furthermore, eggs can be vertically infected with arboviruses and heat waves speed up the maturation of the mosquitoes and of the viruses within mosquitoes. Droughts also cause a decline in mosquito predators like frogs, darning needles and dragonflies. In addition, birds congregate around shrinking water sites, enhancing circulation of viruses among birds and mosquitoes. In conclusion, the seriousness of some of the recent epidemics like West Nile virus and Dengue appear to has been influenced by climate change. As most of the arboviral infections are asymptomatic in humans, there is an increased opportunity for blood, organ and tissue donations by infected individuals during the viraemic period, resulting in an increased risk of transmission of arboviruses.","US FDA, Mol Virol Lab, Div Emerging & Transfus Transmitted Dis, Off Blood Res & Review,Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),"Rios, M (corresponding author), US FDA, Mol Virol Lab, Div Emerging & Transfus Transmitted Dis, Off Blood Res & Review,Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",maria.rios@fda.hhs.gov,,,,,,,25,5,5,3,27,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXEN, ENGLAND",1751-2816,,,ISBT SCI SERIES,,,2009,1,,,,87,94,,10.1111/j.1751-2824.2009.01216.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-2824.2009.01216.x,,,8,Hematology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Hematology,BJD60,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000265020700016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whilst this information can be obtained directly from the data providers, the resulting formats, temporal aggregations, and vocabularies may not be homogeneous across datasets. Moreover, different data policies hold for the different databases, being only some of them publicly available. Therefore, obtaining and harmonizing multi-model seasonal forecast data for sector-specific applications is an error-prone, time consuming task. In order to facilitate this, the ECOMS User Data Gateway (ECOMS-UDG) was developed in the framework of the ECOMS initiative as a one-stop-service for climate data. To this aim, the variables required by end users were identified, downloaded from the data providers and locally stored as virtual datasets in a THREDDS Data Server (TDS), implementing fine-grained user management and authorization via the THREDDS Access Portal (TAP). As a result, users can retrieve the subsets best suited to their particular research needs in a user-friendly manner using the standard TDS data services. Moreover, an open source, R-based interface for data access and postprocessing was developed in the form of a bundle of packages implementing harmonized data access (one single vocabulary), data collocation, bias adjustment and downscaling, and forecast visualization and validation. This provides a unique comprehensive framework for end-to-end applications of seasonal predictions, hence favoring the reproducibility of the ECOMS scientific outcomes, extensible to the whole scientific community.

Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications, the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but significant challenges related to spatial variability and model structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.","[Ochsner, Tyson E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Cosh, Michael H.] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Cuenca, Richard H.; Hagimoto, Yutaka] Oregon State Univ, Dep Biol & Ecol Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dorigo, Wouter A.] Vienna Univ Technol, Dep Geodesy & Geoinformat, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Draper, Clara S.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Draper, Clara S.] Univ Space Res Assoc, GESTAR, Columbia, MD 21044 USA; [Kerr, Yann H.] Ctr Etudes Spatiales Biosphere, F-31401 Toulouse, France; [Larson, Kristine M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Aerosp Engn Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Njoku, Eni G.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Small, Eric E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Zreda, Marek] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Oregon State University; Technische Universitat Wien; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Arizona,"Ochsner, TE (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, 368 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",tyson.ochsner@okstate.edu,"Cosh, Michael H./A-8858-2015; Dorigo, Wouter A/C-7794-2014; Draper, Clara/P-6097-2016; Larson, Kristine M/J-7623-2018; Kerr, Yann/Z-2432-2019; Small, eric/K-6007-2015","Cosh, Michael H./0000-0003-4776-1918; Dorigo, Wouter A/0000-0001-8054-7572; Draper, Clara/0000-0002-8299-4939; Larson, Kristine M/0000-0003-4666-8885; Ochsner, Tyson/0000-0003-0875-4491; Small, ERIC/0000-0002-5010-4954","SMOS Soil Moisture Network Study- Operational Phase (ESA ESTEC) [4000102722/10]; NASA [NNX10AU84G]; NSF [AGS 0935725]; U.S. National Science Foundation [ATM-0838491]; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; Directorate For Geosciences [1144221, 0838491] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","SMOS Soil Moisture Network Study- Operational Phase (ESA ESTEC)(European Space Agency); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","The contribution of Tyson Ochsner has been funded by the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station.

Here we present results from 19 state-of-the-art transport scheme formulations based on finite-difference/finite-volume methods as well as emerging ( in the context of atmospheric/oceanographic sciences) Galerkin methods. Discretization grids range from traditional regular latitude-longitude grids to more isotropic domain discretizations such as icosahedral and cubed-sphere tessellations of the sphere. The schemes are evaluated using a wide range of diagnostics in idealized flow environments. Accuracy is assessed in single-and two-tracer configurations using conventional error norms as well as novel diagnostics designed for climate and climate-chemistry applications. In addition, algorithmic considerations that may be important for computational efficiency are reported on. The latter is inevitably computing platform dependent. The ensemble of results from a wide variety of schemes presented here helps shed light on the ability of the test case suite diagnostics and flow settings to discriminate between algorithms and provide insights into accuracy in the context of global atmospheric/ocean modeling. A library of benchmark results is provided to facilitate scheme intercomparison and model development. Simple software and data sets are made available to facilitate the process of model evaluation and scheme intercomparison.","[Lauritzen, P. H.; Conley, A. J.; Lamarque, J-F; Skamarock, W.

A state-of-the-art framework for implementing an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA), the NOAA IEA approach, is used as an example to demonstrate whether and how assessment in ecosystem-based management (EBM), as often implemented in fisheries, can be expected to facilitate planned adaptation. Using comparisons with another assessment framework developed for implementing a climate change adaptation project, the United Nations Development Programme-Global Environment Facility Adaptation Policy Framework (UNDP-GEF APF), this paper expands and operationalizes the concepts of managing for resilience versus change in EBM as presented by West et al.(). It first introduces a variety of terms from climate change adaptation literature to help institutionalize planned adaptation as a useful concept within fisheries, then presents an expanded map of adaptive management processes in EBM. Finally, it proposes steps for enhancing processes supporting planned adaptation in individual applications of EBM in fisheries. Steps include (i) recognizing interest and funding for adaptation planning as prerequisites, (ii) evaluating what information or actors are lacking to implement better planning, and (iii) determining what institutional processes within an adaptive management cycle need augmentation.","[Woods, Pamela J.] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Fornubudir 5, IS-220 Hafnarfjordur, Iceland; [Woods, Pamela J.] Univ Iceland, Fac Life & Environm Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI); University of Iceland,"Woods, PJ (corresponding author), Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Fornubudir 5, IS-220 Hafnarfjordur, Iceland.;Woods, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Fac Life & Environm Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",pamela.woods@hafogvatn.is,,,EuroMarine Network through the CoDReG Foresight Workshop [EM/PFB/2017.006]; US National Science Foundation [OCE-1323991]; Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER) [36800],EuroMarine Network through the CoDReG Foresight Workshop; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER),"The preparation of this paper has been supported by the EuroMarine Network (www.euromarinenetwork.eu) through the CoDReG Foresight Workshop EM/PFB/2017.006, US National Science Foundation under Award no.

The risk posed by ECEs in the wheat production systems of Australia could be better managed through the identification of safe flowering (SFW) and optimal time of sowing (TOS) windows. To address this issue, three locations (Narrabri, Roseworthy and Merredin), three cultivars (Suntop and Gregory for Narrabri, Mace for both Roseworthy and Merredin) and 20 TOS at 1-week intervals between 1 April and 12 August for the period from 1957 to 2007 were evaluated using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM)-Wheat model. Simulation results show that (1) the average frequency of frost events decreased with TOS from 8 to 0 days (d) across the four cases (the combination of locations and cultivars), (2) the average frequency of heat stress events increased with TOS across all cases from 0 to 10 d, (3) soil moisture stress (SMS) increased with earlier TOS before reaching a plateau and then slightly decreasing for Suntop and Gregory at Narrabri and Mace at Roseworthy while SMS increased with TOS for Mace at Merredin from 0.1 to 0.8, (4) Mace at Merredin had the earliest and widest SFW (216-260) while Mace at Roseworthy had latest SFW (257-280), (5) frost risk and heat stress determine SFW at wetter sites (i.e. Narrabri and Roseworthy) while frost risk and SMS determine SFW at drier site (i.e. Merredin) and (6) the optimal TOS (window) to maximise wheat yield are 6-20 May, 13-27 May and 15 April at Narrabri, Roseworthy and Merredin, respectively. These findings provide important and specific information for wheat growers about the management of ECE risk on farm. Furthermore, the coupling of the APSIM crop models with state-of-the-art seasonal and intra-seasonal climate forecast information provides an important tool for improved management of the risk of ECEs in economically important cropping industries in the foreseeable future.",,,,luo.qunying122@gmail.com,"Trethowan, Richard/ADZ-7680-2022; Tan, Daniel/E-4589-2012","Tan, Daniel/0000-0003-0449-4557; Trethowan, Richard/0000-0003-0105-875X",Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation [US00081],Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp),This study was supported by Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation with project code of US00081.,,26,4,4,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

In the late-glacial period (ca. 14,300-13,100 cal yr BP), Pinus/Picea-dominated parkland supported little to no fire activity. From the late-glacial to the early Holocene (ca. 13,100-10,800 cal yr BP), Pseudotsuga/Abies-dominated forest featured more frequent fire episodes that burned mostly woody vegetation. In the early to middle Holocene (ca. 10,800-5200 cal yr BP), Quercus-dominated savanna was associated with frequent fire episodes of low-to-moderate severity, with art increased herbaceous (i.e., grass) charcoal content. From the middle to late Holocene (ca. 5200 cal yr BP to present), forest dominated by Pseudotsuga, Thuja-type, and Tsuga heterophylla supported less frequent, but mostly large or high-severity fire episodes. Fire episodes were least frequent, but were largest or most severe, after ca. 2500 cal yr BP. The fire history at Battle Ground Lake was apparently driven by climate, directly through the length and severity of the fire season, and indirectly through climate-driven vegetation shifts, which affected available fuel biomass.

J,"Tingting, TT; Jiang, ZH; Wu, ZW",,,,Ma Tingting; Jiang Zhihong; Wu Zhiwei,,,Responses of the Leading Mode of Coldwave Intensity in China to a Warming Climate,ACTA METEOROLOGICA SINICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,coldwave intensity; southward extension; warm period; cold period,ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; JANUARY 2008; REANALYSIS; NORTHERN; 20TH-CENTURY; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; EXTREMES; PROGRESS; TRENDS,"Regional extreme cold events have changed notably with recent global warming. Understanding how these cold extremes change in China is an urgent issue. This study examines the responses of the dominant mode of China coldwave intensity (CWI) to global warming by comparing observations with simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The leading modes of the CWI derived from empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis have different features in different epochs. During the cold period (1957-1979), the leading mode is characterized by centers of extreme values of CWI in northern China; while during the warm period (1980-2009), the leading mode features two maximum loading centers over northern and southern China. The southward extension of the extreme value center is associated with an increase in the intensity of coldwave variations in southern China relative to previous decades. A multi-model ensemble of seven state-of-the-art climate models shows an extension of the maximum loading of the CWI leading mode into southern China by the end of the 21st century (2080-2099) under the A1B global warming scenario (atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm). These results indicate that the primary response of the leading mode of CWI to global warming might be a southward extension of the extreme value center. This response may be associated with the southward shift of the storm track observed during recent decades. A significant change in the baroclinic growth rates around 40 degrees N is accompanied by a consistent change in synoptic eddies in the troposphere, which may indicate a shift in the preferred latitude for the growth of eddies. As a result, the storm track tends to move southward, suggesting that southern China may experience increased storminess due to increased baroclinic instability in the troposphere.","[Ma Tingting; Jiang Zhihong; Wu Zhiwei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Jiang, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhjiang@nuist.edu.cn,,,"National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China [2013CB430202, 2010CB950401]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230528]; China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund [GYHY200906016]; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"Supported by the National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China (2013CB430202 and 2010CB950401), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41230528), China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund (GYHY200906016), and Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,48,0,0,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0894-0525,2191-4788,,ACTA METEOROL SIN,Acta Meteorol.

Multispectral remote sensing has enabled mapping of global spatiotemporal patterns of fire and fire effects, which has significantly improved our understanding of interactions between ecosystems, climate, humans and fire. With several upcoming spaceborne hyperspectral missions like the Environmental Mapping And Analysis Program (EnMAP), the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) and the Precursore Iperspettrale Della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), we provide a review of the state-of-the-art and perspectives of hyperspectral remote sensing of fire. Hyperspectral remote sensing leverages information in many (often more than 100) narrow (smaller than 20 nm) spectrally contiguous bands, in contrast to multispectral remote sensing of few (up to 15) non-contiguous wider (greater than 20 nm) bands. To date, hyperspectral fire applications have primarily used airborne data in the visible to short-wave infrared region (VSWIR, 0.4 to 2.5 mu m). This has resulted in detailed and accurate discrimination and quantification of fuel types and condition, fire temperatures and emissions, fire severity and vegetation recovery. Many of these applications use processing techniques that take advantage of the high spectral resolution and dimensionality such as advanced spectral mixture analysis. So far, hyperspectral VSWIR fire applications are based on a limited number of airborne acquisitions, yet techniques will approach maturity for larger scale application when spaceborne imagery becomes available. Recent innovations in airborne hyperspectral thermal (8 to 12 pm) remote sensing show potential to improve retrievals of temperature and emissions from active fires, yet these applications need more investigation over more fires to verify consistency over space and time, and overcome sensor saturation issues. Furthermore, hyperspectral information and structural data from, for example, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are highly complementary. Their combined use has demonstrated advantages for fuel mapping, yet its potential for post-fire severity and combustion retrievals remains largely unexplored.","[Veraverbeke, Sander] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dennison, Philip] Univ Utah, 332 S 1400 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Gitas, Ioannis; Katagis, Thomas] Univ Thessaloniki, 59 Mouschounti St, Thessaloniki 55134, Greece; [Hulley, Glynn; Kalashnikova, Olga; Kuai, Le; Stavros, Natasha] CALTECH, NASA Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Kuai, Le] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Meng, Ran] Brookhaven Natl Lab, POB 5000, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Roberts, Dar] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, 5832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Veraverbeke, S (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.s.n.veraverbeke@vu.nl; dennison@geog.utah.edu; igitas@for.auth.gr; Glynn.Hulley@jpl.nasa.gov; Olga.Kalashnikova@jpl.nasa.gov; thkatag@for.auth.gr; Le.Kuai@jpl.nasa.gov; ranmeng@bnl.gov; dar@geog.ucsb.edu; Natasha.Stavros@jpl.nasa.gov,"Gitas, Ioannis Z./C-3329-2008; Katagis, Thomas/AAF-3545-2021; Kalashnikova, Olga V/E-6818-2019; Veraverbeke, Sander/H-2301-2012; Veraverbeke, Sander/M-3928-2019; Meng, Ran/Q-9436-2016","Gitas, Ioannis Z./0000-0003-0056-5629; Kalashnikova, Olga V/0000-0002-1330-1529; Veraverbeke, Sander/0000-0003-1362-5125; Veraverbeke, Sander/0000-0003-1362-5125; Stavros, E.

Previous Holocene EAWM proxy data records, which were mostly located in Central, Eastern and Southern China, did not show a consistent Holocene EAWM history. Therefore, it is difficult to provide insights into mechanisms of the long-term winter monsoon variability on the basis of the records. Eolian sediments at the southern edge of the Gobi Desert, Western China, are sensitive to the EAWM changes and less affected by the East Asian summer monsoon due to an obstruction of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This paper presents a comparison between a well-dated Holocene EAWM record and coupled climate model simulations, so as to explore physical processes and influencing factors of the Holocene EAWM. Sediment samples from two Holocene eolian sedimentary sections [Huangyanghe (a) and Huangyanghe (b)] were acquired at the southern edge of the Gobi Desert. Chronologies were established based on twenty bulk organic matter AMS C-14 ages and five pollen concentrates AMS C-14 ages. Proxy data, including grain-size, total organic carbon, magnetic susceptibility and carbonate content were obtained from the two eolian sections. The grain-size standard deviation model was applied to determine components sensitive to variability of the Holocene EAWM. After a comparison of environmentally-sensitive grain-size components and proxy data, the 20-200 mu m component at the Huangyanghe (a) and the 20-159 mu m component at the Huangyanghe (b) section were selected as indicators of the Holocene EAWM, which show a strong early Holocene winter monsoon and a decline of the winter monsoon since the mid-Holocene. We also present equilibrium and transient simulations of the climate evolution for the Holocene using a state-of-art coupled climate model: the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Indices for the Holocene EAWM were calculated and are consistent with the reconstructed Holocene EAWM intensity. The simulations indicate that orbital forcing effects on the land-sea temperature and sea level pressure contrast can account for the observed EAWM trends. Other forcings that were present in the early Holocene, including the remnant Laurentide ice sheet and meltwater forcing in the North Atlantic, were not responsible for the Holocene trends.","[Li, Yu] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Hydrol Cycle & Water Resources Arid Reg, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu; Morrill, Carrie] NOAA, Paleoclimatol Branch, Natl Climat Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Li, Yu; Morrill, Carrie] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Lanzhou University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Hydrol Cycle & Water Resources Arid Reg, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",oscaryoulee@gmail.com,,"Li, Yu/0000-0003-3381-5372; Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371009]; US National Science Foundation (P2C2 program); US Department of Energy; National Center for Atmospheric Research,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation (P2C2 program); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Center for Atmospheric Research,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41371009).

Reliable flood modelling is challenging due to the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation intensity, duration and frequency, heterogeneity in temperature rise and land-use changes. Reliable high-resolution precipitation data and distributed hydrological model can solve the problem. This study aims to develop a distributed hydrological model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simulate streamflow extremes from satellite-based high-resolution climate data. Four widely used bias correction methods were compared to select the best method for downscaling coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) global climate model (GCMs) simulations. A novel ML-based distributed hydrological model was developed for modelling runoff from the corrected satellite rainfall data. Finally, the model was used to project future changes in runoff and streamflow extremes from the downscaled GCM projected climate. The Johor River Basin (JRB) in Malaysia was considered as the case study area. The distributed hydrological model developed using ML showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.96 and 0.78 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.01 and 5.64 during calibration and validation. The simulated flow analysis using the model showed that the river discharge would increase in the near future (2020-2059) and the far future (2060-2099) for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The largest change in river discharge would be for SSP-585. The extreme rainfall indices, such as Total Rainfall above 95th Percentile (R95TOT), Total Rainfall above 99th Percentile (R99TOT), One day Max Rainfall (R x 1day), Five-day Max Rainfall (R x 5day), and Rainfall Intensity (RI), were projected to increase from 5% for SSP-119 to 37% for SSP-585 in the future compared to the base period. The results showed that climate change and socio-economic development would cause an increase in the frequency of streamflow extremes, causing larger flood events.","[Iqbal, Zafar; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Ismail, Tarmizi; Sa'adi, Zulfaqar] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Sa'adi, Zulfaqar] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Water Secur IPASA, Res Inst Sustainable Environm RISE, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Farooque, Aitazaz] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Fac Sustainable Design Engn, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Math Phys & Comp, USQs Adv Data Analyt Res Grp, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Al Ayen Univ, Ctr Sci Res, New Era & Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Thi Qar 64001, Iraq",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; University of Prince Edward Island; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; University of Southern Queensland,"Ismail, T (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",izafar2@graduate.utm.my; sshahid@utm.my; tarmiziismail@utm.my; zulfaqar@utm.my; afarooque@upei.ca; yaseen@ukm.edu.my,"Ismail, Tarmizi/AAO-3422-2020; Iqbal, Zafar/HDM-5923-2022; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018","Ismail, Tarmizi/0000-0002-6748-4703; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (FRGS) [R.J130000.78515F092],"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (FRGS)(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (FRGS) (No. R.J130000.78515F092).,,70,1,1,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,11,,,,,,6620,10.3390/su14116620,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116620,,,30,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Z6ST,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000808952400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, thermocline biases in the tropical North Pacific are investigated using the newly released CMIP6 historical simulations. It is found that CMIP6 models tend to produce an overly shallow thermocline in the northwestern tropics, accompanied by a deep thermocline in the northeastern tropics. A pronounced thermocline strength bias arises in the tropical northeastern Pacific, demonstrating a dipole structure with a sign change at about 8 degrees N. These thermocline biases are accompanied with biases in the simulations of oceanic circulations, including a too weak North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), a reduction in water exchanges between the subtropics and the equatorial regions, and an eastward extension of the equatorward interior water transport. The causes of these thermocline biases are further analyzed. The thermocline bias is primarily caused by the model deficiency in simulating the surface wind stress curl, which can be further attributed to the longstanding double-ITCZ bias in the tropical North Pacific. Besides, thermocline strength bias can be partly attributed to the poor prescription of oceanic background diffusivity. By constraining the diffusivity to match observations, the thermocline strength in the tropical northeastern Pacific is greatly increased.","[Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua; Li, Delei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua; Li, Delei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua; Li, Delei] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rong-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rong-Hua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dake] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dake] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory","Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",rzhang@qdio.ac.cn,"LI, Delei/S-1564-2019","Zhu, Yuchao/0000-0002-0277-200X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41906007, 41690122(41690120), 41705082, 41421005]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1404102(2017YFC1404100)]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 40000000, XDB 42000000]; Shandong Taishan Scholarship; Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Shandong Taishan Scholarship; Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF),"The authors wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their numerous comments that helped to improve the original manuscript.

Thirteen of these technologies, i.e. auto-responsive technologies (ARTs), were studied for climatic suitability on opaque facades under current and future weather conditions. An expeditious method, that can be used as a pre-design tool, is presented, which allows mapping out the potential use of ARTs in different climates allocating them to thermal adaptive strategies (TAS). Using the Climate consultant tool 6.0, building bioclimatic charts (BBCs) based on hourly weather data, were generated to determine the best passive design strategies (PDS) for nine locations. Correspondence between TAS and some PDS, based on the weather conditions in which they are effective, was proposed in order to assess the ARTs' climatic suitability, i.e., the time percentage in which the analysed strategy, employing specific ARTs, can contribute to occupants' comfort. Cold climates present short suitability times concerning all the studied TAS. Higher suitability times for TAS, exclusively for cooling, were found in Equatorial and Arid climates, which are expected to increase worldwide in the future. The solar reflectance adaptation strategy is expected to increase its suitability time and achieve a more balanced mode of usage (similar heating and cooling times). This will boost the technology which enables its implementation, i.e. thermochromics.","[Santos, Rita Andrade; Flores-Colen, Ines; Slivestre, Jose Dinis] Univ Lisbon, CERIS, Inst Super Tecn, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Simoes, Nuno] Univ Coimbra, Dept Civil Engn, CERIS, Coimbra, Portugal; [Simoes, Nuno] Itecons, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Santos, RA (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, CERIS, Inst Super Tecn, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",andrade.santos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Flores-Colen, Ines/A-6635-2013","Flores-Colen, Ines/0000-0003-4038-6748",CERIS [PD/BD/135215/2017]; FCT [PD/BD/135215/2017],CERIS; FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),"The authors acknowledge the support of the CERIS, and the FCT for the financial support to the first author through PhD scholarship no.

The increase in renewable energy sources may result in savings and the increasing cost of maintaining carbon-based energy. Worldwide involvement is required. The fulfillment of conditions by individual states does not solve the problem. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed economic growth. It turns out that economic growth is not always associated with increased investments in RES (existing or emerging new clean energy points). We have a new epidemiological threat-Delta-which could become large. This will not improve the situation. Germany is an exemplary country for benchmarking in the field of renewable energy. The worrying fact is that Poland, despite economic growth, does not achieve an even growth in RES. Each of us is required to be involved, to be open to innovation and to act in accordance with the energy policy of the European Union. Basic management functions (planning, organizing, motivating and controlling) are also essential. Failure to meet the demands of the energy policy should be thoroughly verified and consequences should be drawn in order to involve the whole world. The authors thoroughly analyzed many factors that have a significant impact on the success in stopping climate change and increasing RES. With the increase in energy demand, renewable energy is introduced to a greater extent. Additionally, coal energy will be more expensive to maintain. The more RES, the more expensive the energy obtained from mine sources. The investment is an opportunity to meet the demands of RES, but investors are currently only interested in investing in renewable energy in highly developed countries. The decision-making process regarding the implementation of renewable energy sources not only consists in a radical decision to introduce changes, but also in the fulfillment of a number of assumptions regarding the energy policy controlled by the authorities of a given state as part of this action. There is a risk (fear) in underdeveloped countries that they will not be able to finalize this project, either due to the lack of investor interest or the lack of real opportunities due to the failure to meet the guidelines of the energy policy of a given country. It is advisable that state governments facilitate the process as much as possible so that even less developed countries could take advantage of this postulate.","[Jalowiec, Tomasz; Wojtaszek, Henryk] War Studies Univ, Inst Management, Management & Command Fac, PL-00910 Warsaw, Poland",,"Wojtaszek, H (corresponding author), War Studies Univ, Inst Management, Management & Command Fac, PL-00910 Warsaw, Poland.",tjalowiec@akademia.mil.pl; h.wojtaszek@akademia.mil.pl,"Wojtaszek, Henryk Zygmunt/AAD-3824-2019; Jalowiec, Tomasz/B-7965-2019","Wojtaszek, Henryk Zygmunt/0000-0002-3082-1219; Jalowiec, Tomasz/0000-0002-6974-090X",Academy of War Art in Warsaw,Academy of War Art in Warsaw,The article was funded from research funds from the Academy of War Art in Warsaw.,,80,5,5,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,OCT,2021,19,,,,,,6030,10.3390/en14196030,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14196030,,,33,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,WL2NV,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000710249300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The province has recently adopted an action plan for climate change adaptation. However, the national authorities intend to promote Lao Cai as a major secondary city on the main route from China to Hanoi. In a context of rapid, strategic, state-driven urban development, I identify three main obstacles to effective implementation of environmental and climate change policies: (1) the pre-eminence of economic growth over any environmental goal, (2) the underenforcement of existing regulations, and (3) a failure of environmental governance. Environmental risk management is mainly based on the reinforcement of defensive infrastructures (such as the river embankment) and the displacement of exposed people. These actions are likely inefficient in a context of increased major hazards that might put great pressure on displaced residents' livelihoods. In other words, there is a wide gap between discourse and implementation.","[Pulliat, Gwenn] Univ Montpellier 3, UMR Art Dev, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, CNRS, Route Mende, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France; [Pulliat, Gwenn] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Asian Inst, Urban Climate Resilience Southeast Asia Partnersh, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; University of Toronto,"Pulliat, G (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 3, UMR Art Dev, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, CNRS, Route Mende, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France.",gwenn.pulliat@cnrs.fr,,"Pulliat, Gwenn/0000-0003-2649-5614",,,,,50,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2365-757X,2365-7588,978-3-319-98968-6; 978-3-319-98967-9,URBAN BOOK SERIES,,,2019,,,,,201,222,,10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6_10,10.1007/978-3-319-98968-6,,22,Environmental Studies; Geography; Urban Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Urban Studies,BQ9GS,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000624512100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The evaluation includes detailed comparisons with aircraft and ground data, along with remote sensing observations from MODIS and AERONET. We demonstrate several improvements to aerosol properties following the implementation of the Global Model for Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP-mode) modal aerosol scheme in the HadGEM3 climate model. This predicts the particle size distribution, composition, and optical properties, giving increased accuracy in the representation of aerosol properties and physical-chemical processes over the Coupled Large-scale Aerosol Scheme for Simulations in Climate Models (CLASSIC) bulk aerosol scheme previously used in HadGEM2. Although both models give similar regional distributions of carbonaceous aerosol mass and aerosol optical depth (AOD), GLOMAP-mode is better able to capture the observed size distribution, single scattering albedo, and Angstrom exponent across different tropical biomass burning source regions. Both aerosol schemes overestimate the uptake of water compared to recent observations, CLASSIC more so than GLOMAP-mode, leading to a likely overestimation of aerosol scattering, AOD, and single scattering albedo at high relative humidity. Observed aerosol vertical distributions were well captured when biomass burning aerosol emissions were injected uniformly from the surface to 3 km. Finally, good agreement between observed and modelled AOD was gained only after scaling up GFED3 emissions by a factor of 1.6 for CLASSIC and 2.0 for GLOMAP-mode. We attribute this difference in scaling factor mainly to different assumptions for the water uptake and growth of aerosol mass during ageing via oxidation and condensation of organics. We also note that similar agreement with observed AOD could have been achieved with lower scaling factors if the ratio of organic carbon to primary organic matter was increased in the models toward the upper range of observed values. Improved knowledge from measurements is required to reduce uncertainties in emission ratios for black carbon and organic carbon, and the ratio of organic carbon to primary organic matter for primary emissions from biomass burning.","[Johnson, Ben T.; Haywood, James M.; Langridge, Justin M.; Szpek, Kate; Brooke, Jennifer K.; Marenco, Franco; Mulcahy, Jane P.; Dalvi, Mohit] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Haywood, James M.] Univ Exeter, CEMPS, Exeter, Devon, England; [Darbyshire, Eoghan; Morgan, William T.; Coe, Hugh] Univ Manchester, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Artaxo, Paulo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Phys, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Longo, Karla M.] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Mann, Graham W.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bellouin, Nicolas] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Longo, Karla M.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Longo, Karla M.] USRA GESTAR, Greenbelt, MD USA",Met Office - UK; University of Exeter; University of Manchester; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Leeds; University of Reading; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Johnson, BT (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England.",ben.johnson@metoffice.gov.uk,"Haywood, Jim/GQA-6691-2022; Marenco, Franco/J-3667-2012; Brooke, Jennifer K./ABG-2243-2020; Johnson, Ben/A-6563-2013; Szpek, Kate/AAY-3681-2021; Artaxo, Paulo/E-8874-2010; Mann, Graham/L-9529-2017","Marenco, Franco/0000-0002-1833-1102; Brooke, Jennifer K./0000-0001-5752-5877; Szpek, Kate/0000-0002-2073-586X; Artaxo, Paulo/0000-0001-7754-3036; Johnson, Ben/0000-0003-3334-9295; Mann, Graham/0000-0003-1746-2837; Coe, Hugh/0000-0002-3264-1713; Haywood, Jim/0000-0002-2143-6634; Mulcahy, Jane/0000-0002-0870-7380; Darbyshire, Eoghan/0000-0002-5119-7259","SAMBBA (NERC) [NE/J009822/1]; IMPALA [NE/M017214/1]; NERC; DFID; NERC [NE/M017265/1, NE/J010057/1, NE/J010073/1, NE/M017214/1, NE/D013690/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [1236935, NE/J010057/1, NE/M017214/1, NE/M017265/1, NE/J010073/1, NE/D013690/1] Funding Source: researchfish",SAMBBA (NERC); IMPALA; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); DFID; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement (FAAM) BAe-146 Atmospheric Research Aircraft is jointly funded by the Met Office and Natural Environment Research Council and operated by DirectFlight Ltd.

For example, changes in the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) can be regarded as a crucial indicator of climate variations. Clouds play an important role -still insufficiently assessed- in the global energy balance on all spatial and temporal scales, and satellites provide an ideal platform to measure cloud and large-scale atmospheric variables simultaneously. The TOVS series of satellites were the first to provide this type of information since 1979. OLR [Mehta and Susskind(1)], cloud cover and cloud top pressure [Susskind et al.(2)] are among the key climatic parameters computed by the TOVS Pathfinder Path-A algorithm using mainly the retrieved temperature and moisture profiles. AIRS, regarded as the new and improved TOVS, has a much higher spectral resolution and greater S/N ratio, retrieving climatic parameters with higher accuracy. First we present encouraging agreements between MODIS and AIRS cloud top pressure (C-tp) and 'effective' (A(eff), a product of infrared emissivity at 11 mu m and physical cloud cover or A(c)) cloud fraction seasonal and interannual variabilities for selected months. Next we present validation efforts and preliminary trend analyses of TOVS-retrieved C-tp and A(eff). For example, decadal global trends of the TOVS Path-A and ISCCP-D2 P-c and A(eff)/A(c) values are similar. Furthermore, the TOVS Path-A and ISCCP-AVHRR [available since 1983] cloud fractions correlate even more strongly, including regional trends. We also present TOVS and AIRS OLR validation effort results and (for the longer-term TOVS Pathfinder Path-A dataset) trend analyses. OLR interannual spatial variabilities from the available state-of-the-art CERES measurements and both from the AIRS [Susskind et al.(3,4)] and TOVS OLR computations are in remarkably good agreement. Global monthly mean CERES and TOVS OLR time series show very good agreement in absolute values also. Finally, we will assess correlations among long-term trends of selected parameters, derived simultaneously from the TOVS Pathfinder Path-A dataset.","JCET UMBC & NASA GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Molnar, GI (corresponding author), JCET UMBC & NASA GSFC, Code 613-5, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6289-6,PROC SPIE,,,2006,,1&2,,,,,62331D,10.1117/12.665046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.665046,,,10,Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BES78,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000239353500047,View Full Record in Web of Science

It means that urban and suburban areas' air and surface temperatures are hotter than their nearby surrounding rural areas. Pavements and parking lots contributes to about 29% to 45% of the urban areas, and they contribute to the UHI phenomena. During the day, temperature of dark dry surfaces (such as pavements and parking lots) in direct sun can reach up to 88 degrees C while vegetated surfaces with moist soils might reach only 18 degrees C under the same conditions. The increase in temperature due to UHI leads to an increase in the peak energy demand using more air conditioners and raising the energy bills. It also leads to an increase in the levels of greenhouse gas emissions (global worming) and air pollution. Increased daytime temperatures, reduced nighttime cooling, and higher air pollution levels related to UHIs affects human health as they lead to general discomfort, respiratory difficulties, heat cramps, and exhaustion. UHI has great and direct effects on the environment, on people and on the human health, on energy consumption and on the economy, and on the pavement performance. The factors that affect the formation and intensity of UHI are versatile in nature. These factors vary between geographic location, time of day and season, synoptic weather, city size, city function and city form. The last two factors are the factors which can be controlled in order to mitigate UHI. Recent studies showed more interest in analyzing and quantifying the UHI phenomenon with more focus on the mitigation techniques. It is abundantly clear that there must be strategies to measure, model and control the phenomenon and achieve one of the Sustainable Development Goals, namely; sustainable cities and communities. The primary focus of this concise, yet comprehensive state of the art paper is to present the different technologies to mitigate the urban heat island. This study presented the different UHI definitions, causes, evaluation methods, and finally compared between the different mitigation techniques and set recommendations and guidelines based on a comprehensive literature review.","[Abd El-Hakim, Ragaa] Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Publ Works Engn Dept, Tanta, Egypt; [El-Badawy, Sherif] Mansoura Univ, Fac Engn, Publ Works Engn Dept, Mansoura, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"Abd El-Hakim, R (corresponding author), Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Publ Works Engn Dept, Tanta, Egypt.",ragaa.abdelhakim@f-eng.tanta.edu.eg; sbadawy@mans.edu.eg,,,,,,,196,3,3,4,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2366-3405,2366-3413,978-3-030-34196-1; 978-3-030-34195-4,SUSTAIN CIV INFRASTR,,,2020,,,,,42,69,,10.1007/978-3-030-34196-1_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34196-1_4,,,28,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering,BT7KT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000849952600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet these arts-based research processes, although present in the social sciences, are still largely invisible in a research climate that privileges (e. g., through publication, funding, and recognition) work claiming to be exclusively scientific. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: To fully develop the potential of the arts for a transformative educational inquiry, the synthesis of scientific and artistic methods must be fully explicated through clear examples that address theoretical and empirical concerns. This article focuses on explicit arts-based approaches that the authors employed in a 3-year teacher education study of professional conflicts experienced by novice bilingual teachers. Authors describe how they used the arts and to what end, addressing questions of artistic processes, expertise, and research validity. Research Design: The research design included theatrical and literary techniques alongside more traditional qualitative methods of inquiry (e. g., participant observation, audio-and video-recorded focus group interactions, interviews, and surveys). Authors initiated performative focus groups based on the work of Paulo Freire and Augusto Boal in which participants share and act scenes from power-laden experiences of conflict, rehearsing strategies for personal and social revolution. This embodied data enabled the research team to focus empirical and pedagogical attention on both participants' physical and verbal scripts or trans/scripts: compressed renderings of original transcripts that utilize techniques from poetry and the dramatic arts to highlight the data's emotional hot points and heightened language from the original discourse. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study illuminated the range of experiences and emotions involved in novice bilingual teachers' professional lives, signaling the value and validity of research that is both artistic and scientific. Such hybridity may at first appear to make for unexpected and potentially haphazard methodological mergers. The authors do not claim to have resolved these epistemological tensions, but to have exploited both traditional and artistic research methods to broaden the notion of what counts as research in teacher education and to conduct research that is engaging to researchers and participants alike.","[Cahnmann-Taylor, Melisa] Univ Georgia, Dept Language & Literacy Educ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Souto-Manning, Mariana] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dice, Jaime L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College; University of Rhode Island,"Cahnmann-Taylor, M (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Language & Literacy Educ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,"Cahnmann-Taylor, Melisa/0000-0001-5667-8695",,,,,33,34,34,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

Field observations during sampling in 1995 indicated that the panel: (1) was coated with a heavy rock varnish, (2) had a 'fresh' visual appearance, and (3) had some granite-derived sand (angular grus) at the panel's base. Micron-scale back-scatter and nanoscale transmission electron microscopy of pre-fire samples revealed a minimal amount of decay (granite grussification): mainly minor grain-to-grain separation; minor internal dissolution; and a little feldspar grain cracking. Our basic finding is that even this minimal amount of grussification was enough to set the stage for the wildfire to erode the entire panel. Pre-fire micron-scale cracking may have enabled the fire's steep thermal gradient to spall the surface. Panel erosion was likely enhanced by pre-existing grain-to-grain porosity to facilitate further fire-induced granular disintegration. Pre-fire nanoscale dissolution within mineral grains, formed along crystal defects, provided a weakness that then led to grain cracking of quartz and other granitic minerals. The implication for the conservation of rock art on granitic panels is worrisome, but clear and simple: condition assessments need to indicate whether any granitic sand occurs at a panel's base. Given that many places experiencing climate change are also experiencing drought and enhanced risk from wildfire, the appropriate management recommendation would then be to remove all vegetation near the panel on a regular basis.","[Dorn, Ronald, I] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Whitley, David S.] ASM Affiliates, Tehachapi, CA USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Dorn, RI (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",ronald.dorn@asu.edu,,,,,,,114,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-5033,1753-5522,,CONSERV MANAGE ARCHA,Conserv.

Heritage is concerned with conserving the past, while climate change is about conserving the future. This paper tackles this temporal cross-roads by examining a tourist attraction that transforms modern, consumer culture into heritage in the form of a fast-tracked lost civilisation beneath the sea. Museo Subaquatico De Arte is a sunken sculpture museum in the Caribbean Sea that inaugurates a unique way of restoring the distressed habitats of the Meso-American Reef System, while offering a sobering glimpse into a world that asks tourists to consider 'what have we done?' Visitors are invited to examine their own way of life as both precarious and implicated in climate changed futures by confronting them with an Atlantis-like eeriness that both reflects and portends the closure of the tumultuous Anthropocene. The experience promotes the immediacy of the present by concretising life-sized caricatures of consumer culture beneath the sea, bequeathing these to an aquatic environment that soon transforms them into a state of decaying modernity. This promotes a theatre for radical change as these caricatures, and by extension we, are overtaken by this environment and destined to a diminutive state.","[Picken, Felicity] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2750, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Picken, F (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2750, Australia.",f.picken@uws.edu.au,,,,,,,61,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-873X,1747-6631,,J HERIT TOUR,J.

In particular, changes in the frequency and intensity of heat waves and cold spells are of high relevance in terms of mortality and morbidity. This demonstrates the urgent need for reliable early-warning systems to help authorities prepare and respond to emergency situations. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a climate-driven mortality model to provide probabilistic predictions of exceeding emergency mortality thresholds for heat wave and cold spell scenarios. Daily mortality data corresponding to 187 NUTS2 regions across 16 countries in Europe were obtained from 1998-2003. Data were aggregated to 54 larger regions in Europe, defined according to similarities in population structure and climate. Location-specific average mortality rates, at given temperature intervals over the time period, were modelled to account for the increased mortality observed during both high and low temperature extremes and differing comfort temperatures between regions. Model parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework, in order to generate probabilistic simulations of mortality across Europe for time periods of interest. For the heat wave scenario (1-15 August 2003), the model was successfully able to anticipate the occurrence or non-occurrence of mortality rates exceeding the emergency threshold (75th percentile of the mortality distribution) for 89% of the 54 regions, given a probability decision threshold of 70%. For the cold spell scenario (1-15 January 2003), mortality events in 69% of the regions were correctly anticipated with a probability decision threshold of 70%. By using a more conservative decision threshold of 30%, this proportion increased to 87%. Overall, the model performed better for the heat wave scenario. By replacing observed temperature data in the model with forecast temperature, from state-of-the-art European forecasting systems, probabilistic mortality predictions could potentially be made several months ahead of imminent heat waves and cold spells.","[Lowe, Rachel; Ballester, Joan; Rodo, Xavier] Inst Catala Ciencies Clima IC3, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Ballester, Joan] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci GPS, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Creswick, James] European Ctr Environm & Hlth, World Hlth Org WHO Reg Off Europe, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Robine, Jean-Marie] Univ Montpellier 2, INSERM, U988, Natl Inst Hlth & Med Res,MMDN U1198, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Robine, Jean-Marie] Univ Montpellier 2, U1198, MMDN U1198, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Robine, Jean-Marie] Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, F-75014 Paris, France; [Herrmann, Francois R.] Univ Geneva, Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Internal Med Rehabil & Geriatr, Div Geriatr, CH-1226 Thonex, Switzerland; [Rodo, Xavier] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",Institut Catala de Ciencies del Clima (IC3); California Institute of Technology; World Health Organization; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); University of Geneva; ICREA,"Lowe, R (corresponding author), Inst Catala Ciencies Clima IC3, Carrer Doctor Trueta,203,3a, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",rachel.lowe@ic3.cat; joan.ballester@ic3.cat; creswickj@who.int; jean-marie.robine@inserm.fr; francois.herrmann@hcuge.ch; xavier.rodo@ic3.cat,"Lowe, Rachel/GXN-3278-2022; HERRMANN, Francois R/B-6710-2011; Ballester, Joan/E-6627-2017; Robine, Jean-Marie/F-5439-2011; HERRMANN, Francois/M-7390-2019; Rodó, Xavier/F-7663-2017; Lowe, Rachel/H-1658-2015","HERRMANN, Francois R/0000-0003-1312-1517; Ballester, Joan/0000-0003-0009-437X; Robine, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-4111-6195; HERRMANN, Francois/0000-0003-1312-1517; Rodó, Xavier/0000-0003-4843-6180; Lowe, Rachel/0000-0003-3939-7343; Creswick, James/0000-0001-5400-307X",EUPORIAS project - European Commission [308291]; EU Community Action Programme for Public Health [2005114]; European Commission; ICREA Funding Source: Custom,EUPORIAS project - European Commission(European Commission); EU Community Action Programme for Public Health; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); ICREA(ICREA),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the EUPORIAS project (grant agreement No. 308291) funded by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Research Programme.

Remote sensing data-based classification approaches are the key to large-scale mapping and monitoring of LCZs. The potential of deep learning-based approaches is not yet fully explored, even though advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to push the frontiers for various computer vision tasks. One reason is that published studies are based on different datasets, usually at a regional scale, which makes it impossible to fairly and consistently compare the potential of different CNNs for real-world scenarios. This article is based on the big So2Sat LCZ42 benchmark dataset dedicated to LCZ classification. Using this dataset, we studied a range of CNNs of varying sizes. In addition, we proposed a CNN to classify LCZs from Sentinel-2 images, Sen2LCZ-Net. Using this base network, we propose fusing multilevel features using the extended Sen2LCZ-Net-MF. With this proposed simple network architecture, and the highly competitive benchmark dataset, we obtain results that are better than those obtained by the state-of-the-art CNNs, while requiring less computation with fewer layers and parameters. Large-scale LCZ classification examples of completely unseen areas are presented, demonstrating the potential of our proposed Sen2LCZ-Net-MF as well as the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset. We also intensively investigated the influence of network depth and width, and the effectiveness of the design choices made for Sen2LCZ-Net-MF. This article will provide important baselines for future CNN-based algorithm developments for both LCZ classification and other urban land cover land use classification.

The analysis compares results of experiments where atmospheric CO2 increases by 1%/ yr, performed with the two versions of this model. The AMOC is reduced by 47% when the melting of land-ice is considered, and represents an extreme melting scenario. This reduction is of 21% without this melting. It is shown that this difference in AMOC impacts the northern hemisphere mostly through the sea-ice cover feedback.","Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Swingedouw, D (corresponding author), Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",didier.swingedouw@cea.fr,"Marti, Olivier/B-2378-2009; Swingedouw, Didier/M-5471-2019; Swingedouw, Didier/D-1408-2010","Marti, Olivier/0000-0002-8246-5578; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850",,,,,14,51,51,0,21,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

In this paper, land cover change trajectories of the study area over the last three decades are developed using Landsat data. Then historic land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) patterns are used to estimate, calibrate and validate key drivers of land use change. Future likelihood of land-cover/land-use for 2021 and 2031 are simulated using state-of-art image processing techniques based on the driving factors of land use change integrated with Land Change Modeler. Hypothetical scenarios of LCLUC including a) low density of new urbanization growth and open land with vegetation cover, b) normal urbanization and, c) highly development of commercial/urban land use and impervious surfaces, are constructed during the simulations. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is employed to generate total suspended sediment with the various combinations of three hypothetical scenarios mentioned above and climate change scenarios projected for 2021 and 2031. The future climate patterns for the periods of 2011-2021 and 2021-2031 are generated from the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Spatial Report for scenarios A1B, B1, and A2. A total of 19 SWAT models are generated, one for 2011, nine for 2021 and 2031 respectively. The results are then used to compare and identify the impacts of combined land use and climate change on surface water quality, to answer and confirm the hypothesis that urban sprawl developing patterns in the greater St. Louis region have significant impacts on surface water quality in specific way.","[Jordan, Y.

Based on a series of freshwater hosing/extraction experiments with the state-of-the-art Community Climate System Model version 3, we construct a global spatial fingerprint of oceanic temperature anomalies in response to AMOC changes under MIS3 boundary conditions. Highest sensitivity to AMOC changes, especially in summer, is found in northeastern North Atlantic sea surface temperature, but a characteristic temperature fingerprint is also found at subsurface levels. After testing significance of the linear sea surface temperature (SST)-AMOC regressions, the model results are combined with paleo-SST records to estimate the magnitude of millennial-scale Dansgaard-Oeschger AMOC variations during MIS3.

Moreover, it is the purpose, frequency of use and user density of these buildings that make them a special case for study. These buildings are no longer fit for their assigned purpose as they require significant energy for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer, to avoid overheating. These conditions cause significant concerns in school buildings in Cyprus and the effects of climate change exacerbates these parameters. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different retrofitting measures and their impact on the thermal comfort and the energy performance of educational premises under different climatic scenarios. For the purposes of this study, a secondary school building was selected as a representative case study of educational buildings in Cyprus and was modelled using IES-VE. Retrofit measures optimizing geometry, construction and operation were examined using a calibrated dynamic thermal simulation model in current and future climatic scenarios, to determine both their effectiveness in minimizing heating demand in the winter and overheating conditions in the summer period. Comfort conditions were assessed with reference to international standards based on adaptive thermal comfort. The study demonstrates that most educational buildings in Cyprus cannot ensure thermal comfort conditions, without the support of technical systems, neither in the present nor in anticipated future climatic conditions, thereby indicating the urgent need to take action. According to the research results, natural ventilation and insulation of the roof are considered very important in achieving this goal, as they have the potential to minimize the cooling degree hours by 96.8% and the heating degree hours by 4.3%. A combination of all passive measures and heat recovery ventilation can reduce degree hours for both heating and cooling by 51% in the current climatic conditions, and by 60% and 66.4% according to climatic projections for 2050 and 2090, respectively. The methodology for the evaluation of the thermal and energy behaviour of the educational building stock applied in this study could be a trustworthy tool for decision-making in energy retrofitting projects in Cyprus, as well as in other areas with similar climatic conditions.","[Heracleous, C.; Michael, A.; Savvides, A.] Univ Cyprus, Dept Architecture, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Hayles, C.] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Cardiff, Wales",University of Cyprus; Cardiff Metropolitan University,"Heracleous, C (corresponding author), Univ Cyprus, Dept Architecture, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",echryso@ucy.ac.cy; CSHayles@cardiffmet.ac.uk,"Heracleous, Chryso/D-2528-2015","Heracleous, Chryso/0000-0002-2177-9370","Energy & Environmental Design of Buildings Research Laboratory (E&EDB Lab), University of Cyprus","Energy & Environmental Design of Buildings Research Laboratory (E&EDB Lab), University of Cyprus","The research presented in this paper was carried out within the framework of Doctoral Studies in Architecture and was supported by the Energy & Environmental Design of Buildings Research Laboratory (E&EDB Lab) , University of Cyprus.

This study investigated the feasibility of the utilization of PCMs through numerical simulations in residential buildings located in different Iranian climates in Tehran, Tabriz, Yazd, and Bandar Abbas. In so doing, the optimal PCM for each city was selected based on its impact on annual energy consumption, and then its effects on the indoor temperature and thermal load of the model in the hottest and coldest months of the year were examined. The results showed that the use of PCMs does not lead to significant energy conservation in the hot and humid climate of Bandar Abbas compared with other climates. In the second part of the study, the economic feasibility of PCMs and the payback period of such investment were investigated based on the current local electricity and natural gas prices. It was found that although the use of PCMs leads to significant energy conservation in most of these climates, with the current prices of energy and PCMs in Iran, the use of these materials will not be cost-effective, as the return periods for such investment in Tehran, Tabriz, Yazd, and Bandar Abbas will be 42, 179, 102, and 114 years, respectively.

The results show that the TAS trends are significantly affected by 1-2 K century-1, which under 1.5 degrees C global warming translates into a non-negligible impact of up to 1 K in the regional projections of TAS, similarly affecting projections for maximum and minimum temperatures. In some cases, these differences involve a doubling signal, laying further claim to careful reconsideration of the RCM setups with regard to the inclusion of GHG concentrations as an evolving external forcing which, for the sake of research reproducibility and reliability, should be clearly documented in the literature.","[Jerez, S.; Lopez-Romero, J.

The seasonal climate retrospective forecasts [the Florida Climate Institute-Florida State University Seasonal Hindcasts at 50-km resolution (FISH50)] is initialized in June and integrated through November of each year from 1982 through 2001. Each seasonal climate forecast has six ensemble members. An earlier study showed that FISH50 represents state-of-the-art seasonal climate prediction skill for the summer and fall seasons, especially in the subtropical and higher latitudes. The retrospective prediction of streamflow is based on multiple calibrated rainfall-runoff models. The hydrological models are forced with rainfall from FISH50, (quantile based) bias-corrected FISH50 rainfall (FISH50_BC), and resampled historical rainfall observations based on matching observed analogs of forecasted quartile seasonal rainfall anomalies (FISH50_Resamp). The results show that direct use of output from the climate model (FISH50) results in huge biases in predicted streamflow, which is significantly reduced with bias correction (FISH50_BC) or by FISH50_Resamp. On a discouraging note, the authors find that the deterministic skill of retrospective streamflow prediction as measured by the normalized root-mean-square error is poor compared to the climatological forecast irrespective of how FISH50 (e. g., FISH50_BC, FISH50_Resamp) is used to force the hydrological models. However, our analysis of probabilistic skill from the same suite of retrospective prediction experiments reveals that, over the majority of the 28 watersheds in the SEUS, significantly higher probabilistic skill than climatological forecast of streamflow can be harvested for the wet/dry seasonal anomalies (i.e., extreme quartiles) using FISH50_Resamp as the forcing. The authors contend that, given the nature of the relatively low climate predictability over the SEUS, high deterministic hydrological prediction skills will be elusive. Therefore, probabilistic hydrological prediction for the SEUS watersheds is very appealing, especially with the current capability of generating a comparatively huge ensemble of seasonal hydrological predictions for each watershed and for each season, which offers a robust estimate of associated forecast uncertainty.","[Bastola, Satish; Misra, Vasubandhu; Li, Haiqin] Florida State Univ, COAPS, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Misra, Vasubandhu] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Misra, Vasubandhu] Florida State Univ, Florida Climate Inst, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Bastola, S (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, COAPS, 2035 E Paul Dirac Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA.",sbastola@fsu.edu,,,"NOAA [NA12OAR4310078, NA10OAR4310215, NA11OAR4310110]; USGS [06HQGR0125]; USDA [027865]",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USGS(United States Geological Survey); USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This work was supported by grants from NOAA (NA12OAR4310078, NA10OAR4310215, and NA11OAR4310110), USGS (06HQGR0125), and USDA (027865).

Here I review the mechanisms put forward to explain the zonal mean mid-latitude circulation response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The mechanisms are grouped according to their thermodynamic starting point, which are thought to arise from processes independent of the zonal mean mid-latitude circulation response. There are 24 mechanisms and 8 thermodynamic starting points: (i) increased latent heat release aloft in the tropics, (ii) increased dry static stability and tropopause height outside the tropics, (iii) radiative cooling of the stratosphere, (iv) Hadley cell expansion, (v) increased specific humidity following the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, (vi) cloud radiative effect changes, (vii) turbulent surface heat flux changes, and (viii) decreased surface meridional temperature gradient. I argue progress can be made by testing the thermodynamic starting points. I review recent tests of the increased latent heat release aloft in the tropics starting point, i.e., prescribing diabatic perturbations, quantifying the transient response to an abrupt CO2 increase and imposing latitudinally dependent CO2 concentration. Finally, I provide a future outlook for improving our understanding of predicted changes in the zonal mean mid-latitude circulation.","[Shaw, Tiffany A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Shaw, TA (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tas1@uchicago.edu,,,National Science Foundation [AGS-1742944]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation),TAS acknowledges support from the National Science Foundation (AGS-1742944) and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.,,69,32,32,2,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6061,,,CURR CLIM CHANGE REP,Curr.

To write about atmospheres means evoking a specific forcefield, which is different from observing and analyzing an object from a distance. In the first part, I write about my own experience of the coastal atmosphere by looking around rather than ahead, as Tsing (2015) defined the art of noticing. Based on his paintings, on literature, and interviews, I show in the second part how a local artist, the painter Franz Radziwill, made the specific atmosphere of Dangast explicit. Finally, I follow a citizens' initiative on their way to preserve the specific atmosphere of this coastal village as an artists' place. In doing so, I provide a detailed insight into the atmospheres of democracy, which define how transitions take place and decisions are taken locally. In the conclusion, I argue that the focus on coastal atmospheres is a way to transcend the boundaries between nature and culture and to undermine the teleological argument of growth and development which more often than not shape coastal politics.","[Krauss, Werner] Univ Bremen, Artec Sustainabil Res Ctr, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Krauss, W (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Artec Sustainabil Res Ctr, Bremen, Germany.",wkrauss@uni-bremen.de,,"Krauss, Werner/0000-0002-8007-4151",ERA4CS project CoCliServ (co-development of place-based climate services for action)/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF),ERA4CS project CoCliServ (co-development of place-based climate services for action)/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was financed by the ERA4CS project CoCliServ (co-development of place-based climate services for action)/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).,,33,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1872-7859,2212-9790,,MARIT STUD,Marit.

Reducing energy consumption has become an important task for engineers because 30% of the total energy consumption is used for heating our buildings. Recycling the huge amount of industrial and agricultural by-products has also become urgent because due to their CO2 emissions, their combustion is not a state-of-the-art alternative. Besides rediscovering some long-known, nature-based insulating materials, there are also several research projects that have resulted in new products. In the last century it was relatively easy to review this product range, but nowadays there are so many kinds of nature-based thermal insulating products, there is a need for systematization, and more in-depth knowledge about them is required. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new systematization of nature-based thermal insulation materials, summarize the main knowledge about them, and indicate the direction of recent research and development.","[Bozsaky, David] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Fac Architecture Civil Engn & Transport Sci, Dept Architecture & Bldg Construct, Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Bozsaky, D (corresponding author), Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Fac Architecture Civil Engn & Transport Sci, Dept Architecture & Bldg Construct, Gyor, Hungary.",bozsaky@gmail.com,,"Bozsaky, David/0000-0002-2099-9435","project - Internationalization, initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer as instruments of intelligent specializations at Szechenyi Istvan University [EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00017]","project - Internationalization, initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer as instruments of intelligent specializations at Szechenyi Istvan University","The author would like to acknowledge the financial support of the EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00017 project - Internationalization, initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer as instruments of intelligent specializations at Szechenyi Istvan University.",,41,9,9,5,15,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",,1338-3973,,SLOVAK J CIV ENG,SLOVAK J.

Accurate measurement of rainfall is vital for water resource managers in this semiarid region. In this work, the SM2RAIN-CCI rainfall data obtained from the inversion of the microwave-based satellite soil moisture (SM) observations derived from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), and ones from three state-of-the-art rainfall products (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), and Multi-SourceWeighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP)) were evaluated against in situ rainfall observations under different bioclimatic conditions at the NEB (e.g., AMZ, Amazonia; CER, Cerrado; MAT, Mata Atlantica; and CAAT, Caatinga). Comparisons were made at daily, 5-day, and 0.25 degrees scales, during the time-span of 1998 to 2015. It was found that 5-day SM2RAIN-CCI has a reasonably good performance in terms of the correlation coefficient over the CER biome (R median: 0.75). In terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), it exhibits better performance in the CAAT biome (RMSE median: 12.57 mm). In terms of bias (B), the MSWEP, SM2RAIN-CCI, and CHIRPS datasets show the best performance in MAT (B median: -8.50%), AMZ (B median: -0.65%), and CER (B median: 0.30%), respectively. Conversely, CMORPH poorly represents the rainfall variability in all biomes, particularly in the MAT biome (R median: 0.43; B median: -67.50%). In terms of detection of rainfall events, all products show good performance (Probability of detection (POD) median > 0.90). The performance of SM2RAIN-CCI suggests that the SM2RAIN algorithm fails to estimate the amount of rainfall under very dry or very wet conditions. Overall, results highlight the feasibility of SM2RAIN-CCI in those poorly gauged regions in the semiarid region of NEB.","[Paredes-Trejo, Franklin] Univ Western Plains Ezequiel Zamora, Dept Civil Engn, San Carlos Campus 2201, Zamora, Venezuela; [Paredes-Trejo, Franklin; Alves Barbosa, Humberto] Univ Fed Alagoas, Inst Ciencias Atmosfer, LAPIS, AC Simoes Campus, BR-57072900 Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil; [Rossato Spatafora, Luciana] Univ Politecn Cataluna, IEEC UPC, Jordi Girona 1-3UPC Campus Nord,Bldg D3, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain; [Rossato Spatafora, Luciana] Univ Politecn Cataluna, SMOS Barcelona Expert Ctr, Jordi Girona 1-3UPC Campus Nord,Bldg D3, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain",Universidade Federal de Alagoas; Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya (IEEC); Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Paredes-Trejo, F (corresponding author), Univ Western Plains Ezequiel Zamora, Dept Civil Engn, San Carlos Campus 2201, Zamora, Venezuela.;Paredes-Trejo, F (corresponding author), Univ Fed Alagoas, Inst Ciencias Atmosfer, LAPIS, AC Simoes Campus, BR-57072900 Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.",franklinparedes75@gmail.com; barbosa33@gmail.com; luciana.rossato@gmail.com,"Rossato Spatafora, Luciana Rossato/AAW-4227-2021; Paredes, Franklin/A-9132-2017","Rossato Spatafora, Luciana Rossato/0000-0002-2058-2680; Paredes, Franklin/0000-0003-3356-602X",CAPES/CEMADEN/MTCI [24/2014]; PNPD-UFAL/Meteorology [26001012005P5],CAPES/CEMADEN/MTCI; PNPD-UFAL/Meteorology,This work was funded by CAPES/CEMADEN/MTCI (Grant: Edital Pro-Alertas no 24/2014 under project Analise e Previsao dos Fenomenos Hidrometeorologicos Intensos do Leste do Nordeste Brasileiro) and PNPD-UFAL/Meteorology (Grant No. 26001012005P5).,,80,18,18,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUL,2018,7,,,,,,1093,10.3390/rs10071093,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10071093,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,GO8IV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000440332500116,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objectives: Evaluate the strengths and limitations of current manufacturing processes for custom-contoured wheelchair seating to suggest potential future manufacturing processes. Study Design: Literature review of the state of the art. Methods: Research conducted through a literature review focused on the performance of different types of custom-contoured wheelchair seating products and processes over the last 40 years. Recent literature in orthotics and prosthetics was also consulted to assess future trends in seating. Results: There are five main manufacturing processes currently used to produce custom-contoured wheelchair seating systems. No single process is yet suitable for all wheelchair users, but many manufacturers are transitioning to computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling to reduce manual labour. Adjustable micro-modular seating and moulded seat insert manufacturing are also prevalent and offer alternative seating to soft foam carving. Conclusion: There is a need in the custom wheelchair seating sector for processes that are fast, cost-effective, produce little to no material waste, and that can effectively maintain a comfortable seating micro-climate. Additive manufacturing may meet these criteria, but further evaluation is required.","[Nace, Susan; Tiernan, John; Annaidh, Aisling Ni] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Mech & Mat Engn, Room 210, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Nace, Susan; Tiernan, John] Enable Ireland, SeatTech Posture & Mobil Serv, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Annaidh, AN (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Mech & Mat Engn, Room 210, Dublin 4, Ireland.",aisling.niannaidh@ucd.ie,"Ní Annaidh, Aisling/ABF-8938-2021; Nace, Susan/AAS-1888-2020","Ní Annaidh, Aisling/0000-0002-9929-4541; Nace, Susan/0000-0001-9507-6005",Irish Research Council [irc72e6e373cd8ee4981332f32b5e9773be]; Enable Ireland under the Irish Research Council's Employment Based Postgraduate Programme [irc72e6e373cd8ee4981332f32b5e9773be],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Enable Ireland under the Irish Research Council's Employment Based Postgraduate Programme",This research is supported by the Irish Research Council and Enable Ireland under the Irish Research Council's Employment Based Postgraduate Programme (Grant No.: irc72e6e373cd8ee4981332f32b5e9773be).,,50,3,3,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-3646,1746-1553,,PROSTHET ORTHOT INT,Prosthet.

In this study, we ran model simulations for 46 557 lakes across Europe to investigate the influence of this heatwave on surface water temperature. We validated the model with satellite-derived lake surface temperatures for 115 lakes from 1995 to 2018. Using the validated model, we demonstrated that, during May-October 2018, mean and maximum lake surface temperatures were 1.5 and 2.4 degrees C warmer than the base-period average (1981-2010). A lake model experiment demonstrated that, on average, the increase in air temperature was the dominant driver of surface water temperature change. However, in some lake regions, other meteorological forcing had a greater influence. Notably, higher than average solar radiation and lower than average wind speed exacerbated the influence of the heatwave on lake surface temperature in many regions, particularly Fennoscandia and Western Europe. To place our results in the context of projected 21st century climate change, we then ran the lake model with input data from state-of-the-art climate model projections under 3 emissions scenarios. Under the scenario with highest emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), we demonstrated that by the end of the 21st century, the lake surface temperatures that occurred during the heatwave of 2018 will become increasingly common across many lake regions in Europe.","[Woolway, R.

Most prominently, observations from the Northern Hemisphere's extratropics indicate an earlier occurrence of spring events. Recent climate models include land surface schemes that provide representation of the vegetation. However, they are limited in simulating the plants' response to climate change. In this study we present results of a dynamical-statistical modeling approach for phenology in southeastern Germany, combining climate change simulations provided by a high resolution, state-of-the-art regional climate model (RCM) with three different types of regression methods: ordinary least squares (OLS), least absolute deviation (LAD) and random forest (RFO). We focus on changes in the day of the year (DOY) of Forsythia suspensa flowering, the earliest phenophase of the growing season in Bavaria. Based on roughly 2600 observations, collected at 94 phenological and 26 meteorological stations between 1952 and 2013, we compare the regressions via a bootstrap, using once 13 and once 4 meteorological variables as predictors. Altogether, we find the regressions with less variables to be more robust, while the regression estimates are nearly identical. Explained variance and RMSE (root mean square error) are 54.8 % and 8.8 days for RFO and 51.2 % and 9.1 days for the other regressions. These trained and cross validated statistical models are used to estimate the effects of future climate change on the DOY by applying them to the RCM simulations. For OLS or LAD, under a low (high) greenhouse gas emission scenario, we find a mean advance of the DOY of 8 (15) days by the end of the 21th century compared to the base period from 1961 to 1990. The spatial pattern of the change resembles the topography, with the strongest trends in the DOY over mountainous regions as a consequence of a simultaneous rise in temperatures and reduction in snow depth. RFO is restricted to the range of the observations and hence the response to the simulated climate is damped, resulting in an advance of DOY of only 5 (8) days and a reduction in variance. There is no apparent spatial pattern identifiable. Altogether, we find OLS and LAD to be more suitable for dynamical-statistical modeling of phenology than RFO.","[Pollinger, Felix; Ziegler, Katrin; Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Pollinger, F (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",felix.pollinger@uni-wuerzburg.de; katrin.ziegler@stud-mail.uni-wuerzburg.de; heiko.paeth@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Pollinger, Felix/0000-0002-9519-2433",,,,,42,3,3,1,10,"UNIV BONN, GEOGRAPHISCHES INST",BONN,"MECKENHEIMER ALLEE 166, BONN, GERMANY",0014-0015,,,ERDKUNDE,Erdkunde,OCT-DEC,2017,4,,,,271,285,,10.3112/erdkunde.2017.04.01,http://dx.doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2017.04.01,,,15,"Geography; Geography, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Physical Geography,FP7YR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000417856700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used a state-of-the-art, one-dimensional, hydrodynamic-ecosystem model [General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)-framework for aquatic biogeochemical models (FABM)-PCLake] to determine the influence of extreme climate events on a temperate and temporarily summer stratified lake (Lake Bryrup, Denmark). The model was calibrated (eight years data) and validated (two years data), and the modeled variables generally showed good agreement with observations. Then, a span of extreme warming scenarios was designed based on weather data from the heatwave seen over northern Europe in May-July 2018, mimicking situations of extreme warming returning every year, every three years, and every five years in summer and all year round, respectively. We found only modest impacts of the extreme climate events on nutrient levels, which in some scenarios decreased slightly when looking at the annual mean. The most significant impacts were found for phytoplankton, where summer average chlorophyll a concentrations and cyanobacteria biomass peaks were up to 39% and 58% higher than during baseline, respectively. As a result, the phytoplankton to nutrient ratios increased during the heat wave experiments, reflecting an increased productivity and an increased cycling of nutrients in the pelagic. The phytoplankton blooms occurred up to 15 days earlier and lasted for up to half a month longer during heat wave years relative to the baseline. Our extreme scenarios illustrated and quantified the large impacts of a past heat wave (observed 2018) and may be indicative of the future for many temperate lakes.","[Chen, Weiyu] Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Chen, Weiyu; Nielsen, Anders; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann; Hu, Fenjuan; Chou, Qingchuan; Sondergaard, Martin; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsvej 25, DK-25 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chou, Qingchuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Chou, Qingchuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Hohai University; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Chen, WY (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.;Chen, WY (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsvej 25, DK-25 Silkeborg, Denmark.",weiyuchen92@hotmail.com; an@bios.au.dk; tka@bios.au.dk; fenjuan@bios.au.dk; chouqc@ihb.ac.cn; ms@bios.au.dk; ej@bios.au.dk; trolle@bios.au.dk,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012","Søndergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100",China Scholarship Council [201706710085]; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research; CASHFISH project - Danish Council for Independent Research; WATExR project through the EU JPI Climate initiative; PROGNOS project through the EU JPI Water initiative; Danish EPA,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research; CASHFISH project - Danish Council for Independent Research; WATExR project through the EU JPI Climate initiative; PROGNOS project through the EU JPI Water initiative; Danish EPA,"This work was partly supported by a scholarship awarded toW.Y.

Very good agreement between the MSU and channel 2 weighted ECMWF anomalies is found over most of the globe with correlation coefficients over 0.9, but the agreement falls off over the tropics, the South Atlantic, and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The ECMWF analyses agree best with the MSU data in regions of good radiosonde coverage, while lower correlations are found in regions where the analyses depend more heavily on satellite data. Systematic errors introduced into the analyses by the retrieval techniques applied to the radiance data largely explain this apparent contradiction. Additionally, changes to the analysis-forecast system at ECMWF over the decade appear as apparent changes in climate, and these discontinuities most strongly affect the tropics and are evident in regions of fewer observations. To the extent that the weighted ECMWF data agree with the MSU brightness temperatures the vertical dependence of the MSU data can be examined. Correlations of the MSU data with ECMWF temperature anomalies at individual pressure levels are highest at 300 mb over the globe, a level apparently least affected by the frequent changes and improvements at ECMWF. Over regions of good data coverage, such as the Northern Hemisphere landmasses and Australia, the MSU anomalies correlate very highly with all levels of the troposphere up to 200 mb. Thus, the MSUs appear to be an extremely useful tool for measuring global tropospheric temperature fluctuations on a monthly and longer time scale. Problems in the ECMWF temperature record since 1982 are examined in detail for the tropics. In September 1982 the introduction of diabatic nonlinear normal-mode initialization resulted in significant temperature increases in the tropical middle troposphere, especially at 500 mb. In May 1985 tropical temperatures at 700 mb (850 mb) increased (decreased) after the implementation of the T106 spectral model with major accompanying changes to physical parameterizations. Tropical temperatures near the tropopause decreased substantially after the May 1986 enhancement of the vertical resolution of the model from 16 to 19 levels with 3 new stratospheric levels. Problems at 1000 mb are present throughout the 96-month study period and are directly related to the manner in which analyzed temperatures are obtained at ECMWF. Comparisons with temperatures obtained from radiosonde stations in the tropics show that the ECMWF analyses have clearly improved with time, especially after May 1985 after which the 1000-200-mb temperatures show much greater coherence. These results show the importance of realizing the inherent problems with operationally based gridded datasets, and they strongly support the need for reanalysis of all data using a state-of-the-art four-dimensional data assimilation system.","NATL CTR ATMOSPHER RES,POB 3000,BOULDER,CO 80307",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,,,"Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012","Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000; Hurrell, James Wilson/0000-0002-3169-6384",,,,,28,28,28,1,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Recent findings State-of-the-art climate model simulations suggest that the global ocean becomes the dominant term the planetary heat budget on annual and longer timescales. Therefore, we expect to see a close correspondence between year-to-year variations in ocean heating rates and satellite measurements of ERB. Recent comparisons of satellite ERB time series and ocean heating rates show a marked improvement over earlier studies in terms of consistency and specification of uncertainties. Contemporary research has also emphasised the utility of these independent data sets for cross validation of the climate record and their fundamental importance for monitoring the rate of climate change. Summary Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have brought about an imbalance in Earth's radiation budget that is driving global climate change. Our primary means for monitoring this energy imbalance is via direct satellite measurements of ERB and through estimates of global ocean heat content (OHC) change. CERES satellite measurements of ERB offer high spatiotemporal resolution and uncertainties on annual time series of order 0.1 Wm(-2) but cannot provide absolute monitoring of Earth's energy imbalance due to limitations in sensor calibration. The Argo array of autonomous profiling floats has revolutionised the ocean observing system and our ability to estimate absolute ocean heating rates with current uncertainties estimated to be 0.5/0.1 Wm(-2) on annual/decadal timescales. These ocean observations are essential to anchor the time series of ERB and can be used to mitigate satellite sensor drifts. Sustaining these highly complementary elements of the climate observing system is essential for improved understanding of climate variability and change. Improvements in satellite sensor calibration, estimates of total solar irradiance andmore comprehensive sampling of the global oceans (e.g. Deep Argo) are key aspects to reducing uncertainties in future observations of Earth's energy imbalance.","[Palmer, Matthew D.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Palmer, MD (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England.",matthew.palmer@metoffice.gov.uk,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Palmer, Matthew/0000-0001-7422-198X",Joint UK BEIS/DefraMet Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; Natural Environment Research Council DEEP-C project [NE/K005480/1]; NERC [NE/K005480/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K005480/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Joint UK BEIS/DefraMet Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; Natural Environment Research Council DEEP-C project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),I am grateful to two anonymous reviewers who provided constructive comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

Here, state-of-the-art methods on hydraulic and statistical modelling are applied to historical and contemporaneous flood records to evaluate flood hazards beyond natural climate cycles. A comprehensive flood record of the Duero River in Zamora (Spain) was compiled from documentary sources, early water-level readings and continuous gauge records spanning the last 500 years. Documentary evidence of flood events includes minute books (municipal and ecclesiastic), narrative descriptions, epigraphic marks, newspapers and technical reports. We identified 69 flood events over the period 1250 to 1871, of which 15 were classified as catastrophic floods, 16 as extraordinary floods and 38 as ordinary floods. Subsequently, a two-dimensional hydraulic model was implemented to relate flood stages (flood marks and inundated areas) to discharges. The historical flood records show the largest floods over the last 500 years occurred in 1860 (3450m(3) s(-1)), 1597 (3200m(3) s (-1)) and 1739 (2700m(3) s (-1)). Moreover, at least 24 floods exceeded the perception threshold of 1900m(3) s (-1) during the period (1500-1871). Annual maximum flood records were completed with gauged water-level readings (pre-instrumental dataset, PRE: 1872-1919) and systematic gauge records (systematic dataset, SYS: 1920-2018). The flood frequency analyses were based on (1) the expected moments algorithm (EMA) and (2) the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) method, using five datasets with different temporal frameworks (historic dataset, HISTO: 1511-2018; PRE-SYS: 1872-2018; full systematic record, ALLSYS: 1920-2018; SYS1: 1920-1969; and SYS2: 1970-2018). The most consistent results were obtained using the HISTO dataset, even for high quantiles (0.001% annual exceedance probability, AEP). PRE-SYS was robust for the 1% AEP flood with increasing uncertainty in the 0.2% AEP or 500-year flood, and ALLSYS results were uncertain in the 1% and 0.2% AEP floods. Since the 1970s, the frequency of extraordinary floods (>1900m(3) s(-1)) declined, although floods on the range of the historical perception threshold occurred in 2001 (2075m(3) s(-1)) and 2013 (1654m(3) s (-1)). Even if the future remains uncertain, this bottom-up approach addresses flood hazards under climate variability, providing real and certain flood discharges. Our results can provide a guide on low-regret adaptation decisions and improve public perception of extreme flooding.","[Benito, Gerardo; Machado, Maria] MNCN CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci, C Serrano 115bis, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Castillo, Olegario] Univ Cadiz, Dept Ingn Ind & Ingn Civil, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Algeciras, Cadiz 11202, Spain; [Ballesteros-Canovas, Juan A.] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Barriendos, Mariano] Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist & Arqueol, Montalegre 6, Barcelona 08001, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cadiz; University of Geneva; University of Barcelona,"Benito, G (corresponding author), MNCN CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci, C Serrano 115bis, Madrid 28006, Spain.",benito@mncn.csic.es,"Benito, Gerardo/E-5456-2013; Benito, Gerardo/AAK-4763-2020","Benito, Gerardo/0000-0003-0724-1790; Benito, Gerardo/0000-0003-0724-1790; Ballesteros Canovas, Juan A./0000-0003-4439-397X; Castillo Lopez, Olegario/0000-0001-6020-103X","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [CGL2017-86839-C3-1-R]; Fundacion Biodiversidad [PRCV00446]","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades; Fundacion Biodiversidad(European Commission)","This research has been supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades (grant no.

The decadal climate prediction experiments (DPEs) by predicting near-term climate with initialized global climate models (GCMs) provide robust skill at predicting sea surface temperature variability in some ocean regions as the North Atlantic. However, the state-of-the-art DPEs, which reproduce the observed warming trend associated with forced climate change, fail at predicting land surface air temperature (SAT) interdecadal variability. Here, we develop an effective statistical-dynamical model to predict spatial and temporal evolutions in Northern-Hemisphere (NH) summer land SAT. We identify two dominant interdecadal variability modes of the NH summer land SAT, whose evolutions are synchronized with forced climate change and Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), respectively. Based on statistical relationships with physical interpretations, time series of the forced responses and the AMV skillfully predicted by GCMs, the land SAT over the past one hundred years is predicted retrospectively with significantly improved skill compared to that predicted by the DPEs. Our results indicate that the decadal variability of the NH land SAT is predictable, with predictability rooted in atmospheric interdecadal circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) forced by the AMV. More skillful NH climate prediction by DPEs, which would be more practical for stakeholders and decision-makers, can be achieved by improving interdecadal CGT simulations in GCMs.","[Wu, Bo; Zhou, Tianjun; Lin, Jianshe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Bo] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, China Meteorol Adm, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chao; Mueller, Wolfgang A.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Mueller, Wolfgang A.] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Hamburg, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Max Planck Society","Wu, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wu, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, China Meteorol Adm, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wubo@mail.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Li, Chao/L-1915-2015; Wu, Bo/C-8644-2009","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Li, Chao/0000-0003-2556-0891; Wu, Bo/0000-0002-9099-3725","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606301]; NSFC [41675089, 41661144009]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change",National Key Research and Development Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,"We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that helped greatly to improve the original manuscript.

However, our understanding on its magnitude, global pattern, and climatic drivers remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated global mean annual LUE during 1980-2013 based on state-of-the-art estimates from scaled-up eddy covariance measurements (data-driven models) and 10 process-based models used in Global Carbon Project. We found comparable global LUE estimates from data-driven models (0.90 +/- 0.25 g C MJ(-1)) and process-based models (0.73 +/- 0.22 g C MJ(-1)), with individual model estimates ranging from 0.49 to 0.98 g C MJ(-1). While both types of models agreed on highest LUE over the tropical evergreen forests, discrepancies remained over middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which probably resulted from different response of LUE to climatic factors. Spatial analyses revealed that LUE variations were more driven by temperature and precipitation than by solar radiation. While the response of LUE to precipitation was almost always positive globally, the response of LUE to temperature was only positive in part of the nontropical regions. Process-based models showed that precipitation strongly regulated the response of LUE to temperature, which shifted from negative to positive when mean annual precipitation was larger than 1,000 mm yr(-1). Our results provide converging global LUE estimates and highlight the need to take fully account of interactive effects of climatic factors in regulating LUE and thus the response of photosynthesis to climate change.","[Tang, Shuchang; Wang, Xuhui; He, Mingzhu; Huang, Ling; Zhang, Yuan; Yang, Hui; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Wang, XH (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xuhui.wang@pku.edu.cn,"He, Mingzhu/GOG-9562-2022; wang, xuhui/H-8605-2019","He, Mingzhu/0000-0003-0099-5899; wang, xuhui/0000-0003-0818-9816; Tang, Shuchang/0000-0001-9979-9358",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41861134036]; Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20050101],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41861134036) and Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant XDA20050101).,,87,1,1,4,47,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-8953,2169-8961,,J GEOPHYS RES-BIOGEO,J.

It also regulates the rate of global temperature rise in response to rising GHGs(4). The tropical Pacific Ocean response to rising GHGs impacts all of the world's population. State-of-the-art climate models predict that rising GHGs reduce the west-to-east warm-to-cool sea surface temperature gradient across the equatorial Pacific(5). In nature, however, the gradient has strengthened in recent decades as GHG concentrations have risen sharply(5). This stark discrepancy between models and observations has troubled the climate research community for two decades. Here, by returning to the fundamental dynamics and thermodynamics of the tropical ocean-atmosphere system, and avoiding sources of model bias, we show that a parsimonious formulation of tropical Pacific dynamics yields a response that is consistent with observations and attributable to rising GHGs. We use the same dynamics to show that the erroneous warming in state-of-the-art models is a consequence of the cold bias of their equatorial cold tongues. The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change in the many regions sensitive to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures.","[Seager, Richard; Cane, Mark; Henderson, Naomi; Lee, Dong-Eun; Abernathey, Ryan; Zhang, Honghai] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University,"Seager, R (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",seager@ldeo.columbia.edu,,"Cane, Mark/0000-0001-5408-2388; Zhang, Honghai/0000-0001-6838-4950; Henderson, Naomi/0000-0002-9531-2159; Abernathey, Ryan/0000-0001-5999-4917; Lee, dong eun/0000-0001-8546-563X; Seager, Richard/0000-0003-4772-9707",NSF [OCE 1657209]; World Surf League P.U.R.E. through Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); World Surf League P.U.R.E. through Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life,"This work was supported by NSF award OCE 1657209 and a grant from World Surf League P.U.R.E. through Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life.

However, the interaction between the Arctic and midlatitude circulation involves a complex chain of mechanisms, which leaves state-of-the-art general circulation models unable to represent this interaction unambiguously. This study uses an idealized general circulation model to provide a process-based understanding of the sensitivity of the midlatitude circulation to the location of high-latitude warming. A simplified atmosphere is simulated with a single zonally localized midlatitude storm track, which is analogous to the storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere. It is found that even small changes in the position of the forcing relative to that storm track can lead to very different responses in the midlatitude circulation. More specifically, it is found that heating concentrated in one region may cause a substantially stronger global response compared to when the same amount of heating is distributed across all longitudes at the same latitude. Linear interference between climatological and anomalous flow is an important component of the response, but it does not explain differences between different longitudes of the forcing. Feedbacks from atmospheric transient eddies are found to be associated with this strong response. A dependence between the climatological jet latitude and the jet response to polar surface heating is found. These results can be used to design and interpret experiments with complex state-of-the-art models targeted at Arctic-midlatitude interactions.","[Ruggieri, Paolo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy; [Kucharski, Fred] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Novak, Lenka] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); California Institute of Technology,"Ruggieri, P (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy.",paolo.ruggieri@cmcc.it,"Ruggieri, Paolo/X-6334-2018","Ruggieri, Paolo/0000-0003-1996-7206",Blue-Action project (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme) [727852]; U.K. Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M014932/1]; NERC [NE/M014932/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Blue-Action project (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme); U.K. Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors are thankful to three anonymous reviewers for very helpful and insightful comments.

Data sets based on numerical atmospheric modeling, such as reanalysis data sets, represent an alternative source of information, but they often suffer from inaccuracies, e.g., due to insufficient spatial resolution. sDoG (statistical Downscaling for Glacierized mountain environments) is a reanalysis data postprocessing tool designed to extend short-term weather station data from high mountain sites to the baseline climate. In this study, sDoG is applied to ERA-Interim predictors to produce a retrospective forecast of daily air temperature at the Vernagtbach climate monitoring site (2640 MSL) in the Central European Alps. First, sDoG is trained and cross-validated using observations from 2002 to 2012 (cross-validation period). Then, the sDoG retrospective forecast and its cross-validation-based uncertainty estimates are evaluated for the period 1979-2001 (hereafter referred to as the true evaluation period). We demonstrate the ability of sDoG to model air temperature in the true evaluation period for different temporal scales: day-to-day variations, year-to-year and season-to-season variations, and the 23-year mean seasonal cycle. sDoG adds significant value over a selection of reference data sets available for the site at different spatial resolutions, including state-of-the-art global and regional reanalysis data sets, output by a regional climate model, and an observation-based gridded product. However, we identify limitations of sDoG in modeling summer air temperature variations particularly evident in the first part of the true evaluation period. This is most probably related to changes of the microclimate around the Vernagtbach climate monitoring site that violate the stationarity assumption underlying sDoG. When comparing the performance of the considered reference data sets, we cannot demonstrate added value of the higher resolution data sets over the data sets with lower spatial resolution. For example, the global reanalyses ERA5 (31 km resolution) and ERA-Interim (80 km resolution) both clearly outperform the higher resolution data sets ERA5-Land (9 km resolution), UERRA HARMONIE (11 km resolution), and UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX (5.5 km resolution). Performance differences among ERA5 and ERA-Interim, by contrast, are comparably small. Our study highlights the importance of station-scale uncertainty assessments of atmospheric numerical model output and downscaling products for high mountain areas both for data users and model developers.","[Hofer, Marlis; Horak, Johannes] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Hofer, M (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Marlis.Hofer@uibk.ac.at; Johannes.Horak@uibk.ac.at,,"Horak, Johannes/0000-0001-9992-3013",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P280060],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),Open Access Funding by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (P280060).,,50,0,0,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,NOV,2020,11,,,,,,1256,10.3390/atmos11111256,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11111256,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OX5QK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000593618800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous modelling studies have generally concluded that the biogeophysical effects of historical deforestation led to an annual mean cooling in the northern mid-latitudes(3,4), in line with the albedo-induced negative radiative forcing from land-cover changes since pre-industrial time reported in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report(5). However, further observational and modelling studies have highlighted strong seasonal and diurnal contrasts in the temperature response to deforestation(6-10). Here, we show that historical deforestation has led to a substantial local warming of hot days over the northern mid-latitudes-a finding that contrasts with most previous model results(11,12). Based on observation-constrained state-of-the-art climate-model experiments, we estimate that moderate reductions in tree cover in these regions have contributed at least one-third of the local present-day warming of the hottest day of the year since pre-industrial time, and were responsible for most of this warming before 1980. These results emphasize that landcover changes need to be considered when studying past and future changes in heat extremes, and highlight a potentially overlooked co-benefit of forest-based carbon mitigation through local biogeophysical mechanisms.","[Lejeune, Quentin; Davin, Edouard L.; Gudmundsson, Lukas; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Winckler, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Lejeune, Quentin] Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Max Planck Society,"Lejeune, Q (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Lejeune, Q (corresponding author), Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany.",quentin.lejeune@climateanalytics.org,"Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Gudmundsson, Lukas/I-9535-2014","Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Gudmundsson, Lukas/0000-0003-3539-8621; Lejeune, Quentin/0000-0001-9152-3197","European Union [282672, 641816, 607085]; ERC DROUGHT-HEAT [617518]; German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program",European Union(European Commission); ERC DROUGHT-HEAT; German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We acknowledge partial support from the European Union through the projects FP7 EMBRACE (grant agreement 282672), H2020 CRESCENDO (grant agreement 641816), FP7 EUCLEIA (grant agreement 607085) and ERC DROUGHT-HEAT (contract 617518), as well as from the German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program.

Two inter-annual global and individual climate signals dominate: i.e., ENSO and quasi-biennial (QB). Moreover, significant correlations are found between three known equatorial SST indices (i.e., IO1 in Indian Ocean, NINO3 in Pacific Ocean, and ATL2 in Atlantic Ocean), and SST time-series obtained by summing-up only global lead-frequency signals identified here: i.e., 0.74, 0.82, and 0.56 respectively.

These writings emphasise Trajkovic's constant urging for a fairer (from his point of view) evaluation of Serbian art music in a wider, European and global context, but also within the state / national frameworks. Trajkovic aimed to prove that Serbian art music, as well as writings on music, would have enjoyed a wider recognition, had certain of their top achievements not been left forgotten and unpublished, and thus unavailable to potential researchers and performers. That is why he pleaded for the improvement of sheet music publishing in the country, as well as for the targeted promotion of Serbian art music repertoire. Moreover, he insisted on the proximity of the Belgrade 'cultural climate' in the interwar period with the artistic and scholarly tendencies in France and its 'zones of influence' in the same period. Consequently, Trajkovic particularly insists on the new evaluation of the opuses of the composers and musicologists Miloje Milojevic (1884-1946) and Dragutin Gostuski (1923-1998) whom he saw as those creative and intellectual individuals who had fallen victims to the 'historical injustice' and whose (re)positioning within the Serbian music culture would increase the relevance of that same culture both in the national and international contexts.","[Jankovic-Begus, Jelena] Belgrade Festivals Ctr, Belgrade, Serbia; [Jankovic-Begus, Jelena] Univ Arts, Fac Mus, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Jankovic-Begus, J (corresponding author), Belgrade Festivals Ctr, Belgrade, Serbia.;Jankovic-Begus, J (corresponding author), Univ Arts, Fac Mus, Belgrade, Serbia.",jelenaforfree@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,0,"SERBIAN ACAD SCIENCES & ARTS, INST MUSICOLOGY-SASA",BELGRADE,"35, KNEZA MIHAILA ST, BELGRADE, SERBIA",1450-9814,2406-0976,,MUZIKOL-MUSICOL,Muzikol.-Musicol.,,2021,31,,,,95,126,,10.2298/MUZ2131095J,http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/MUZ2131095J,,,32,Music,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Music,ZS9WG,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000768808700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this large-scale behavioural experiment, we gathered data during Smart Distance Lab: The Art Fair (n=839) between August 28 and 30, 2020 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We varied walking directions (bidirectional, unidirectional, and no directions) and supplementary interventions (face mask and buzzer to alert visitors of 1.5 metres distance). We captured visitors' movements using cameras, registered their contacts (defined as within 1.5 metres) using wearable sensors, and assessed their attitudes toward COVID-19 as well as their experience during the event using questionnaires. We also registered environmental measures (e.g., humidity). In this paper, we describe this unprecedented, multi-modal experimental data set on social distancing, including psychological, behavioural, and environmental measures. The data set is available on figshare and in a MySQL database. It can be used to gain insight into (attitudes toward) behavioural interventions promoting social distancing, to calibrate pedestrian models, and to inform new studies on behavioural interventions.","[Tanis, Charlotte C.; Leach, Nina M.; Geiger, Sandra J.; Nauta, Floor H.; Dablander, Fabian; van Harreveld, Frenk; de Wit, Sanne; Borsboom, Denny; Blanken, Tessa F.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Harreveld, Frenk] Nat Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, NL-3721 MA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Kanters, Gerard; Knoppers, Jop; Markus, Diederik A.

Raters coded each lesson for the affective qualities of the classroom environment, the rigor of curricular tasks including guidelines for student work, and the quality of teacher-student verbal exchanges. We applied multiple regression techniques to explain predictive relations between classroom climate, instructional quality, and student behavior. Results indicated that the degree of respect that teachers showed students significantly predicted students' behavior toward one another. The presence of explicit rules in the classroom for respectful, prosocial behavior also significantly predicted the number of students who participated in discussions. Further, the quality of students' participation in class discussions that is, the degree to which they built on other students' contributions and explained and supported their responses-was predicted by teachers pressing students to explain their thinking in discussions and by the rigor of the questions posed to students in the discussion.","[Matsumura, Lindsay Clare] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Educ Learning Policy Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Slater, Sharon Cadman] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Learning Res & Dev, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Crosson, Amy] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Language & Literacy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Harvard University,"Matsumura, LC (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Educ Learning Policy Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,54,39,39,2,50,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-5984,,,ELEM SCHOOL J,Elem.

Populations of species can respond to changes in their environment through local genetic adaptation or plasticity, dispersal, or local extinction. The individual-based modeling (IBM) approach has been repeatedly applied to assess organismic responses to environmental changes. IBMs simulate emerging adaptive behaviors from the basic entities upon which both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms act. The objective of this review is to summarize the state of the art of eco-evolutionary IBMs and to explore to what degree they already address the key responses of organisms to environmental change. In this, we identify promising approaches and potential knowledge gaps in the implementation of eco-evolutionary mechanisms to motivate future research. Using mainly the ISI Web of Science, we reveal that most of the progress in eco-evolutionary IBMs in the last decades was achieved for genetic adaptation to novel local environmental conditions. There is, however, not a single eco-evolutionary IBM addressing the three potential adaptive responses simultaneously. Additionally, IBMs implementing adaptive phenotypic plasticity are rare. Most commonly, plasticity was implemented as random noise or reaction norms. Our review further identifies a current lack of models where plasticity is an evolving trait. Future eco-evolutionary models should consider dispersal and plasticity as evolving traits with their associated costs and benefits. Such an integrated approach could help to identify conditions promoting population persistence depending on the life history strategy of organisms and the environment they experience.","[Romero-Mujalli, Daniel; Tiedemann, Ralph] Univ Potsdam, Evolutionary Biol Systemat Zool, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Romero-Mujalli, Daniel; Jeltsch, Florian] Univ Potsdam, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",University of Potsdam; University of Potsdam,"Romero-Mujalli, D (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Evolutionary Biol Systemat Zool, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.;Romero-Mujalli, D (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",dmujalli@uni-potsdam.de; jeltsch@uni-potsdam.de; tiedeman@uni-potsdam.de,,,University of Potsdam,University of Potsdam,This work was funded by the University of Potsdam.,,110,14,15,2,42,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

ARs are responsible for many of the largest winter floods in the mid-latitudes resulting in major socioeconomic losses; for example, the loss from United Kingdom (UK) flooding in summer/winter 2012 is estimated to be about $1.6 billion in damages. Given the well-established link between ARs and peak river flows for the present day, assessing how ARs could respond under future climate projections is of importance in gauging future impacts from flooding. We show that North Atlantic ARs are projected to become stronger and more numerous in the future scenarios of multiple simulations from five state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) in the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The increased water vapour transport in projected ARs implies a greater risk of higher rainfall totals and therefore larger winter floods in Britain, with increased AR frequency leading to more flood episodes. In the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) for 2074-2099 there is an approximate doubling of AR frequency in the five GCMs. Our results suggest that the projected change in ARs is predominantly a thermodynamic response to warming resulting from anthropogenic radiative forcing.","[Lavers, David A.; Allan, Richard P.; Brayshaw, David J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Lavers, David A.; Allan, Richard P.; Lloyd-Hughes, Benjamin; Brayshaw, David J.; Wade, Andrew J.] Univ Reading, Walker Inst, Reading, Berks, England; [Allan, Richard P.; Brayshaw, David J.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Lavers, David A.; Villarini, Gabriele] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wade, Andrew J.] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading; University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Iowa; University of Reading,"Lavers, DA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",david-lavers@uiowa.edu,"Allan, Richard/B-5782-2008; Villarini, Gabriele/F-8069-2016","Allan, Richard/0000-0003-0264-9447; Villarini, Gabriele/0000-0001-9566-2370; Brayshaw, David/0000-0002-3927-4362; Wade, Andrew/0000-0002-5296-8350","UK Natural Environment Research Council under the Changing Water Cycle programme, HydEF project [NE/I00677X/1]; NERC [NE/H015841/1, NE/G015708/1, NE/I00677X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009, NE/G015708/1, NE/I00677X/1, NE/H015841/1] Funding Source: researchfish","UK Natural Environment Research Council under the Changing Water Cycle programme, HydEF project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council under the Changing Water Cycle programme, HydEF project (NE/I00677X/1).

Development of such strategies is, however, a challenge. Climate change alone is a significant complication, but, in addition, complexities exist trying to identify the most appropriate set of mitigation measures, or interventions. There are a range of economic and environmental performance measures that require consideration, and the spatial and temporal aspects of evaluating the performance of these is complex. All these elements pose severe difficulties to decisionmakers. This article describes a decision support methodology that has the capability to assess the most appropriate set of interventions to make in a flood system and the opportune time to make these interventions, given the future uncertainties. The flood risk strategies have been explicitly designed to allow for flexible adaptive measures by capturing the concepts of real options and multiobjective optimization to evaluate potential flood risk management opportunities. A state-of-the-art flood risk analysis tool is employed to evaluate the risk associated to each strategy over future points in time and a multiobjective genetic algorithm is utilized to search for the optimal adaptive strategies.

By law, part of the coastal defence system has to withstand a water level that on average occurs only once every 10 000 years. The question then arises whether and how climate change affects the heights of extreme storm surges. Published research points to only small changes. However, due to the limited amount of data available results are usually limited to relatively frequent extremes like the annual 99%-ile. We here report on results from a 17-member ensemble of North Sea water levels spaning the period 1950-2100. It was created by forcing a surge model of the North Sea with meteorological output from a state-of-the-art global climate model which has been driven by greenhouse gas emissions following the SRES A1b scenario. The large ensemble size enables us to calculate 10 000 year return water levels with a low statistical uncertainty. In the one model used in this study, we find no statistically significant change in the 10 000 year return values of surge heights along the Dutch during the 21st century. Also a higher sea level resulting from global warming does not impact the height of the storm surges. As a side effect of our simulations we also obtain results on the interplay between surge and tide.","[Sterl, A.; van den Brink, H.; de Vries, H.; Haarsma, R.; van Meijgaard, E.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, KNMI, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Sterl, A (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, KNMI, POB 201, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands.",sterl@knmi.nl,"Sterl, Andreas/AAE-7174-2020; Haarsma, Reindert/D-1803-2013","Sterl, Andreas/0000-0003-3457-0434; Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687","Dutch Delta Committee; Ralf Weisse (GKSS, Germany); Delta Committee; DEISA,; HLRS; SARA; NCF [NRG-2006.06, CAVE-06-023, SG-06-267]; DEISA Consortium [508830/031513]","Dutch Delta Committee; Ralf Weisse (GKSS, Germany); Delta Committee; DEISA,; HLRS; SARA; NCF; DEISA Consortium","This work was initiated and partly funded by the Dutch Delta Committee (Commissie Veerman).

A number of hypotheses have been proposed, revolving around deficiencies in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere energy exchange, poorly resolved low-level boundary-layer clouds or misrepresentations of deep-convective storms. A common approach to evaluating model biases focuses on the model-mean state. However, this makes difficult an unambiguous interpretation of the origins of a bias, given that biases are the result of the superposition of impacts of clouds and land-surface deficiencies over multiple time steps. This article presents a new methodology to objectively detect the role of clouds in the creation of a surface warm bias. A unique feature of this study is its focus on temperature-error growth at the time-step level. It is shown that compositing the temperature-error growth by the coinciding bias in total downwelling radiation provides unambiguous evidence for the role that clouds play in the creation of the surface warm bias during certain portions of the day. Furthermore, the application of an objective cloud-regime classification allows for the detection of the specific cloud regimes that matter most for the creation of the bias. We applied this method to two state-of-the-art GCMs that exhibit a distinct warm bias over the Southern Great Plains of the USA. Our analysis highlights that, in one GCM, biases in deep-convective and low-level clouds contribute most to the temperature-error growth in the afternoon and evening respectively. In the second GCM, deep clouds persist too long in the evening, leading to a growth of the temperature bias. The reduction of the temperature bias in both models in the morning and the growth of the bias in the second GCM in the afternoon could not be assigned to a cloud issue, but are more likely caused by a land-surface deficiency.","[Van Weverberg, Kwinten; Morcrette, Cyril J.; Petch, Jon C.] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Ma, Hsi-Yen; Klein, Stephen A.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA",Met Office - UK; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Van Weverberg, K (corresponding author), Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",kwinten.vanweverberg@metoffice.gov.uk,"Ma, Hsi-Yen/K-1019-2013; Van Weverberg, Kwinten/GVU-5063-2022; Van Weverberg, Kwinten/AAJ-6939-2021; Klein, Stephen A/H-4337-2016; Morcrette, Cyril J/H-7282-2012","Van Weverberg, Kwinten/0000-0002-5397-7320; Klein, Stephen A/0000-0002-5476-858X; Morcrette, Cyril J/0000-0002-4240-8472; Ma, Hsi-Yen/0000-0002-9628-1278; Petch, Jon/0000-0003-1476-5103",Regional and Global Climate Modeling and Atmospheric System Research programs of the US Department of Energy as part of the Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed; US Department of Energy by LLNL [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Office of Biological and Environmental Research,Regional and Global Climate Modeling and Atmospheric System Research programs of the US Department of Energy as part of the Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed; US Department of Energy by LLNL(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Biological and Environmental Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"The authors thank Richard Forbes, Maike Ahlgrimm and Shaocheng Xie for the stimulating discussions about the methodology.

The regime of the excessive ITCZ but negative SST bias is inconsistent with the common positive rainfall-SST correlation of climate anomalies over the tropics. Using a two-mode model, we decomposed the rainfall bias into two components and found that the surface convergence (SC) bias is the key factor forming the excessive ITCZ bias in the historical runs of 25 CMIP5 models and 23 CMIP6 models. A mixed layer model was further applied to connect the formation of the SC bias with the SST pattern bias. The results suggest that the meridional pattern of the SST bias plays a key role in forming the SC bias. In the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, the overall negative SST bias has two apparent meridional troughs at around 10 degrees S and 10 degrees N, respectively. The two meridional troughs in the SST bias drive two convergence centers in the SC bias favoring the excessive ITCZ, even though the local SST bias is negative.","[Zhou, Shijie; Huang, Gang; Huang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shijie; Huang, Gang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang; Huang, Ping] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, P (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.",huangping@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0606703]; Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Science [COMS2019QXX]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975116, 41722504, 41831175, 91937302, 41721004]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2016074]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","National Key R&D Program of China; Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Science; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant 2019YFA0606703), the Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Science (COMS2019QXX), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41975116, 41722504, 41831175, 91937302, and 41721004), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2016074), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

The warm bias develops within 1 or 2 months in decadal experiments initialised in January using an observationally derived state. To better quantify the role of the atmospheric biases in initiating this warm SST bias, several sensitivity experiments have been performed. In a first set of experiments, the surface solar net heat flux sent to the ocean model is academically corrected over the southeastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. This correction locally reduces the warm SST bias by more than 50 % with some remote impacts over equatorial regions. In contrast, the solar heat flux correction has locally little impact on the spring cooling. A second set of experiments quantifies the role of surface winds, using a nudging technique. When applied in a narrow equatorial region, the wind correction mainly improves the SST annual cycle amplitude along the Equator. It promotes not only the spring cooling along the Equator in preconditioning the mixed-layer depth but also in the southeastern Atlantic along the African coast. These local and remote effects are attributed to the more realistic representation of the oceanic equatorial circulation, driven by corrected winds. These results are consistent with those reported by Wahl et al. (Clim Dyn 36:891-906, 2011) in a very similar study with the Kiel Climate Model. The solar and wind biases have comparable effects in their study, although the importance of off-equatorial winds is less clear in our study. Diagnosing the wind energy flux provides a physical understanding of the equatorial region. When combining the corrections of both the equatorial wind and the southeastern solar heat flux, no obvious feedback between them is evidenced. The present study also emphasizes the need to consider two time-scales, the annual mean and the seasonal cycle, as well as two regions, the equatorial and the southeastern Atlantic regions, to comprehensively address the Atlantic SST bias. As pointed out in Richter (Clim Dyn, doi: 10.1007/s00382-012-1624-5, 2013), the need to improve the atmospheric component of the CNRM-CM model is emphasized, even though strong positive coupling feedbacks are highlighted.","[Voldoire, A.; Claudon, M.; Caniaux, G.; Giordani, H.; Roehrig, R.] Meteo France CNRS, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Voldoire, A (corresponding author), Meteo France CNRS, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France.",aurore.voldoire@meteo.fr,,"Marti, Olivier/0000-0002-8246-5578",NOAA Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program,NOAA Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program,The authors wish to thank C.

In this paper, the sensitivity of forest models to different steady-state climate scenarios, to different process formulations and to different assumptions on the transient behaviour of climate is studied. The effects of 3 scenarios of climatic change and the behaviour of 5 forest gap models of the FORECE/FORCLIM family are compared at sites along an elevational gradient in the European Alps. A wide variety of species compositions may be obtained al a given site depending on the scenario of future climate. At some sites all future forests differ radically from today's forest, suggesting that these current forests are highly sensitive to climatic change. At some sites, the results of the 5 forest models differ strongly with respect to species composition and carbon storage when subjected to the same climate scenario, showing that the models need to be improved in order to arrive at reliable and robust parameterizations of abiotic and biotic influences in forest models. When comparing the effects of step, Linear, and sigmoid changes of the mean climatic parameters over 100 yr, it becomes evident that the type of change modelled is not crucial because the climatic change proceeds fast compared to the successional dynamics. It is concluded that simulations of the possible effects of climatic change on forests should be considered as sensitivity tests, not as predictions. Given the current uncertainties in atmospheric sciences (climate predictions) and in ecology (modelling of long-term forest dynamics), the most promising research strategy is to compare the effects of several climate scenarios and the projections of several forest models to arrive at slate-of-the-art ecological impact assessments.","SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST TERR ECOL, CH-8952 SCHLIEREN, SWITZERLAND",,,,"Bugmann, Harald/A-1252-2008","Bugmann, Harald/0000-0003-4233-0094",,,,,35,49,49,1,16,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,,,CLIM RES,Clim.

It has been postulated that climate warming may pose the greatest threat species in the tropics, where ectotherms have evolved more thermal specialist physiologies. Although species could rapidly respond to environmental change through adaptation, little is known about the potential for thermal adaptation, especially in tropical species. 2. In the light of the limited empirical evidence available and predictions from mutation-selection theory, we might expect tropical ectotherms to have limited genetic variance to enable adaptation. However, as a consequence of thermodynamic constraints, we might expect this disadvantage to be at least partially offset by a fitness advantage, that is, the hotter-is-better hypothesis. 3. Using an established quantitative genetics model and metabolic scaling relationships, we integrate the consequences of the opposing forces of thermal specialization and thermodynamic constraints on adaptive potential by evaluating extinction risk under climate warming. We conclude that the potential advantage of a higher maximal development rate can in theory more than offset the potential disadvantage of lower genetic variance associated with a thermal specialist strategy. 4.Quantitative estimates of extinction risk are fundamentally very sensitive to estimates of generation time and genetic variance. However, our qualitative conclusion that the relative risk of extinction is likely to be lower for tropical species than for temperate species is robust to assumptions regarding the effects of effective population size, mutation rate and birth rate per capita. 5. With a view to improving ecological forecasts, we use this modelling framework to review the sensitivity of our predictions to the model's underpinning theoretical assumptions and the empirical basis of macroecological patterns that suggest thermal specialization and fitness increase towards the tropics. We conclude by suggesting priority areas for further empirical research.","[Walters, Richard J.; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.; Berger, David] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Walters, Richard J.] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6BX, Berks, England; [Berger, David] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Zurich; University of Reading; Uppsala University,"Walters, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",r.j.walters@reading.ac.uk,,"Walters, Richard/0000-0002-9653-8512","European Science Foundation [2570]; Swedish Research Council VR; Zoological Museum, Zurich","European Science Foundation(European Science Foundation (ESF)European Commission); Swedish Research Council VR(Swedish Research Council); Zoological Museum, Zurich","We thank Joel Kingsolver, the Editor Duncan Irschick, Associate Editor Art Woods and two anonymous referees for constructive comments on an earlier draft.

A well-developed observing system and sustained effort of the climate modeling community have improved our understanding of TAV. It is dominated by the seasonal cycle, for which some mechanisms have been identified. The interannual TAV presents a marked seasonality with three dominant modes: (i) the Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), (ii) the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) and (iii) the variability in the Angola-Benguela Front (ABF). At longer time scales, the AMM is active and low-frequency variations in the strength, periodicity, and spatial structure of the AZM are observed. Also, changes in the mean position of the ABF occur. Climate models still show systematic biases in the simulated TAV. Their causes are model-dependent and relate to drawbacks in the physics of the models and to insufficient resolution of their atmospheric and oceanic components. The identified causes for the biases can have local or remote origin, involving the global ocean and atmospheric circulation. Although there is not a clear consensus regarding the role of model resolution in the representation of the TAV, eddy-resolving ocean models combined with atmospheric models with enhanced horizontal and vertical resolutions simulate smaller biases.","[Cabos, William] Univ Alcala, Dept Phys, Alcala De Henares 28805, Spain; [Cabos, William] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [de la Vara, Alba] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Environm Sci Inst, Ave Carlos III S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain; [de la Vara, Alba] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Ind, Dept Matemat Aplicada Ingn Ind, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Koseki, Shunya] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Koseki, Shunya] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5020 Bergen, Norway","Universidad de Alcala; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research","Cabos, W (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Dept Phys, Alcala De Henares 28805, Spain.;Cabos, W (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",william.cabos@uah.es,"de la Vara, Alba/AAC-1654-2021; Cabos, William/L-7374-2014; DE LA VARA, ALBA/AAA-7409-2021","Cabos, William/0000-0003-3638-6438; DE LA VARA, ALBA/0000-0001-8877-6361; Koseki, Shunya/0000-0001-7205-7434","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; Spanish State Research Agency; European Regional Development Fund [CGL2017-89583-R]; Salvador Madariaga grant (Spanish Ministry of Science Innovation and Universities) [2018/19]; Giner de los Rios 2018/19 (University of Alcala); STERCP (European Research Council) [648982]","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); Spanish State Research Agency(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Salvador Madariaga grant (Spanish Ministry of Science Innovation and Universities); Giner de los Rios 2018/19 (University of Alcala); STERCP (European Research Council)","Work conducted by William Cabos and Alba de la Vara has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the Spanish State Research Agency and the European Regional Development Fund, through grant CGL2017-89583-R.

The convection-permitting simulation outperforms state-of-the-art climate integrations that rely on convection parametrisations. Yet the domain-averaged model precipitation is larger than in the multi-observational ensemble, but the latter shows large spread. Overestimations of outgoing TOA shortwave and longwave radiation are much reduced compared to the COSMO-CLM CORDEX-Africa integration, but still suggest a general underestimation of the cloud fraction or frequency. Comparing the control with a no-lake simulation, the presence of Lake Victoria implies strong intensification of over-lake rainfall, but it only slightly increases the total domain-averaged precipitation. In addition, the easterly trade winds are shown to largely affect the mesoscale circulation and precipitation patterns. During daytime, fast trades and anabatic slope winds trigger convection at the lee-wind slopes, and subsidence over the basin. Slow trades allow the stationary air to produce spontaneous convective cells and to develop anabatic winds that result in orographic precipitation. During night-time, trade winds curl around the eastern branch of the East African Rift, generating a southerly and northerly evening convergence front entering the Lake Victoria Basin. Thus, our results highlight the key importance of the easterly trade winds and the complex orography in determining the total accumulation and location of precipitation in the Lake Victoria region.","[Van de Walle, Jonas; Brousse, Oscar; Souverijns, Niels; van Lipzig, Nicole P.

Integrating phase change materials (PCM) into building is one of the effective solutions for energy efficiency. This paper aims to evaluate the optimal envelope type and climatic zone able to improve the performance of buildings using PCM. A numerical simulation was conducted using the difference finite method by Energy plus, in three climates of North Africa; Mediterranean, arid and sub-arid climate, concerning four different building envelopes (brick, concrete block, reinforced concrete and earth) to analyze the energy, economic and environmental impact. The maximum values of energy saving rate is found in the arid and sub-arid climate, with the highest value of 10.5 % for earth envelope, and the lowest value of 2.57 % for concrete block envelope in Mediterranean climate. The use of PCM is more efficient for cooling in arid climate for the different considered envelopes with a maximum of cooling energy reduction of 7.3%, and its use in the sub-arid climate and the Mediterranean one is more efficient for heating with a maximum value of 10.7% in the earth envelope. The environmental and economic analysis shows that the use of PCM in optimal conditions can reduce 10 % of energy cost and 707 kg/year of CO2 emissions. Furthermore the payback period obtained varied between 7 and 43 years with an average of 23 years. Conclusively, the use of PCM for thermal energy storage in buildings still a good solution for energy performance.","[M'hamdi, Yousra] Mohammed V Univ, Mohammadia Engn Sch, Civil Engn & Environm Lab LGCE, Rabat, Morocco; [Baba, Khadija; Tajayouti, Mohammed; Nounah, Abderrahman] Mohammed V Univ, Sch Technol Sale, Civil Engn & Environm Lab LGCE, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat; Mohammed V University in Rabat,"M'hamdi, Y (corresponding author), Mohammed V Univ, Mohammadia Engn Sch, Civil Engn & Environm Lab LGCE, Rabat, Morocco.",yousra.mhamdi.d@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,0,0,4,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-092X,1471-1257,,SOL ENERGY,Sol.

Its level is related to the Polochic Rivers runoff and therefore to the precipitation/evaporation over its catchment area. The Lake Izabal water level fluctuations are driven by the annual cycle of rainy and dry seasons. In this study the ENVISAT RA-2 Geophysical Data Records orbits over the lake, coupled with in-situ measurements are used in order to determine and characterize the lake level fluctuations. The precipitation records over the lake's catchment area are also analyzed. In addition, some relationships of the lake level interannual variations with the climate indexes of Southern Oscillation Index SOI and the Tropical North Atlantic NATL were investigated.

In this study, we examined 41 fully coupled atmosphere-ocean models from fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which will be widely used in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and address whether the current state-of-the-art CMIP5 models can characterise the climatology of the East Asian winter monsoon. We also compared the results with the models from third phase of CMIP, which was extensively used in the fourth assessment report of the IPCC. The results show that the cold surface air temperature (SAT) bias is lessened and the precipitation amount decreased with the current CMIP5 models. Moreover, the CMIP5 models performbetter at predicting surface winds and high-level jet streams than the CMIP3 models. Moreover, CMIP5 models show more model consistency in most EAWM parameters, and the interannual variability of the SAT is closer to the observations.

This simplified coupled model reproduces qualitatively some features of the first and the second EOF of atmospheric 833 hPa geopotential height in accordance with NCEP data. The variability patterns of the simplified coupled model have been compared with variability patterns simulated by four complex state-of-the-art coupled CMIP5 models. The first EOF of the simplified model is too zonal and does not reproduce the right position of the centre of action over the Pacific Ocean and its extension to the tropics. The agreement in the second EOF between the simplified and the CMIP5 models is better. The total variance of the simplified model is weaker than the observational variance and those of the CMIP5 models. The transport properties of the Southern Ocean circulation are in qualitative accord with observations. The simplified model exhibits skill in reproducing essential features of decadal and multi-decadal climate variability in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere.

Pressurized irrigation systems and appropriate irrigation schedules can increase water productivity (i.e., product yield per unit volume of water consumed by the crop) and reduce the evaporative or system loss of water as opposed to traditional surface irrigation methods. However, in water-scarce countries, irrigation management frequently becomes a complex task. Deficit irrigation and the use of non-conventional water resources (e.g., wastewater, brackish groundwater) has been adopted in many cases as part of a climate change mitigation measures to tackle the water poverty issue. Protected cultivation systems such as greenhouses or screenhouses equipped with artificial intelligence systems present another sustainable option for improving water productivity and may help to alleviate water scarcity in these countries.

The vast majority of production is currently from first-generation feedstocks, such as rapeseed oil, and waste cooking oils. However, the increased exploitation of soybean oil and palm oil has led to vast deforestation, smog emissions and heavily impacted on biodiversity in tropical regions. One promising alternative, potentially capable of meeting future demand sustainably, are oleaginous yeasts. Despite being known about for 143 years, there has been an increasing effort in the last decade to develop a viable industrial system, with currently around 100 research papers published annually. In the academic literature, approximately 160 native yeasts have been reported to produce over 20% of their dry weight in a glyceride-rich oil. The most intensively studied oleaginous yeast have been Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus (20% of publications), Rhodotorula toruloides (19%) and Yarrowia lipolytica (19%). Oleaginous yeasts have been primarily grown on single saccharides (60%), hydrolysates (26%) or glycerol (19%), and mainly on the mL scale (66%). Process development and genetic modification (7%) have been applied to alter yeast performance and the lipids, towards the production of biofuels (77%), food/supplements (24%), oleochemicals (19%) or animal feed (3%). Despite over a century of research and the recent application of advanced genetic engineering techniques, the industrial production of an economically viable commodity oil substitute remains elusive. This is mainly due to the estimated high production cost, however, over the course of the twenty-first century where climate change will drastically change global food supply networks and direct governmental action will likely be levied at more destructive crops, yeast lipids offer a flexible platform for localised, sustainable lipid production. Based on data from the large majority of oleaginous yeast academic publications, this review is a guide through the history of oleaginous yeast research, an assessment of the best growth and lipid production achieved to date, the various strategies employed towards industrial production and importantly, a critical discussion about what needs to be built on this huge body of work to make producing a yeast-derived, more sustainable, glyceride oil a commercial reality.","[Abeln, Felix; Chuck, Christopher J.] Univ Bath, Dept Chem Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Abeln, Felix] Univ Bath, Ctr Sustainable & Circular Technol, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Abeln, F; Chuck, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Chem Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",felix.abeln@bath.edu; c.chuck@bath.ac.uk,,,Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (Innovate UK) [EP/N013522/1]; H2020-MSCA-COFUND-2014 [665992]; Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (BBSRC) [EP/N013522/1]; Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (EPSRC) [EP/N013522/1],Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (Innovate UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); H2020-MSCA-COFUND-2014; Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research has been funded by the Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (Innovate UK, BBSRC, EPSRC) to support the translation, development and commercialisation of innovative Industrial Biotechnology processes (EP/N013522/1), and H2020-MSCA-COFUND-2014, #665992, MSCA FIRE: Fellows with Industrial Research Enhancement.",,316,11,11,13,36,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1475-2859,,MICROB CELL FACT,Microb.

Here results from a state-of-the-art global climate model are presented that does not simulate a weakening of the THC in response to greenhouse warming. Large-scale air-sea interactions in the tropics, similar to those operating during present-day El Ninos, lead to anomalously high salinities in the tropical Atlantic.

The basis of this proposition, is the economic theory that applying a tax on carbon dioxide emissions is the optimal solution to addressing the market failure of externalities. In moving from theory to practice, the evidence from comprehensive global assessments, over the last three decades, covering actual policy experience and empirical study of policy effects, requires evolution and refinement of the theory. Carbon taxes are not adopted at the scale, coverage or price level necessary to effectively reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. A persistent implementation gap has arisen, largely due to the political and social challenges that accompany taxation. Assessments of policy experience in key sectors of built environment, transport and industry, highlight the critical role of regulation, standards and technology among broader policy programmes. While a carbon tax can provide simplicity and scope, it is not sufficient on its own. Consistent with this finding, recent modelling innovations show that taxes can be employed as part of a portfolio of best practice policies and measures, for deep reduction of emissions. Portfolios can facilitate application of a lower, more moderate carbon tax, which enhances the social acceptability and political feasibility of the tax itself. When designing a tax, revenue recycling can help with policy resistance, delivering the double dividend of economic and climate gains, and addressing distributional considerations. A carbon tax may be useful to complement the broader portfolio of policies and measures accepted as necessary for long-term transition and transformation. It can offer support and prevent rebounds, but is not a substitute for the fundamental systems change that is at the core of addressing urgent sustainability crises.","[O'Mahony, Tadhg] Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Tampere, Finland",University of Turku,"O'Mahony, T (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Tampere, Finland.",tadhg.omahony@utu.fi,,"O'Mahony, Tadhg/0000-0003-2480-7186",,,,,32,8,8,11,35,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2643-1092,,,GREEN FINANC,Green Financ.,,2020,4,,,,409,423,,10.3934/GF.2020022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/GF.2020022,,,15,"Business, Finance; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,PO5SW,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000605230100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

NASA studies on indoor air pollutants indicate that the usage of 15-18 air-purifying plants in 18-24 cm diameter containers can clean the air in an average 167.2 m(2) house (approximately one plant per 9.2 m(2)). This study investigates the effect of three different types of air-purifying plants, Pachira aquatica, Ficus benjamina, and Aglaonema commutatum, in reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde (CH2O) in hot desert climate. An experiment is performed in which the CH2O and VOCs concentrations are measured in two laboratory spaces (Room 1 and Room 2). Different volumes (5 and 10% of the laboratory volume) of target plants are installed in Room 1, whereas Room 2 is measured under the same conditions without plants for comparison. The results show that the greater the planting volume (10%), the greater is the reduction effect of each VOCs. In summer in hot desert climate, the initial concentration (800 mu g/cm(3)) of CH2O and VOCs is higher, and the reduction amount is higher (534.5 mu g/cm(3)) as well. The reduction amount of CH2O and toluene (C7H8) is particularly high. In the case of C7H8, the reduction amount (45.9 mu g/cm(3)) is higher in summer with Aglaonema commutatum and Ficus benjamina. It is statistically proven that Ficus benjamina is most effective in reducing CH2O and C7H8 in an indoor space in hot desert climate.

Increase in the number of paleoclimate registers with multidisciplinary studies has improved our understanding of this complex desert ecosystem during the intervals of millennial-scale global climate changes that occurred over the Holocene. This chapter describes and synthesizes the information of vegetation and dynamics of precipitation-desertification reconstructed from biological, physical, and chemical proxies in geological deposits (e.g., lacustrine deposit, paleosol, pack rat midden, sand dune, and speleothem) into four different climate regions (i.e., northeastern Mexico, NAM, desert, and south Baja) of the subtropical Mexico. The proxy records are compared with different climate forcings such as insolation strength, mean position of Intertropical Convergence Zone, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity, and sea surface temperatures of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Heterogeneity in hydroclimates of these climate regions is evaluated with respect to previously proposed hypotheses and a new hypothesis associated with size of the Atlantic warm pool. Tropical storms and their trajectories played important roles and contributed to the variable hydroclimates. ENSO was the dominant forcing during the late Holocene, and it generally caused reduction in total annual precipitation and enhancement in the aridity.

The existing wastewater infrastructure from four counties in North East England region is investigated, which includes energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) data from 87 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (16 activated sludge (AS) and 71 biofilter (BF) plants) and 196 pump stations across the region. This study provides a rigorous and novel way of justifying new investments for retrofitting treatment technologies to the wastewater network. Mass and energy balances are performed across the network utilising a spread-sheet based model. Overall, energy use and CO2 emissions are greatest in biological wastewater treatment (relative to other network elements) with estimated median levels of 0.37 kWh/m(3) and 0.40 kg-CO2/m(3), respectively, per waste volume processed. However, energy-use and CO2 emissions differed according to treatment technology with AS plants using significantly more energy (median = 0.4 kWh/m(3)) and producing more CO2 (median = 0.4 kg-CO2/m(3)) than BF plants (medians: 0.2 kWh/m(3) and 0.3 kg-CO2/m(3), respectively). Hence, directed interventions within WWTPs themselves will have the greatest positive influence on energy use and CO2 emissions. Given water companies are often locked-in with their infrastructure, retrofitting existing treatment networks is strongly suggested. For example, adding BF pre-treatment to existing AS plants will reduce energy use, whereas anaerobic or photosynthetic technologies may be useful for reducing energy and CO2 emissions in new-builds. This study confirms energy and carbon dioxide inefficiencies exist in modern wastewater networks, but uniquely identifies targeted actions to reduce inefficiencies, especially retrofitting existing WWTPs to reduce CO2 emitted and energy used in the wastewater infrastructure to make major advances towards achieving climate change reduction targets.","[Velasquez-Orta, Sharon B.; Heidrich, Oliver; Graham, David] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Heidrich, Oliver] Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Black, Ken] Northumbrian Water, Head Off, Abbey Rd, Durham DH1 5FJ, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of East Anglia,"Velasquez-Orta, SB; Graham, D (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",sharon.velasquez-orta@ncl.ac.uk; d.graham@ncl.ac.uk,,"Heidrich, Oliver/0000-0002-6581-5572; Graham, David W/0000-0002-9753-496X","EPSRC - United Kingdom through the project titled: SECURE: SElf Conserving URban Environments [EP/I002154/1]; EPSRC iBUILD: Infrastructure Business models, valuation and Innovation for Local Delivery [EP/K012398/1]; EPSRC [EP/I002154/1, EP/R036705/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/P028195/1] Funding Source: UKRI","EPSRC - United Kingdom through the project titled: SECURE: SElf Conserving URban Environments; EPSRC iBUILD: Infrastructure Business models, valuation and Innovation for Local Delivery; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","We appreciate the technical assistance and industrial insight of different managers and specialist in Northumbrian Water Ltd including Mrs. Bernie Glanville, Mrs. Holly Hutchinson, Mr. David Harker and Mr Alec Llewellyn.

However, it remains for non-vocational subjects, and especially degree programmes in the Arts and Humanities, to prove their merit in this demand-based climate. While sceptics may be worried that endeavours to adapt an academic discipline to the needs of economic utility may effectively dilute the academic content of a degree programme, this article suggests that this need not be the case.

However, how agroclimatic conditions and adverse weather events relevant for grasslands will change across the European grassland areas has not been examined to date. Using a single reference setup for soil and management over 476 European sites defined by climate stations, we show the probability of eight selected adverse weather events with the potential to significantly affect grassland productivity under climate change and how these events vary regionally across Europe. Changes in these eight key agroclimatic indicators create markedly specific spatial patterns. We found that by 2050, the exposure of the south and west European grasslands to heat and drought may double in comparison with today and that the area with frequent occurrences of heat and drought will expand northwards. However, across Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic countries to southern Finland and Sweden, the likelihood of these events is likely to decrease. While changing cultivars and management strategies are unavoidable, shifting grassland production to other regions to reduce the risk may not be possible as the risk of adverse events beyond the key grassland-growing areas increases even further. Moreover, we found marked changes in the overall thermal and water regimes across European regions. The effect of adverse weather events in the future could be different in other regions of the world compared to regions in Europe, emphasizing the importance of conducting similar analyses for other major grassland producing regions. To mitigate the impact of climate change, new ways of maintaining grassland productivity need to be developed. These methods include more efficient selection of species mixtures for specific regions, including increased use of legumes and forbs; incorporation of new genetic resources, including the development of hybrid cultivars, such as Festulolium hybrids; and incorporation of state-of-the-art technologies in breeding programs and new grazing management.","[Trnka, M.; Balek, J.; Semeradova, D.; Belinova, M.; Hlavinka, P.; Olesen, J.

This paper aims at exploring and analyzing how these challenges created by the new legislation has been met during building of a new hospital block in Tromso, the A-wing. Building on sustainable transition theory which identifies several recombinant dynamics, both public and private, we define the building of passive houses as a societal development encompassing dynamics like company development, personnel competences, as well as architectural, engineering and production methods. The empirical material draws on interviews, analysis of documents relative to the project and public media material. The case study revealed a mixture of recurrent, and specific cold climate challenges: some are directly related to passive house technologies, such as issues with the facade, others indirectly, such as Tromso being a remote market for material and labour. The project encountered delays, shift in contracts and cost augmentations. Competences had to be developed and combined to achieve the standards of passive house building and the local workforce was complemented by adding workers from other regions and markets; the south and middle Norwegian, Nordic, Baltic and East European countries. Accordingly, the project was not isolated in the northern part of Norway and its challenges appeared to be rather organizational and managerial than technical.","[Koch, Christian; Buser, Martine] Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, S-42196 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Koch, C (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Construct Management, S-42196 Gothenburg, Sweden.",kochch@chalmers.se; buser@chalmers.se,"Koch, Christian/D-2210-2013","Koch, Christian/0000-0003-3750-976X; buser, martine/0000-0002-5914-3466",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2352-2534,,978-3-030-00662-4; 978-3-030-00661-7,SPRING PR ENERG,,,2019,,,,,1065,1073,,10.1007/978-3-030-00662-4_89,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00662-4_89,,,9,Energy & Fuels,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels,BR9HE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000675599300089,View Full Record in Web of Science

With CO2-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-ofwork blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols.Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains.

The ways the concepts of future, health and environment are dealt with by project participants suggest that arts-based research methods may be at risk of being seen as non-political spaces safe for people with privilege to envision some peoples as having more rights than others to a healthy future. The article begins by exploring how arts-based approaches, and photovoice in particular, can result in positive generative conversations between differently positioned research collaborators. Then, guided by critical anti-racist, queer, and Indigenous scholarship on futurities and ecologies, we move on to suggest that arts-based methods might rightly be critiqued for appearing as naive methods, susceptible to reinscribing dominant paradigms of power and privilege. This tension has implications for geohumanities, explored in the concluding sections of the article. Ultimately, we argue that working with arts-based methods across sectors must acknowledge and account for gradations of power.

Whereas a large deficit in the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR; June-September) was experienced over the Indian region (with the all-India rainfall deficit by 22% of the average), the ensemble average prediction was for above-average rainfall during the summer monsoon. The retrospective predictions of ISMR with CFS from NCEP for 1981-2008 have been analysed. The retrospective predictions from NCEP for the summer monsoon of 1994 and that from CDAC for 2009 have been compared with the simulations for each of the seasons with the stand-alone atmospheric component of the model, the global forecast system (GFS), and observations. It has been shown that the simulation with GFS for 2009 showed deficit rainfall as observed. The large error in the prediction for the monsoon of 2009 can be attributed to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event seen in the prediction from July onwards, which was not present in the observations. This suggests that the error could be reduced with improvement of the ocean model over the equatorial Indian Ocean.","[Yadav, Priyanka; Gadgil, Sulochana] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Janakiraman, S.; Ved, Mohit; Laveti, Ramesh Naidu] CDAC, Bangalore 560038, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC),"Gadgil, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",sulo@caos.iisc.ernet.in,"S, Janakiraman/J-8928-2015; Yadav, Priyanka/N-4272-2019","S, Janakiraman/0000-0003-2292-9518; Yadav, Priyanka/0000-0003-0277-8142",,,,,23,14,14,0,3,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

Annual radial increment (ARI) measurements from stem cross-sections were used to identify the effects of precipitation, air temperature and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) on tree growth under monsoon-related conditions. We analyzed the ARI of 144 trees from 49 forest stands and applied response function and moving correlation analysis as well as a linear mixed-effects model to detect climate signal in the tree-ring series. Analyses of climate-growth relations confirmed the influence of monsoon intensities on ARI, especially in the months of May to July of the current year. Particularly in times of a weak monsoon, the preceding autumn months significantly affect the ARI. The positive effect of precipitation in times of a strong monsoon and the negative effect of air temperature-indicating increased evapotranspiration-in times of a weak monsoon alternate. An increase in drought sensitivity of the ARI was found, especially after long dry periods. The results revealed for L. gmelinii the highest climate sensitivity, with ARI more strongly influenced by precipitation in the monsoon-related months, whereas Q. mongolica was most drought tolerant and recovered quicker after growth depression. P. asperata and P. tabuliformis were located in between. Our findings provide evidence for a strong influence of the periodically fluctuating monsoon intensities on the ARI of all investigated tree species. Our results support decision-making for forest management under anticipated climate change, especially for tree species selection, in the climate sensitive region of Northeast China.","[Hipler, Sandra-Maria; Speicher, Benedikt; Sprengel, Lars; Kahle, Hans-Peter; Spiecker, Heinrich] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Wu, Shuirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Policy & Informat, 1 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China",University of Freiburg; Chinese Academy of Forestry,"Hipler, SM (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",sandra.hipler@iww.uni-freiburg.de; benedikt.speicher@yahoo.de; lars.sprengel@iww.uni-freiburg.de; hans-peter.kahle@iww.uni-freiburg.de; instww@uni-freiburg.de; shuirongwu@126.com,"Wu, Shuirong/GSD-9778-2022","Sprengel, Lars/0000-0002-6332-7911; Kahle, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-9677-5094","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project Lin2Value [033L049A]; Ministry of Science and Technology on the Chinese side (MOST) [2015DFA31440]; Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project Lin2Value(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Science and Technology on the Chinese side (MOST); Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","This research was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project Lin2Value (Grant Number 033L049A) and by the Ministry of Science and Technology on the Chinese side (MOST, Support Code 2015DFA31440).

The drought characteristics i.e., duration, area, frequency, intensity, and severity are calculated using Run theory and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on annual and seasonal timescales. SA is divided into four homogeneous subregions using the k-means clustering algorithm, while the trends were estimated using Sen's Slope estimator and modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test. A state-of-the-art Bayesian Dynamic Linear (BDL) model was employed to assess the sub-regional drought variability and their possible links with large-scale atmospheric drivers such as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). It is found that the SA winter season experienced a significant drying long-term trend, especially southwestern and northeastern parts of SA. Drought durations show dipolar patterns with longer drought duration in the southwestern compared to the northern parts of SA. Notably, arid and semi-arid regions have shown significant drying trends in terms of their area, frequency, and severity, implying that meteorological droughts are relatively more severe in those regions. Similarly, the relationship varies over time between drought variability and climate drivers. In particular, the IOD has an impact on drought episodes over southwest SA relative to the northern parts and is mostly affected by the Sea surface temperature (SST) variability. The study results contribute to a better understanding of the meteorological drought characteristics over SA, which is important for disaster risk managers and policymakers to mitigate drought impacts.","[Ullah, Irfan] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Irfan] Hohai Univ, CMA HHU Joint Lab Hydrometeorol Studies, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Omer, Abubaker] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Liu, Mengyang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Hydrometeorol Disaster Mech & Warning, Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Habtemicheal, Birhanu Asmerom] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Aerosol Cloud Precipitat, Sch Atmospher Phys,China Meteorol Adm, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Habtemicheal, Birhanu Asmerom] Wollo Univ, Dept Phys, Dessie 1145, Ethiopia; [Saleem, Farhan] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Saleem, Farhan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Rwanda Meteorol Agcy, Kigali 898, Rwanda; [Syed, Sidra] Univ Peshawar, Inst Peace & Conflicts Studies, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Arshad, Muhammad] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Sect H-8-2, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Iyakaremye, Vedaste; Arshad, Muhammad; Liu, Mengyang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China","Hohai University; Hohai University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Ministry of Water Resources; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Peshawar; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Hydrometeorol Disaster Mech & Warning, Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",xyma@nuist.edu.cn,"Ullah, Irfan/AEN-0985-2022","Ma, Xieyao/0000-0002-3936-2020",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877158],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors greatly acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877158).

Quantifying how sensitive streamflow timing is to climate change and where it is most sensitive remain key questions. Physically based hydrological models are often used for this purpose; however, they have embedded assumptions that translate into uncertain hydrological projections that need to be quantified and constrained to provide reliable inferences. The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in projected end-of-century changes to streamflow timing between a new empirical model based on diel (daily) streamflow cycles and regional land surface simulations across the mountainous western USA. We develop an observational technique for detecting streamflow responses to snowmelt using diel cycles of incoming solar radiation and streamflow to detect when snowmelt occurs. We measure the date of the 20th percentile of snowmelt days (DOS20) across 31 western USA watersheds affected by snow, as a proxy for the beginning of snowmelt-initiated streamflow. Historic DOS20 varies from mid-January to late May among our sites, with warmer basins having earlier snowmelt-mediated streamflow. Mean annual DOS20 strongly correlates with the dates of 25 % and 50 % annual streamflow volume (DOQ(25) and DOQ(50), both R-2 = 0.85), suggesting that a 1 d earlier DOS20 corresponds with a 1 d earlier DOQ(25) and 0.7 d earlier DOQ(50). Empirical projections of future DOS20 based on a stepwise multiple linear regression across sites and years under the RCP8.5 scenario for the late 21st century show that DOS20 will occur on average 11 +/- 4 d earlier per 1 degrees C of warming. However, DOS20 in colder watersheds (mean November-February air temperature, T-NDJF < -8 degrees C) is on average 70 % more sensitive to climate change than in warmer watersheds (T-NDJF > 0 degrees C). Moreover, empirical projections of DOQ(25) and DOQ(50) based on DOS20 are about four and two times more sensitive to climate change, respectively, than those simulated by a state-of-the-art land surface model (NoahMP-WRF) under the same scenario. Given the importance of changes in streamflow timing for water resources, and the significant discrepancies found in projected streamflow sensitivity, snowmelt detection methods such as DOS20 based on diel streamflow cycles may help to constrain model parameters, improve hydrological predictions, and inform process understanding.","[Krogh, Sebastian A.; Gordon, Beatrice; Harpold, Adrian] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Krogh, Sebastian A.; Sterle, Gary; Harpold, Adrian] Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Krogh, Sebastian A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Agr Engn, Water Resources Dept, Chillan 3780000, Chile; [Scaff, Lucia] Univ Saskatchewan, Canada First Res Excellence Fund CFREF, Global Water Futures, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Kirchner, James W.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kirchner, James W.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Mt Hydrol Res Unit, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Universidad de Concepcion; University of Saskatchewan; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Krogh, SA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA.;Krogh, SA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr, Reno, NV 89557 USA.;Krogh, SA (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Agr Engn, Water Resources Dept, Chillan 3780000, Chile.",skrogh@udec.cl,"Krogh, Sebastian/AAH-4110-2019; Kirchner, James/B-6126-2009; Harpold, Adrian/K-9262-2015","Krogh, Sebastian/0000-0003-2663-7088; Kirchner, James/0000-0001-6577-3619; Harpold, Adrian/0000-0002-2566-9574","Center for Weather and Water Extremes in the West (CW3E) Atmospheric River Program; National Science Foundation [2012310, 2012188]; CONICYT",Center for Weather and Water Extremes in the West (CW3E) Atmospheric River Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"This project has been supported by a grant from the Center for Weather and Water Extremes in the West (CW3E) Atmospheric River Program and two National Science Foundation grants (EAR nos. 2012310 and 2012188) to Adrian Harpold.

The effect of lakes and reservoirs on the local and regional climate is commonly parameterized in regional or global climate modeling as a function of surface water temperature estimated by atmosphere-coupled one-dimensional lake models. The latter typically neglect one of the major transport mechanisms specific to artificial reservoirs: heat and mass advection due to inflows and outflows. Incorporation of these essentially two-dimensional processes into lake parameterizations requires a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical soundness, which is addressed in this study. We evaluated the performance of the two most used lake parameterization schemes and a machine-learning approach on high-resolution historical water temperature records from 24 reservoirs. Simulations were also performed at both variable and constant water level to explore the thermal structure differences between lakes and reservoirs. Our results highlight the need to include anthropogenic inflow and outflow controls in regional and global climate models. Our findings also highlight the efficiency of the machine-learning approach, which may overperform process-based physical models in both accuracy and computational requirements if applied to reservoirs with long-term observations available. Overall, results suggest that the combined use of process-based physical models and machine-learning models will considerably improve the modeling of air-lake heat and moisture fluxes. A relationship between mean water retention times and the importance of inflows and outflows is established: reservoirs with a retention time shorter than similar to 100 d, if simulated without inflow and outflow effects, tend to exhibit a statistically significant deviation in the computed surface temperatures regardless of their morphological characteristics.","[Almeida, Manuel C.; Rebelo, Ricardo M.; Rodrigues, Antonio C.; Coelho, Pedro S.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-2825516 Lisbon, Portugal; [Shevchuk, Yurii] MX Automot GmbH, D-13355 Berlin, Germany; [Kirillin, Georgiy] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Ecohydrol, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Soares, Pedro M.

Optimal operation of reservoirs is of paramount importance for better management of scarce water resources under competing multiple demands such as irrigation, water supply etc., with decreasing reliability of these systems under climate change. This study compares six different state-of-the-art modeling techniques namely; Deterministic Dynamic Programming (DDP), Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), Implicit Stochastic Optimization (ISO), Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI), Sampling Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SSDP), and Model Predictive Control (MPC), in developing pareto-optimal reservoir operation solutions considering two competing operational objectives of irrigation and flood control for the Pong reservoir located in Beas River, India. Set of pareto-optimal (approximate) solutions were derived using the above-mentioned six methods based on different convex combinations of the two objectives and finally the performances of the resulting sets of pareto-optimal solutions were compared. Additionally, key reservoir performance indices including resilience, reliability, vulnerability and sustainability were estimated to study the performance of the current operation of the reservoir. Modeling results indicate that the optimal-operational solution developed by DDP attains the best performance followed by the MPC and FQI. The performance of the Pong reservoir operation assessed by comparing different performance indices suggests that there is high vulnerability (similar to 0.65) and low resilience (similar to 0.10) in current operations and the development of pareto-optimal operation solutions using multiple state-of-the-art modeling techniques might be crucial for making better reservoir operation decisions.","[Mohanavelu, Aadhityaa; Soundharajan, Bankaru-Swamy] Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Coimbatore 641112, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Tbilisi 0162, Georgia",Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Coimbatore; Ilia State University,"Mohanavelu, A (corresponding author), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Coimbatore 641112, Tamil Nadu, India.",aadhityaa65@gmail.com; b_soundharajan@cb.amrita.edu; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge,,"Mohanavelu, Aadhityaa/0000-0002-0386-0220",,,,,74,0,0,21,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The identification and reduction of uncertainties of scenario simulations are issues for marine management. For instance, it is important to know whether nutrient load abatement will meet its objectives of restored water quality status in future climate or whether additional measures are required. However, uncertainties are large and their sources need to be understood to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of measures. The assessment of sources of uncertainties in projections of biogeochemical cycles based on authors' own expert judgment suggests that the biggest uncertainties are caused by (1) unknown current and future bioavailable nutrient loads from land and atmosphere, (2) the experimental setup (including the spin up strategy), (3) differences between the projections of global and regional climate models, in particular, with respect to the global mean sea level rise and regional water cycle, (4) differing model-specific responses of the simulated biogeochemical cycles to long-term changes in external nutrient loads and climate of the Baltic Sea region, and (5) unknown future greenhouse gas emissions. Regular assessments of the models' skill (or quality compared to observations) for the Baltic Sea region and the spread in scenario simulations (differences among projected changes) as well as improvement of dynamical downscaling methods are recommended.","[Meier, H.

In this paper, the multi-objective optimization was introduced to study the shape, size and constructure of the transparent building envelope of rural residences in cold climate zone, China. It began with the field investigation and the establishment of the prototypical models. Then the daylighting, heating and cooling load and thermal comfort of the building were simulated, and the multi-objective optimization was performed. The results indicated that the multi-objective optimization of the transparent building envelope could significantly improve daylighting, energy efficiency, and thermal comfort performance of the rural residences. The best values of the northward, the westward and the southward window-to-wall ratio are 0.10, 0.11, 0.12 respectively for the no-sunspace model, and that is 0.13, 0.13, 0.43 respectively for the sunspace model. Compared with the prototypical models, the useful daylight illuminances for the optimal no-sunspace model and sunspace model increased by 6% and 17% respectively, the heating and cooling load decreased by 23% and 17% respectively, and the predicted percentage of dissatisfied decreased by 12% and 9% respectively.","[Yao, Sheng; Jiang, Zezhi; Yuan, Jingyu; Wang, Zhenkun; Huang, Liying] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Art Design, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China; [Yao, Sheng; Jiang, Zezhi; Yuan, Jingyu; Wang, Zhenkun; Huang, Liying] Hebei Prov Key Lab Hlth Human Settlements, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Technology,"Yuan, JY (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Art Design, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China.",jyyuan@hebut.edu.cn,,,"Social Science Foundation Program of Hebei, China [HB21YS046]","Social Science Foundation Program of Hebei, China","This research was supported by the Social Science Foundation Program of Hebei, China (No. HB21YS046).",,43,0,0,24,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-157X,,,CASE STUD THERM ENG,Case Stud.

Knowledge of past C-14 levels improves our understanding of climate processes, the Sun, the geodynamo, and the carbon cycle. Recently updated radiocarbon calibration curves (IntCal20, SHCal20, and Marine20) provide unprecedented accuracy in our estimates of C-14 levels back to the limit of the C-14 technique (similar to 55,000 years ago). Such improved detail creates new opportunities to probe the Earth and climate system more reliably and at finer scale.

Most Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are designed to solve static multi-objective optimization problems where the environment does not change dynamically. For that reason, the requirement for convergence in static optimization problems is not as time-critical as for dynamic optimization problems. Most MOEAs use generic variables and operators that scale to static multi-objective optimization problems. Problems emerge when the algorithms can not converge fast enough, due to scalability issues introduced by using too generic operators. This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm CONTROLEUM-GA that uses domain specific variables and operators to solve a real dynamic greenhouse climate control problem. The domain specific operators only encode existing knowledge about the environment. A comprehensive comparative study is provided to evaluate the results of applying the CONTROLEUM-GA compared to NSGAII, e-NSGAII and eMOEA.

Disseminated neoplasia, a form of cancer found in some bivalves -recently discovered to be transmissible in at least six species -has been shown to impair bivalve health and fitness, with occasional mass outbreaks causing high levels of mortality. As the ability of the host bivalve to respond to disseminated neoplasia, and the survival and transmissibility of disseminated neoplasia both depend on environmental factors, it is crucial to understand the interaction between climate change and disseminated neoplasia epidemiology. Furthermore, with bivalves being species of high ecological and economic importance, there is a rising need for the development of efficient disseminated neoplasia diagnostic tools in order to detect, mitigate and potentially prevent deleterious disseminated neoplasia outbreaks. Therefore, in this study, we reviewed the current knowledge of climate impacted environmental parameters on disseminated neoplasia and identified best practices and methodology for the detection of transmissible disseminated neoplasia in the wild. By exploring the potential effects changing climate has on disseminated neoplasia dynamics, we identified future research directions in order to advance the field. This included using state of the art disease detection methods and taking into account species' ecological niches to understand the dynamic of disseminated neoplasia outbreaks in the wild and to investigate whether disseminated neoplasia is present in freshwater ecosystems. Finally, we provided a comprehensive step-by-step guideline for an evidence-based detection of this disease in marine ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Although the Pleistocene terrace record of major river systems in northwestern Europe has been investigated by many authors, relatively little attention has been paid to base-level changes related to glacier advance retreat cycles and how these regional changes in base-level interacted with river catchment processes. This study provides a synthesis of the stratigraphic architecture of Middle Pleistocene to Holocene fluvial terraces in the upper Weser and middle Leine valley in northern Germany and links it to glaciation, climate and base-level change. The depositional architecture of the fluvial terrace deposits has been reconstructed from outcrops and high-resolution shear wave seismic profiles. The chronology is based on luminescence ages, Th-230/U ages, C-14 ages and Middle Palaeolithic archaeological assemblages. The drainage system of the study area developed during the Early Miocene. During the Pleistocene up to 170 m of fluvial incision took place. A major change in terrace style from strath terraces to cut-and-fill terraces occurred during the early Middle Pleistocene before Marine Isotope Stage MIS 12, which may correlate with climate deterioration and the onset of glaciation in northern central Europe. During this time a stable buffer zone was established within which channels avulsed and cut and filled freely without leaving these vertical confines. Climate was the dominant driver for river incision and aggradation, whereas the terrace style was controlled by base-level changes during ice-sheet growth and decay. A major effect of glacio-isostatic processes was the post-Elsterian re-direction of the River Weser and River Leine. The Middle Pleistocene fluvial terraces are vertically stacked, indicating a high aggradation to degradation ratio, corresponding with a regional base-level rise during glacier advance. At the beginning of the Late Pleistocene the terrace style changed from a vertical to a lateral stacking pattern, which is attributed to a decrease in accommodation space during glacier retreat. The formation of laterally attached terraces persisted into the Holocene. Major incision phases took place during MIS 5e, 5d, 5c, and probably early MIS 4, early MIS 3 and MIS 2 (Lateglacial). During MIS 5e and the Lateglacial the braided river systems changed into meandering rivers, indicated by preserved organic-rich flood-plain and point bar deposits. The Late Pleistocene braided river systems (MIS 5c to MIS 3) are characterized by a high sinuosity, which may be a direct effect of an increased downstream gradient after deglaciation when the channel lengthened and the river adjusted to the increased gradient by increasing sinuosity. These Middle Pleniglacial fluvial deposits are unconformably overlain by Lateglacial to Holocene meandering river deposits, which form laterally attached terraces, recording millennial-scale channel shifts. The lack of Late Pleniglacial deposits might be related to Late Weichselian forebulge formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the Department of Engineering of University of Sannio has developed a laboratory suitable for performing researches on the dynamic interactions between building envelope components, indoor environment and mechanical systems for a typical climate of south of Italy. The work described within this paper is a part of this large-scale project. Its goals are: (a) to design, test and validate a poly-equipped test room, (b) to perform transient tests to determine performances of common and innovative building components and alternative HVAC systems. More in detail, this paper focuses on the first goal, with the aim to generalize the design approach, requirements and capabilities of calibrated outdoor test facilities, specifically thought for Mediterranean climate. The facility has undergone a substantial amount of characterization tests, aimed at determining its response under yearly operations. The primary conclusions are that the new test facility is usable for a wide range of environmental and indoor conditions, it is functional and has been validated through characterization and preliminary investigations of the behavior of the thermal envelope. Moreover, some experimental results are, here analyzed, by evidencing the potentialities of vacuum insulation panels for improving the performances of the thermal envelope, for what concerns both winter and summer seasons. Then, some numerical analyses have been carried out. A 3D CFD model has been calibrated for studying the real distribution of temperatures and water vapor partial pressures within VIP panels. Furthermore, a dynamic energy model of the test cell has been developed by means of Energy Plus, with the aim to use its capability to compare potential configurations that would be installed in future researches, or to evaluate energy, environmental and economic issues.

Concerning the quality of the RO-derived atmospheric profiles, performance simulation studies and first data analysis results from the current CHAMP satellite mission are encouraging but also reveal weaknesses of present RO retrieval chains at high altitudes ( above 30 km). This study aims at providing, first, understanding of these weaknesses and, second, mitigation by an advanced retrieval scheme. We first evaluated present state-of-the- art high-altitude RO retrieval algorithms. We found clear superiority for using statistical optimization involving background information over using exponential extrapolation and a sensitivity of RO retrieval products to biases in background information calling for sensible bias mitigation. Exploiting these findings, an advanced high-altitude retrieval scheme is presented, which focuses on minimizing residual retrieval biases in the upper stratosphere and thereby on optimizing the climate monitoring utility of retrieved profiles. Applied to a large ensemble of simulated occultation events, the advanced scheme proved to be effective. The scheme is currently under evaluation with real data from the CHAMP mission. It will then serve as part of a processing chain generating RO-based global climatologies of refractivity, geopotential height, temperature, and humidity based on RO data from CHAMP, SAC-C, GRACE and other future satellites carrying RO instruments.","Graz Univ, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Gobiet, A (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, Univ Pl 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",andreas.gobiet@uni-graz.at,"Gobiet, Andreas/B-5228-2008; Kirchengast, Gottfried/D-4990-2016; Gobiet, Andreas/AAF-6039-2020; Gobiet, Andreas/AAX-2537-2020","Kirchengast, Gottfried/0000-0001-9187-937X; Gobiet, Andreas/0000-0001-5751-2961; ",,,,,60,61,63,0,3,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

We focus on the potential for climate change policy creation among small rural governments in the USA. We argue that co-production of scientific knowledge and policy is a communicative approach that encompasses local knowledge flowing up from rural governments as well as expertise and power (to coordinate and ensure compliance) flowing down from higher level authority. Using environmental examples related to land use policy, natural gas hydro-fracturing, and watershed protection, we demonstrate the importance of knowledge flows, power, and coordination in policy creation. Co-production of knowledge and policy requires respect for local knowledge and a broader framing of issues to include both environmental and economic perspectives. While we see potential for local action, we caution that polycentric approaches lead to externality problems that require multi-level governance to ensure coordination and compliance.","[Homsy, George C.] SUNY Binghamton, Coll Community & Publ Affairs, Dept Publ Adm, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Warner, Mildred E.] Cornell Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Cornell University,"Homsy, GC (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Coll Community & Publ Affairs, Dept Publ Adm, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",ghomsy@binghamton.edu; mew15@cornell.edu,,"Warner, Mildred/0000-0002-0109-338X",,,,,102,34,34,5,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0199,1467-9523,,SOCIOL RURALIS,Sociol.

It is shown that energy need for the cooling of the studied office building is dominant in all considered climate conditions, although it can be decreased up to 23% in most favourable considered climate conditions by implementing free cooling techniques. The case study buildings with BIPV structures on their east and west facades meet more stringed nZEB criteria; in addition, final energy demand decreases by 17-37% in comparison to the reference all-glass building. In the case of all-BIPV buildings, the final energy demand is decreased by 36-48%. Such buildings can significantly contribute to the mitigation of global climate change, as BIPV electricity production exceeds the building's energy demand.","[Domjan, Suzana; Arkar, Ciril; Begelj, Ziga; Medved, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Lab Sustainable Technol Bldg, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Domjan, S (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Lab Sustainable Technol Bldg, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",suzana.domjan@fs.uni-lj.si,,,"European Regional Development Fund, Research and development programmes (TRL 3-6), Programme: Sustainable and innovative construction of smart buildings TIGR4smart' [C3330-16-529003]; Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0223]","European Regional Development Fund, Research and development programmes (TRL 3-6), Programme: Sustainable and innovative construction of smart buildings TIGR4smart'; Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia)","This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund, Research and development programmes (TRL 3-6), Programme: Sustainable and innovative construction of smart buildings TIGR4smart' (C3330-16-529003).

The resulting need to control or guide the daylight for reaching a balance between thermal and daylighting performance has been emphasized over the years. However, the concept of the 'thermal-daylighting balance' varied depending on various evaluation criteria and research methods, which may confuse designers. To systematically clarify the issue and illustrate the consensus involved in existing research, this study conducted a state-of-the-art review of the thermal-daylighting balance by categorizing and analyzing the concept, metrics, methods, and factors. The differences in the concept expressions were related to the multi-aspects involved (indoor comfort, energy, and view). Methods for reaching the balance could be categorized into five types: separate investigation (M1); separate investigation + overall comparison (M2); one-another (M3); together (M4); and multi-objective optimization (M5). M1 and M2 were frequently applied, while M5 was more effective. Multiple factors for building/facade/control system designs contribute to the balance. Generally, a proper base plan width-to-depth (e.g. 1:1), facade window-wall-ratio (usually around 30%), high transparency and thermal insulation glazing, adjustable shading with control, and efficient lighting equipment were recommended for reaching the balance. The specified optimal values were changed by the variation in locations/climates and factor combinations. Additionally, the uninvolved metrics (for view, non-visual effect, etc.) and factors (e.g. special building functions and climates) were illustrated. The priority among the metrics, factors, or the advanced products/techniques remained future challenges.","[Yu, Fei; Wennersten, Ronald; Leng, Jiawei] Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fei] Suzhou Univ Technol, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Intelligent Bldg Energy Effi, 99 Xuefu Rd, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Wennersten, Ronald] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Southeast University - China; Royal Institute of Technology,"Leng, JW (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",jw_leng@seu.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0700200, 2016YFC0700203]; open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency [BEE201902]",National Key R&D Program of China; open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [grant numbers 2016YFC0700200, 2016YFC0700203] and the open fund for Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Building Energy Efficiency [grant numbers BEE201902].

In particular, large covariance matrices arise from multivariate spatial data sets, for instance, in climate/weather modeling applications to improve prediction using statistical methods and spatial data. One of the most time-consuming computational steps consists in calculating the Cholesky factorization of the symmetric, positive-definite covariance matrix problem. The structure of such covariance matrices is also often data-sparse, in other words, effectively of low rank, though formally dense. While not typically globally of low rank, covariance matrices in which correlation decays with distance are nearly always hierarchically of low rank. While symmetry and positive definiteness should be, and nearly always are, exploited for performance purposes, exploiting low rank character in this context is very recent, and will be a key to solving these challenging problems at large-scale dimensions. The authors design a new and flexible tile row rank Cholesky factorization and propose a high performance implementation using OpenMP task-based programming model on various leading-edge manycore architectures. Performance comparisons and memory footprint saving on up to 200Kx200K covariance matrix size show a gain of more than an order of magnitude for both metrics, against state-of-the-art open-source and vendor optimized numerical libraries, while preserving the numerical accuracy fidelity of the original model.

However, the main concern about the current state of art in the use of Building Energy Simulation (BES) as an approach to natural ventilation is the definition of input data which usually do not represent the real state of the buildings in the studied region. Within this context, the main contribution of this research is to propose a methodology through which the real state of buildings can be evaluated. By this analysis, valid input parameters was found to exploit the capabilities of BES and CFD simulations to fulfill the main objective of this study, which is to assess the impact of natural ventilation strategies in the energy consumption of HVAC systems and occupants hygrothermal comfort. Four natural ventilation strategies were evaluated: single sided ventilation, cross ventilation, solar chimney and double facade. The results show that the exclusive use of natural ventilation is ineffective to ensure hygrothermal comfort in a building with high thermal loads in a warm-humid climate like Guayaquil. However, by using a hybrid system (natural ventilation/dehumidification and cooling) cooling energy consumption can be reduced in up to 10.6% without compromising occupant's hygrothermal comfort. Due to the promising results regarding energy savings, further research will aim to evaluate the impact of other passive strategies in energy consumption.","[Beltran, R.

The temperate climate represents a challenge due to variations in temperature and relative humidity throughout the year, which are by no means extreme. Knowledge regarding human occupancy in historic religious buildings in temperate climates increases the possibilities of controlling and staying within a given comfort range for the users benefit. The objective was to determine the impact of occupancy on the thermal performance of a historic religious building located in sub-humid temperate climate, to increase the knowledge and to generate opportunities to decrease the excessive use of active systems prevalent today. The objective was approached with a numerical method that included monitoring periods and dynamic simulation to determine a novel passive cooling system that would maintain a determined comfort temperature for the longest time in summer. By implementing a novel passive cooling system, the results showed an impact on the operative temperature according to occupancy level, which reduced the cooling degree-hour by 80% and 66% at the upper occupancy with 80% and 90% satisfaction levels, respectively.

However, due to the limited number of large eruptions that occurred during the period of instrumental observations, the precise amplitude of post-volcanic cooling is not well constrained. Here we present new evidence on summer temperature cooling over Europe in years following volcanic eruptions. We compile and analyze an updated network of tree-ring maximum latewood density chronologies, spanning the past nine centuries, and compare cooling signatures in this network with exceptionally long instrumental station records and state-of-the-art general circulation models. Results indicate post-volcanic June-August cooling is strongest in Northern Europe 2 years after an eruption (-0.52 +/- 0.05 degrees C), whereas in Central Europe the temperature response is smaller and occurs 1 year after an eruption (-0.18 +/- 0.07 degrees C). We validate these estimates by comparison with the shorter instrumental network and evaluate the statistical significance of post-volcanic summer temperature cooling in the context of natural climate variability over the past nine centuries. Finding no significant post-volcanic temperature cooling lasting longer than 2 years, our results question the ability of large eruptions to initiate long-term temperature changes through feedback mechanisms in the climate system. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the response seen in general circulation models and emphasize the importance of considering well-documented, annually dated eruptions when assessing the significance of volcanic forcing on continental-scale temperature variations.","[Esper, Jan; Schneider, Lea] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Krusic, Paul J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Univ Giessen, Dept Geog,Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Buentgen, Ulf] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Timonen, Mauri] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Rovaniemi Res Unit, Rovaniemi 96301, Finland; [Sirocko, Frank] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geosci, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Zorita, Eduardo] HZG Res Ctr, Inst Coastal Res, D-21494 Geesthacht, Germany; [Buentgen, Ulf] Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res OCCR, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, CZ-60300 Brno, Czech Republic","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Stockholm University; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; University of Bern; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Esper, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",esper@uni-mainz.de,"Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013","Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973; Schneider, Lea/0000-0002-8208-7300",Mainz Geocycles Research Centre; EU/FP7 project ACQWA [NO212250]; DFG,Mainz Geocycles Research Centre; EU/FP7 project ACQWA; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The study was supported by the Mainz Geocycles Research Centre.

Both models are the atmospheric components of two state-of-the-art climate models coupled to a multi-level mixed-layer ocean model, following the RCP 4.5 scenario. Both show that the EASM is enhanced due to the amplified land-sea thermal contrast. Summer precipitation over northern China is projected to increase by 5%-10% in both models mainly driven by enhancement of the monsoon circulation. Over south-eastern China the two models project different signs of precipitation change: a decrease in GOML1 with the maximum of about -1.0 mm d(-1) and an increase in GOML2 with a maximum of around 1.0 mm d(-1). Though the thermal effect of climate warming leads to a projected increase in precipitation over south-eastern China in both models, circulation changes are opposite and dominate the precipitation response. This indicates that uncertainty in changes in projected precipitation largely arises from uncertainly in projected circulation changes. The different circulation changes in the two models are likely related to differences in projected Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Western tropical Pacific and North Pacific. In GOML1, the SST warming in the tropical Pacific is associated with an anomalous local Hadley circulation, characterized by anomalous ascent in the tropics and southern subtropics, and anomalous descent with less precipitation over south-eastern China. In GOML2, the large decrease in the meridional SST gradient between the South China Sea and Western North Pacific is associated with an anomalous local Hadley circulation with anomalous ascent at 20 degrees N-30 degrees N and anomalous descent at 5 degrees N-15 degrees N, leading to an anti-cyclonic circulation anomaly over the South China Sea and increased precipitation over south-eastern China.","[Tian, Fangxing; Dong, Buwen; Robson, Jon; Sutton, Rowan] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Tett, Simon F.

A combination of household interview, key informant interview, focus group discussion complemented by literature review compose data collection techniques deployed. The study revealed diverse socio-ecological system 'adaptive capacities' for building resilience to climate change effects. These includes socio-cultural i.e. heterogenous ethnic groups, promising literacy rate, diverse age cohorts within the population and diverse occupations. Another set of adaptive capacities at Pugu and Kazimzumbwi socio-ecological system regards diverse and innovative ecosystem services based income generating activities i.e. Bee keeping industry and tourism industry in its multiple forms (food tourism, arts and craft tourism and nature tourism). Overall, the Pugu and Kazimzumbwi socio-ecological system has considerable adaptive capacities providing ample platform for agents to act upon in building resilience to climate change effects.

Politically speaking, the difference from the Danes was obvious: never did Norway have feudal aristocracy nor bonded peasantry. The theory of the influence of climate and physical environment on culture and character helped create a specific sense of Norwegianness : the folklore of Norway was oral and had to be collected and written down, which was done by Asbjornsen and Moe in the 1840s, and their collections accentuate the fairy tale as distinctly Norwegian because of its black humor, the talent-hidden hero and the graceful yet independent women characters. The fairy tales have successful endings; by contrast, the legends are more realistic and psychologically diverse. The language of tales and legends is a compromise between written Danish and Norwegian dialects. Ballads are also collected by Landstad and Croeger at the end of the 19th century, which portray courtly love and help to show that the Norwegian farmer was a subject of the King, not a serf like his Danish counterpart. Norwegian folk music and folk art in general inspired musicians and writers, and folk art was also significantly present in modern Norwegian politics as the new 'National Left' found its cultural and social identity in folklore. The emphasis on her folk identity became significant when Norway broke out of the union with Sweden in 1905.","[Bo, Gudleiv] Univ Oslo, Inst Lingvistiske & Nordiske Studier, Boks1072, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Bo, G (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Inst Lingvistiske & Nordiske Studier, Boks1072, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",gudleiv.bo@iln.uio.no,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,KNOWLEDGE HUB PUBL CO LTD,HONG KONG,"AMTEL BUILDING, 148 DES VOEUX ROAD CENTRAL, HONG KONG, 00000, HONG KONG",1949-8519,2154-6711,,FORUM WORLD LIT STUD,Forum World Lit.

However, large-scale and long-term observation of soil moisture is sparse. In this study, the latest NCAR Community Land Model is used to simulate regional soil moisture in East Asia for recent 25 years with the atmospheric forcing provided by NCEP/DOE reanalysis. A 50-year simulation has been conducted with the first 25 years as the model spins up for soil moisture to reach steady state. The last 25 years simulation provides a soil moisture dataset with physical consistency and spatio-temporal continuity. Our analysis focuses on spatial and temporal variability of the regional soil moisture based on the last 25-year modeling. Additionally, The trend in the regional soil moisture and its possible link to climate warming is examined. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: 1. Simulated soil moisture exhibits clear sensitivity to its initial condition. Such sensitivity is a function of soil depth. This study indicates that the equilibrium time of soil moisture increases with the depth of soil layers. It takes about 20 years to reach equilibrium below 1.5m. Therefore either a longer spin-up (20 years or more) or accurate initial soil moisture is necessary for a quality land surface modeling. 2. In comparison with the reanalysis and in-situ measurements, the model reproduces the observed large-scale structure reasonably well. The simulation shows mesoscale spatial variation as well. 3. Linear trend analysis shows that soil has become drier in most areas of East Asia in recent years except southern China and the Tibetan Plateau where soil gets wetter. Further analysis indicates that such dry trend may have a close link to warming surface climate through enhanced evaporation.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, Xian 710075, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Earth Environment, CAS","Wu, WL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, Xian 710075, Peoples R China.",,"Liu, Xiaodong/E-9512-2011; Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022","Liu, Xiaodong/0000-0003-0355-5610; ",,,,,21,3,3,0,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6377-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,F2982,F2982,62982F,10.1117/12.690643,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.690643,,,6,Ecology; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,BFM14,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243026400067,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate whether lack of air-sea interaction might be responsible for their biases, we investigate the Bjerknes feedback (BF) in the TA, the driver of the dominant interannual variability in that region. First, we analyse this mechanism from reanalysis data. Then, we compare our findings to model output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. The feedback is subdivided into three components. The first one consists of the influence of eastern equatorial sea surface temperature anomalies (SST') on zonal wind stress anomalies (') in the western basin. The second component is the influence of wind stress anomalies in the western TA on eastern equatorial oceanic heat content anomalies (HC'). The third component is the local response of overlying SST' to HC' in the eastern TA. All three components are shown to be present in ERA-Interim and ORAS4 reanalysis by correlating the two variables of each component with each other. The obtained patterns are compared to the ones from model output via pattern correlation per component. While the models display errors in the annual cycles of SST, , and HC, as well as in the seasonality of the feedback, the impact of SST' on wind stress and the impact of wind stress on HC' are simulated relatively well by most of the models. This is especially the case when correcting for the error in seasonality. The third component of the BF, the impact of HC' on SST' in the eastern part of the basin, deviates from what we find in reanalysis. We find an influence of HC anomalies on overlying SSTs in the eastern equatorial TA, but it is weaker than in the reanalysis and it is not strongly confined to the equator. Longitude-depth cross sections of equatorial temperature variance and correlation between subsurface temperature anomalies and SST' in the cold tongue region show that flawed simulation and slow adjustment of the subsurface ocean are responsible for this.","[Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena; Hazeleger, Wilco] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Dept, Post Box 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena; Haarsma, Reindert J.; Hazeleger, Wilco] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, R&D Weather & Climate Modeling, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731 GA De Bilt, Netherlands; [Hazeleger, Wilco] Netherlands eSci Ctr NLeSC, Sci Pk 140, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Deppenmeier, AL (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Dept, Post Box 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;Deppenmeier, AL (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, R&D Weather & Climate Modeling, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731 GA De Bilt, Netherlands.",anna-lena.deppenmeier@wur.nl,,"Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687; Hazeleger, Wilco/0000-0002-4566-958X; Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena/0000-0003-0549-7143",EU [603521],EU(European Commission),"We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The seasonal variations in water volume are one of the examples of topics studied nowadays. In general, the variations in river levels depend primarily on the climate and physics characteristics of the corresponding basins. The main factor which influences the water level in the Amazon Basin is the intensive rainfall over this region as a consequence of the humidity of the tropical climate. Unfortunately, the Amazon basin is an area with lack of water level information due to difficulties in access for local operations. The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the Equivalent Water Height (Ewh) from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) mission, to study the connection between water loading and vertical variations of the crust due to the hydrologic. In order to achieve this goal, the Ewh is compared with in-situ information from limnimeter. For the analysis it was computed the correlation coefficients, phase and amplitude of GRACE Ewh solutions and in-situ data, as well as the timing of periods of drought in different parts of the basin. The results indicated that vertical variations of the lithosphere due to water mass loading could reach 7 to 5 cm per year, in the sedimentary and flooded areas of the region, where water level variations can reach 10 to 8 m.","[Costa, Sonia Maria Alves] Inst Brasileiro Geografia & Estat, Diretoria Geociencias, BR-21241051 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Oliveira Cancoro De Matos, Ana Cristina; Blitzkow, Denizar] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Politecn, EPUSP PTR, Lab Topog & Geodesia, BR-05424970 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Costa, SMA (corresponding author), Inst Brasileiro Geografia & Estat, Diretoria Geociencias, Av Brasil,15-671 Bloco 3A,Sala 06, BR-21241051 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",sonia.alves@ibge.gov.br; acocmatos@gmail.com; dblitzkow@usp.br,"Matos, Ana C O C/E-9091-2012; Blitzkow, Denizar/L-6358-2016","Matos, Ana C O C/0000-0002-0040-588X; Blitzkow, Denizar/0000-0003-1412-3063",Brazilian National Research Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),Brazilian National Research Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"The authors acknowledge the institutions IBGE, CPRM, ANA, LISN and GRACE project for the data.

We find that state-of-the-art climate models significantly overestimate the memory of pan-Arctic sea-ice area from the summer months into the following year. This cannot be explained by internal variability. We further show that the observed summer memory can be disentangled regionally into a reemergence of positive correlations in the perennial ice zone and negative correlations in the seasonal ice zone; the latter giving rise to the discrepancy between observations and model simulations. These findings could explain some of the predictability gap between potential and operational forecast skill of Arctic sea-ice area identified in previous studies.","[Giesse, Celine; Notz, Dirk; Baehr, Johanna] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Oceanog, Hamburg, Germany; [Giesse, Celine] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling Hambu, Hamburg, Germany; [Notz, Dirk] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; Max Planck Society,"Giesse, C (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Oceanog, Hamburg, Germany.;Giesse, C (corresponding author), Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling Hambu, Hamburg, Germany.",celine.giesse@uni-hamburg.de,"Notz, Dirk/P-4428-2017","Notz, Dirk/0000-0003-0365-5654; Giesse, Celine/0000-0003-2747-8170",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,"This study is a contribution to the Cluster of Excellence 'CLICCS - Climate, Climatic Change, and Society', contribution to the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) of Universitat Hamburg.

Both decades had similar global-mean anthropogenic aerosol optical depths but substantially different global distributions. For both years, we quantify (i) the forcing spread due to model-internal variability and (ii) the forcing spread among models. Our assessment is based on new ensembles of atmosphere-only simulations with five state-of-the-art Earth system models. Four of these models will be used in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016). Here, the complexity of the anthropogenic aerosol has been reduced in the participating models. In all our simulations, we prescribe the same patterns of the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and associated effects on the cloud droplet number concentration. We calculate the instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) and the effective radiative forcing (ERF). Their difference defines the net contribution from rapid adjustments. Our simulations show a model spread in ERF from -0.4 to -0.9 W m(-2). The standard deviation in annual ERF is 0.3 W m(-2), based on 180 individual estimates from each participating model. This result implies that identifying the model spread in ERF due to systematic differences requires averaging over a sufficiently large number of years. Moreover, we find almost identical ERFs for the mid-1970s and mid-2000s for individual models, although there are major model differences in natural aerosols and clouds. The model-ensemble mean ERF is -0.54 W m(-2) for the pre-industrial era to the mid-1970s and -0.59 W m(-2) for the pre-industrial era to the mid-2000s. Our result suggests that comparing ERF changes between two observable periods rather than absolute magnitudes relative to a poorly constrained pre-industrial state might provide a better test for a model's ability to represent transient climate changes.","[Fiedler, Stephanie; Kinne, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Atmosphere Earth Syst, Hamburg, Germany; [Huang, Wan Ting Katty; Lohmann, Ulrike] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Raisanen, Petri; O'Donnell, Declan; Merikanto, Joonas; Makkonen, Risto] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Bellouin, Nicolas] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Stier, Philip] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford, England; [van Noije, Twan] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Makkonen, Risto] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Helsinki, Finland",Max Planck Society; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Reading; University of Oxford; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki,"Fiedler, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Atmosphere Earth Syst, Hamburg, Germany.",stephanie.fiedler@mpimet.mpg.de,"Lohmann, Ulrike/B-6153-2009; Räisänen, Petri/I-1954-2012; Stier, Philip/B-2258-2008; Merikanto, Joonas/B-1039-2008; Makkonen, Risto/F-3059-2015","Lohmann, Ulrike/0000-0001-8885-3785; Räisänen, Petri/0000-0003-4466-213X; Stier, Philip/0000-0002-1191-0128; Merikanto, Joonas/0000-0002-1145-2569; Fiedler, Stephanie/0000-0001-8898-9949; Huang, Katty/0000-0002-4292-2105; Makkonen, Risto/0000-0002-8961-3393",FP7 project BACCHUS [603445]; Max Planck Society; European Research Council (ERC) project constRaining the EffeCts of Aerosols on Precipitation (RECAP) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [724602]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Academy of Finland [287440]; Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) [652],FP7 project BACCHUS; Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); European Research Council (ERC) project constRaining the EffeCts of Aerosols on Precipitation (RECAP) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS),"We thank the editor Hinrich Grothe for handling our paper and the three anonymous reviewers for their comments that helped in improving the discussion article.

State-of-the-art climate models reproduce the general trend along with a projected continuous expansion. Discrepancies in expansion rates of observation- and model-based studies have been attributed to differences in applied methods, natural variability and model shortcomings. Furthermore, the driving influence of tropical or extratropical processes on these changes is not well understood. All of this highlights the dynamical mechanisms and the region of origin controlling the tropical width are still insufficiently understood. Here we examine the influence of systematic model biases of the atmosphere-only Unified Model (UM) onto the simulation of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropical edge. We utilize nudged experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures, where potential temperature and horizontal winds are relaxed back to ERA-Interim reanalysis for a 20-year period in selected regions. Correcting model biases in the tropics and extratropics separately allows us to dissect the dominant remote impacts of present model errors onto the SH tropical edge simulation. The experiments are applied to established tropical width metrics ranging from near-surface to upper-level metrics capturing the poleward flank of the HC. We find both regions work remotely to reduce errors in the UM fields and location of the tropical edge. Surprisingly, correcting the extratropical biases, south of 45 degrees S, more consistently improves the tropical width across the metrics and seasons than nudging the tropics (10 degrees N-10 degrees S). These findings demonstrate the substantial role of extratropical influences in locating the SH tropical edge.","[Freisen, P. F.; Arblaster, J.

While progress is being made in disaster management, activities that degrade the fragile ecosystem, exacerbated by climate change, poverty, and bad governance, remain growing concerns. Amid these concerns, there is inadequate information to take appropriate actions. The authors wish to provide a solution by examining 35 publications from various scholarly and grey literature and raw data sources, following a critical review process designed to expose the implementation drawbacks, research gaps, advances, and prospects in disaster management in Sierra Leone. The study results show that lapses in data management, fewer professionals, and inefficiencies in communication are the most pressing considerations for improving disaster management in the country. Inadequate funds to implement management plans remain pervasive. Following these findings, we recommend that all first responders be routinely exposed to international tabletop exercises and simulated disaster response training to help them build their capacities and learn from other countries. Students in the relevant disciplines should be encouraged to participate in these exercises to facilitate early learning. Also, management initiatives should consider gender equity, the situations of the disabled, and other vulnerable groups at all levels of planning and implementation of activities. Future studies should assess the influence of social media on disaster management research and practice in the country.","[Turay, Bashiru] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany; [Turay, Bashiru] United Nations Univ UNU EHS, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Gbetuwa, Sheku] Njala Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Inst Geog & Dev Studies, Moyamba, Sierra Leone; [Gbetuwa, Sheku] Tech Univ Dortmund, Dept Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany",University of Bonn; Njala University; Dortmund University of Technology,"Turay, B (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany.;Turay, B (corresponding author), United Nations Univ UNU EHS, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany.",bashiru.turay@uni-bonn.de,"Turay, Bashiru/HGB-9279-2022; Turay, Bashiru/ADJ-3327-2022","Turay, Bashiru/0000-0002-2128-9881",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,37,1,1,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2197-8670,,GEOENVIRONMENTAL DIS,Geoenviron.

Here we present an overview of the American Rose Trials for Sustainability (R) (ARTS (R)). ARTS (R) is a new rose trialing program initiated in 2012 in the United States by experts representing universities, rose nurseries, public gardens, and rose societies with the shared goal of identifying and promoting strong performing roses evaluated under low-input conditions. The ARTS (R) trials are managed by university scientists with years of experience in field research. The ARTS (R) leadership team consulted a wide range of stakeholders to ascertain which rose characteristics were most important and developed a new evaluation protocol in response. As with other ornamental plant evaluation programs, attractive floral attributes and flowering throughout the season are highly valued (42.5% of score). Also of great importance are foliar health and quality (45%) and growth habit (12.5%). The scientific credibility and transparency of ARTS (R) are strengthened in multiple ways including using the Koppen climate classification system for region delineation, a randomized complete block experimental design, and a generated code for each genotype to shield identities of the cultivars and breeders from evaluators. Awards are determined on a regional basis with those cultivars earning awards in four or more regions designated as Master Roses. There are seven roses earning awards for 2018, the debut of the program to the public, with three roses ['True PassionTM' ('LIM10'), 'IcecapTM' ('MEIradena'), and 'The Peachy Knock Out (R) Rose' ('RADgor')] earning Master Rose designations.","[Hammond, G.] Houston Rose Soc, 5020 Montrose Blvd,9th Floor, Houston, TX 77006 USA; [Zlesak, D.

He and his colleagues used a very simple atmospheric pressure index to predict the event and convinced the National Science Foundation and Office of Naval Research to support an expedition to the eastern Pacific on relatively short notice. An anomalous warming was detected during the first half of the expedition, but it quickly dissipated. Given the state of the art in El Nino research at the time, Wyrtki and colleagues could offer no explanation for why the initial warming failed to amplify, nor could they connect what they observed to what was happening in other parts of the basin prior to and during the expedition. With the benefit of hindsight, the authors provide a basin-scale context for what the expedition observed, elucidate the dynamical processes that gave rise to the abbreviated warming that was detected, and present retrospective forecasts of the event using modern coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamical model prediction systems. Reviewing this history highlights how early pioneers in El Nino research, despite the obstacles they faced, were able to make significant progress through bold initiatives that advanced the frontiers of our knowledge. It is also evident that, even though the scientific community today has a much deeper understanding of climate variability, more advanced observational capabilities, and sophisticated seasonal forecasting tools, skillful predictions of El Nino and its cold counterpart La Nina remain a major challenge.","[McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [McPhaden, Michael J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Timmermann, Axel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Timmermann, Axel; Widlansky, Matthew J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Balmaseda, Magdalena A.; Stockdale, Timothy N.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"McPhaden, MJ (corresponding author), NOAA, PMEL, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",michael.j.mcphaden@noaa.gov,"Timmermann, Axel/Y-2799-2019; McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011","Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969","NOAA; U.S. NSF [1049219]; ECMWF; Directorate For Geosciences [1049219, 1049238] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ECMWF; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This article is dedicated to the memory of the late Klaus Wyrtki.

The model has been driven with most relevant forcings, both natural (solar variability, volcanic aerosol) and anthropogenic (greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosol, land-use changes). In contrast to previous GCM studies, we have taken into account the latitudinal dependence of volcanic aerosol and the changing land cover for a period covering several centuries. We find a clear signature of large volcanic eruptions in the simulated temperature record. The model is able to simulate individual extreme events such as the year without a summer 1816. Warm periods in the early seventeenth century and the second half of eighteenth century occur in periods of increased solar irradiation. Strong warming is simulated after 1850, in particular over land, going along with an increase of the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase. Consistent circulation anomalies are simulated in multidecadal means with similarity to observed and reconstructed anomalies, for example during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century. The model is able to reproduce some of the observed or reconstructed regional patterns. We find that cooling around 1700 and at the end of the eighteenth century is less than in other studies, due to the relatively small variations in solar activity and the relatively modest volcanic forcing applied here. These cooling events are not restricted to Europe and North America, but cover most of the Northern Hemisphere. Colder than average conditions, for example during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, go along with a decrease in pressure difference between low and high latitudes and a decrease of the North Atlantic Oscillation. This favours positive sea ice anomalies east of Greenland and around Iceland, leading to widespread negative temperature anomalies over Europe. We also find characteristic blocking patterns over Western Europe, in particular during autumn, which contribute to the advection of cold air.","Danish Meteorol Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Danish Meteorological Institute DMI,"Stendel, M (corresponding author), Danish Meteorol Inst, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",mas@dmi.dk,"Stendel, Martin/E-8499-2010; Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/C-4162-2013","Stendel, Martin/0000-0002-6940-6442; Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/0000-0002-9908-8203",,,,,87,45,45,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Statistically significant changes in tropopause fold frequencies from 1970-1999 to 2070-2099 are identified in both hemispheres, regionally exceeding 3 %, and are associated with the projected changes in the position and intensity of the subtropical jet streams. A strengthening of ozone STT is projected for the future in both hemispheres, with an induced increase in transported stratospheric ozone tracer throughout the whole troposphere, reaching up to 10 nmol mol(-1) in the upper troposphere, 8 nmol mol(-1) in the middle troposphere, and 3 nmol mol(-1) near the surface. Notably, the regions exhibiting the largest changes of ozone STT at 400 hPa coincide with those with the highest fold frequency changes, highlighting the role of the tropopause folding mechanism in STT processes under a changing climate. For both the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) and Afghanistan (AFG) regions, which are known as hotspots of fold activity and ozone STT during the summer period, the year-to-year variability of middle-tropospheric ozone with stratospheric origin is largely explained by the short-term variations in ozone at 150 hPa and tropopause fold frequency. Finally, ozone in the lower troposphere is projected to decrease under the RCP6.0 scenario during MAM (March, April, and May) and JJA (June, July, and August) in the Northern Hemisphere and during DJF (December, January, and February) in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the decline of ozone precursor emissions and the enhanced ozone loss from higher water vapour abundances, while in the rest of the troposphere ozone shows a remarkable increase owing mainly to the STT strengthening and the stratospheric ozone recovery.","[Akritidis, Dimitris; Zanis, Prodromos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Geol, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Pozzer, Andrea] Max Planck Inst Chem, Atmospher Chem Dept, Mainz, Germany",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Max Planck Society,"Akritidis, D (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Geol, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Thessaloniki, Greece.",dakritid@geo.auth.gr,"Zanis, Prodromos/B-5598-2015; Pozzer, Andrea/L-4872-2013","Zanis, Prodromos/0000-0002-3496-2692; Pozzer, Andrea/0000-0003-2440-6104; Akritidis, Dimitris/0000-0003-3104-5271",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF); Research Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Research Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"The EMAC model simulations were performed at the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) with support from the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).

Determining whether greenhouse warming has played a role is an important issue. Here, we examine known modes of tropical climate variability that contribute to droughts in Australia to provide a gauge. We find that a two-year consecutive concurrence of the 2018 and 2019 positive Indian Ocean Dipole and the 2018 and 2019 Central Pacific El Nino, with the former affecting Southeast Australia, and the latter influencing eastern and northeastern Australia, may explain many characteristics of the fires. Such consecutive events occurred only once in the observations since 1911. Using two generations of state-of-the-art climate models under historical and a business-as-usual emission scenario, we show that the frequency of such consecutive concurrences increases slightly, but rainfall anomalies during such events are stronger in the future climate, and there are drying trends across Australia. The impact of the stronger rainfall anomalies during such events under drying trends is likely to be exacerbated by greenhouse warming-induced rise in temperatures, making such events in the future even more extreme.","[Wang, Guojian; Cai, Wenju] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guojian; Cai, Wenju] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guojian; Cai, Wenju] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia",Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Cai, WJ (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.;Cai, WJ (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.",Wenju.Cai@csiro.au,"Wang, Guojian/AAF-9297-2020; cai, wenju/C-2864-2012","Wang, Guojian/0000-0002-8881-7394; cai, wenju/0000-0001-6520-0829",Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research; Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader award,Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research; Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader award,"This work is supported by the Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, a joint research centre between QNLM and CSIRO.

The results are obtained by forcing a hydro-dynamical shallow water model (HYPSE) with 6-hourly meteorological fields produced by state-of-the-art global and regional climate models that have been used in the CIRCE fp6 project. The climate change signal is computed as the difference between severe storm surge statistics in the 1971-2000 and 2021-2050 periods. All sea level time series are filtered in order to cancel sea level rise and steric effects and consider only the contribution due to marine storminess. Results show that large sea level extremes occur only in the North Adriatic and in the Gulf of Gabes and this situation does not change in future climate scenarios. Further extreme values are not expected to significantly change during the next decades because of changes in storminess. However, changes in mean sea level and land subsidence (which are not considered in this study) might change significantly the frequency of coastal floods in spite of the low sensitivity of storminess to climate change.

Scientific studies concerning youth martial-arts athletes (YMAs) have become increasingly broader and deeper since the first Youth Olympic Summer-Games in 2010. 'Ibis paper aims at examining the engagement motivations (EMs) that motivated the YMAs who engaged in martial-arts practices and competitions and their health-related behaviors. Method. Participants were 163 YMAs (Ages =12-18; 84 boys, 79 girls; 71 American, 92 Chinese). Data collection was done by employing Adapted Youth Martial-arts Athlete' Motivations and Health-Relate Behaviors Questionnaire (AYMAMHRBQ). The AYMAMHRBQ contained 19 questions examining participants' EMs, 27 questions investigating health-relate behaviors. Data analyses included a 2 Gender (boy, girl) x 2 Ages (younger, older) x 2 Skill-levels (high, medium) x 2 Countries (PRC, USA) MANOVA, and other suitable methods. Results. The top three mean-scores among the 19 EMs were: Precious value Improving health Having fun. The 'Skill-levels' did not have significant differences but 'Gender' 'Ages' and 'Countries' had. The follow-up MANOVA discovered that: boys scored higher in five EMs than girls, but girls scored higher in one EM than boys. Older-age scored significantly higher in 'To establish prestige' than Younger-age; but Younger-age scored significantly higher than Older-age in 'To develop unique skills'. Eleven out of 19 comparisons reached significant differences in 'Countries' aspect. Precious features about these YMAs' health-relate behaviors were found and discussed. Conclusion. When examining the YMAs' EMs, Skill-levels' factor was not a determinate aspect while 'Gender' 'Ages' and 'Countries' aspects were. Those features of the YMAs' health-relate behaviors possess important meanings for improving YMAs' coaching and management.","[Zeng, Zhen Hao] CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Dept Kinesiol, 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Brooklyn College (CUNY),"Zeng, ZH (corresponding author), CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Dept Kinesiol, 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA.",hzeng@brooldyn.cuny.edu,,,"Research Foundation of the City University of New York, PSC-CUNY Research Award [60702-00 48]","Research Foundation of the City University of New York, PSC-CUNY Research Award","This research project is partially supported by the Research Foundation of the City University of New York, PSC-CUNY Research Award #60702-00 48.",,28,0,0,0,3,STOWARZYSZENIE IDOKAN POLSKA-IDOKAN POLAND ASSOC,RZESZOW,"UL TOWARNICKIEGO 3B, RZESZOW, 35959, POLAND",2084-3763,2082-7571,,IDO MOV CULT,Ido Mov.

Shamanism appears to have become more important in this context of adaptation and stimulated visual art production, which became a major symbolic activity in response to the new environmental conditions. As a result, a few rock engraving sites were produced in what might have been a shamanistic context. One of those sites, the Qajartalik quarry, seems to have been the most important of all. Combining proxemic and kinesic approaches, this paper aims to discuss some aesthetic aspects proper to Qajartalik that may have been experienced by onlookers.","[Arsenault, Daniel] Univ Quebec Montreal, CELAT, Ctr Interuniv Etud Lettres Arts & Tradit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Arsenault, Daniel] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Art Hist, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Arsenault, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, CELAT, Ctr Interuniv Etud Lettres Arts & Tradit, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",arsenault.daniel@uqam.ca,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,9,MUSEO CHILENO ARTE PRECOLOMBINO,SANTIAGO,"BANDERA 361, CASILLA 3687, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0716-1530,0718-6894,,B MUS CHIL ARTE PREC,Bol.

Current vegetation models typically regulate the plant photosynthetic response to soil moisture stress through an empirical function, rather than a mechanistic response where plant water potentials respond to changes in soil water. This representation of soil moisture stress may introduce significant uncertainty into projections for the terrestrial carbon cycle. We examined the use of the soil moisture limitation function in historical and future emissions scenarios in nine Earth system models. We found that soil moisture-limited productivity across models represented a large and uncertain component of the simulated carbon cycle, comparable to 3-286% of current global productivity. Approximately 40-80% of the intermodel variability was due to the functional form of the limitation equation alone. Our results highlight the importance of implementing mechanistic water limitation schemes in models and illuminate several avenues for improving projections of the land carbon sink. Plain Language Summary Understanding the environmental controls of terrestrial ecosystem productivity is of critical importance because terrestrial ecosystems directly impact the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, model projections disagree on the future sign and magnitude of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 drawdown, so it is uncertain if terrestrial ecosystems will continue to mitigate climate change in the future. Here we show that the current representation of water-limited productivity across state-of-the-art vegetation models is a large and uncertain component of terrestrial productivity, comparable in magnitude to current global productivity. Our results provide a foundation for improved projections of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, ranging from vegetation growth to agricultural productivity.","[Trugman, A.

The reforecasts reproduce the observed changes in the large-scale patterns of the Northern Hemispheric surface temperature, upper level wind, and precipitation associated with the different phases of the AO. The results demonstrate that most EPSs improve upon persistence skill scores for lead times up to 2months in boreal winter, suggesting some potential for skillful prediction of the AO and its associated climate anomalies at seasonal time scales. It is also found that the skill of AO forecasts during the recent period (1997-2010) is higher than that of the earlier period (1983-1996).","[Kang, Daehyun; Lee, Myong-In; Im, Jungho] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea; [Kim, Daehyun] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Hye-Mi] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Kang, Hyun-Suk] Korea Meteorol Adm, Climate Res Div, Seoul, South Korea; [Schubert, Siegfried D.] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Arribas, Alberto; MacLachlan, Craig] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Lee, MI (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea.",milee@unist.ac.kr,"Kang, Daehyun/AAC-9961-2020; Im, Jungho/K-6257-2017; Kim, Daehyun/X-1710-2019; Lee, Myong-In/F-3578-2010","Im, Jungho/0000-0002-4506-6877; Kim, Daehyun/0000-0001-9233-2747; Lee, Myong-In/0000-0001-8983-8624; MacLachlan, Craig/0000-0002-9151-9152; Kang, Daehyun/0000-0003-3284-1245; Kim, Hye-Mi/0000-0003-4713-4658",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [APCC 2013-3141],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),This study was supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under grant APCC 2013-3141.

Consequently, significant N2O emissions have been recorded during real wastewater treatment in high rate algal ponds (HRAPs). While data scarcity and variability prevent meaningful assessment, the magnitude reported (0.13-0.57% of the influent nitrogen load) is within the range reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for direct N2O emissions during centralised aerobic wastewater treatment (0.016-4.5% of the influent nitrogen load). Critically, the ability of microalgae to synthesise N2O challenges the IPCC's broad view that bacterial denitrification and nitrification are the only major cause of N2O emissions from wastewater plants and aquatic environments receiving nitrogen from wastewater effluents. Significant N2O emissions have indeed been repeatedly detected from eutrophic water bodies and wastewater discharge contributes to eutrophication via the release of nitrogen and phosphorus. Considering the complex interplays between nitrogen and phosphorus supply, microalgal growth, and microalgal N2O synthesis, further research must urgently seek to better quantify N2O emissions from microalgae-based wastewater systems and eutrophic ecosystems receiving wastewater. This future research will ultimately improve the prediction of N2O emissions from wastewater treatment in national inventories and may therefore affect the prioritisation of mitigation strategies.","[Plouviez, Maxence; Guieysse, Benoit] Massey Univ, Sch Food & Adv Technol, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Plouviez, M (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Sch Food & Adv Technol, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",m.plouviez@massey.ac.nz,"Guieysse, Benoit/F-3208-2013","Guieysse, Benoit/0000-0002-8711-3045; Plouviez, Maxence/0000-0001-6824-697X","Massey University, New Zealand","Massey University, New Zealand","This research was supported by Massey University, New Zealand.",,27,6,6,9,25,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,1996-9732,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

B.",,,Do climate simulations from models forced by averaged sea surface temperatures represent actual dynamics?,NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Recently atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) forced by observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have offered the possibility of studying climate variability over periods ranging from years to decades Such models represent an alternative to fully coupled asynchronous atmosphere ocean models whose long term integration remains problematic. Here, the degree of the approximation represented by this approach is investigated from a conceptual point of view by comparing the dynamical properties of a low order coupled atmosphere-ocean model to those of the atmospheric component of the same model when forced with monthly values of SST derived from the fully coupled simulation. The low order modeling approach is undertaken with the expectation that it may reveal general principles concerning the dynamical behavior of the forced versus coupled systems; it is not expected that such an approach will determine the details of these differences, for which higher order modeling studies will be required. We discover that even though attractor (global) averages may be similar, local dynamics and the resultant variability and predictability characteristics differ substantially. These results suggest that conclusions concerning regional climatic variability (in time as well as space) drawn from forced modeling approaches may be contaminated by an inherently unquantifiable error. It is therefore recommended that this possibility be carefully investigated using state-of-the-art coupled AGCMs.","[Roebber, P. J.; Tsonis, A.

For that we adopted regional and continental perspectives (assuming a single European electricity grid), considered several temporal frequencies (from daily to annual), used state-of-the-art regional climate projections together with a climate-production model, and assumed a future massive deployment of wind and PV power installations. Results support that the spatio-temporal complementarity between the wind and solar resources helps to minimize the temporal variability of the combined production under both present (1971 -2000) and future (2070-2099) climate conditions similarly. Thus the projected changes are overall negligible (well below +/- 5%). However, an additional assessment of theoretical upper/bottom bounds for these changes indicated significant potential increases in the stability of the joint production ranging from 5 to 25% across regions, 15% at the continental scale. This would be subordinated to the feasibility of reaching, with the future deployment strategies, individual wind and PV power production series with a perfect temporal anticorrelation. These results may encourage stakeholders to take holistically optimized decisions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we describe the final tuning phase for the IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model. This phase alone lasted more than 3 years and relied on several pillars: (i) the tuning against present-day conditions given a small adjustment of the ocean surface albedo to compensate for the current oceanic heat uptake, (ii) the release of successive versions after adjustments of the individual components, implying a systematic and recurrent adjustment of the atmospheric energetics, and (iii) the use of a few metrics based on large scale variables such as near-global mean temperature, summer Arctic sea-ice extent, as targets for the tuning.

This affected economic activities, individual and community livelihoods and wellbeing especially in rural communities in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Drought's direct and indirect impacts on public health require urgent institutional responses, especially in South Africa's stride to eliminate HIV as a public health threat by 2030 in line with the UNAIDS goals. This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews and policy documents to discuss how the devastating effect of the 2015 drought experience in the rural Hlabisa sub-district of uMkhanyakude, a high HIV prevalence area, imposes an imperative for more proactive institutional responses to drought and other climate-related events capable of derailing progress made in South Africa's HIV/AIDS response. We found that drought had a negative impact on individual and community livelihoods and made it more difficult for people living with HIV to consistently engage with care due to economic losses from deaths of livestock, crop failure, food insecurity, time spent in search of appropriate water sources and forced relocations. It also affected government institutions and their interventions. Interviewed participants' reflections on drought-related challenges, especially those related to institutional and coordination challenges, showed that although current policy frameworks are robust, their implementation has been stalled due to complex reporting systems, and inadequate interdepartmental collaboration and information sharing. We thus argue that to address the gaps in the institutional responses, there is a need for more inclusive systems of drought-relief implementation, in which government departments, especially at the provincial and district levels, work with national institutions to better share data/information about drought-risks in order to improve preparedness and implementation of effective mitigation measures.","[Orievulu, Kingsley S.; Iwuji, Collins C.] Africa Hlth Res Inst, ZA-3935 Kwa Zulu, Mtubatuba, South Africa; [Orievulu, Kingsley S.; Iwuji, Collins C.] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Global Hlth & Infect, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England; [Orievulu, Kingsley S.] Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Africa China Studies, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",Africa Health Research Institute; University of Brighton; University of Sussex; University of Johannesburg,"Iwuji, CC (corresponding author), Africa Hlth Res Inst, ZA-3935 Kwa Zulu, Mtubatuba, South Africa.;Iwuji, CC (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Global Hlth & Infect, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England.",kingsley.orievulu@ahri.org; c.iwuji@bsms.ac.uk,,"Orievulu, Kingsley/0000-0002-6154-3231; Iwuji, Collins/0000-0003-2045-1717",,,,,32,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

We compare those with emulations of 19 state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCM) using MAGICC6. The RCPs are designed as standard scenarios for the forthcoming IPCC Fifth Assessment Report to span the full range of future greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations pathways currently discussed. The lowest of the RCP scenarios, RCP3-PD, is projected in CLIMBER-3 alpha to imply a maximal warming by the middle of the 21st century slightly above 1.5 degrees C and a slow decline of temperatures thereafter, approaching today's level by 2500. We identify two mechanisms that slow down global cooling after GHG concentrations peak: The known inertia induced by mixing-related oceanic heat uptake; and a change in oceanic convection that enhances ocean heat loss in high latitudes, reducing the surface cooling rate by almost 50%. Steric sea level rise under the RCP3-PD scenario continues for 200 years after the peak in surface air temperatures, stabilizing around 2250 at 30 cm. This contrasts with around 1.3 m of steric sea level rise by 2250, and 2 m by 2500, under the highest scenario, RCP8.5. Maximum oceanic warming at intermediate depth (300-800 m) is found to exceed that of the sea surface by the second half of the 21st century under RCP3-PD. This intermediate-depth warming persists for centuries even after surface temperatures have returned to present-day values, with potential consequences for marine ecosystems, oceanic methane hydrates, and ice-shelf stability. Due to an enhanced land-ocean temperature contrast, all scenarios yield an intensification of monsoon rainfall under global warming.","[Schewe, J.; Levermann, A.; Meinshausen, M.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Schewe, J.; Levermann, A.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam,"Schewe, J (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.",jacob.schewe@pik-potsdam.de,"Levermann, Anders/G-4666-2011; Meinshausen, Malte/A-7037-2011; Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-6505-2019; Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-7985-2019; Schewe, Jacob/V-1273-2017","Levermann, Anders/0000-0003-4432-4704; Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Schewe, Jacob/0000-0001-9455-4159",Heinrich Boll Foundation; German National Academic Foundation; BMBF PROGRESS project [03IS2191B]; UFOPLAN project [FKZ 370841103]; German Federal Environment Agency,Heinrich Boll Foundation; German National Academic Foundation; BMBF PROGRESS project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); UFOPLAN project; German Federal Environment Agency,"This work was supported by the Heinrich Boll Foundation, the German National Academic Foundation, and the BMBF PROGRESS project (support code 03IS2191B).

It is crucial to be able to accurately analyze extreme precipitation in order to reduce its potential risk. This paper presents a validation assessment, exploration, and improvement framework and systematically studies three state-of-the-art downscaling methods applied to six different global climate model (GCM) results for extreme precipitation projection. For the purposes of illustration, the paper applies this framework to data collected from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area from 1950 to 1995. The assessment shows that existing downscaled GCMs do not adequately predict some extreme precipitation indices based on historical records, such as the annual maximum 2-day precipitation and number of days with precipitation more than 20 mm. To explore possible ways of improving the accuracy, marginal distribution and day-to-day serial dependency of extreme precipitation are studied for the downscaled GCMs and observed precipitation. The projection results are further improved by incorporating serial dependency from observed precipitation into downscaled GCM results by means of copulas. In conclusion, the proposed method provides a generic way to further improve downscaled GCMs for extreme precipitation. The analytical results validate the method and show that significant improvement can be achieved from this method.","[Hu, Huiling; Ayyub, Bilal M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ctr Technol & Syst Management, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hu, HL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ctr Technol & Syst Management, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",hhu3@umd.edu; ba@umd.edu,"Hu, Huiling/ABA-7396-2021","Ayyub, Bilal/0000-0003-2692-241X; Hu, Huiling/0000-0001-7013-5056",,,,,47,3,3,0,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,,J HYDROL ENG,J.

The ensemble members (six in total) are produced at two different regional resolutions: three members with 60-km and the other three members with 10-km regional resolution. The use of these two finer and coarser regional resolution ensemble members allows one to examine the impact of resolution on the overall quality of the simulated regional fields. For the multiyear ensemble simulations, an efficient regional downscaling to realistic mesoscales has been obtained. The ensemble means of the midtroposphere prognostic variables (height and meridional wind) show an overall good resemblance to the global reanalysis, especially for summer. Low-level features like the warm season Great Plains low-level jet are well represented in the simulations. During winter the 100-km simulations develop a southward wind east of the Rockies that is present neither in the reanalyses nor in the 60-km simulations. The analysis of the annual mean precipitation and its variance reveals that the ensemble simulations reproduce many of the observed features of a high-resolution rain gauge dataset analyzed on a 0.5 degrees X 0.5 degrees grid. Signal-to-noise ratios are larger than 1.5 s over a major part of the United States, especially over the Midwest and also over the mountainous regions like the Rockies and the Appalachians, suggesting that the orographic forcing is contributing to a larger signal. The ratios are smaller toward the eastern and western U.S. coastlines. This result could be attributed, at least in part, to limits in the representation of the land-sea contrasts. For comparison purposes, an additional simulation has been performed using a global uniform 2 degrees X 2.5 degrees grid with the same number of global grid points as those of the above stretched grids. The stretched-grid GCM ensemble means show, overall, a better regional depiction of features than those of the uniform-grid GCM. The results of the study show that even using limited ensemble integrations with a state-of-the-art stretched-grid GCM is beneficial for reducing the uncertainty of the multiyear regional climate simulation, especially when using finer 60-km regional resolution.","Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Sci Applicat Int Corp, Beltsville, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),"Fox-Rabinovitz, MS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, ESSIC, Room 2207,224 CSS Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",foxrab@essic.umd.edu,"Berbery, Ernesto/F-4560-2010","Berbery, Ernesto/0000-0003-2587-3345",,,,,43,8,8,0,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Fluent was used to study the airflow and temperature distribution in the occupied spaces evaluating different possibility of exploiting natural ventilation for different outside conditions. In this study two driving forces-wind and stack effect (buoyancy forces)- are investigated to study the possibility of providing comfort in the building. The results document the indoor climate, the boundary conditions for further planning and the possibilities for high-rise buildings with the new innovative enclosure.

Fruit and apple consumption is 100 kg and 20 kg/person/year, respectively. Apple varieties currently planted in Germany include 'Braeburn', 'Gala', 'Fuji' and 'Pinova', and 'Topaz' and 'Santana' in organic fruit orchards. Orchards are commonly spaced at 3x1 in resulting in 3,000-3,500 trees/ha. In recent years, fruit trees often flower earlier due to climate change with overhead sprinklers protecting them from late frosts. The decrease in honey bee populations led to research into managing wild native, individual (non-hive) bee species such as Osmia and Andrena or the use of imported frozen pollen in small single-variety plots. Research also examined alternatives to tar oil impregnated timber for tree stakes. Alternative impregnation oils, non impregnated Robinia poles with wire trellis and recyclable plastic poles are being investigated for stability and durability. Tree rows are usually treated with herbicides with research underway into organic mulching with shredded wood chippings from excavated apple trees, Miscanthus or communal plant-derived compost. Breakeven farmgate prices vary from 0.32 sic/kg class 1 'Jonagold' apples to 0.37 sic/kg for 'Elstar' apples. Many research objectives are aimed at sustainability and conserving resources like soil and water and cutting costs, particularly labour cost. Research is underway on mechanical thinning of apple flowers. This may aid or supersede chemical thinning, which is currently restricted to 2-3 compounds with temperature dependent efficacy. Hail nets are becoming more widespread due to increasing incidence of hail storms throughout the growing season. Physiological effects of hail nets include reductions in sunburn, flower initiation, fruit yield and colouration as well as increases in vegetative growth and spider mite populations. Research focuses on combating the light loss associated with hail nets using reflective mulches to overcome insufficient colouration in bi-coloured apple cultivars. Research also addresses approaches to estimate and predict yield using image analysis or laser scanners which will supersede traditional approaches based on fruit counts. New technology already provides non-invasive firmness and NIR-based sugar determination of apple fruit. Research is underway on its extension to acidity and internal fruit disorders. QS-GAP certification will supersede IP (Integrated Production) control practises. Bar code or RF ID tags will enable traceability of fruit to their origin and require a database of orchard management practises.","INRES Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Klein Altendorf Res Stn, D-53359 Rheinbach, Germany",,"Blanke, MM (corresponding author), INRES Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Klein Altendorf Res Stn, Meckenheimer Str 42, D-53359 Rheinbach, Germany.",,"Blanke, Michael/D-2231-2018","Blanke, Michael/0000-0003-1593-4124",,,,,6,3,3,1,32,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-531-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2008,772,,,,441,446,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.772.75,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.772.75,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BIO30,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000261331900075,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this view, local overheating exacerbated by urban heat island phenomenon has been identified as a result of anthropogenic actions responsible for citizens' health issues and other serious socio-economic consequences in urban areas, where almost the 70% of the world population is expected to live in thirty years. This fact imposes to respond to an urgent research question concerning the development and the real-world application of effective mitigation strategies against urban climate change phenomena, for a better population resilience. Among the variety of these strategies, the implementation of cool coatings over urban surfaces exposed to the solar radiation, i.e. cool roofs and cool pavements, represents a proved solution to counteract such overheating effect and its negative consequences on the population living in urban context. In this view, the present work reviews the state of the art about the development of new materials and their main applications as cool roofing and paving systems for passive cooling purpose of buildings and cities, which have been published in more than 260 papers in the last decades. Both indoor and outdoor passive cooling benefits were clearly demonstrated and quantified with varying climate conditions, material characteristics and the built environment context. Despite that, the investigation around this issue is still active worldwide, from chemistry, material science and engineering fields. Additionally, new triggers were highlighted as possible starting points for future scientific focus. In particular, still active discussions give rise to promising research findings expected to clarify (i) the effect of cool coatings on pedestrians' glare, possibly mitigated by directionally-reflective materials, (ii) the role of cool coatings for HVAC optimization, (iii) the combined benefits of cool coatings and thermal-energy storage techniques for UHI mitigation.

In this paper, subsurface biases in the tropical Atlantic Ocean (TA) are investigated by analyzing simulations from the Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) and conducting ocean-only experiments that are based on the Parallel Ocean Program, version 2 (POP2). The subsurface biases are prominent in almost all OMIP simulations, characterized by two warm-bias patches off the equator. By conducting two groups of POP2-based ocean-only experiments, two potential origins of the biases are explored, including uncertainties in wind forcing and vertical mixing parameterization, respectively. It is illustrated that the warm bias near 10 degrees N can be slightly reduced by modulating the prescribed wind field, and the warm biases over the entire basin are significantly reduced by reducing background diffusivity in the ocean interior in ways to match observations. By conducting a heat-budget analysis, it is found that the improved subsurface simulations are attributed to the enhanced cooling effect by constraining the vertical mixing diffusivity in terms of the observational estimate, implying that overestimation of vertical mixing is primarily responsible for the subsurface warm biases in the TA. Since the climate simulation is very sensitive to the vertical mixing parameterization, more accurate representations of ocean vertical mixing are clearly needed in ocean and climate models.","[Zhang, Qiushi; Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiushi; Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiushi; Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yuchao; Zhang, Rong-Hua] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean & Climate Dynam, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rong-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean & Climate Dynam, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian, Peoples R China.",rzhang@qdio.ac.cn,,"Zhu, Yuchao/0000-0002-0277-200X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41906007, 42030410, 41690122(41690120)]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 40000000, XDB 42000000]; OMIP; ESGF",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); OMIP; ESGF,"The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers for their comments that helped to improve the original paper significantly.

Process-based forest models have been widely used to project productivity changes under changing environmental conditions into the future. Based on a review of published simulation results from a large number of process-based models, a synthesis of impacts of environmental change on forest productivity and carbon pools is presented. This synthesis shows that most stand-scale process-based model studies have been carried out in temperate and boreal forests, focusing mostly on monospecific forests with tree species that are relevant for forestry and on analyses of the impacts of climate change and of increasing [CO2] rather than that of other environmental drivers. Forest productivity and biomass carbon pools in these forests mainly respond positively to environmental change especially if the effects of increasing [CO2] are included. If climate change is considered in isolation 61 % of the simulations show positive responses, but 35% of the simulations show decreasing forest productivity and declining biomass carbon pools. Boreal forests mostly become more productive and sequester more carbon under climate change and increasing [CO2], while temperate and especiallyMediterranean forests show more mixed responses depending on the importance of individual environmental driving variables. It is recommended that future modeling studies should increasingly strive to incorporate mixed stands and tropical forests, and include other environmental drivers besides climate and [CO2] to better capture the totality of future changes in forest productivity and carbon pools.","[Reyer, Christopher] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res Res Domain II Cli, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",,"Reyer, C (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res Res Domain II Cli, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",reyer@pik-potsdam.de,"Reyer, Christopher/A-5515-2013","Reyer, Christopher/0000-0003-1067-1492",EU [226544]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LS1201A1],EU(European Commission); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The work was funded by the EU research project MOTIVE (grant agreement no. 226544) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, grant no. 01LS1201A1).

The difference in these emission patterns affects the prediction via simulation. This paper aims to extract factors that have an important influence on selecting empirical models by examining the emission pattern of formaldehyde (HCHO) from building materials. As a methodology, Small Chamber Pollutant Emission Test was used for six different flooring and wallpaper specimens, and HCHO was sampled and analyzed using HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography). The result showed that the higher the linear relationship between emission intensity and time, the more appropriate the first-order reduction model. such as flooring-A (R-2 = .99), flooring-B (R-2 = .94), wallpaper-A (R-2 = .99), and wallpaper-C (R-2 =.98). The emission pattern of HCHO in building materials is classified into three types: In type I (R-2 = .00-.11). the emission of chemical substances reaches the maximum after the start of the experiment and decreases relatively rapidly.

J,"Alexander, N",,,,"Alexander, Nadja",,,MEDIATION AND THE ART OF REGULATION,QUT LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In a political climate filled with talk of how to best regulate mediation, it is surprising that so little regulatory theory has been brought into the discussion. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for informed debate in relation to the regulation of mediation. The framework comprises two parts. First, four international regulatory trends in mediation are introduced: the market-contract, self-regulatory, formal framework and formal legislative approaches. Against this background the second part deals with the specific content of regulatory provisions on mediation. The resulting framework is called the Mediation Mix, which brings form and content together and addresses the questions: What aspects of mediation are, or should be, regulated, and how? The Mediation Mix is useful for analysing regulation trends in a given jurisdiction, for comparing trends in different jurisdictions, countries and regions, and for planning regulation policy. Finally, it highlights how different types of regulation can address tensions thrown up by the eternal diversity-consistency debate in mediation.","[Alexander, Nadja] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Peace & Conflict Studies, Dispute Resolut, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Alexander, Nadja] Murdoch Univ, Law, Murdoch, WA, Australia",University of Queensland; Murdoch University,"Alexander, N (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Peace & Conflict Studies, Dispute Resolut, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",n.alexander@uq.edu.au,,"Alexander, Nadja/0000-0003-4909-5920",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),Thanks go to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany for its support in relation to the writing of this paper.

Field measurements were combined with numerical modeling of soil thermal dynamics to assess the roles of fire severity and climate history in postfire permafrost dynamics. Field-based calculations of potential thaw settlement following the loss of remaining ice-rich permafrost averaged 0.6 m. This subsidence would cause the surface elevations of forests to drop on average 0.1 m below the surface water level of adjacent collapse-scar features. Up to 0.5 m of thaw settlement was documented after recent fires, causing water impoundment and further thawing along forest margins. Substantial heterogeneity in soil properties (organic layer thickness, texture, moisture, and ice content) was attributed to differing site histories, which resulted in distinct soil thermal regimes by soil type. Model simulations showed increasing vulnerability of permafrost to deep thawing and thaw settlement with increased fire severity (i.e., reduced organic layer thickness). However, the thresholds of fire severity that triggered permafrost destabilization varied temporally in response to climate. Simulated permafrost dynamics underscore the importance of multiyear to multidecadal fluctuations in air temperature and snow depth in mediating the effects of fire on permafrost. Our results suggest that permafrost is becoming increasingly vulnerable to substantial thaw and collapse after moderate to high-severity fire, and the ability of permafrost to recover is diminishing as the climate continues to warm.","[Brown, Dana R.

A feedback analysis framework specific to the Arctic is developed to address this issue. The feedback analysis shows that a large part of the spread of Arctic climate change is explained by the longwave feedback parameter. The large spread of the negative longwave feedback parameter is in turn mainly due to variations in temperature feedback. The vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere in the Arctic, characterized by a surface inversion during wintertime, exerts a strong control on the temperature feedback and consequently on simulated Arctic climate change. Most current climate models likely overestimate the climatological strength of the inversion, leading to excessive negative longwave feedback. The authors conclude that the models' near-equilibrium response to anthropogenic forcing is generally too small.","[Boe, Julien; Hall, Alex; Qu, Xin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Boe, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",boe@atmos.ucla.edu,"Hall, Alex/D-8175-2014","Boe, Julien/0000-0003-2965-4721",NSF [ARC-0714083],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors are supported by NSF ARC-0714083.

Here we show that state-of-the-art climate models robustly predict a weakening of Atlantic Ninos in response to global warming, mainly due to a decoupling of subsurface and surface temperature variations as the upper equatorial Atlantic Ocean warms. This weakening is predicted by most (>80%) models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6 under the highest emission scenarios. Our results indicate a reduction in variability by the end of the century by 14%, and as much as 24-48% when accounting for model errors using a simple emergent constraint analysis. Such a weakening of Atlantic Nino variability will potentially impact climate conditions and the skill of seasonal predictions in many regions. The Atlantic Nino is an important mode of tropical climate variability, but how it reacts to climate change is not well known due to model biases. Here the authors show a robust weakening of the Atlantic Nino of up to 24-48% under high emissions until the end of the century.","[Crespo, Lander R.; Keenlyside, Noel; Koseki, Shunya; Svendsen, Lea] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Crespo, Lander R.; Keenlyside, Noel; Koseki, Shunya; Svendsen, Lea] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Prigent, Arthur] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Keenlyside, Noel] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Richter, Ingo] JAMSTEC, Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Sanchez-Gomez, Emilia] Univ Toulouse Cerfacs, CNRS, CECI, Toulouse, France",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Prigent, A (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",aprigent@geomar.de,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Svendsen, Lea/0000-0002-0181-3332; Prigent, Arthur/0000-0002-0831-2696","TRIATLAS project - European Union [817578]; Bjerknes Climate Prediction Unit; Trond Mohn Foundation [BFS2018TMT01]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0795A]; UNINETT Sigma2 AS [NN9039K, NS9039K]",TRIATLAS project - European Union; Bjerknes Climate Prediction Unit; Trond Mohn Foundation; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); UNINETT Sigma2 AS,"This study was supported by the TRIATLAS project funded under European Union's Horizon 2020 programme (grant agreement number 817578; L.R.C., N.K., S.K., E.S.-G.); and by the Bjerknes Climate Prediction Unit with funding from the Trond Mohn Foundation (grant BFS2018TMT01; N.K., L.S.).

The initial attempt to create a translation theory in the Soviet Union was made with an eye to the existing literary translation practices, which evolved under the influence of socially determined factors, including general orientation of arts and science towards education, the universally implanted principle of primacy of practice over theory, and the requirements of the Socialist realism. The focus on practice created favorable conditions for the application of comparative methodology to the study of existing translations and the wide spread of translation criticism. The groundbreaking work of Andrei Fedorov put linguistics in the focus of translation research and became a turning point in the development of the translation theory. The elevated interest of researchers to the translation theory continued to coexist with the social requirements, such as the overtly imposed mandatory linkage of theory and practice and the covertly desired methodological orientation of translation studies.","[Kamovnikova, Natalia] St Petersburg Univ Management Technol & Econ, Dept Linguist & Translat Studies, St Petersburg, Russia",,"Kamovnikova, N (corresponding author), St Petersburg Univ Management Technol & Econ, Dept Linguist & Translat Studies, St Petersburg, Russia.",natalie_kamov@yahoo.com,,,,,,,58,0,0,1,1,BRILL RODOPI,LEIDEN,"P O BOX 9000, LEIDEN, 2300 PA, NETHERLANDS",0169-0523,1879-6273,978-90-04-43780-7; 978-90-04-43779-1,APPROACH TRANSL STUD,,,2021,,,,,135,154,,10.1163/9789004437807_008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004437807_008,,,20,History Of Social Sciences; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Social Sciences - Other Topics; Linguistics,BT5BO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000835561800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, the trend towards such technologies has been greatly intensifying, leading these solutions to take root in European commercial refrigeration sector. In this theoretical study, the performance of the present state-of-the-art pure CO2 refrigeration plants was extensively investigated for an average size food retail located in various European climate contexts. The results revealed that, compared to a R404A direct expansion unit, the energy efficiency limit commonly experienced by transcritical R744 refrigerating systems with rise in outdoor temperature disappears with the aid of the multi-ejector concept. Furthermore, depending on the selected solution, the current advanced commercial CO2 only configurations feature energy savings ranging from 3% to 37.1% across Europe over a R404A unit. At last, this investigation demonstrates that transcritical R744 ejector supported parallel systems are the most highly efficient and climate friendly technologies for European food retail industry.

The Massim islands of eastern New Guinea significantly reduced in size throughout the Holocene (<= 11.7 kya), providing a unique opportunity to investigate the long-term adaptive capabilities of humans to changing island ecosystems. Here, we report a 2500-2300 year cultural sequence on Nimowa Island in the Louisiade Archipelago of the Massim region which began with the arrival of a late Lapita population during initial beachfront development. Sediment analyses indicate earlier settlement on the island would not have been possible as the coastline was unstable until near-modern sea levels were reached. The island was abandoned from 1290 to 530 cal. BP during a period of unusually dry conditions ('Medieval Climate Anomaly') and probable freshwater shortages. Re-settlement coincided with wetter climatic conditions ('Little Ice Age'), associated with the establishment of large villages, the earliest expression of local pottery traditions and the onset of large-scale regional exchange networks. Import of non-local obsidian reflects two pulses of interaction followed by periods of increased isolation.

Therefore, to create more sustainable prefabricated buildings, it is important to understand the effects of their envelope parameters on energy performance and indoor environmental quality. Although previous research have investigated the effects of envelope on energy and indoor comfort outputs, the parameters of lightweight prefabricated envelope are not thoroughly considered. This article quantifies the effects of building envelope parameters on the energy use, thermal comfort and daylighting levels of a prefabricated house built in Australia. A building simulation model was developed and validated by comparing predicted with measured indoor temperatures of the house. The baseline performance for evaluation of energy consumption, thermal discomfort hours and daylight unsatisfied hours were carried out using Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) tool. Series of regression-based sensitivity analyses (SAs) to identify the most sensitive parameters were conducted by coupling TRNSYS, jEPlus and SimLab. Applications in six climate zones were investigated. The important focus areas found by SA in each climate and their corresponding design responses can be applied across ranges of prefabricated building projects if built in similar climatic conditions. SA results revealed window glazing and shading among the most influential parameters on all targeted performance outputs. The relationship between sensitivity levels to energy consumption and degree days indicated that the type of window has a higher impact on the reduction of energy use in the cooling dominated climates while insulation of wall was found a more effective strategy in heating-dominated climates.","[Naji, Sareh; Aye, Lu] Univ Melbourne, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Noguchi, Masa] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, ZEMCH EXD Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Aye, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",lua@unimelb.edu.au,"Noguchi, Masa/V-4471-2019; Aye, Lu/J-8733-2013","Noguchi, Masa/0000-0003-1437-5455; Aye, Lu/0000-0002-5495-1683",Melbourne Research Scholarship; ARC Centre for Advanced Manufacturing of Prefabricated Housing [ARC Grant] [IC150100023]; Habitech Systems,Melbourne Research Scholarship; ARC Centre for Advanced Manufacturing of Prefabricated Housing [ARC Grant](Australian Research Council); Habitech Systems,"This research was conducted within the Department of Infrastructure Engineering as a part of PhD thesis of Sareh Naji, who has been supported by Melbourne Research Scholarship.

A surplus of energy can create thermal discomfort and be detrimental to human health. Many cities in warm regions all over the world are forecast to become very hot through global climate change. Some cities already experience extreme heat and have done so for centuries. We conducted a study of one such city in order to generate design guidelines for creating thermally comfortable outdoor places. In the hot, dry city of Lahore, Pakistan we compared the microclimates of two very different outdoor spaces. The first place was the 16th century Shalimar Garden, which contains much green infrastructure and water features. The other example was the hard-surfaced courtyard of the contemporary Alhamra Art Centre. In both places we measured the microclimatic characteristics and used those data to simulate thermal sensation through the energybudget model COMFA. The measured air temperature and humidity in both spaces was similar. However, the solar radiation that would be received by a person in the Alhamra courtyard was much higher than in Shalimar Garden and was the main determinant of thermal discomfort. Results from this study can inform other cities in hot, dry climates about design responses that provide more outdoor thermal comfort and prevent health-threatening heat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In order to accelerate this development, it is advantageous to combine dedicated state-of-the-art software components, as building blocks in modular automated driving function architectures, instead of developing special solutions from scratch. However, e.g., in local motion planning and control, the combination of components is still limited in practice, due to necessary interface alignments, which might yield sub-optimal solutions and additional development overhead. The application of generic interfaces, which manage the data transfer between the software components, has the potential to avoid these drawbacks and hence, to further boost this development approach. This publication contributes such a generic interface concept between the local path planning and path tracking systems. The crucial point is a generalization of the lateral tracking error computation, based on an introduced error classification. It substantiates the integration of an internal reference path representation into the interface, to resolve the component interdependencies. The resulting, proposed interface enables arbitrary combinations of components from a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art path planning and tracking algorithms. Two interface implementations are finally applied in an exemplary automated driving function assembly task.","[Rumetshofer, Johannes; Stolz, Michael; Watzenig, Daniel] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Automat & Control, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Rumetshofer, Johannes; Stolz, Michael; Watzenig, Daniel] Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Graz University of Technology,"Rumetshofer, J (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Automat & Control, A-8010 Graz, Austria.;Rumetshofer, J (corresponding author), Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",j.rumetshofer@tugraz.at; michael.stolz@tugraz.at; daniel.watzenig@tugraz.at,,"Stolz, Michael/0000-0003-3667-7462; Watzenig, Daniel/0000-0002-5341-9708",COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); TU Graz Open Access Publishing Fund,COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); TU Graz Open Access Publishing Fund,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support within the COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK), the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), the Province of Styria (Dept. 12) and the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG).

The community Noah land surface model with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) is unique in that it is the next-generation land surface model for the Weather Research and Forecasting meteorological model and for the operational weather/climate models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. In this study, we add a capability to Noah-MP to simulate nitrogen dynamics by coupling the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) plant model and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) soil nitrogen dynamics. This model development incorporates FUN's state-of-the-art concept of carbon cost theory and SWAT's strength in representing the impacts of agricultural management on the nitrogen cycle. Parameterizations for direct root and mycorrhizal-associated nitrogen uptake, leaf retranslocation, and symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation are employed from FUN, while parameterizations for nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, immobilization, volatilization, atmospheric deposition, and leaching are based on SWAT. The coupled model is then evaluated at the Kellogg Biological Station - a Long Term Ecological Research site within the US Corn Belt. Results show that the model performs well in capturing the major nitrogen state/flux variables (e.g., soil nitrate and nitrate leaching). Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen dynamics improves the modeling of net primary productivity and evapotranspiration. The model improvement is expected to advance the capability of Noah-MP to simultaneously predict weather and water quality in fully coupled Earth system models.","[Cai, X.; Yang, Z. -L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, John A & Katherine G Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX USA; [Fisher, J.

Moreover, the effect of external hydrostatic pressure, bending moment, initial imperfection, sectional rigidity, and diameter-to-thickness ratio of the pipeline on collapse load of the pipeline during buckling were also included in the study. This work highlights the existing knowledge on the topic along with the main findings performed up to recent research.

We emphasize that an essential condition for the healthy development of the field is a careful balance between application and basic work, in which the applied side is the driving force. In other words: scientometrics is primarily a field of applied science. This means that the interaction with 'users' is at least as important as the interaction with colleague-scientists. We state that this situation is very stimulating, it strengthens methodology and it activates basic work. We consider the idea of scientometrics lacking theoretical content or being otherwise in a 'crisis-like' situation as groundless. Scientometrics is in a typical developmental stage in which the creativity of its individual researchers and the 'climate' and facilities of their institutional environments determine the progress in the field and, particularly, its relation with other disciplines. These aspects also contribute substantially to the reputation of scientometrics as a research field respected by the broader scientific community. And this latter point is important, both to let quantitative studies of science and technology take more advantage of an academic environment, as well as to keep it innovative and thus attractive in terms of applications at the longer term.",,,"VanRaan, AFJ (corresponding author), LEIDEN UNIV,CTR SCI & TECHNOL STUDIES,POB 9555,WASSENAARSEWEG 52,NL-2300 RB LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,"van Raan, Anthony/0000-0001-8980-5937",,,,,21,112,123,0,50,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0138-9130,,,SCIENTOMETRICS,Scientometrics,JAN,1997,1,,,,205,218,,10.1007/BF02461131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02461131,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,WP653,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1997WP65300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, climate change will likely affect solar power generation and the atmospheric factors that control it. For the first time, the state-of-the-art CMIP climate models (CMIP6) are used to investigate the potential future evolution of solar power generation and its main atmospheric drivers in West Africa. A multi-model analyses carried out revealed a decrease of solar PV potential throughout West Africa in the 21st century, with an ensemble mean reduction reaching about 12% in southern parts of the region. In addition, the variability of future solar PV production is expected to increase with a higher frequency of lower production periods. The projected changes in the solar PV production and its variability are expected to be predominant in the June to August season. We found the decrease in the solar PV potential to be driven by a decrease of surface irradiance and an increase of near-surface air temperature. However, the decrease of the surface irradiance accounted for a substantially larger percentage of the projected solar PV potential. The decrease in surface irradiance was further linked to changes in both cloud cover and aerosol presence, although generally much more strongly for the former.","[Danso, Derrick Kwadwo; Anquetin, Sandrine; Diedhiou, Arona; Lavaysse, Christophe; Hingray, Benoit] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Grenoble INP,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Danso, Derrick Kwadwo; Diedhiou, Arona; Kobea, Arsene Toka] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Sci Matiere Environm & Energie Solaire LASMES, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Lavaysse, Christophe] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Raynaud, Damien] Steadysun, F-73370 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Danso, Derrick Kwadwo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Iowa State University,"Danso, DK (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Grenoble INP,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France.;Danso, DK (corresponding author), Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Sci Matiere Environm & Energie Solaire LASMES, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.;Danso, DK (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ddanso@iastate.edu,"DIEDHIOU, Arona/D-2719-2009; Danso, Derrick K./GQP-1456-2022","DIEDHIOU, Arona/0000-0003-3841-1027; Danso, Derrick/0000-0001-7141-7530; Hingray, Benoit/0000-0001-6991-0975","France National Research Institute for Sustainable Development, IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France)","France National Research Institute for Sustainable Development, IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France)","This research has been supported by the France National Research Institute for Sustainable Development, IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France).",,57,2,2,8,12,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Current methods to assess these costs employ a variety of terminologies and approaches for different types of natural hazards and different impacted sectors. This may impede efforts to ascertain comprehensive and comparable cost figures. In order to strengthen the role of cost assessments in the development of integrated natural hazard management, a review of existing cost assessment approaches was undertaken. This review considers droughts, floods, coastal and Alpine hazards, and examines different cost types, namely direct tangible damages, losses due to business interruption, indirect damages, intangible effects, and the costs of risk mitigation. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art cost assessment approaches and discusses key knowledge gaps. It shows that the application of cost assessments in practice is often incomplete and biased, as direct costs receive a relatively large amount of attention, while intangible and indirect effects are rarely considered. Furthermore, all parts of cost assessment entail considerable uncertainties due to insufficient or highly aggregated data sources, along with a lack of knowledge about the processes leading to damage and thus the appropriate models required. Recommendations are provided on how to reduce or handle these uncertainties by improving data sources and cost assessment methods. Further recommendations address how risk dynamics due to climate and socio-economic change can be better considered, how costs are distributed and risks transferred, and in what ways cost assessment can function as part of decision support.","[Meyer, V.; Becker, N.; Markantonis, V.; Schwarze, R.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [van den Bergh, J.

Previous studies focused on reflective air spaces (rather than reflective insulation systems) in laboratory steady-state conditions, and different defects and limitations in those investigations have made it necessary to probe for patterns to address the research key questions and generalization of the results. Thus, in this study a numerical simulation approach using ISO 15099 is utilized for performing calculations in enclosed reflective air spaces. Additionally, application of ISO 15099 is compared with ASHRAE experimental data, and related differences and limitations are demonstrated. The optimized configurations of the reflective insulation systems in wall application are explored, and an unprecedented extensive climatic evaluation is conducted. Moreover, the influences of extreme climatic conditions and orientation factor on thermal performance of various reflective configurations are assessed. It is found that systems with a 20 mm air gap adjacent to reflective surfaces are the most appropriate systems in the wall application. In addition, thermal performance of these systems is highly affected by environmental conditions. Finally, the optimized orientations in each configuration are presented.","[Pourghorban, Arash] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Architecture & Energy, Tehran, Iran; [Kari, Behrouz Mohammad] Bldg & Housing Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Solgi, Ebrahim] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Pourghorban, A (corresponding author), Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Architecture & Energy, Tehran, Iran.",arashpourghorban@yahoo.com,"Pourghorban, Arash/AAJ-3628-2020; Pourghorban, Arash/GZK-3240-2022; Solgi, Ebrahim/S-2177-2017","Pourghorban, Arash/0000-0003-1177-9921; Solgi, Ebrahim/0000-0003-4385-3524",,,,,52,10,10,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Changes in human population size and range have affected our genetic evolution, and recent modeling efforts have reaffirmed the importance of population dynamics in cultural and linguistic evolution, as well. However, in the absence of historical records, estimating past population levels has remained difficult. Here we show that it is possible to model spatially explicit human population dynamics from the pre-LGM at 30 ky ago through the LGM to the Late Glacial in Europe by using climate envelope modeling tools and modern ethnographic datasets to construct a population calibration model. The simulated range and size of the human population correspond significantly with spatiotemporal patterns in the archaeological data, suggesting that climate was a major driver of population dynamics 30-13 ky ago. The simulated population size declined from about 330,000 people at 30 ky ago to a minimum of 130,000 people at 23 ky ago. The Late Glacial population growth was fastest during Greenland interstadial 1, and by 13 ky ago, there were almost 410,000 people in Europe. Even during the coldest part of the LGM, the climatically suitable area for human habitation remained unfragmented and covered 36% of Europe.","[Tallavaara, Miikka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Luoto, Miska; Seppa, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Korhonen, Natalia] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Climate Change Res Unit, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Korhonen, Natalia; Jarvinen, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki,"Tallavaara, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",miikka.tallavaara@gmail.com,"Järvinen, Heikki J/A-9376-2012","Järvinen, Heikki J/0000-0003-1879-6804; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Tallavaara, Miikka/0000-0001-9252-7309; Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955",Kone Foundation,Kone Foundation,"We thank A.

However, they are poorly simulated in state-of-the-art climate models. We apply a simple bias correction scheme by only assimilating observed sea surface temperature (SST) data into a coupled earth system model, named the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model version 2 (CAS-ESM 2.0), to better reproduce the upper zonal currents in tropical oceans. There are mainly two reasons for this usage of SST assimilating method: 1) SST has dominant effects on the air-sea interactions over the tropical region; 2) The lack of effective and long-term ocean-current observation data currently. Our results show that the SST assimilation can significantly improve the strength of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and the South Equatorial Current (SEC) through reducing biases in the air-sea turbulence flux. Nevertheless, the SST assimilation has limited effects on improving the simulation of the spatial structure of these zonal currents in the tropical Pacific. The improvement of the wind stress curl over the tropical Pacific region mainly contributes to the improved simulated strength of the Pacific EUC, the NECC and the SEC. It also connects to the reduced biases in atmospheric convective precipitation and sea-level pressure induced by the reduction of the SST bias.","[Sun, Zhikuo] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xin; Jin, Jiangbo; He, Juanxiong; Zheng, Fei; Zhang, He; Dong, Xiao; Zeng, Qingcun] Inst Atmospher Phys, Chinese Acad Sci, ICCES, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jiangbo] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China","Jin, JB; Zheng, F (corresponding author), Inst Atmospher Phys, Chinese Acad Sci, ICCES, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Jin, JB (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",jinjiangbo@mail.iap.ac.cn; zhengfei@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,"Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDBS-LY-DQC010]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42005123, 41991282, 41876012, 42175045]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB42000000]; State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography [QNHX 2017]","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography","This work is jointly supported by the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. ZDBS-LY-DQC010), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No's 42005123, 41991282; 41876012, and 42175045), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB42000000), and the open fund of State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography (Grant No. QNHX 2017).

Modeling these low-frequency rainfall fluctuations has remained problematic for climate models for many years. Here we show using a combination of state-of-the-art rainfall observations and high-resolution global climate models that changes in organized heavy rainfall events carry most of the rainfall variability in the Sahel at multiannual to decadal time scales. Ability to produce intense, organized convection allows climate models to correctly simulate the magnitude of late-twentieth century rainfall change, underlining the importance of model resolution. Increasing model resolution allows a better coupling between large-scale circulation changes and regional rainfall processes over the Sahel. These results provide a strong basis for developing more reliable and skilful long-term predictions of rainfall (seasons to years) which could benefit many sectors in the region by allowing early adaptation to impending extremes.","[Vellinga, Michael; Roberts, Malcolm; Mizielinski, Matthew S.; Strachan, Jane; Bain, Caroline] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Vidale, Pier Luigi; Demory, Marie-Estelle; Schiemann, Reinhard] Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Vellinga, M (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England.",michael.vellinga@metoffice.gov.uk,"Marie-Estelle, Demory/O-5684-2019; Vidale, Pier Luigi/AAF-6468-2019; Schiemann, Reinhard/K-7755-2012","Marie-Estelle, Demory/0000-0002-5764-3248; Vidale, Pier Luigi/0000-0002-1800-8460; Schiemann, Reinhard/0000-0003-3095-9856; Bain, Caroline/0000-0002-2993-9308","UK DFID/Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Science Research Partnership (CSRP) - UK Department for International Development (DFID); Joint UK DECC/DEFRA Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; NCAS Climate contract for the High Resolution Climate Modelling programme [R8/H12/83/001]; NERC-Met Office JWCRP HRCM; Willis Chair in Climate System Science and Climate Hazards; NERC [jwcrp01003, NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [jwcrp01003, NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK DFID/Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Science Research Partnership (CSRP) - UK Department for International Development (DFID); Joint UK DECC/DEFRA Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; NCAS Climate contract for the High Resolution Climate Modelling programme; NERC-Met Office JWCRP HRCM; Willis Chair in Climate System Science and Climate Hazards; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"M.V. and C.B. were supported by the joint UK DFID/Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Science Research Partnership (CSRP), funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) for the benefit of developing countries.

General circulation models (GCMs) along with projection scenarios are the major sources of uncertainty in climate change projections. Therefore, the selection of appropriate GCMs for a region can significantly reduce uncertainty in climate projections. In this study, 20 GCMs were statistically evaluated in replicating the spatial pattern of monsoon propagation towards Peninsular Malaysia at annual and seasonal time frames against the 20th Century Reanalysis dataset. The performance evaluation metrics of the GCMs for different time frames were compromised using a state-of-art multi-criteria decision-making approach, compromise programming, for the selection of GCMs. Finally, the selected GCMs were interpolated to 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution and bias-corrected using the Asian Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) rainfall as reference data. The results revealed the better performance of BCC-CSM1-1 and HadGEM2-ES in replicating the historical rainfall in Peninsular Malaysia. The bias-corrected projections of selected GCMs revealed a large variation of the mean, standard deviation and 95% percentile of daily rainfall in the study area for two futures, 2020-2059 and 2060-2099 compared to base climate.","[Salman, Saleem A.; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem; Ismail, Tarmizi; Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Nashwan, Mohamed Salem] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport AASTMT, Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Construct & Bldg Engn, 2033 Elhorria, Cairo, Egypt","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport","Ismail, T (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",tarmiziismail@utm.my,"Ismail, Tarmizi/AAO-3422-2020; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem/J-6843-2018; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010","Ismail, Tarmizi/0000-0002-6748-4703; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem/0000-0003-4007-5878; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2622.14J27],Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),"The authors would like to acknowledge Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for providing financial support for this research through RUG Grant Tier 2 Q.J130000.2622.14J27.

Research in Spain began a little over twenty years ago, which was later than in other European countries, and it began in a heterogeneous way, both in the SUDS typology and spatially within the peninsular geography. The main objective of this work has been to know through bibliographic review the state of the art of scientific research of these systems and their relationship with the different types of climates in the country. These structures have a complex and sensitive dependence on the climate, which in the Iberian Peninsula is mostly type B and C (according to the Koppen classification). This means little water availability for the vegetation of some SUDS, which can affect the performance of the technique. To date, for this work, research has focused mainly on green roofs, their capabilities as a sustainable construction tool, and the performance of different plant species used in these systems in arid climates. The next technique with the most real cases analyzed is permeable pavements in temperate climates, proving to be effective in reducing flows and runoff volumes. Other specific investigations have focused on the economic feasibility of installing rainwater harvesting systems for the laundry and the hydraulic performance of retention systems located specifically in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. On the contrary, few scientific articles have appeared that describe other SUDS with vegetation such as bioretention systems or green ditches, which are characteristic of sustainable cities, on which the weather can be a very limiting factor for their development.","[Abellan Garcia, Ana Isabel] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Montes Forestal & Medio N, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Cruz Perez, Noelia; Santamarta, Juan C.] Univ La Laguna ULL, Dept Ingn Agr Naut Civil & Maritima, Tenerife 38206, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad de la Laguna,"Garcia, AIA (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Montes Forestal & Medio N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",ana.abellan.garcia@alumnos.upm.es; ncruzper@ull.edu.es; jcsanta@ull.edu.es,"Santamarta, Juan C./AAZ-2262-2021","Santamarta, Juan C./0000-0002-0269-3029; Abellan Garcia, Ana Isabel/0000-0001-7131-4515; Cruz-Perez, Noelia/0000-0003-1279-0823",,,,,152,3,3,4,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,,,,,,7258,10.3390/su13137258,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137258,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TF8NP,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000670972500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we illustrate the contrast between an interdecadal strong positive phase of the winter Pacific/North American pattern (PNA) in the early 19th century that is described by a PNA reconstruction based on tree rings from northwestern North America, and a slight tendency towards negative winter PNA anomalies during the same period in an ensemble of state-of-the-art coupled climate simulations. Additionally, a pseudo-proxy investigation with the same simulation ensemble allows for assessing the robustness of PNA reconstructions using solely geophysical predictors from northwestern North America for the last millennium. The reconstructed early 19th-century positive PNA anomaly emerges as a potentially reliable feature, although the pseudo-reconstructions are subject to a number of sources of uncertainty and deficiencies highlighted especially at multidecadal and centennial timescales. The pseudo-reconstructions demonstrate that the early 19th-century discrepancy between reconstructed and simulated PNA does not stem from the reconstruction process. Instead, reconstructed and simulated features of the early 19th-century PNA can be reconciled by interpreting the reconstructed evolution during this time as an expression of internal climate variability, which is unlikely to be reproduced in its exact temporal occurrence by a small ensemble of climate simulations. However, firm attribution of the reconstructed PNA anomaly is hampered by known limitations and deficiencies of coupled climate models and uncertainties in the early 19th-century external forcing and background climate state.","[Zanchettin, D.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Zanchettin, D.] Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Bothe, O.] Helmholtz Ctr Geesthacht, HZG, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Lehner, F.; Raible, C.

CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) has received tremendous attention due to its significant role in intensifying global warming. Considering the lack of a timely review on the state-of-the-art progress of promising CCU techniques, developing an appropriate and prompt summary of such advanced techniques with a comprehensive understanding is necessary. Thus, it is imperative to provide a timely review, given the fast growth of sophisticated CO2 capture and utilization materials and their implementation. In this work, we critically summarized and comprehensively reviewed the characteristics and performance of both liquid and solid CO2 adsorbents with possible schemes for the improvement of their CO2 capture ability and advances in CO2 utilization. Their industrial applications in pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture as well as utilization were systematically discussed and compared. With our great effort, this review would be of significant importance for academic researchers for obtaining an overall understanding of the current developments and future trends of CCU. This work is bound to benefit researchers in fields relating to CCU and facilitate the progress of significant breakthroughs in both fundamental research and commercial applications to deliver perspective views for future scientific and industrial advances in CCU.","[Gao, Wanlin; Liang, Shuyu; Huang, Liang; Gao, Yanshan; Wang, Qiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rujie; Wang, Lidong] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Qian; Liu, Yuefeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu; Zheng, Qianwen; Louis, Benoit; Roger, Anne-Cecile] Univ Strasbourg, ICPEES Inst Chim & Proc Energie Environm & Sante, UMR CNRS 7515, 25 Rue Becquerel, F-67087 Strasbourg 2, France; [Xie, Bingqiao; Toe, Cui Ying; Scott, Jason; Amal, Rose] Univ New South Wales, Sch Chem Engn, Particles & Catalysis Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Zhu, Xuancan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Key Lab Power Mech Engn MOE China, Inst Refrigerat & Cryogen, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junya] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng; Heh, Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Atmospher Environm & Pollut Control, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Jo, Changbum; Park, Sang-Eon] Inha Univ, Lab Nanogreen Catalysis, Incheon 402751, South Korea; [Park, Sang-Eon] Inha Univ, Nano Ctr Fine Chem Fus Technol, Dept Chem, Incheon 402751, South Korea","Beijing Forestry University; North China Electric Power University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; University of New South Wales Sydney; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Kunming University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Inha University; Inha University","Wang, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Park, SE (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Lab Nanogreen Catalysis, Incheon 402751, South Korea.;Park, SE (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Nano Ctr Fine Chem Fus Technol, Dept Chem, Incheon 402751, South Korea.",qiangwang@bjfu.edu.cn; separk@inha.ac.kr,"He, Hong/S-2854-2019; Liu, Yuefeng/A-6714-2015; Liang, Shuyu/GRE-7397-2022; Xie, Bingqiao/AAV-8302-2021; He, Hong/GRS-1413-2022; Toe, Cui Ying/X-9226-2019","He, Hong/0000-0001-8476-8217; Liu, Yuefeng/0000-0001-9823-3811; He, Hong/0000-0001-8476-8217; Toe, Cui Ying/0000-0002-8480-5994; Xie, Bingqiao/0000-0001-6582-3401; Amal, Rose/0000-0001-9561-4918","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019JQ03015]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1810209]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Bingtuan [2018BC002]; Beijing Municipal Education Commission through the Innovative Transdisciplinary Program Ecological Restoration Engineering''; Next Generation Carbon Upcycling Project through the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea [2019M1A2A6071804]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Bingtuan; Beijing Municipal Education Commission through the Innovative Transdisciplinary Program Ecological Restoration Engineering''; Next Generation Carbon Upcycling Project through the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019JQ03015), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1810209), the International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Bingtuan (2018BC002), and the Beijing Municipal Education Commission through the Innovative Transdisciplinary Program Ecological Restoration Engineering''.

However, in contrast to the model robustness of simulated extremes at the global scale, the robustness in simulating past and future extremes often diminishes over finer spatial scales. In this study we analyze heat waves simulated by state-of-the-art global climate models over the Australian region. For the first time we present results explicitly detailing the model spread in simulated heat wave trends and climatology for this region for the recent past (1958-2005). As expected, large intermodel spread is observed at the local to regional scale for both heat wave trends and climatology. By analyzing multiple initial condition runs from individual models, we show that model internal variability strongly influences the spatial patterns of heat wave trends, while intermodel differences in heat wave climatology appear more influenced by model uncertainty. From a model evaluation perspective, cluster analysis is shown to be useful in characterizing robust spatial features of heat waves simulated by the models. In contrast to the multimodel mean, where uncorrelated spatial features tend to be averaged out, cluster composites preserve these features. Since previous examinations have tended to focus on the multimodel mean the extent of model spread may have been overlooked. Further examination of the processes that lead to model differences and biases is needed.","[Gibson, Peter B.; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E.; Alexander, Lisa V.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gibson, Peter B.; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E.; Alexander, Lisa V.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fischer, Erich M.] Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",University of New South Wales Sydney; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Gibson, PB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Gibson, PB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",peter.gibson@unsw.edu.au,"Fischer, Erich/B-6067-2011; Alexander, Lisa V/A-8477-2011; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/O-5042-2015","Fischer, Erich/0000-0003-1931-6737; Alexander, Lisa V/0000-0002-5635-2457; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/0000-0001-9443-4915; Gibson, Peter/0000-0003-2095-5165",Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; Australian postgraduate Award; ARC [DE140100952],Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); Australian postgraduate Award(Australian Government); ARC(Australian Research Council),"We thank the NCI National Facility at the Australian National University for providing data storage and computational facilities.

For this purpose, a state of art review and calculations were made for the period 1957-2013 using observed hydrological and meteorological data with a water balance approach. Actual evapotranspiration was calculated and validated by empirical formulas. Water storage change analysis was conducted with uncertainty boundaries using a 10-year moving window. Results show that temperature, precipitation, and actual evapotranspiration in the SRYR increased by 0.34 degrees C, 11.4 mm, and 7.6 mm per decade, respectively (significant at 0.05 probability level). Runoff appears to have increased at a rate of 3.3 mm per decade. The SRYR water storage in total has not changed significantly during the period, although the moving average is mostly below zero. Based on the water balance equation, the increase in calculated evapotranspiration is mainly due to the significantly increasing temperature. This in combination with increasing precipitation leads to a relatively stable water storage during the study period. Correlation analyses show that precipitation dominates runoff during the warm season (May to October), while temperature anomalies dominate the runoff during the cold season (November to April). The influence of temperature on runoff seems to enhance during the winter period.","[Du, Yiheng; Berndtsson, Ronny; An, Dong; Zhang, Linus] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hao, Zhenchun; Yuan, Feifei] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 221000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Lund University; Lund University; Hohai University,"Du, YH (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",yiheng.du@tvrl.lth.se; ronny.berndtsson@tvrl.lth.se; dong.an@tvrl.lth.se; linus.zhang@tvrl.lth.se; hzchun@hhu.edu.cn; feifei.yuan@tvrl.lth.se,"Zhang, Linus/ABH-1379-2021; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015","Zhang, Linus/0000-0003-2676-3420; Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Du, Yiheng/0000-0002-5176-8111",National Key Research Projects [2016YFC0402704]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371047]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601711]; Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds [1601027B]; China Scholarship Council,National Key Research Projects; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),Funding from the National Key Research Projects (Grant No. 2016YFC0402704) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41371047) are gratefully acknowledged.

However, climate factors can be unreliable and can lower the effectiveness of prediction when they are applied in locations where climate factors do not differ significantly. The purpose of this study was to improve a dengue surveillance system in areas with similar climate by exploiting the infection rate in the Aedes aegypti mosquito and using the support vector machine (SVM) technique for forecasting the dengue morbidity rate. Methods and Findings Areas with high incidence of dengue outbreaks in central Thailand were studied. The proposed framework consisted of the following three major parts: 1) data integration, 2) model construction, and 3) model evaluation. We discovered that the Ae. aegypti female and larvae mosquito infection rates were significantly positively associated with the morbidity rate. Thus, the increasing infection rate of female mosquitoes and larvae led to a higher number of dengue cases, and the prediction performance increased when those predictors were integrated into a predictive model. In this research, we applied the SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to forecast the high morbidity rate and take precautions to prevent the development of pervasive dengue epidemics. The experimental results showed that the introduced parameters significantly increased the prediction accuracy to 88.37% when used on the test set data, and these parameters led to the highest performance compared to state-of-the-art forecasting models. Conclusions The infection rates of the Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes and larvae improved the morbidity rate forecasting efficiency better than the climate parameters used in classical frameworks. We demonstrated that the SVM-R-based model has high generalization performance and obtained the highest prediction performance compared to classical models as measured by the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and mean absolute error (MAE).","[Kesorn, Kraisak; Ongruk, Phatsavee] Naresuan Univ, Fac Sci, Comp Sci & Informat Technol Dept, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chompoosri, Jakkrawarn; Thavara, Usavadee; Tawatsin, Apiwat] Natl Inst Hlth, Dept Med Sci, Minist Publ Hlth, Nonthaburi, Thailand; [Phumee, Atchara; Siriyasatien, Padet] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Siriyasatien, Padet] King Chulalongkorn Mem Hosp, Excellence Ctr Emerging Infect Dis, Thai Red Cross Soc, Bangkok, Thailand",Naresuan University; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University; Thai Red Cross Society,"Kesorn, K (corresponding author), Naresuan Univ, Fac Sci, Comp Sci & Informat Technol Dept, Phitsanulok, Thailand.",kraisakk@nu.ac.th,"PHUMEE, ATCHARA/AAG-4881-2020; Kesorn, Kraisak/AAU-2475-2020; Kesorn, Kraisak/AAE-8562-2020; siriyasatien, padet/F-3936-2012","PHUMEE, ATCHARA/0000-0001-8243-7406; Kesorn, Kraisak/0000-0002-5195-8038; Siriyasatien, Padet/0000-0002-9248-1678",National Research Council in Thailand [Phor Khor/2555-125]; National Science and Technology Development Agency (Thailand),National Research Council in Thailand; National Science and Technology Development Agency (Thailand),"This research was supported by the National Research Council in Thailand, Project no: Phor Khor/2555-125 and the National Science and Technology Development Agency (Thailand) for a Research Chair Grant.

Quantifying this value, however, might not be straightforward as better forecast quality does not necessarily imply better decisions by the end users, especially when forecasts do not reach their final users, when providers are not trusted, or when forecasts are not appropriately understood. In this study, we contribute an assessment framework to evaluate the operational value of W&C services for informing agricultural practices by complementing traditional forecast quality assessments with a coupled human-natural system behavioural model which reproduces farmers' decisions. This allows a more critical assessment of the forecast value mediated by the end users' perspective, including farmers' risk attitudes and behavioural factors. The application to an agricultural area in northern Italy shows that the quality of state-of-the-art W&C services is still limited in predicting the weather and the crop yield of the incoming agricultural season, with ECMWF annual products simulated by the IFS/HOPE model resulting in the most skillful product in the study area. However, we also show that the accuracy of estimating crop yield and the probability of making optimal decisions are not necessarily linearly correlated, with the overall assessment procedure being strongly impacted by the behavioural attitudes of farmers, which can produce rank reversals in the quantification of the W&C services operational value depending on the different perceptions of risk and uncertainty.","[Li, Yu; Castelletti, Andrea] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Wolfgang Pauli Str 15, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Giuliani, Matteo; Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Castelletti, A (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Wolfgang Pauli Str 15, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.;Castelletti, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",andrea.castelletti@polimi.it,"Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020","Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498; LI, YU/0000-0002-6490-5672; Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347",IMPREX; European Commission under Horizon framework programme [641811]; SOWATCH; Fondazione Cariplo [2015-0220],IMPREX; European Commission under Horizon framework programme; SOWATCH; Fondazione Cariplo(Fondazione Cariplo),The work has been partially funded by the IMPREX project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 framework programme (grant no. 641811) and the SOWATCH project funded by Fondazione Cariplo (grant no. 2015-0220).

The main air pollutants are included: NOx, SO2, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), NH3, CO, PM10 and PM2.5, and also CH4. To stay as close as possible to the emissions as officially reported and used in policy assessment, the inventory uses the officially reported emission data by European countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive as the basis where possible. Where deemed necessary because of errors, incompleteness or inconsistencies, these are replaced with or complemented by other emission data, most notably the estimates included in the Greenhouse gas Air pollution Interaction and Synergies (GAINS) model. Emissions are collected at the high sectoral level, distinguishing around 250 different sector-fuel combinations, whereafter a consistent spatial distribution is applied for Europe. A specific proxy is selected for each of the sector-fuel combinations, pollutants and years. Point source emissions are largely based on reported facility-level emissions, complemented by other sources of point source data for power plants. For specific sources, the resulting emission data were replaced with other datasets. Emissions from shipping (both inland and at sea) are based on the results from a separate shipping emission model where emissions are based on actual ship movement data, and agricultural waste burning emissions are based on satellite observations. The resulting spatially distributed emissions are evaluated against earlier versions of the dataset as well as against alternative emission estimates, which reveals specific discrepancies in some cases. Along with the resulting annual emission maps, profiles for splitting particulate matter (PM) and NMVOCs into individual components are provided, as well as information on the height profile by sector and temporal disaggregation down to the hourly level to support modelling activities. Annual grid maps are available in csv and NetCDF format (https://doi.org/10.24380/0vzb-a387, Kuenen et al., 2021).","[Kuenen, Jeroen; Dellaert, Stijn; Visschedijk, Antoon; Super, Ingrid; Denier van der Gon, Hugo] TNO, Dept Climate Air & Sustainabil, Princetonlaan 6, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka] FMI, Dept Atmospher Composit Res, POB 503, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research,"Kuenen, J (corresponding author), TNO, Dept Climate Air & Sustainabil, Princetonlaan 6, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",jeroen.kuenen@tno.nl,,"Denier van der Gon, Hugo/0000-0001-9552-3688; Super, Ingrid/0000-0001-8252-5983; Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka/0000-0001-8454-4109",Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS); Horizon 2020 framework programme H2020 Societal Challenges (VERIFY) [776810]; Horizon 2020 framework programme H2020 Societal Challenges CHE [776186],Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS); Horizon 2020 framework programme H2020 Societal Challenges (VERIFY); Horizon 2020 framework programme H2020 Societal Challenges CHE,"This research has been supported by the Horizon 2020 framework programme H2020 Societal Challenges (VERIFY; grant no. 776810) and CHE (grant no. 776186) as well as the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission.",,60,10,10,8,15,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

After a brief state of the art, two applications for predicting low flows of French rivers are presented. The first one aims at forecasting the probability of occurrence of severe droughts using weather typing within hydrologically homogeneous regions. The relatively poor quality of results in validation suggests that France may not be well suited for this type of approach. The second approach is applied to the Rhine River The rainfall-runoff model GR4J combined with the HBV snow module is forced by a stochastic rainfall generator to provide daily river flows on seven sub-basins for the following 90 days. Results show that a reliable mid term forecasting (<30 days) is possible in the lower catchment but the tool is not able to anticipate low flows in the tipper catchment.","[Sauquet, Eric] Cemagref, HHLY, F-69336 Lyon, France; [Lerat, Julien] Cemagref, UR HBAN, F-92163 Antony, France; [Prudhomme, Christel] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England",INRAE; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Sauquet, E (corresponding author), Cemagref, HHLY, 3 Bis Quai Chauveau,CP 200, F-69336 Lyon, France.",cric.sauquet@cemagref.fr; julien.lerat@cemagref.fr; c.prudhomme@ceh.ac.uk,"Prudhomme, Christel/K-2669-2012","Prudhomme, Christel/0000-0003-1722-2497; Sauquet, Eric/0000-0001-9539-7730; Lerat, Julien/0000-0003-4521-8874",Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010022] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,19,3,3,0,8,SOC HYDROTECHNIQUE FRANCE,PARIS,"25, RUE DES FAVORITES, F 75015 PARIS, FRANCE",0018-6368,,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

Through the dynamic adjustment of the sea surface in response to a possible slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(1,2), a warming climate could also affect regional sea levels, especially in the North Atlantic region(3), leading to high vulnerability for low-lying Florida and western Europe(4-6). Here we analyse climate projections from a set of state-of-the-art climate models for such regional changes, and find a rapid dynamical rise in sea level on the northeast coast of the United States during the twenty-first century. For New York City, the rise due to ocean circulation changes amounts to 15, 20 and 21 cm for scenarios with low, medium and high rates of emissions respectively, at a similar magnitude to expected global thermal expansion. Analysing one of the climate models in detail, we find that a dynamic, regional rise in sea level is induced by a weakening meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, and superimposed on the global mean sea-level rise. We conclude that together, future changes in sea level and ocean circulation will have a greater effect on the heavily populated northeastern United States than estimated previously(7-9).","[Yin, Jianjun] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Schlesinger, Michael E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Climate Res Grp, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Stouffer, Ronald J.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Yin, JJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",yin@coaps.fsu.edu,"Thompson, Renee L/A-9675-2012",,Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI); WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM); Office of Science; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-07ER64470],Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI); WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM); Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank T.L.

The shift has been argued to originate from the underlying El-Nino like sea surface temperature (SST) forcing. This study explores the possibility that the change of the activity of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) can be an additional, if not alternative, contributor to the shift, using the dataset of Yamada et al. (2010) from a global non-hydrostatic 14-km grid mesh time-slice experiment for a boreal-summer case. Within the case-study framework, we develop the hypothesis that an eastward shift of the high-activity area of the MJO, as manifested itself as the significant intra-seasonal modulation of the enhanced precipitation, is associated with the increased tropical cyclogenesis potential over the North central Pacific by regulating cyclonic relative vorticity and vertical shear. In contrast, the North Indian Ocean and maritime continent undergo relatively diminished genesis potential. An implication is that uncertainty in the future tropical cyclogenesis in some part of the Pacific and other ocean basins could be reduced if projection of the MJO and its connection with the underlying SST environment can be better understood and constrained by the improvement of climate models.","[Oouchi, Kazuyoshi; Satoh, Masaki; Yamada, Yohei; Tomita, Hirofumi; Sugi, Masato] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Satoh, Masaki] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Earth Surface Syst, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Tomita, Hirofumi] RIKEN, Adv Inst Computat Sci, Computat Climate Sci Res Team, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo; RIKEN,"Oouchi, K (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",k-ouchi@jamstec.go.jp,"Sugi, Masato/GRY-2736-2022",,,,,,40,2,2,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

The learning required includes but overtakes debate, bringing organisations, individuals and communities into cycles of experiential, cumulative, ad hoc and opportunistic, yet systematic, learning. Current conceptualisations and approaches to learning have not been framed with the requisite level of integrated complexity given our sustainability challenges. This article introduces the action research approach of learning history in an open system' in the service of such learning. Updating the heretofore single-project focussed learning history, we present recent methodological developments for its use in open systems that support a joining up of projects and sites of endeavour to support deeper and accumulating systems' learning.

In many regions this may result in a negative water balance during the vegetative cycle, which can augment the risk of drought and will require mitigation strategies. These strategies, ultimately, will mean the installation of irrigation systems in some winegrowing regions where vines were cultivated historically under rain-fed conditions and growers do not have many years of experience with vine water management. This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art summary of the recent and most important literature on vine water assessment for monitoring and adapting vineyard management strategies to production goals in view of global warming. Plant, soil and atmospheric methods are reviewed, and their advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Recent advances in plant water status measurement reveal the limitation of traditional techniques such as water potential, particularly in the context of drought and high vapor pressure deficit and the discoveries regarding hydraulic and stomatal regulation. New technologies can integrate heterogeneous sources of information collected in the vineyard at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Such new approaches offer new synergies to overcome limitations inherent to plant water status measurement techniques obtained directly or indirectly from proxy measurements.","[Rienth, Markus] Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Oenol, Route Duillier 50, CH-1260 Nyon 1, Switzerland; [Scholasch, Thibaut] Fruit Sci, MIBI, 672 Rue Mas Verchant, F-34000 Montpellier, France",,"Rienth, M (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Oenol, Route Duillier 50, CH-1260 Nyon 1, Switzerland.",markus.rienth@changins.ch,"Rienth, Markus/AAI-5448-2021; Rienth, Markus/AAK-3241-2021","Rienth, Markus/0000-0002-6302-6297",,,,,146,21,21,2,9,INT VITICULTURE & ENOLOGY SOC-IVES,VILLENAVE D ORNON,"INST SCI VIGNE VIN-ISVV, 210 CHEMIN DE LEYSOTTE, VILLENAVE D ORNON, FRANCE",,2494-1271,,OENO ONE,OENE One,,2019,4,,,,619,637,,10.20870/oeno-one.2019.53.4.2403,http://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2019.53.4.2403,,,19,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,KH7JV,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000510827400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Integrating detailed climatic data across spatial and temporal scales into species distribution modelling can help to predict potential changes in biodiversity. Consequently, this type of data can be useful for developing efficient biodiversity management and conservation planning. The provision of such data becomes even more important in highly biodiverse regions, currently suffering from climatic and landscape changes. The Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica (BRMI; Portugal-Spain) is one of the most relevant reserves for wildlife in Europe. This highly diverse region is of great ecological and socio-economical interest, suffering from synergistic processes of rural land abandonment and climatic instabilities that currently threaten local biodiversity. Aiming to optimise conservation planning in the Reserve, we provide a complete dataset of historical and future climate models (1 x 1 km) for the BRMI, used to build a series of distribution models for 207 vertebrate species. These models are projected for 2050 under two climate change scenarios. The climatic suitability of 52% and 57% of the species are predicted to decrease under the intermediate and extreme climatic scenarios, respectively. These models constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the Reserve, which should be further supported by implementing climate and land-use change factors to increase the accuracy of future predictions of species distributions in the study area. New information Herein, we provide a complete dataset of state-of-the-art historical and future climate model simulations, generated by global-regional climate model chains, with climatic variables resolved at a high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km) over the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica. Additionally, a complete series of distribution models for 207 species (168 birds, 24 reptiles and 15 amphibians) under future (2050) climate change scenarios is delivered, which constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the reserve.","[Campos, Joao C.; Rodrigues, Sara; Honrado, Joao P.] InBIO CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Porto, Portugal; [Freitas, Teresa; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CITAB Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroambientais & Biol, Apartado 1013, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Regos, Adrian] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Zool Xenet & Antropol Fis, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade do Porto; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Campos, JC (corresponding author), InBIO CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Porto, Portugal.",jc_campos@cibio.up.pt,"Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011; Regos, Adrian/M-5207-2014; Campos, Joao Carlos/L-7901-2013","Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078; Regos, Adrian/0000-0003-1983-936X; Freitas, Teresa Raquel/0000-0001-5209-0237; Alves Cordeiro Rodrigues, Sara Filipa/0000-0002-7714-5799; Campos, Joao Carlos/0000-0002-9144-4680","Portuguese national funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., under the FirESmart project [PCIF/MOG/0083/2017]; project INMODES - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2017-89999-C2-2-R]; Xunta de Galicia [ED481B2016/084-0]; IACOBUS programme (INTERREG V-A Espana-Portugal, POCTEP 2014-2020); National Funds by FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04033/2020]","Portuguese national funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., under the FirESmart project; project INMODES - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission); IACOBUS programme (INTERREG V-A Espana-Portugal, POCTEP 2014-2020); National Funds by FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology","This research was supported by Portuguese national funds through FCT -Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., under the FirESmart project (PCIF/MOG/0083/2017) and by project INMODES (CGL2017-89999-C2-2-R), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.

However, although anthropogenic disturbance in Labrador, Canada is low, caribou populations in this region are declining. Given that other mechanisms must be influencing these populations, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of hypotheses of the direct and indirect influences of climate on survival for 257 adult female boreal caribou from 5 populations over nearly two decades. Caribou survival was determined using known-fate models in MARK and an information-theoretic approach was used to evaluate multiple models of adult female caribou survival. Model sets examining monthly and annual changes in survival and the influence of a series of climatic conditions were constructed for each local population. Patterns of annual and within-year survival varied among populations. Moderate to high survival rates were documented for the majority of populations, but lower and more variable survival occurred in a population that had undergone a significant decline. Predation by wolves was the most important source of mortality, and seasonal incursions of 1000s of migratory caribou into boreal caribou wintering ranges may have led to apparent competition for populations with significant range overlap. Although the influence of climate on adult female boreal caribou survival was generally low, survival was weakly but positively related to snowfall, and negatively related to freezing rain during the fall. However, given that any variation in adult female survival has the potential to influence population trends, evaluating the influence of climatic factors on survival improves knowledge of the mechanisms underlying caribou population dynamics in a changing environment. These results, combined with the general declines in these populations, suggest that the disturbance-apparent competition paradigm which is the prominent hypothesis explaining declines in caribou populations in North America, requires a broader interpretation.

To address these issues, a web-based platform was developed to enable discovery and access to key environmental information for the region. This platform covers: landuse, climate, and demographic scenarios; hydrology and related water vulnerability and scarcity; as well as beach erosion. Each data set has been obtained with state-of-the-art modelling tools from available monitoring data using appropriate validation methods. These analyses were conducted using global and regional data sets. The data sets are intended for national to regional assessments, for instance for prioritizing environmental protection projects and investments.

Three mixing assumptions were considered, including external (EM), internal (IM, BC-core surrounded by well mixed scattering-shells) and partially internal (PIM, 32.2% of sulfate and nitrate, 35.5% of BC and 48.5% of OC were internally mixed) mixtures. Results indicated that high levels of anthropogenic aerosols were found in Southwest and Central to East China. Regional mean surface loadings of sulfate, nitrate, BC, primary OC over China were 9.56, 3.64, 2.30, and 2.99 mu g m(-3), respectively. PIM-aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo, which were consistent with AERONET and satellite observations, were 0.51 +/- 0.37 and 0.95 +/- 0.02 in Central to East China, implying that proportions of internally mixed aerosols in PIM were reasonable to some degrees. Both aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) and corresponding climate responses were sensitive to aerosol mixing states and BC/OC hygroscopicities. The more BC was internally mixed or hydrophilic, the more solar radiation was absorbed, thus leading to more decreases in cloud amount (CA) and subsequently less surface cooling. Combining with the uncertainties of BC/OC hygroscopicities, regional mean PIM-aerosol DRF at the top of atmosphere ranged from -0.78 to -0.61 W m(-2) in all-sky and from -5.24 to -4.95 W m(-2) in clear-sky. Additionally, responses of cloud amount and water path, total column absorbed solar radiation (TCASR), surface air temperature and precipitation (TP) to PIM-aerosol DRFs over China were about -0.45 similar to -0.37%, -0.44 similar to -0.32 g m(-2), +0.69 similar to +0.72 W m(-2), -0.13 similar to -0.11 K and -4.56 similar to -4.29%, respectively. These responses were also sensitive to the lateral boundary condition perturbations especially for CA, TCASR and TP, while DRFs themselves were not. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How then can this report, acknowledging so many of those aspects of climate change that render CBA an unsuitable tool for generating policy recommendations, go ahead to conduct a global CBA and make policy recommendations? I explain how issues are suppressed and sidelined in a careful and methodical manner, with the pretence they have been addressed by'state of the art'solutions.

The analysis shows that the simulated fields of 2-m air temperature, precipitation, and snow water equivalent by the RCMs closely match the observations with similar multiyear means and a high correlation of the monthly anomalies. The climatic conditions responsible for the 2011 flood are generally well simulated by the RCMs. The use of multidecadal RCM simulations facilitates the identification of anomalies that contributed to the flood. The flood was linked to a combination of factors: the 2010/11 winter was cold and snowy, the snowmelt in spring was fast, and there was a record amount of precipitation in April and May. Driven by outputs from the RCMs, HSAMI was able to reproduce the mean hydrograph of the Richelieu River, but it underestimated the peak of the 2011 flood. HSAMI adequately computes the water transport from the mountains to the river mouth and the storage effect of Lake Champlain, which dampens the flood over a long period. Overall, the results suggest that RCM simulations can be useful for reconstructing high-resolution climate information and providing new variables that can help better understand the causes of extreme climatic events.","[Lucas-Picher, Philippe; Laprise, Rene] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Terre & Atmosphere, Ctr Etud & Simulat Climat Echelle Reg, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Lucas-Picher, Philippe; Riboust, Philippe] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Dept Genie construct, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Somot, Samuel] Meteo France CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Lucas-Picher, P (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Terre & Atmosphere, Ctr ESCER, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",plp@sca.uqam.ca,"Somot, Samuel/A-7585-2008","Lucas-Picher, Philippe/0000-0001-8707-7745; Somot, Samuel/0000-0002-5066-2921; Philippe, Riboust/0000-0001-9244-524X","Quebec's Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies; Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE) Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction and Response (MEOPAR)","Quebec's Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies; Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE) Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction and Response (MEOPAR)","This study was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from Quebec's Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies and a visiting scientist position at Meteo-France to the first author and by a grant from the Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE) Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction and Response (MEOPAR).",,56,11,11,1,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

This subject will continue to attract attention especially as the world strives to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy. Despite the numerous benefits associated with hydropower, the sustainability of some hydropower plants is being threatened due to low inflows often associated with climate change. Free surface vortices associated with low water levels or submergence at plant intakes can have very detrimental consequences on the operation of hydropower plants if not addressed. Notwithstanding this, free surface vortex flows have also been found to be very relevant in emerging technologies such as the water vortex hydropower plant system. This paper, therefore, presents a state-of-the-art review of the subject including summarised historical findings, but with an emphasis on current developments, findings and research gaps to guide practitioners and researchers. In response to the research gaps identified, the authors make a number of recommendations for further studies which include establishing relationships between free surface vortices formation and turbine efficiency, development of more accurate models for critical submergence and free surface vortices, assessment of free surface vortices at multiple and multi-level intakes, establishing the relationship between free surface vortices and sediment transport at intakes, application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) shape optimization tools for intake and anti-vortex device optimisation, as well as the continuing development of CFD tools to simulate air-entrained vortices at hydropower intakes.

At least nine rock slope failures >1 km(3) in volume,two of which involved similar to 10 km(3), have been identified in the Tien Shan. Thanks to an arid climate many of these formerly river-blocking rockslides and long-runout rock avalanches are well preserved, and both their morphology and internal structure may be readily studied in detail. Here we briefly describe the state-of-the-art and planned future international collaborations in research on rock-slope failures in the Tien Shan.","Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geospheres Dynam, Moscow, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Sadovsky Institute of Geosphere Dynamics of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Strom, AL (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geospheres Dynam, Leninskiy Av,38-1, Moscow, Russia.",,"Havenith, Hans-Balder HBH/G-8518-2014; Havenith, Hans-Balder/GQP-2342-2022",,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,3-540-28664-0,,,,2005,,,,,109,112,,10.1007/3-540-28680-2_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-28680-2_12,,,4,"Engineering, Geological; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Geology,BDP13,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000234667400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The MJO also serves as a primary source of predictability for global Earth system variability on subseasonal time scales. The MJO remains poorly represented in our state-of-the-art climate and weather forecasting models, however. Moreover, despite the advances made in recent decades, theories for the MJO still disagree at a fundamental level. The problems of understanding and modeling the MJO have attracted significant interest from the research community. As a part of the AGU's Centennial collection, this article provides a review of recent progress, particularly over the last decade, in observational, modeling, and theoretical study of the MJO. A brief outlook for near-future MJO research directions is also provided.","[Jiang, Xianan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jiang, Xianan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Adames, Angel F.] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kim, Daehyun] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Maloney, Eric D.; DeMott, Charlotte A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Lin, Hai] Enviromnent & Climate Change Canada, Rech Previs Numer Atmospher, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Kim, Hyemi] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Zhang, Chidong] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Klingaman, Nicholas P.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Klingaman, Nicholas P.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Colorado State University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; Recherche en Prevision Numerique (RPN); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Jiang, XN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Jiang, XN (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",xianan@ucla.edu,"Maloney, Eric D/A-9327-2008; Adames-Corraliza, Angel F./AAE-6703-2019; Klingaman, Nicholas P/H-4610-2012; DeMott, Charlotte/L-7414-2015","Maloney, Eric D/0000-0002-2660-2611; Adames-Corraliza, Angel F./0000-0003-3822-5347; Klingaman, Nicholas P/0000-0002-2927-9303; Zhang, Chidong/0000-0001-9708-1561; Jiang, Xianan/0000-0002-6010-0527; DeMott, Charlotte/0000-0002-3975-1288; Kim, Hye-Mi/0000-0003-4713-4658; Lin, Hai/0000-0003-4353-0426","WMO WGNE; NOAA Climate Program Office [NA15OAR4310098, NA15OAR4310177, NA17OAR4310261]; NSF [AGS-1652289, AGS-1841754, OCE-1924659]; NOAA CVP Grant [NA18OAR4310299]; NASA CYGNSS Grant [NNX17AH77G]; NASA [80NSSC17K0227]; NOAA [NA18OAR4310300, NA16OAR4310094, NA18OAR4310405]; DOE [DESC0016223, DE-SC0020092]; KMA Grant [KMI2018-03110]; National Centre for Atmospheric Science, a Natural Environmental Research Council collaborative centre; NOAA MAPP Grant [NA16OAR4310071]; DOE RGCM Grant [DE-SC0020324]; NERC [ncas10016, NE/L010976/1] Funding Source: UKRI","WMO WGNE; NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA CVP Grant; NASA CYGNSS Grant; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); KMA Grant; National Centre for Atmospheric Science, a Natural Environmental Research Council collaborative centre; NOAA MAPP Grant; DOE RGCM Grant(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank Editor-in-Chief M.

First, the different types of cellulosic fiber-based packaging materials, which can be used to replace fossil-based packaging materials, are presented for flexible and rigid applications. The focus is on technological solutions with packaging properties that enable the protection of commonly sold food products. The manufacturing processes associated with these cellulosic fiber based materials is described and the environmental impact assessment of 4 selected case studies presented: stand-up pouches, flexible flow wraps, frozen or chilled food trays, and molded pulp lids. A simplified eco-design Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was then performed to compare each solution with its fossil-based counterpart. Differences and similarities between the various cellulosic solutions have been identified. Furthermore, the assessment confirms that cellulosic fiber-based materials have reduced environmental impacts as compared to fossil-based counterparts, if a similar packaging weight is obtained. Indeed, all impacts of plastics are between 3 and 5 kg CO(2)eq/kg, while all impacts of cellulosic fiber-based materials are below 1.5 kg CO(2)eq/kg.","[Schenker, Urs; Missoum, Karim; Vishtal, Alexey; Bras, Julien] Nestle Res, Route Jorat 57, CH-1000 Lausanne 26, Switzerland; [Chardot, Julia] NPTC Waters, 1020 Ave Georges Clemenceau,BP 101, F-88804 Vittel, France",,"Schenker, U; Bras, J (corresponding author), Nestle Res, Route Jorat 57, CH-1000 Lausanne 26, Switzerland.",urswalter.schenker@rdls.nestle.com; julia.chardot@waters.nestle.com; karim.missoum@rd.nestle.com; alexey.vishtal@rd.nestle.com; julien.bras@rd.nestle.com,,"Schenker, Urs/0000-0002-9437-0904",,,,,38,5,5,9,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8617,1879-1344,,CARBOHYD POLYM,Carbohydr.

The response of natural carbon uptake to CO2 and climate change will determine anthropogenic emissions compatible with a target CO2 pathway. For phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), four future representative concentration pathways (RCPs) have been generated by integrated assessment models (IAMs) and used as scenarios by state-of-the-art climate models, enabling quantification of compatible carbon emissions for the four scenarios by complex, process-based models. Here, the authors present results from 15 such Earth system GCMs for future changes in land and ocean carbon storage and the implications for anthropogenic emissions. The results are consistent with the underlying scenarios but show substantial model spread. Uncertainty in land carbon uptake due to differences among models is comparable with the spread across scenarios. Model estimates of historical fossil-fuel emissions agree well with reconstructions, and future projections for representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) and RCP4.5 are consistent with the IAMs. For high-end scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), GCMs simulate smaller compatible emissions than the IAMs, indicating a larger climate-carbon cycle feedback in the GCMs in these scenarios. For the RCP2.6 mitigation scenario, an average reduction of 50% in emissions by 2050 from 1990 levels is required but with very large model spread (14%-96%). The models also disagree on both the requirement for sustained negative emissions to achieve the RCP2.6 CO2 concentration and the success of this scenario to restrict global warming below 2 degrees C. All models agree that the future airborne fraction depends strongly on the emissions profile with higher airborne fraction for higher emissions scenarios.","[Jones, Chris; Robertson, Eddy; Liddicoat, Spencer] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Arora, Vivek] Victoria Univ, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Shevliakova, Elena] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ USA; [Bopp, Laurent] CEA, CNRS, UVSQ, IPSL,LSCE, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Brovkin, Victor; Reick, Christian H.; Segschneider, Joachim] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Hajima, Tomohiro; Kawamiya, Michio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Kato, Etsushi] Ctr Global Environm Res, Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Lindsay, Keith] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Roelandt, Caroline; Tjiputra, Jerry] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); University of Victoria; University of Exeter; Princeton University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Max Planck Society; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Bergen,"Jones, C (corresponding author), Hadley Ctr, Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",chris.d.jones@metoffice.gov.uk,"Kawamiya, Michio/GPS-7720-2022; Jones, Chris/I-2983-2014; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Brovkin, Victor/C-2803-2016; Shevliakova, Elena/J-5770-2014; bopp, laurent/ABF-5302-2020; Kato, Etsushi/Q-2623-2018; Brovkin, Victor/I-7450-2012; Tjiputra, Jerry/AAB-5896-2022","Jones, Chris/0000-0002-7141-9285; Friedlingstein, Pierre/0000-0003-3309-4739; Brovkin, Victor/0000-0001-6420-3198; bopp, laurent/0000-0003-4732-4953; Kato, Etsushi/0000-0001-8814-804X; Tjiputra, Jerry/0000-0002-4600-2453",Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; EU-FP7 COMBINE project [226520]; EU-FP7 CARBOCHANGE project [284679]; Research Council of Norway through the EarthClim project [207711/E10]; National Science Foundation,Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; EU-FP7 COMBINE project; EU-FP7 CARBOCHANGE project; Research Council of Norway through the EarthClim project(Research Council of Norway); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation.; MOHC authors were supported by the Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme (GA01101), and work to perform HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM CMIP5 simulations was supported by the EU-FP7 COMBINE project (Grant 226520).

To date, NH3 has mostly been synthesized by the Haber-Bosch process in industry. Under the ever-increasing pressure of the fossil fuel depletion crisis and anthropogenic global climate change with continuous CO2 emission in the 21st century, research targeting the synthesis of NH3 under mild conditions in a sustainable and environment friendly manner is vigorous and thriving. Therefore, the focus of this review is the state-of-the-art engineering of efficient photocatalysts for dinitrogen (N-2) fixation toward NH3 synthesis. Strenuous efforts have been devoted to modifying the intrinsic properties of semiconductors (i.e. poor electron transport, rapid electron-hole recombination and sluggish reaction kinetics), including nanoarchitecture design, crystal facet engineering, doping and heterostructuring. Herein, this review provides insights into the most recent advancements in understanding the charge carrier kinetics of photocatalysts with respect to charge transfer, migration and separation, which are of fundamental significance to photocatalytic N-2 fixation. Subsequently, the challenges, outlooks and future prospects at the forefront of this research platform are presented. As such, it is anticipated that this review will shed new light on photocatalytic N-2 fixation and NH3 synthesis and will also provide a blueprint for further investigations and momentous breakthroughs in next-generation catalyst design.","[Chen, Xingzhu; Li, Neng; Kong, Zhouzhou; Zhao, Xiujian] Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Silicate Mat Architectures, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Neng] Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Ong, Wee-Jun] ASTAR, IMRE, 2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138634, Singapore",Wuhan University of Technology; University of Cambridge; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Materials Research & Engineering (IMRE),"Li, N (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Silicate Mat Architectures, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Li, N (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England.;Ong, WJ (corresponding author), ASTAR, IMRE, 2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138634, Singapore.",lineng@whut.edu.cn; ongwj@imre.a-star.edu.sg,"Ong, Wee-Jun/O-1403-2013; Zhao, Xiujian/E-1499-2011; Li, Neng/V-8235-2019","Ong, Wee-Jun/0000-0002-5124-1934; Zhao, Xiujian/0000-0002-2517-2605; Li, Neng/0000-0001-9633-6702","China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201606955033]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51461135004]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2015CFB227]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; research board of the State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures; Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore","China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); research board of the State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures; Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR))","N.

This work was undertaken to address the unmet need for a permanent and unified object specific sensory and digital data labelling system for fine art objects that does not require large-scale wireless infrastructure. The sensor-tags are demonstrated in a six-month pilot study to evaluate the temperature and humidity buffering performance of a microclimate enclosure (MCE) constructed to protect a late C16th panel painting. The framed painting fitted with NFC sensor-tags was hung in a busy, and environmentally uncontrolled, Cambridge college dining hall to mimic a typically large, semipublic exhibition space. The resulting visibility of climatic conditions and the detailed analytics made possible from the data sets harvested from the NFC sensor-tags have provided invaluable information to the painting conservators.

To support this effort and facilitate comparisons between observations and model results, a long transient simulation with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtension (WACCM-X) from 1950 to 2015 was conducted. This simulation used realistic variations in solar and geomagnetic activity, main magnetic field changes, and trace gas emissions, including CO2, thereby including all known drivers of upper atmosphere climate change. Analysis of the full 1950-2015 interval with a standard multilinear regression approach demonstrated difficulties in removing solar cycle effects sufficiently to obtain reliable trends. Results improved when an (F10.7a)(2) was included in the regression model, in addition to terms for F10.7a, KP, and the trend itself. Comparisons with previous studies and analysis of spatial variations in trend estimates confirmed that the increase in CO2 concentration is the main driver of trends in thermosphere temperature and density, but at high (magnetic) latitudes effects of main magnetic field changes play a role as well, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Spatial patterns of trends in h(m)F(2), NmF(2), and total electron content indicate a superposition of CO2 and geomagnetic field effects, with the latter dominating trends in the region of similar to 50-20 degrees N, similar to 60 degrees W to 20 degrees E. Additional model experiments to investigate the indirect dynamical effects of climate change in the lower atmosphere (<50 km) on the upper atmosphere (>100 km) suggested that these effects are small and insignificant. However, current model limitations could mean that these effects are underestimated. Plain Language Summary A simulation with a state-of-the-art global model of the atmosphere from the surface up to about 500-km altitude was done for the period 1950-2015 to study climate change in the upper atmosphere (above 100-km altitude). The simulation included realistic variations in solar and geomagnetic activity, the Earth's magnetic field, and trace gas emissions, including CO2. Solar and geomagnetic activity variations occur naturally as part of the similar to 11-year solar cycle and have a large effect on the upper atmosphere. Still, by removing these effects as much as possible, we showed that the increase in CO2 concentration is the main cause of cooling in the upper atmosphere, while effects of magnetic field changes also play a role near the poles, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term trends in the charged portion of the upper atmosphere, the ionosphere, are caused by both CO2 and magnetic field effects, with the latter being most important in the region of similar to 50 degrees S to 20. N, similar to 60 degrees W to 20 degrees E. Additional model experiments to investigate effects of climate change in the lower atmosphere (<50 km) on the upper atmosphere suggested that these are small. However, they might be underestimated by the model.","[Cnossen, I.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey,"Cnossen, I (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England.",inos@bas.ac.uk,"Cnossen, Ingrid/E-5809-2010","Cnossen, Ingrid/0000-0001-6469-7861",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Independent Research Fellowship [NE/R015651/1]; NERC [bas0100031] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Independent Research Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),I.

While some critical management studies researchers go on to stress the necessity of fundamental paradigm shifts, even this more radical discourse by and large fails to provide an imaginative, hopeful vision for organizational practice and theorizing in the service of ecological sustainability. We propose that an eschatological imagination' would add a much-needed action- and future-oriented dimension to the critical management studies research agenda on sustainability. Eschatology focuses on the coming of a new era through a concern with the creative overcoming of hegemonic stories through the enactment of counter-stories. We present three framebreaking qualities of eschatology: first, a rhetoric of hope'; second, the aesthetic harmonization of contrasts'; and third, possibilities for flexible imitation'. Drawing on the work of Gregory Bateson as an illustrative counter-story, we explain how an eschatological framework enables a critical yet imaginative and future-oriented engagement with ecological challenges. Finally, we offer a tentative example of such experimentation: the work of an activist eco-poet which begins to show how defamiliarizing narratives demonstrating these qualities can inform research practice.","[Gaya, Patricia; Phillips, Mary] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Phillips, M (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Dept Management, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England.",Mary.Phillips@Bristol.ac.uk,,"Phillips, Mary/0000-0003-3177-4394",,,,,106,15,15,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,NOV,2016,6,,,,803,824,,10.1177/1350508415619240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350508415619240,,,22,Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Business & Economics,EB9XQ,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000387751600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Large scale development of variable renewable energy, which is regarded as non-dispatchable, requires additional power system quality services such as voltage regulation, frequency regulation and inertial response. Energy storage provides an important means to supply these services but there are many uncertainties in terms of technology, market readiness, economics, and regulatory requirements. The aim of this study is to undertake a global state-of-the-art review of the techno-economic and regulatory status of energy storage and power quality services at the distribution level. The review will establish the global trends in electricity markets that have seen high levels of renewable energy penetration. The results of the investigation indicate that further research is required to qualify, quantify, and value the installation of mass energy storage particularly at the distribution level.

To contribute to typicity assessment, the soils (morphology, mineralogy, chemical and physical analyses), parent material (geologic maps and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry) and climate (temperature and precipitation) were characterized in seven vineyards located in the state of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, Brazil, by carrying out state-of-the-art terroir analysis and assessing the environmental variations of the study sites. A soil profile was described and sampled in the central part of each vineyard. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) biplots were used to analyze the relationships between these factors and the composition of wines (2016, 2017 and 2018 harvests) produced from Syrah in commercial vineyards in different municipalities of Tres Coracees (TC). Cordislandia (COR), Andradas (AND), Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso (SSP), Tres Pontas (TP), Espirito Santo do Pinhal (PIN) and ltobi (ITO). The vineyards were grouped according to soil and climate characteristics. Group A was composed of COR, AND and PIN vineyards, which exhibited the highest correlation with soil Al3+ content and accumulated rainfall. The group's wines had the lowest ash alkalinity, total polyphenol index (TPI) and pH values and the highest fixed acidity. Group B consisted of the TP and TC vineyards, which had the highest soil organic matter and boron contents and the highest thermal amplitude with similar values (15.4 degrees C in TC and 15.2 degrees C in TP); their wines showed average composition. Group C comprised ITO alone, which was characterized by the shallowest and least developed soils. Its wine had the highest flavonol content and high dry extract, color intensity, TPI, alcohol content and sugar values. Group D contained the SSP vineyard, in which the soil subsurface horizons were correlated with the highest wine pH. Late harvest in this vineyard caused the most dehydration of grapes and consequent concentration of most wine compounds (human effect on terroir). The terroir information produced in this study adds substantial value to the wines produced under the tropical environmental conditions of southeastern Brazil, for which such studies are very rare. By characterizing the natural factors (soil, soil parent material and climate) and human factors (vineyard management and wine characteristics) related to terroir, this study can also provide historical information about the wine from this emergent region (the historical factors). In addition, its results can be used to guide producers in their choice of vineyard cultivation sites according to preference in wine composition.","[Marcolino Goncalves, Mariana Gabriele; Curi, Nilton; de Menezes, Michele Duarte] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Soil Sci, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Caldeira Brant, Luciana Alves] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Agr, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [da Mota, Renata Vieira; Peregrino, Isabela; de Souza, Claudia Rita; Regina, Murillo de Albuquerque] Agr Res Agcy State Minas Gera, Expt Ctr Caldas, Santa Cruz Ave 500, BR-3778000 Caldas, MG, Brazil; [Fruett, Tatiele; Inda, Alberto Vasconcellos] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Soil Sci, Bento Goncalves Ave 7712, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"de Menezes, MD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Soil Sci, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",michele.menezes@ufla.br,"inda, alberto vasconcellos/H-2984-2012; Vieira da Mota, Renata/K-8193-2016","inda, alberto vasconcellos/0000-0001-5252-0313; Vieira da Mota, Renata/0000-0002-2079-0762; Fruett dos Santos, Tatiele/0000-0003-2678-6374; Gabriele Marcolino Goncalves, Mariana/0000-0003-0143-6482; Curi, Nilton/0000-0002-2604-0866",CAPES (Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel); FAPEMIG (Minas Gerais State Research Support Foundation); CNPq (Brazilian Council of Scientific and Technological Development),CAPES (Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPEMIG (Minas Gerais State Research Support Foundation)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CNPq (Brazilian Council of Scientific and Technological Development)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors would like to thank CAPES (Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), FAPEMIG (Minas Gerais State Research Support Foundation), and CNPq (Brazilian Council of Scientific and Technological Development) for their financial support and for the scholarships provided to the authors.",,70,0,0,6,6,INT VITICULTURE & ENOLOGY SOC-IVES,VILLENAVE D ORNON,"INST SCI VIGNE VIN-ISVV, 210 CHEMIN DE LEYSOTTE, VILLENAVE D ORNON, FRANCE",,2494-1271,,OENO ONE,OENE One,,2022,2,,,,63,79,,10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.2.4617,http://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.2.4617,,,17,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,2V3MH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000823754200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The new energy market and the smart grid paradigm ask for both better demand side management policies and for more reliable forecasts from single end-users, up to system scale. However, it is complex to predict the electric demand owing to the influencing factors such as climate factors, social activities, and seasonal factors. The methods developed for load forecasting are broadly analyzed in two categories, namely analytical techniques and artificial intelligence techniques. In the literature, commonly used analytical methods are linear regression method, Box-Jenkins method, and nonparametric regression method. The analytical methods work well under normal daily circumstances, but they can't give contenting results while dealing with meteorological, sociological or economical changes, hence they are not updated depending on time. Therefore, artificial intelligence techniques have gained importance in reducing estimation errors. Artificial neural network, support vector machine, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system are among these artificial intelligence techniques. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review of three artificial intelligence techniques for short-term electric load forecasting is comprehensively presented.","[Zor, Kasim] Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Adana, Turkey; [Timur, Oguzhan; Teke, Ahmet] Cukurova Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Adana, Turkey",Adana Alparslan Turkes Science & Technology University; Cukurova University,"Zor, K (corresponding author), Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Adana, Turkey.",kzor@adanabtu.edu.tr; otimur@cu.edu.tr; ahmetteke@cu.edu.tr,"TEKE, Ahmet/A-9464-2010; Zor, Kasım/F-4743-2018; Timur, Oguzhan/J-4689-2018","TEKE, Ahmet/0000-0003-2610-9576; Zor, Kasım/0000-0001-6443-114X; Timur, Oguzhan/0000-0002-6537-7840",Scientific Research Project Unit of Cukurova University [FBA-2017-8252],Scientific Research Project Unit of Cukurova University(Cukurova University),"The authors would like to acknowledge the Scientific Research Project Unit of Cukurova University owing to research and financial support for the project named as Electric Demand Prediction: Data Acquisition, Implementation of ANN, and User Interface Design and numbered as FBA-2017-8252.",,64,24,24,1,12,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6409-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,7,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BJ5IN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000425930300045,View Full Record in Web of Science

All the models realistically reproduce a climatological annual mean of global air mass (AM) close to the ERA-Interim AM during 1989-2005. Surprisingly, the global AM in half of the models shows nearly no seasonal variation, which does not agree with the seasonal processes of global precipitable water or water vapor, given the mass conservation constraint. To better understand the inconsistencies, we evaluated the seasonal cycles of global AM tendency and water vapor source (evaporation minus precipitation). The results suggest that the inconsistencies result from the poor balance between global AM tendency and water vapor source based on the global AM budget equation. Moreover, the cross-equatorial dry air mass flux, or hemispheric dry mass divergence, is not well represented in any of the 20 CMIP5 models, which show a poorly matched seasonal cycle and notably larger amplitude, compared with the hemispheric tendencies of thy AM in both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Pronounced erroneous estimations of tropical precipitation also occur in these models. We speculate that the large inaccuracy of precipitation and possibly evaporation in the tropics is one of the key factors for the inconsistent cross-equatorial mass flux. A reasonable cross-equatorial mass flux in well-balanced hemispheric air mass and moisture budgets remains a challenge for both reanalysis assimilation systems and climate modeling.","[Qin Yu-jing; Lu Chu-han; Guan Zhao-yong; Zhi Hai] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Lu, CH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",luchuhan@nuist.edu.cn,,"qin, yujing/0000-0002-8654-3115","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province grant [BIC2012465]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41205065, 41475045, 41005046]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB428602]; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province grant(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution,"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province grant (BIC2012465); National Natural Science Foundation of China (41205065, 41475045, 41005046); National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB428602); Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution",,22,0,0,0,9,JOURNAL  OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGICAL PRESS,GUANGZHOU,"6 FU JIN RD, GUANGZHOU, 510080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1006-8775,,,J TROP METEOROL,J.

This requires, before all, robust climate change information from the present-day state-of-the-art climate models. However, the robustness of climate change projections highly depends upon the fidelity of climate modeling experiments. Hence, this study assesses the fidelity of seven dynamically refined (0.44 degrees) experiments, performed under the framework of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for South Asia (CX-SA), and additionally, their six coarse-resolution driving datasets participating in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5). We assess fidelity in terms of reproducibility of the observed climatology of temperature and precipitation, and the seasonality of the latter for the historical period (1971-2005). Based on the model fidelity results, we further assess the robustness or uncertainty of the far future climate (2061-2095), as projected under the extreme-end warming scenario of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. Our results show that the CX-SA and their driving CMIP5 experiments consistently feature low fidelity in terms of the chosen skill metrics, suggesting substantial cold (6-10 degrees C) and wet (up to 80%) biases and underestimation of observed precipitation seasonality. Surprisingly, the CX-SA are unable to outperform their driving datasets. Further, the biases of CX-SA and of their driving CMIP5 datasets are higher in magnitude than their projected changes under RCP8.5and hence under less extreme RCPsby the end of 21st century, indicating uncertain future climates for the Indus Basin watersheds. Higher inter-dataset disagreements of both CMIP5 and CX-SA for their simulated historical precipitation and for its projected changes reinforce uncertain future wet/dry conditions whereas the CMIP5 projected warming is less robust owing to higher historical period uncertainty. Interestingly, a better agreement among those CX-SA experiments that have been obtained through downscaling different CMIP5 experiments with the same regional climate model (RCM) indicates the RCMs' ability of modulating the influence of lateral boundary conditions over a large domain. These findings, instead of suggesting the usual skill-based identification of 'reasonable' global or regional low fidelity experiments, rather emphasize on a paradigm shift towards improving their fidelity by exploiting the potential of meso-to-local scale climate modelspreferably of those that can solely resolve global-to-local scale climatic processesin terms of microphysics, resolution and explicitly resolved convections. Additionally, an extensive monitoring of the nival regime within the Himalayan watersheds will reduce the observational uncertainty, allowing for a more robust fidelity assessment of the climate modeling experiments.","[ul Hasson, Shabeh; Boehner, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Hamburg, Germany; [ul Hasson, Shabeh] Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Chishtie, Farrukh] SERVIR Mekong, Asian Disaster Preparedness Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand",University of Hamburg,"ul Hasson, S (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Hamburg, Germany.;ul Hasson, S (corresponding author), Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.",shabeh.hasson@uni-hamburg.de,"Boehner, Juergen/I-9844-2014; hasson, shabeh ul/D-5672-2014; Chishtie, Farrukh/GVU-1414-2022","Boehner, Juergen/0000-0002-0842-0152; hasson, shabeh ul/0000-0002-7791-9635; Chishtie, Farrukh/0000-0002-6392-6084",,,,,68,15,15,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Two distinct regimes emerged from a transition in the spectral exponents, . The weather regime covering time-scales<10days with 1; and the macroweather regime extending from a few months to a few decades with 0<<1. Additionally, the spectra showed a generally good statistical agreement amongst several different model- and satellite-based datasets. Detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) revealed three important results which are robust across all datasets: (1) Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship is the dominant mechanism of W non-periodic variability at multi-year time-scales; (2) C-C is not the dominant control of W, P or E non-periodic variability at time-scales below about 6months, where the weather regime is approached and other mechanisms become important; (3) C-C is not a dominant control for P or E over land throughout the entire time-scale range considered. Furthermore, it is suggested that the atmosphere and oceans start to act as a single coupled system at time-scales>1-2 years, while at time-scales<6months they are not the dominant drivers of each other. For global-ocean and full-globe averages, (DCCA) showed large spread of the C-C importance for P and E variability amongst different datasets at multi-year time-scales, ranging from negligible (<0.3) to high (0.6-0.8) values.

Park; Horton, Radley M.",,,Blue Water Trade-Offs With Vegetation in a CO2-Enriched Climate,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FEEDBACKS; ARIDITY,"Present and future freshwater availability and drought risks are physically tied to the responses of surface vegetation to increasing CO2. A single-model large ensemble identifies the occurrence of colocated warming-and CO2-induced leaf area index increases with summer soil moisture declines. This pattern of greening and drying, which occurs over 42% of global vegetated land area, is largely attributable to changes in the partitioning of precipitation at the land surface away from runoff and toward terrestrial vegetation ecosystems. Changes in runoff and ecosystem partitioning are inversely related, with changes in runoff partitioning being governed by changes in precipitation (mean and extremes) and ecosystem partitioning being governed by ecosystem water use and surface resistance to evapotranspiration (ET). Projections show that warming-influenced and CO2-enriched terrestrial vegetation ecosystems use water that historically would have been partitioned to runoff over 48% of global vegetated land areas, largely in Western North America, the Amazon, and Europe, many of the same regions with colocated greening and drying. These results have implications for how water available for people will change in response to anthropogenic warming and raise important questions about model representations of vegetation water responses to high CO2. Plain Language Summary Using a large ensemble of simulations from a state-of-the-art Earth System Model, we show that 42% of global vegetated land areas are projected to have greening in the form of additional vegetation growth at the same time as drying in the form of reduced soil moisture in a business-as-usual world. Simultaneous greening and drying is curious and suggests that future ecosystems-which could demand more water due to warmer and longer growing seasons and CO2 fertilization-siphon water that historically would have become the runoff that fills rivers and streams, termed blue water. We show that warming and changes in plant growth from CO2 creates an explicit water trade-off in which future vegetation directly diminishes runoff relatively or absolutely for nearly half of global land areas. Our results have important implications for future water availability, but also point to the crucial importance of resolving model uncertainties associated with terrestrial vegetation and its response to increasing CO2.","[Mankin, Justin S.; Seager, Richard; Smerdon, Jason E.; Cook, Benjamin I.; Williams, A.

Hydro-economic modeling is a state-of-the art approach that can be used to guide the design and implementation of these policies in basins. A major gap in developments of hydro economic modeling to date has been the weak integration of physically-based representations of water sources and uses such as the interaction between ground and surface water resources, to inform complex basin scale policy choices. This paper presents an integrated hydro-economic modeling framework to address this gap with application to an important and complex river basin in Spain, the Jucar basin, for the assessment of a range of climate change scenarios and policy choices. Results indicate that in absence of adequate policies protecting water resources and natural ecosystems, water users will strategically deplete reservoirs, aquifers and river flows for short-term adaptation to climate change, disregarding the impacts on the environment and future human activities. These impacts can be addressed by implementing sustainable management policies. However, these policies could have disproportionate costs for some stakeholders groups, and their opposition may undermine attempts at sustainable policy. These tradeoffs among water policy choices are important guides to the design of policies aimed at basin wide adaptation to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The concentration of CO2, the most important Green House Gas (GHG), has reached to formidable levels. Although carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods have been largely worked upon, they are cumbersome in terms of economy and their long term environmental safety raises a concern. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis which in turn could be used for the production of bioenergy and other value-added products. Despite enormous potential, the production of microalgae for low-value bulk products and bulk products such as biofuels, is heretofore, not feasible. To achieve economic viability and sustainability, major hurdles in both, the upstream and downstream processes have to be overcome. Recent technoeconomic analyses and life-cycle assessments of microalgae-based production systems have suggested that the only possible way for scaling up the production is to completely use the biomass in an integrated biorefinery set-up wherein every valuable component is extracted, processed and valorized. This article provides a brief yet comprehensive review of the present carbon sequestration and utilization technologies, focusing primarily on biological CO2 capture by microalgae in the context of bio-refinery. The paper discusses various products of microalgal biorefinery and aims to assess the opportunities, challenges and current state-of-the-art of microalgae-based CO2 bioconversion, which are essential to the sustainability of this approach in terms of the environment as well as the economy.","[Singh, Jyoti; Dhar, Dolly Wattal] Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Microbiol, Ctr Conservat & Utilisat Blue Green Algae, New Delhi, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute,"Dhar, DW (corresponding author), Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Microbiol, Ctr Conservat & Utilisat Blue Green Algae, New Delhi, India.",dollywattaldhar@yahoo.com,,"Singh, Jyoti/0000-0002-1262-6938","Department of Science and Technology [PDF/2015/001067]; Government of India (GoI), New Delhi, India","Department of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Government of India (GoI), New Delhi, India","This work was supported by grants from Department of Science and Technology (PDF/2015/001067), Government of India (GoI), New Delhi, India.",,97,84,84,29,142,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Discontinuities in the time series, also named inhomogeneities, may lead to biased conclusions in such studies, so they should be detected and corrected. Previous studies have suggested a geostatistical stochastic approach, which uses Direct Sequential Simulation (DSS), as a promising methodology for the homogenisation of precipitation data series. Based on the spatial and temporal correlation between the neighbouring stations, DSS calculates local probability density functions at a candidate station to detect inhomogeneities. Here, we present a new method named gsimcli (Geostatistical SIMulation for the homogenisation of CLImate data), which is an improved and extended version of that approach. This technique is novel in its incorporation of spatial correlation metrics for the homogenisation of climate time series. The method's performance is assessed with annual and monthly precipitation, and monthly temperature data from two regions of the COST-HOME benchmark data set, and the results are compared using performance metrics. We also evaluate a semi-automatic version of the gsimcli method, which performs additional adjustments for sudden shifts. Both gsimcli versions provided similar results in the homogenisation of annual series. The gsimcli method was more efficient in the homogenisation of the benchmark's precipitation series than the original geostatistical approach. The gsimcli approach performed more closely to state-of-the-art procedures in the homogenisation of monthly data than in the homogenisation of annual data. We expect that the proposed procedure will open new perspectives for the development of techniques that detect and correct inhomogeneities in climate data with monthly and sub-monthly resolution.","[Ribeiro, Sara; Caineta, Julio; Costa, Ana Cristina; Henriques, Roberto] Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVA IMS, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Ribeiro, S (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVA IMS, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal.",sribeiro@novaims.unl.pt,"Henriques, Roberto/AAA-2271-2019; Costa, Ana Cristina/D-1906-2010","Henriques, Roberto/0000-0002-4862-8177; Costa, Ana Cristina/0000-0003-2904-1028","'Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia' (FCT), Portugal [PTDC/GEO-MET/4026/2012]","'Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia' (FCT), Portugal(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of 'Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia' (FCT), Portugal, through the research project PTDC/GEO-MET/4026/2012 ('GSIMCLI - geostatistical simulation with local distributions for the homogenization and interpolation of climate data').",,46,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

This quasi-experimental study determined the impact of providing an online adaptation of TBP during the COVID-19 pandemic to urban, low-income, diverse high school students (3 intervention schools assigned to receive TBP-based spoken word program; 3 comparison schools received a non-health focused spoken word program). We used outcomes derived from the Culture of Health framework, including: (1) health-related mind-sets and expectations; (2) sense of belonging; and (3) civic engagement. Students completed pre/post surveys; a subset of adults and youth from all 6 schools completed semi-structured interviews. TBP participation resulted in measurable shifts in students' mind-sets around structural drivers of health and health inequity and increases in plans for future civic engagement.

This paper describes the procedures used to calculate the average totals, frequencies of occurrence, and percentiles that constitute these normals. All parameters were calculated from a single, state-of-the-art dataset of daily observations, taking care to produce normals that were as representative as possible of the full 1981-2010 period, even when the underlying data records were incomplete. In the resulting product, average precipitation totals are available at approximately 9300 stations across the United States and parts of the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean islands. Snowfall and snow-depth statistics are provided for approximately 5300 of those stations, as compared with several hundred stations in the 1971-2000 normals. The 1981-2010 statistics exhibit the familiar climatological patterns across the contiguous United States. When compared with the same calculations for 1971-2000, the later period is characterized by a smaller number of days with snow on the ground and less total annual snowfall across much of the contiguous United States; wetter conditions over much of the Great Plains, Midwest, and northern California; and drier conditions over much of the Southeast and Pacific Northwest. These differences are a reflection of the removal of the 1970s and the addition of the 2000s to the 30-yr-normals period as part of this latest revision of the normals.","[Durre, Imke; Squires, Michael F.; Vose, Russell S.; Arguez, Anthony; Applequist, Scott] NOAA, Natl Climat Data Ctr, Asheville, NC 28801 USA; [Yin, Xungang] ERT Inc, Asheville, NC USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Durre, I (corresponding author), NOAA, NCDC, Rm 504,151 Patton Ave, Asheville, NC 28801 USA.",imke.durre@noaa.gov,"Durre, Imke/AAU-8600-2020; Arguez, Anthony/I-9375-2017; Vose, Russell/GSI-5687-2022","Arguez, Anthony/0000-0002-4664-9767; ",,,,,34,20,20,4,23,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

Despite the reduction of NOx over the years, the Selangor state has captured a higher level of O-3 in year 2011. The measurement result has shown that the surge in O-3 level was attributed to the reduction of NOx/NMHC ratio. This paper hence attempted to identify the role of land use change from 1999 to 2011 on the ground ozone air quality in the tropical urban conurbation, Greater Kuala Lumpur (GKL), Selangor, Malaysia. With the state-of-the-art chemical weather prediction tool, WRFChem, the external synoptic factors and emission inventory were controlled when comparing the chronological land use changes. The results showed that the urban-induced temperature and wind bias in the tropical region has induced stronger wind to disperse the NOx and carries the TVOC from the suburban to the downwind urban region. The reduction of NOx/TVOC has gradually shifted towards the optimum O-3 formation regime in 2011. The formation of highly concentrated ozone becomes more sensitive to the increment of TVOC as the NOx level reduces in the urban. This highlights the essential involvement of TVOC in the ozone formation in lieu of the NOx reduction in the tropical city, a region with growing emitter of reactive biogenic ozone precursors.

CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate change. Effective CO2 emission abatement strategies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are required to combat this trend. There are three major approaches for CCS: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel process. Post-combustion capture offers some advantages as existing combustion technologies can still be used without radical changes on them. This makes post-combustion capture easier to implement as a retrofit option (to existing power plants) compared to the other two approaches. Therefore, post-combustion capture is probably the first technology that will be deployed. This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the research work carried out so far in post-combustion capture with chemical absorption. The technology will be introduced first, followed by required preparation of flue gas from power plants to use this technology. The important research programmes worldwide and the experimental studies based on pilot plants will be reviewed. This is followed by an overview of various studies based on modelling and simulation. Then the focus is turned to review development of different solvents and process intensification.

The challenge is further demonstrated by assessing the ability of various reanalyses in capturing the observed summer rainfall variability in the eastern China and by examining the biases in reanalyses and in a climate model. Summer rainfall forecasts (hindcasts) initiated in May from eight seasonal forecast systems have low forecast skill with linear correlation of -0.3 to 0.5 with observations. The low forecast skill is consistent with the low perfect model score (similar to 0.1-0.3) of atmospheric model forced by observed SST, due to the fact that external forcing (SST) may play a secondary role in the summer rainfall variation in the eastern China. This is a common feature for the climate variation over the middle and high latitude lands, where the internal dynamical processes dominate the rainfall variation in the eastern China and lead to low predictability, and external forcing (such as SST) plays a secondary role and is associated with predictable fraction. Even the reanalysis rainfall has some remarkable disagreements with the observation. Statistically, more than 20% of the observed variance is not captured by the mean of six reanalyses. Among the reanalyses, JRA55 stands out as the most reliable one. In addition, the reanalyses and climate model have pronounced biases in simulating the mean rainfall. These defaults mean an additional challenge in predicting the summer rainfall variability in the eastern China that has low predictability in nature.","[Liang, Ping] Shanghai Meteorol Bur, Shanghai Climate Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zeng-Zhen] NOAA, NWS, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Liu, Yunyun] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaofan] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xingwen] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Plateau Meteorol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Zhejiang University; China Meteorological Administration","Hu, ZZ (corresponding author), NOAA, NWS, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",Zeng-Zhen.Hu@NOAA.GOV,"Liu, Yunyun/AAD-8880-2022; Li, Xiaofan/G-2094-2014; Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011; Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400; Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368","NOAA; NSF; NASA; DOE; National Key Research and Development Plan Major Natural Disaster Monitoring, Warning and Prevention [2017YFC1502301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775047, 41790471]; Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Projects [GYHY201406001]; National Meteorological Science and Technology Innovation project; Young Talents Specially Project of Chinese Meteorological Administration","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Key Research and Development Plan Major Natural Disaster Monitoring, Warning and Prevention; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Projects; National Meteorological Science and Technology Innovation project; Young Talents Specially Project of Chinese Meteorological Administration","We appreciate constructive comments and suggestions from two reviewers as well as the assistance and help of Drs.

Interviews of 58 fishers from 26 harbours and meetings with national fisheries organisations and managers revealed the perception of an offshore movement of coastal cod. Numerical modelling based on fishing survey data did not substantiate these perceptions in the data-poor coastal waters. However, Data Storage Tag (DST) information combined with bottom sea water temperature data from the spatio-temporal hydrodynamic Baltic Sea Ice-Ocean Model showed changes in potential cod habitat distribution in the Skagerrak-Kattegat and western Baltic from 1979 to 2016. Subsequently, cod habitats were defined in three categories: (i) potentially suitable (T <= 12 degrees C); (ii) episodic (12 < T <= 16 degrees C); and (iii) unsuitable (T > 16 degrees C). The environmental changes were linked to the socio-economic component of cod fishery. Cod catches (weight and monetary value) were retrieved using logbook information and data from the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS, 2005-2016) and the Automatic Identification System (AIS, 2006-2016). General additive modelling significantly showed the largest proportion of catches took place in the potentially suitable habitat whereas catches were lower in the episodic habitat and rare in the unsuitable habitat. The results of this first large-scale SAF application are highly valuable for adapting existing fisheries management by: (i) providing information on habitat shrinkage for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) based stock assessments; (ii) adding a spatio-temporal dimension for coastal productivity relative to the vessel-based Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system; and (iii) providing a predictive scenario simulation tool for sustainable management under changing environmental conditions.","[Dinesen, Grete E.; Neuenfeldt, Stefan; Kokkalis, Alexandros; Egekvist, Josefine; Kristensen, Kasper; Munk, Peter; Hussy, Karin; Stottrup, Josianne G.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DTU Aqua, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Lehmann, Andreas] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kid, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Technical University of Denmark; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel,"Dinesen, GE (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DTU Aqua, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",gdi@aqua.dtu.dk,"Støttrup, Josianne/AAJ-5433-2021; Kokkalis, Alexandros/B-8446-2015","Støttrup, Josianne/0000-0002-0921-8773; Kokkalis, Alexandros/0000-0002-9662-6272; Munk, Peter/0000-0002-0968-6083; Neuenfeldt, Stefan/0000-0001-8574-3257; Hussy, Karin/0000-0002-1993-6146; Dinesen, Grete E./0000-0002-6385-1238; Egekvist, Josefine/0000-0001-9619-1443; Kristensen, Kasper/0000-0003-3425-3762","project BONUS BaltCoast through EU BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; Danish Research Council [PUT1439, IUT18-9]; InnovationsFonden, Denmark; Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany [BMBF 03F0717A]","project BONUS BaltCoast through EU BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; Danish Research Council(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); InnovationsFonden, Denmark; Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research has received funding from the project BONUS BaltCoast through EU BONUS (Art 185) funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research 2007-2013 BONUS Implementation Agreement and by the Danish Research Council grants PUT1439 and IUT18-9, technological development and demonstration, and from the Baltic Sea national funding institutions, InnovationsFonden, Denmark and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF 03F0717A).",,57,8,8,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1400-0350,1874-7841,,J COAST CONSERV,J.

The first is an overall long-term forecast, and is based on tree census data of growers in the Australian Macadamia Society (AMS). This data set currently covers around 70% of total production and is supplemented by our best estimates of non-AMS orchards. A statistical model was developed to calculate average yields per tree using growers' historical yields. This model allowed for the effects of tree age, variety, year, region, and tree spacing, and explained 65% of the total variation in the yield per tree data. The second forecast is an annual climate adjustment of the long-term estimates, taking into account the expected effects on production of the previous year's climate. This adjustment is based on historical yields, measured as the percentage deviance between expected and actual production. The dominant climatic variables are observed temperature, rainfall, evaporation, solar radiation, and modelled water stress. Initially, a number of models showed good agreement within the historical data, with jackknife cross-validation R-2 values of up to 97%. However, forecasts varied quite widely between these alternate models. Exploratory multivariate analyses and nearest-neighbour methods were used to investigate these differences. For the first three years, the overall forecasts were in the right direction (when compared with the long-term expected values), but were not sufficiently accurate. Recent results and plans for the future, including monitoring sentinel trees, will be discussed.","[Stephenson, R. A.] Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, Maroochy Res Stn, Nambour, Australia; [Mayer, D.

Here, we use a relatively novel high-resolution Lead-lag (LL) method to identify short time windows with persistent LL relations in the three series during the period from 1947 to 2020. We find that there are roughly 20-year time windows where LL relations change direction at both interannual, high-frequency and multidecadal, low-frequency timescales. However, with varying LL strength, the AMO leads AMOC for the full period at the interannual timescale. During the period from 1980 to 2000, we had the sequence NAO -> AMO -> AMOC -> NAO at the interannual timescale. For the full period in the decadal time scale, we obtain NAO -> AMO -> AMOC. The Ekman variability closely follows the NAO variability. Both single time series and the LL relation between pairs of series show pseudo-oscillating patterns with cycle periods of about 20 years.

We discuss empirical evidence and theoretical models for ontogenetic variation in thermal sensitivity and performance curves (TPCs). Data on lower thermal limits for development (T-0) demonstrate variation between stages within a species that is of comparable magnitude to variation among species; we illustrate the consequences of such ontogenetic variation for developmental responses to changing temperature. Ontogenetic variation in optimal temperatures and upper thermal limits has been reported in some systems, but current data are too limited to identify general patterns. The shapes of TPCs for different fitness components such as juvenile survival, adult fecundity, and generation time differ in characteristic ways, with important consequences for understanding fitness in varying thermal environments.

In the study presented here, a state-of-the-art regional scale atmospheric climate-chemistry-aerosol model REMOTE is used to understand the influence of spatial model resolutions of 1.0 degrees, 0.5 degrees and 0.25 degrees on predicted meteorological and aerosol parameters for June 2003 for the European domain comprising North-east Atlantic and Western Europe. Model precipitation appears to improve with resolution while wind speed has shown best results for 0.25 degrees resolution for most of the stations compared with ECAD data. Low root mean square error and spatial bias for surface pressure, precipitation and surface temperature show that the model is very reliable. Spatial and temporal variation in black carbon, primary organic carbon, sea-salt and sulphate concentrations and their burden are presented. In most cases, chemical species concentrations at the surface show no particular trend or improvement with increase in resolution. There has been a pronounced influence of horizontal resolution on the vertical distribution pattern of some aerosol species. Some of these effects are due to the improvement in topographical details, flow characteristics and associated vertical and horizontal dynamic processes. The different sink processes have contributed very differently to the various aerosol species in terms of deposition (wet and dry) and sedimentation which are strongly linked to the meteorological processes. Overall, considering the performance of meteorological parameters and chemical species concentrations, a horizontal model resolution of 0.5 degrees is suggested to achieve reasonable results within the limitations of this model.

In this context, increased interdependencies of gas, heat and electricity ESs have recently encouraged the planners to design operation and/or expiation strategies in an integrated manner in favor of a new concept, the so-called Energy Hub (EH). Although this concept has been employed so far in a multitude of studies, but its real nature, advantages, difficulties, importance or inevitability aspect, and eventually, its application areas in power industries have remained as open questions from various viewpoints. On the other hand, the difference in the planners' perceptions of the EH concept has caused emerging various definition and models for this. At this point, it is worth reviewing the frameworks proposed for planning the ESs based on the EH approach, while understanding the application areas of the EH, its components, the nature behind presented definitions, and the hierarchy of events/factors drawing the planners attention to this approach, can help to find the answers of the questions. In doing so, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review of existing research works focusing on the operation and/or expansion planning problems of ESs in the context of EH. Reviewing results and findings can be helpful for both researchers new to this field of study by extraction of the distinguishing borders between underlying concepts and presenting an in-depth review on the latest studies, and experts in this research field by summarizing the details of a wide range of relevant works and extracting research gaps.","[Sadeghi, Hadi; Rashidinejad, Masoud; Abdollahi, Amir] Shahid Bahonar Univ, Dept Elect Engn, POB 76169-14111, Kerman, Iran; [Sadeghi, Hadi] Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Young Res Assoc, Energy & Environm Inst, Kerman, Iran; [Moeini-Aghtaie, Moein] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, POB 11365-11155, Tehran, Iran",Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK); Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK); Sharif University of Technology,"Rashidinejad, M (corresponding author), Shahid Bahonar Univ, Dept Elect Engn, POB 76169-14111, Kerman, Iran.",mrashidi@uk.ac.ir,"Rashidinejad, Masoud/AFO-2305-2022; Abdollahi, Amir/GPX-5416-2022","Rashidinejad, Masoud/0000-0002-3046-7088; ",,,,,213,43,44,0,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1359-4311,,,APPL THERM ENG,Appl.

The basin-averaged rainfall progressively decreases with the increase of deforestation from 2000 to 2030, 2050, and so on, to total deforestation by the end of the twenty-first century. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of rainfall is significantly affected by both the land-cover type and topography. While the massively deforested region experiences an important decrease of precipitation, the areas at the edge of that region and at elevated regions receive more rainfall. Propagating squall lines over the massively deforested region dissipate before reaching the western part of the basin, causing a significant decrease of rainfall that could result in a catastrophic collapse of the ecosystem in that region. The basin experiences much stronger precipitation changes during El Niho events as deforestation increases. During these periods, deforestation in the western part of the basin induces a very significant decrease of precipitation. During wet years, however, deforestation has a minor overall impact on the basin climatology.","[Da Silva, Renato Ramos; Werth, David; Avissar, Roni] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Avissar, R (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 90287, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",avissar@duke.edu,"Ramos-da-Silva, Renato/I-4759-2012","Ramos-da-Silva, Renato/0000-0002-3714-0870",,,,,68,79,85,2,36,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Although the degree of efficiency in direct gas feeding is essentially better (71.3 % secondary energy out of primary energy) than in local cogeneration (45.7-57.8 % secondary energy out of primary energy), the greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of local cogeneration in Germany (254-350 g CO2/kWh(biogas)) is much higher than that of direct gas feeding (187-228 9 CO2/kWh(biogas)). The reason for this is that in Germany natural gas, which is substituted through direct gas feeding, is primarily used for heating purposes. Since natural gas has the lowest emissions of all fossil fuels, and as heating installations generate lower emissions per kilowatt hour than power generation, using biogas for direct gas feeding is not the best available solution as regards climate protection in the German context. Because of a higher emission factor for the production of electricity, its substitution with local power plants is privileged. In particular this is true if waste heat arising from cogeneration can be used locally. By contrast with direct gas feeding, the application of innovative and efficient technologies like molten carbonate or solid oxide fuel cells can generate essential improvements of emission reductions in biogas plants. Thanks to higher efficiency factors for the production of electricity, the greenhouse gas reduction capacity of these fuel cells is much better compared with block heat and power plants, which represent the state-of-the-art. Even if no waste heat can be used at the location of the biogas plant, the application of fuel cells is still much better than direct gas feeding or block heat and power plants. For this reason the use of fuel cells in German biogas plants should be promoted.","[Wegener, Jens; Luecke, Wolfgang; Heinzemann, Joerg] Univ Gottingen, Abt Agrartech, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Wegener, J (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Abt Agrartech, Gutenbergstr 37, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",jwegene@gwdg.de,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,7,LEIBNIZ INST AGRICULTURAL ENG POTSDAM-BORNIM E V,POTSDAM,"MAX-EYTH-ALLEE 100, POTSDAM, D-14469, GERMANY",0948-7298,,,AGRARTECH FORSCH-AGR,Agrartech.

Thus, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation of the climate change require the renovation and efficient use of energy of its building stock. Vacuum Insulation Panels represent a very attractive alternative to traditional insulation materials because high thermal performance can be achieved with a smaller thickness of insulation. The article reports a study of heating savings by thermally refurbishing the envelope of a multi-storey residential block with vacuum insulation panels on opaque portions of its east, south, and west elevations. Without the provision of cooling, however, the cladding may cause overheating in some climate conditions. A set of double-and triple-glazed low-emissivity windows with different glazing systems and frames has been designed for use in conjunction with wall cladding and the heating and cooling demands have been analysed for a series of cases. Heat transfer simulations using Trnsys, Window, and Optics have been conducted on the building, located in the cool climate of Berlin and the warm climate of Bilbao, to determine the best combination of insulation and type of window.

In this work we investigate the regional climate and radiative effects of modifying surface albedo to mimic massive deployment of cool surfaces (roofs and pavements) and, separately, photovoltaic arrays across the United States. We use a fully coupled regional climate model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to investigate feedbacks between surface albedo changes, surface temperature, precipitation and average cloud cover. With the adoption of cool roofs and pavements, domain-wide annual average outgoing radiation increased by 0.16 +/- 0.03 W m(-2) (mean +/- 95% C.I.) and afternoon summertime temperature in urban locations was reduced by 0.11-0.53 degrees C, although some urban areas showed no statistically significant temperature changes. In response to increased urban albedo, some rural locations showed summer afternoon temperature increases of up to +0.27 degrees C and these regions were correlated with less cloud cover and lower precipitation. The emissions offset obtained by this increase in outgoing radiation is calculated to be 3.3 +/- 0.5 Gt CO(2) (mean +/- 95% C.I.). The hypothetical solar arrays were designed to be able to produce one terawatt of peak energy and were located in the Mojave Desert of California. To simulate the arrays, the desert surface albedo was darkened, causing local afternoon temperature increases of up to +0.4 degrees C. Due to the solar arrays, local and regional wind patterns within a 300 km radius were affected. Statistically significant but lower magnitude changes to temperature and radiation could be seen across the domain due to the introduction of the solar arrays. The addition of photovoltaic arrays caused no significant change to summertime outgoing radiation when averaged over the full domain, as interannual variation across the continent obscured more consistent local forcing.","[Millstein, Dev; Menon, Surabi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Millstein, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dmillstein@lbl.gov,,,US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH1123]; LBNL; DOE,US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); LBNL; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was supported by the US Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH1123.

The climate patterns, their spatio-temporal variability and change are based on a 40-year (1980-2019) wave hindcast, obtained by combining the ERA5 reanalysis wind forcing with the state-of-the-art WAVEWATCH III spectral wave model and verified against satellite altimetry. Results are presented for the typical (50th percentile) and extreme (99th percentile) significant wave height and, for the first time at the regional Mediterranean Sea scale, for the typical and extreme expected maximum individual wave height of sea states. The climate variability of wind waves is evaluated at seasonal scale by proposing and adopting a definition of seasons for the Mediterranean Sea states that is based on the satellite altimetry wave observations of stormy (winter) and calm (summer) months. The results, initially presented for the four seasons and then for winter and summer only, show the regions of the basin where largest waves occur and those with the largest temporal variability. A possible relationship with the atmospheric parameter anomalies and with teleconnection patterns (through climate indices) that motivates such variability is investigated, with results suggesting that the Scandinavian index variability is the most correlated to the Mediterranean Sea wind-wave variability, especially for typical winter sea states. Finally, a trend analysis shows that the Mediterranean Sea typical and extreme significant and maximum individual wave heights are decreasing during summer and increasing during winter.","[Barbariol, Francesco; Davison, Silvio; Falcieri, Francesco Marcello; Benetazzo, Alvise] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Venice, Italy; [Ferretti, Rossella; Ricchi, Antonio] Univ Aquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Laquila, Italy; [Ferretti, Rossella; Ricchi, Antonio] Ctr Excellence Telesensing Environm & Model Predi, Laquila, Italy; [Sclavo, Mauro] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Polar Sci ISP, Padua, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Neuroscienze (IN-CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); University of L'Aquila; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Neuroscienze (IN-CNR); Istituto di Scienze Polari (ISP-CNR),"Barbariol, F (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Venice, Italy.",francesco.barbariol@cnr.it,"Ricchi, Antonio/AAM-9517-2020; benetazzo, alvise/AGG-0076-2022","Ricchi, Antonio/0000-0002-7061-8442; benetazzo, alvise/0000-0002-9535-4922",,,,,67,10,10,1,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Changes in the size of the forest soil carbon pool could have significant impacts on the European carbon budget. We present the first assessment of future changes in European forest soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks using a dedicated process-based SOC model and state-of-the-art databases of driving variables. Soil carbon change was calculated for Europe using the Rothamsted Carbon model using climate data from four climate models, forced by four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions scenarios (SRES). Changes in litter input to the soil due to forest management, projected changes in net primary production (NPP), forest age-class structure, and changes in forest area were taken into account. Results are presented for mineral soil only. Under some climate scenarios carbon in forest soils will increase slightly (0.1 to 4.6 Pg) in Europe over the 21st Century, whilst for one scenario, forest SOC stocks are predicted to decrease by 0.3 Pg. Different trends are seen in different regions. Climate change will tend to speed decomposition, whereas increases in litter input due to increasing NPP and changing age-class structure will slow the loss of SOC. Increases in forest area could further enhance the total soil carbon stock of European forests. Whilst climate change will be a key driver of change in forest soil carbon, changes in age-class structure and land-use change are estimated to have greater effects.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; European Forest Inst, FIN-80100 Joensuu, Finland; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; Finnish Environm Inst, FIN-00251 Helsinki, Finland",University of Aberdeen; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Universite Catholique Louvain; Finnish Environment Institute,"Smith, P (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Cruickshank Bldg,St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",pete.smith@abdn.ac.uk,"Montanarella, Luca/AAE-7112-2019; Wattenbach, Martin/D-1482-2013; Rounsevell, Mark D A/C-5481-2011; Rounsevell, Mark D A/AAC-4498-2021; Zaehle, Sönke/C-9528-2017; Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Smith, Jo U/F-7763-2012","Wattenbach, Martin/0000-0002-1843-1031; Rounsevell, Mark D A/0000-0001-7476-9398; Zaehle, Sönke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Smith, Jo U/0000-0001-6984-6766; Lindner, Marcus/0000-0002-0770-003X",,,,,38,78,84,3,31,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4271,1918-1841,,CAN J SOIL SCI,Can.

Given the complexity of the various direct and indirect causes and consequences of a drier world, scientific tasks need to be coordinated efficiently. Drought-related research endeavors ranging from individual projects to global initiatives therefore require prioritization. Here, we present 60 priority questions for optimizing future drought research. This topical catalogue reflects the experience of 65 scholars from 21 countries and almost 20 fields of research in both natural sciences and the humanities. The set of drought-related questions primarily covers drought monitoring, impacts, forecasting, climatology, adaptation, as well as planning and policy. The questions highlight the increasingly important role of remote sensing techniques in drought monitoring, importance of drought forecasting and understanding the relationships between drought parameters and drought impacts, but also challenges of drought adaptation and preparedness policies.","[Trnka, Miroslav] Global Change Res Inst AS CR Vvi, Belidla 986-4b, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno,"Trnka, M (corresponding author), Global Change Res Inst AS CR Vvi, Belidla 986-4b, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.;Trnka, M (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",mirek_trnka@yahoo.com,"Hain, Christopher/ABE-7127-2020; Zalud, Zdenek/G-3203-2014; Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.

Most biases are related to an incorrect latitudinal position of the monsoon structures. To disentangle the role of the large-scale dynamics from that of the physical processes in these biases, simulations are performed with the LMDZ general circulation model in which the horizontal winds are nudged toward reanalysis. Wind nudging greatly improves the position of the ITCZ as well as the representation of the components of the surface energy budget directly impacted by the water budget and hence facilitates a more systematic analysis of remaining biases associated with the physics in the model. The great potential of wind nudging to compare the energetics of the atmospheric column in climate models at grid cell scale with station observations, even for coarse grid models, is then shown. Despite the improved water advection and rainfall seasonality in the nudged simulations, errors consisting in a cold bias during the dry season over Sahel, an underestimated seasonal variation of surface albedo, and an overestimation of the solar incoming flux remain. The origin of these remaining biases is further investigated by conducting a series of dedicated sensitivity experiments. Results highlight the key role of the soil thermal inertia, the turbulent mixing efficiency, the surface albedo, and the aerosols and clouds radiative effects in the representation of meteorological 2m-variables and surface energy budget.","[Diallo, F.

The article draws on insights from a series of research, arts and public engagement projects where collaborative scenario-making was explored as a way of opening up civic space in the face of the high levels of uncertainty, global risks and collective action problems associated with climate futures and societal transformations. Scenarios are proposed as rehearsal spaces for more collective modes of responding to the prospect of uncertain futures. The article introduces the conceptual innovation of speculative improvisations, binding together strands from anticipation and futures studies, speculative research, speculative design thinking and participatory action on and engagement in urban futures. The article suggests that thinking and practicing the future otherwise involves considering responses and responsibilities in the present day as well as reconfiguring ways of imagining the future. The article considers the possibilities for speculative improvisations and develops the idea of collective scenarios as the anticipatory framework - or rehearsal - that can support a more vibrant and imaginative sense of how societies can be prepared for uncertain futures.","[Tyszczuk, Renata] Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Tyszczuk, R (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",r.tyszczuk@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Smith, Joe/0000-0002-7674-6699; Tyszczuk, Renata/0000-0001-9556-1502",Leverhulme Trust [MRF-2018-015]; Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Connected Communities programme [AH/L008173/1]; Jerwood Charitable Foundation; Ashden Trust; Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield; Open University's Open Space Research Centre,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Connected Communities programme; Jerwood Charitable Foundation; Ashden Trust; Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield; Open University's Open Space Research Centre,"The Collective Scenarios project is supported by a Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship [MRF-2018-015] .

The present-day tropical Atlantic is one region that exports much locally evaporated moisture away, leading to more saline surface waters in the Atlantic compared to the Indo-Pacific at similar latitudes. Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model equipped with numerical water tracers to show that over half of the atmospheric freshwater exported from the Atlantic originates as evaporation in the northern Atlantic subtropics, primarily between 10 degrees N and 20 degrees N, and is transported across Central America via prevailing easterlies into the equatorial Pacific. We find enhanced moisture export from the Atlantic to Pacific with warming is due to greater distances between moisture source and sink regions, which increases moisture export from the Atlantic at the expense of local precipitation. Distance traveled increases due to longer moisture residence times, not simply Clausius-Clapeyron scaling.","[Singh, Hansi K.

Landslides are responsible for at least 17% of all fatalities from natural hazards worldwide, and nearly 25% of annual casualties caused by natural hazards in Korea. Due to global climate change, the frequency of landslide occurrence has been increased and subsequently, the losses and damages associated with landslides also have been increased. Therefore, accurate prediction of landslide occurrence, and monitoring and early warning for ground movements are very important tasks to reduce the damages and losses caused by landslides. Various studies on landslide prediction and reduction in landslide damage have been performed and consequently, much of the recent progress has been in these areas. In particular, the application of information and geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) has greatly contributed to landslide hazard assessment studies over recent years. In this paper, the recent advances and the state-of-the-art in the essential components of the landslide hazard assessment, such as landslide susceptibility analysis, runout modeling, landslide monitoring and early warning, were reviewed. Especially, this paper focused on the evaluation of the landslide susceptibility using probabilistic approach and physically based method, runout evaluation using volume based model and dynamic model, in situ ground based monitoring techniques, remote sensing techniques for landslide monitoring, and landslide early warning using rainfall and physical thresholds.","[Chae, Byung-Gon] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Planning & Coordinat Div, Daejeon 34131, South Korea; [Park, Hyuck-Jin] Sejong Univ, Dept Geoinformat Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Catani, Filippo] Univ Florence, Dept Earth Sci, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Simoni, Alessandro; Berti, Matteo] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources (KIGAM); Sejong University; University of Florence; University of Bologna,"Park, HJ (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Geoinformat Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",hjpark@sejong.ac.kr,"Catani, Filippo/AHC-3484-2022; Catani, Filippo/B-8518-2016; Simoni, Alessandro/D-6492-2011; Park, Hyuck-Jin/AAY-6787-2021","Catani, Filippo/0000-0001-5185-4725; Simoni, Alessandro/0000-0003-3051-5083; Park, Hyuck-Jin/0000-0001-5429-5180","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP) [NRF-2016R1A2B4008963]; Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of Korea [17-3413]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP); Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of Korea","This research was partly supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Korea government (MSIP) (No. NRF-2016R1A2B4008963) and the Basic Research Project (Grant No. 17-3413) of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of Korea.",,354,142,144,69,386,GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY KOREA,SEOUL,"NEW BLD RM 813, 22, TEHERAN-RO 7-GIL, SEOUL, 06130, SOUTH KOREA",1226-4806,1598-7477,,GEOSCI J,Geosci.

This can improve agricultural production but also increase weather-related risks. In this context, agrometeorological indices can help to better understand the interactions between crops and climate and thus serve as a basis for the development of adaptation strategies. This study investigates two important aspects of crop production, namely the length of vegetation period and drought risks. Our investigation relies on homogenized data series for temperature and precipitation spanning the period 1864-2009 and the latest climate scenarios from the European research project ENSEMBLES. Concerning the length of vegetation period, our results are consistent with the findings of earlier studies. For the Plateau, they suggest by 2050 an extension of about 40 days relative to the reference in the 1970s. Regarding drought risks the picture is less dramatic than previously assumed. This can be explained by the fact that for the first half of the 21st century the ENSEMBLES scenarios show on average only a small tendency toward reduced summer precipitation. On this aspect, however, even the new scenarios are fraught with uncertainty.","[Calanca, Pierluigi; Holzkaemper, Annelie] Forsch Anstalt Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Calanca, P (corresponding author), Forsch Anstalt Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",pierluigi.calanca@art.admin.ch,,,,,,,15,3,4,0,4,AGRARFORSCHUNG,POSIEUX,"AGROSCOPE LIEBEFELD-POSIEUX, POSIEUX, CH-1725, SWITZERLAND",1663-7852,,,AGRARFORSCH SCHWEIZ+,Agrarforschung Schweiz,SEP,2010,9,,,,320,325,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,655ON,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000282259400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, strong vegetation memory has been identified in dryland regions, but the factors underlying the spatial patterns of vegetation memory remain unknown. We aim to map the components and drivers of vegetation memory in dryland regions using state-of-the-art climate reanalysis data and refined approaches to identify vegetation-memory characteristics across dryland regions worldwide. Using a framework which distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic ecological memory, we show that (i) intrinsic memory is a much stronger component than extrinsic memory in the majority of dryland regions and (ii) climate reanalysis datasets change the detection of extrinsic vegetation memory in some global dryland regions. Synthesis. Our study offers a global picture of the vegetation response to two climate variables using satellite data, information which is potentially relevant for mapping components and properties of vegetation responses worldwide. However, the large differences in the spatial patterns in intrinsic vegetation memory in our study compared to previous analyses show the overall sensitivity of this component to the initial choice of extrinsic predictor variables. As a result, we caution against using the oversimplified link between intrinsic vegetation-memory and vegetation recovery rates at large spatial scales.","[Kusch, Erik; Seddon, Alistair W.

The results presented here are the regional climate change scenarios of atmospheric water balance components, precipitation, moisture convergence and evaporation (P, C and E) up to the end of the twenty-second century based on IPCC AR4 modelling experiments conducted for (A1B) future greenhouse gas emission scenario. The AOGCMs, despite their relatively coarse resolution, have shown a reasonable skill in depicting the hydrological cycle over the South Asian region. However, considerable biases do exist with reference to the observed atmospheric water balance and also inter-model differences. The monsoon rainfall and atmospheric water balance changes under A1B scenario are discussed in detail. Spatial patterns of rainfall change projections indicate maximum increase over northwest India in most of the models, but changes in the atmospheric water balance are generally widespread over South Asia. While the scenarios presented in this study are indicative of the expected range of rainfall and water balance changes, it must be noted that the quantitative estimates still have large uncertainties associated with them.","[Prasanna, Venkatraman; Yasunari, Tetsuzo] Nagoya Univ, HyARC, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Prasanna, V (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",prasa_arnala@yahoo.com,"PRASANNA, Venkatraman/AAE-6612-2022","PRASANNA, Venkatraman/0000-0001-5967-3793",,,,,34,13,13,1,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

However, the results of this research are generally not known by the general public. Communicating scientific concepts is an increasingly important task in the research world. Different ways to engage learners and incorporate narratives in teaching materials exist, yet they are generally underused. Here we report on an international scientific outreach project called Frozen-Ground Cartoons, which aims at making permafrost science accessible and fun for students, teachers, and parents through the creation of comic strips. We present the context in which the project was initiated, as well as recent education and outreach activities. The future phases of the project primarily involve a series of augmented reality materials, such as maps, photos, videos, and 3D drawings. With this project we aim to foster understanding of permafrost research among broader audiences, inspire future permafrost researchers, and raise public and science community awareness of polar science, education, outreach, and engagement.","[Bouchard, Frederic] Univ Paris Saclay, Orsay, France; [Bouchard, Frederic; Sansoulet, Julie; Malenfant-Lepage, Julie] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Sansoulet, Julie] CNRS, Paris, France; [Fritz, Michael; Tanski, George] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Malenfant-Lepage, Julie] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Nieuwendam, Alexandre] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Geog Studies IGOT, Lisbon, Portugal; [Paquette, Michel] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Rudy, Ashley C.

In response, scholars have increasingly identified barriers to adaptation in the literature. But, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. To further improve understanding of barriers to adaptation and identify gaps in the state-of-the-art knowledge, we undertook a synthesis of empirical literature from sub-Saharan Africa focusing on vulnerable, natural resource-dependent communities and livelihoods. Our review illustrates that: (1) local-level studies that reveal barriers to adaptation are diverse, although there is a propensity for studies on small-holder farmers; (2) many of the studies identify several barriers to adaptation, but appreciation of their interactions and compounded impacts remains scarce; and (3) most of the barriers uncovered relate broadly to biophysical, knowledge, and financial constraints on agricultural production and rural development. More hidden and under-acknowledged political, social, and psychological barriers are rarely mentioned, unless captured in studies that specifically set out to investigate these. We finish our review by highlighting gaps in understanding and by suggesting future research directions, focusing on issues of social justice. We argue that research on barriers needs to start asking why these barriers emerge, how they work together to shape adaptation processes, who they affect most, and what is needed to overcome them.

Advantages of applying a historical-extrapolation approach to forecasting the development of world energy and other anthropogenic sources affecting the planet's atmosphere and climate, and also comprehensive consideration of natural climatic factors and natural variability features of the global climate are demonstrated. It is shown that a pattern adequately reflecting the change in the world's energy consumption and its carbon intensity was presented as a result of a genetic (based on the historical development regularities) world energy development forecast elaborated at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) more than 30 years ago. The cumulative carbon dioxide emission estimates for the period of 1990-2020 obtained using this approach are fully consistent with the actual data following from the world energy statistics(1). By using this approach, it became possible to predict an essential transformation of the world energy mix (energy transition) at the beginning of the current century, which manifested itself in the growing role of carbon-free energy sources, primarily renewable ones. The predictions carried out in the 1990s using the MPEI's combined climatic model, which combines the principles of dynamic and statistical modeling of the global climatic system and takes into account the effect of natural climatic factors and the climatic system's internal features with using a genetic forecast of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission for the period of 1990-2020, showed an encouraging consistency with the data of observed global temperature variation dynamics. The prediction results show that the majority of the most radical energy consumption and corresponding carbon dioxide emission scenarios are in reality unfeasible, and the model predictions of global climatic changes performed according to these scenarios are also extremely unlikely. At the same time, it is stated that, to achieve the goals of preventing the average global temperature increase by more than 2 degrees C in comparison with the preindustrial period, it is necessary, along with decreasing the consumption of fossil fuel, to develop, on significant scales, carbon dioxide capture technologies, both biological (forest recreation, protection from forest fires, etc.) and geological (direct disposal).","[Klimenko, V.

Firstly, the evolution of ISM precipitation, mean temperature and soil moisture during June to September 2001-2010 is verified using Emanuel over land and Grell over ocean with Arakawa and Schubert (1974) closure, in combination with the two planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes, Holtslag and University of Washington - UW Turbulence closure model for PBL. Then the feedback due to extended desertification between land surface and PBL, during ISM regime is studied.

Numerical experiments (control and design experiment) with the above mentioned combination of PBL schemes is performed for investigating the impact of extended desertification on the changes in the ISM precipitation, surface fluxes, circulation pattern, moisture fluxes and net radiation etc. In the extended desert design experiment, the land-use pattern in the model over Thar Desert (i.e. northwestern part of Indian sub-continent between Pakistan and northwestern India) is changed from crop/mixed farming and semi-desert to desert/semi-desert type of vegetation, mimicking extended desertification in the RegCMv4.4.5.10 model. Results show that due to increase in desertification over Thar deserts there is increase in albedo resulting from a decrease in plant cover, along with formation of anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation causes a decrease in JJAS rainfall (p < 0.01) over north, north-west India by -1 to -2 mm/day (similar to 25% reduction). Anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation over the Indian land mass in the extended desertification experiment causes less convective heating and is responsible for the decrease in precipitation (with respect to control experiment). The anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation developed covers northern part of Bay of Bengal resulting in decrease in moisture advection of the order of -12 to -18 kgm(-1)sec(-1) (similar to 10% reduction). This drives away all moisture from the nearby regions. The effect of extended desertification induced feedbacks on variability and dominant modes of variability of Indian monsoon precipitation and soil wetness is also studied and reported. Finally, it is concluded that the relative magnitudes of the changes in albedo and vegetation (or vegetation roughness length) are important determinants of the size of climate change due to prescribed extended desert landscape over Thar desert region of Indian subcontinent. The results of this numerical study provides a basis and reference study for LULCC and mitigation measure human beings need to undertake for climate change adaptation.","[Lodh, Abhishek] Minist Earth Sci, Earth Syst Sci Org, Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting NCMRWF, A-50,Sect 62, Noida 201309, India; [Lodh, Abhishek] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi 110016, India",Earth System Science Organization (ESSO); Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Lodh, A (corresponding author), Minist Earth Sci, Earth Syst Sci Org, Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting NCMRWF, A-50,Sect 62, Noida 201309, India.",abhishek.iitd.lodh@gmail.com,"lodh, abhishek/AGR-2143-2022","Lodh, Abhishek/0000-0002-4951-0226",MHRD (Govt. of India),"MHRD (Govt. of India)(Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India)","The author is thankful to Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy for making the RegCMv4.4.5.10 model codes available for this study and regular updates via RegCNET.

These have often led to flooding, which also affected businesses. In the face of climate change, such events can become more frequent and can threaten economic development. To determine if more action is needed to protect businesses from flooding, we assessed how many businesses have suffered damages from floods in certain years in a certain area of Kigali. We also gathered information on how businesses were affected, how they are preparing for flooding and what support they are seeking. We developed and piloted a survey, a standardised questionnaire for gathering information on the relevance of flooding for businesses. The survey was then conducted among 350 businesses in Kigali asking business owners about their experiences with flooding in recent years. Eighty-one per cent of businesses have been affected by floods in 2013 and 2014. The annual damage costs resemble 22% of the total net profit of the businesses in the area. The most common damages were damages to goods that were to be sold and damages to buildings. The extent of past flood damages warrants action on flood risk management, both by businesses and citizens, as well as by city officials. Suitable actions range from increasing awareness about suitable protection measures to upgrading the sewage system.","[Tsinda, Aime] Univ Rwanda, Coll Educ, Kigali, Rwanda; [Kind, Christian; Hess, Janto S.] Adelphi, Berlin, Germany; [Mugisha, Roger] Inst Policy Anal & Res, Kigali, Rwanda; [Bizoza, Alfred R.] Univ Rwanda, Coll Agr Anim Sci & Vet Med, Kigali, Rwanda",University of Rwanda; University of Rwanda,"Tsinda, A (corresponding author), Univ Rwanda, Coll Educ, Kigali, Rwanda.",aime.tsinda@gmail.com,"Bizoza, Alfred/AAO-1785-2020",,Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN),Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN),The project was funded by Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN).,,59,0,0,0,4,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

The two modes exchange energy through highly nonlinear interaction terms. We consider a periodic channel domain, oriented zonally and centered around the equator and adopt a fractional stepping-splitting strategy, for the governing system of equations, dividing it into three natural pieces which independently preserve energy. We obtain a scheme which preserves geostrophic steady states with minimal ad hoc dissipation by using state of the art numerical methods for each piece: The f-wave algorithm for conservation laws with varying flux functions and source terms of Bale et al. (2002) for the advected baroclinic waves and the Riemann solver-free non-oscillatory central scheme of Levy and Tadmor (1997) for the barotropic-dispersive waves. Unlike the traditional use of a time splitting procedure for conservation laws with source terms (here, the Coriolis forces), the class of balanced schemes to which the f-wave algorithm belongs are able to preserve exactly, to the machine precision, hydrostatic (geostrophic) numerical-steady states. The interaction terms are gathered into a single second order accurate predictor-corrector scheme to minimize energy leakage. Validation tests utilizing known exact solutions consisting of baroclinic Kelvin, Yanai, and equatorial Rossby waves and barotropic Rossby wave packets are given.","Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 3P4, Canada; NYU, Courant Inst, Dept Math, New York, NY 10012 USA; NYU, Courant Inst, Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of Victoria; New York University; New York University,"Khouider, B (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, POB 3045 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3P4, Canada.",khouider@math.uvic.ca,,"Khouider, Boualem/0000-0002-6899-5257",,,,,35,38,38,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0935-4964,1432-2250,,THEOR COMP FLUID DYN,Theor.

However, the potential impact of changing climatic variability on the fate of populations has been largely unexamined. We analyzed multiyear demographic data for 36 plant and animal species with a broad range of life histories and types of environment to ask how sensitive their long-term stochastic population growth rates are likely to be to changes in the means and standard deviations of vital rates (survival, reproduction, growth) in response to changing climate. We quantified responsiveness using elasticities of the long-term population growth rate predicted by stochastic projection matrix models. Short-lived species (insects and annual plants and algae) are predicted to be more strongly (and negatively) affected by increasing vital rate variability relative to longer-lived species (perennial plants, birds, ungulates). Taxonomic affiliation has little power to explain sensitivity to increasing variability once longevity has been taken into account. Our results highlight the potential vulnerability of short-lived species to art increasingly variable climate, but also suggest that problems associated with short-lived undesirable species (agricultural pests, disease vectors, invasive weedy plants) may be exacerbated in regions where climate variability decreases.","[Morris, William F.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Pfister, Catherine A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tuljapurkar, Shripad; Haridas, Chirrakal V.; Boggs, Carol L.; Lee, Charlotte T.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Boyce, Mark S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Bruna, Emilio M.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bruna, Emilio M.] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Church, Don R.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Coulson, Tim] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Doak, Daniel F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Forsyth, Stacey] Univ Arizona, Inst BIO5, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Gaillard, Jean-Michel] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Unite Mixte Rech N5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Horvitz, Carol C.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Kalisz, Susan] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Kendall, Bruce E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Donald Bren Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Knight, Tiffany M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Menges, Eric S.] Archbold Biol Stn, Lake Placid, FL 33862 USA",Duke University; University of Chicago; Stanford University; University of Alberta; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Virginia; Imperial College London; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Arizona; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; VetAgro Sup; University of Miami; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Washington University (WUSTL),"Morris, WF (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, BOx 90339, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",wfmorris@duke.edu,"Coulson, Tim/AAL-8148-2021; Kendall, Bruce/C-1871-2008; Bruna, Emilio M/H-2769-2012; Boyce, Mark S/A-2620-2014","Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003; Kendall, Bruce/0000-0003-1782-8106; Bruna, Emilio M/0000-0003-3381-8477; Boyce, Mark S/0000-0001-5811-325X; Tuljapurkar, Shripad/0000-0001-5549-4245; Forsyth, Stacey/0000-0001-8055-6858",PHS HHS [P01 AB 22500] Funding Source: Medline,PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service),,,30,324,327,5,251,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2008,1,,,,19,25,,10.1890/07-0774.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0774.1,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,270JN,18376542,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253717200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fortunately, aerogel glazing system has recently been considered to have great potential in energy-saving applications for architectural glass due to its special light transmission and thermal insulation properties. In this paper, eight aerogel glazing samples were prepared by filling aerogel particles with four different diameters into hollow glass with two different thicknesses (viz., 5 mm and 7.5 mm). The thermal and optical parameters of the aerogel glazing were experimentally measured and the day-lighting performance was calculated. A case study of the aerogel glazing installing at different positions in a large atrium building under cooling-dominant climates was carried out. The results indicate that installing aerogel glazing at the skylight with is more effective than at the outside windows. The envelope heat gain was reduced by 31% by replacing the single glazing with the HA-type aerogel glazing at skylight under the condition of indoor illumination. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The variations and fluctuations of the microclimatic variables, namely temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH), could have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of wooden objects, works of art and structures. For this reason, through the years, several guidelines have been provided by standards and protocols about the optimal microclimatic conditions that should be ensured to avoid the decay and the eventual catastrophic failure of heritage objects and buildings. In this work, two historical buildings entirely made of Scots pine wood have been analysed: the Ringebu and Heddal stave churches (Norway). These churches store several wooden medieval statues and paintings that are also susceptible to the effects of the microclimate. For this reason, the timeseries of the indoor relative humidity of the two churches have been analysed, in the framework of the indications provided by the standards. The criticalities of the existing protocols have been pointed out, emphasizing the need for systematically and periodically updated specifications, tailorable to a given case study of concern, without forgetting the ever-present needs of energy- and money-saving approaches.","[Califano, America; Baiesi, Marco] Univ Padua, Dept Phys & Astron Galileo Galilei, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Califano, America; Bertolin, Chiara] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",University of Padua; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bertolin, C (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Ind & Mech Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",america.califano@unipd.it; marco.baiesi@unipd.it; chiara.bertolin@ntnu.no,"Bertolin, Chiara/ABI-3960-2020","Bertolin, Chiara/0000-0002-0684-8980; Califano, America/0000-0002-6344-8051",Norwegian Research Council [274749]; Swedish Energy Agency [50049-1],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC)),This work has received funding by the Norwegian Research Council within the framework of the Sustainable Management of Heritage Building in a long-term perspective (Symbol) Research Project n. 274749 and by the Swedish Energy Agency within the Spara Och Bevara project n. 50049-1.,,25,1,1,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAY,2022,5,,,,,,791,10.3390/atmos13050791,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13050791,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,1O8HX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000801567100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the present study was to describe process changes in surgical team performance and team members' attitudes to safety culture following hospital relocation and expansion of perioperative services. Methods. The study was a naturalistic study using structured observations and surveys to assess non-technical skills (NTS; i.e. communication, teamwork, situational awareness, decision making and leadership) in surgery. This interrupted time series design used mixed-linear regression models to examine the effect of phase (before and after hospital relocation) on surgical teams' NTS and their processes that may affect performance. Differences in self-reported teamwork and safety climate attitudes were also examined. Results. In all, 186 procedures (100 before and 81 after hospital relocation) were observed across teams working in general, paediatric, orthopaedic and thoracic surgeries. Interobserver agreement ranged from 86% to 95%. An effect of phase was found, indicating that there were significant improvements after relocation in the use of NTS by the teams observed (P = 0.020; 95% confidence interval 1.9-4.7). Conclusions. The improvements seen in surgical teams' NTS performance and safety culture attitudes may be related to the move to a new state-of-the-art perioperative department.","[Gillespie, Brigid M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Gillespie, Brigid M.] Gold Coast Univ Hosp & Hlth Serv, 1 Hosp Blvd, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia; [Gillespie, Brigid M.; Harbeck, Emma; Chaboyer, Wendy] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Natl Ctr Res Excellence Nursing, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Kang, Evelyn] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Natl Ctr Res Excellence Nursing, DRESSING Trial, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Steel, Catherine; Fairweather, Nicole] Princess Alexandra Hosp, Div Surg, 199 Ipswich Rd, Woolloongabba, Qld 4102, Australia",Griffith University; Gold Coast University Hospital; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Gillespie, BM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.;Gillespie, BM (corresponding author), Gold Coast Univ Hosp & Hlth Serv, 1 Hosp Blvd, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia.;Gillespie, BM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Natl Ctr Res Excellence Nursing, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",b.gillespie@griffith.edu.au; e.harbeck@griffith.edu.au; e.kang@griffith.edu.au; Catherine.Steel@health.qld.gov.au; nfairweather.asa@gmail.com; w.chaboyer@griffith.edu.au,"Gillespie, Brigid M/E-7799-2012; Chaboyer, Wendy/F-9588-2018; Harbeck, Emma L/GNP-3168-2022","Harbeck, Emma/0000-0002-6554-2658; Chaboyer, Wendy/0000-0001-9528-7814; Kang, Evelyn/0000-0001-8253-1638; Gillespie, Brigid/0000-0003-3186-5691","Australian Research Council, Early Career Discovery Fellowship Scheme; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Centre for Excellence in Nursing Research","Australian Research Council, Early Career Discovery Fellowship Scheme(Australian Research Council); Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Centre for Excellence in Nursing Research","Brigid M.

We show that the observed change in liquid and solid Arctic FW storage is likely already driven by the changing climate, based on ensemble simulations from a state-of-the-art climate model. Generally, the emergence of forced changes in Arctic FW fluxes occurs earlier for oceanic fluxes than for atmospheric or land fluxes. Nares Strait liquid FW flux is the first flux to show emergence outside the range of background variability, with this change potentially already occurring. Other FW fluxes have likely started to shift but have not yet emerged into a completely different regime. Future emissions reductions have the potential to avoid the emergence of some FW fluxes beyond the background variability. Plain Language Summary The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean are fresher than the rest of the world oceans, due to the input of large amounts of river runoff. The very fresh surface ocean affects the ocean circulation and climate not just in the Arctic Ocean but also at lower latitudes, especially in the North Atlantic. The last two decades have seen a freshening of the surface Arctic Ocean, for reasons that are currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that this freshening is likely already driven by climate change. Furthermore, we find that due to manmade climate change, Arctic freshwater fluxes to the North Atlantic are also likely to soon start showing signs of change beyond the range of the variability we have observed in the past. The information provided here about the expected timing of the emergence of climate change signals will allow us to monitor upcoming changes in real time, to better understand how changes in the Arctic Ocean can impact climate worldwide.","[Jahn, Alexandra; Laiho, Rory] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jahn, Alexandra; Laiho, Rory] Univ Colorado Boulder, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Jahn, A (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Jahn, A (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",alexandra.jahn@colorado.edu,"Jahn, Alexandra/C-6545-2008","Jahn, Alexandra/0000-0002-6580-2579; Laiho, Rory/0000-0003-1035-5377",National Science Foundation [NSF-OPP 1504348]; NSF,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by the National Science Foundation under Award NSF-OPP 1504348.

Nevertheless, although many museums have been widely investigated in Europe, the effects of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in museums under tropical and subtropical climates and with different economic realities are still unclear. An important portion of the world's cultural heritage is currently in tropical countries where both human and financial resources for preserving museum collections are limited. Hence, our aim is to assess the damage that can be caused to the artwork by pollution in hot and humid environments, where air quality and microclimatic condition differences can cause deterioration. As a case study, particulate matter as well as gases were collected at the Oscar Niemeyer Museum (MON) in Curitiba, Brazil, where large modern and contemporary works of art are displayed. NO2, SO2, O-3, Acetic Acid, Formic Acids and BTEX, in the ambient air, were sampled by means of passive diffusive sampling and their concentrations were determined by IC or GC-MS. The particulate matter was collected in bulk form and analyzed with the use of energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and aethalometer. The chemical compositions of individual particles were quantitatively elucidated, including low-Z components like C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements, using automated electron probe microanalysis. The gaseous and particulate matter levels were then compared with the concentrations obtained for the same pollutants in other museums, located in places with different climates, and with some reference values provided by international cultural heritage conservation centers. Results are interpreted separately and as a whole with the specific aim of identifying compounds that could contribute to the chemical reactions taking place on the surfaces of artifacts and which could potentially cause irreversible damage to the artworks.

The basis of the paper is an eighteen-month empirical study of three interdisciplinary fields that cross the boundaries between the natural sciences or engineering, on the one hand, and the social sciences or arts, on the other. The fields are: 1) environmental and climate change research, 2) ethnography in the IT industry and 3) art-science. In the first part of the paper, in contrast to existing accounts, we question the idea that interdisciplinarity should be understood in terms of the synthesis of two or more disciplines. We stress the forms of agonism and antagonism that often characterize relations between disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, and distinguish between three modes of interdisciplinarity. In the second part we outline three distinctive logics or rationales that guide interdisciplinary research. In addition to the logics of accountability and innovation, we identify the logic of ontology, that is, an orientation apparent in diverse interdisciplinary practices in each of our three fields towards effecting ontological transformation in the objects and relations of research. While the three logics are interdependent, they are not reducible to each other and are differently entangled in each of the fields. We point to the potential for invention in such interdisciplinary practices and, against the equation of disciplinary research with autonomy, to the possibility of forms of interdisciplinary autonomy.","[Barry, Andrew; Born, Georgina; Weszkalnys, Gisa] OUCE, Sch Geog, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Barry, A (corresponding author), OUCE, Sch Geog, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",andrew.barry@geog.ox.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-151-25-0042-A] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,124,282,287,5,117,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Outbreaks have occurred across the world during pollen season with the capacity to rapidly inundate a health care service, resulting in potentially catastrophic outcomes for allergic patients. TA occurs when specific meteorological and aerobiological factors combine to affect predisposed atopic patients with IgE-mediated sentitization to pollen allergens. Thunderstorm outflows can concentrate aeroallergens, most commonly grass pollen but also other pollens such as Parietaria and moulds in TA, at ground level to release respirable allergenic particles after rupture by osmotic shock related to humidity and rainfall. Inhalation of high concentrations of these aeroallergens by sensitized individuals can induce early asthmatic responses which can be followed by a late inflammatory phase. There is evidence that, during pollen season, thunderstorms can induce allergic asthma outbreaks, sometimes also severe asthma crisis and sometimes deaths in patients suffering from pollen allergy. It has been observed that changes in the weather such as rain or humidity may induce hydratation of pollen grains during pollen seasons and sometimes also their fragmentation which generates atmospheric biological aerosols carrying allergens. Asthma attacks are induced for the high concentration at ground level of pollen grains which may release allergenic particles of respirable size after rupture by osmotic shock. In other words, it is a global health problem observed in several cities and areas of the world that can strike without sufficient warning, inducing sometimes severe clinical consequences also with deaths of asthma patients. Due to constant climate change, future TA events are likely to become more common, more disastrous and more unpredictable, as a consequence it is important to have deep knowledge on this topic to prevent asthma attacks. Other environmental factors, such as rapid changes in temperature and agricultural practices, also contribute to causing TA.","[D'Amato, Gennaro] High Special Hosp A Cardarelli, Dept Chest Dis, Div Resp & Allerg Dis, Naples, Italy; [D'Amato, Gennaro] Federico II Univ Naples, Med Sch Specializat Resp Dis, Naples, Italy; [Annesi-Maesano, Isabella] IPLESP, Epidemiol Allerg & Resp Dis Dept, Paris, France; [Annesi-Maesano, Isabella] Univ Montpellier, INSERM, IDESP, Montpellier, France; [Urrutia-Pereira, Marilyn] Fed Univ Pampa, Dept Pediat, Pampa, RS, Brazil; [Del Giacco, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, Dept Med Sci & Publ Hlth, Cagliari, Italy; [Filho, Nelson A.

As urban areas across the globe continue to grow and expand laterally into undeveloped landscapes there is a pressing need to better understand the impacts such landscapes have on hydrological dynamics. The quest for a holistic understanding of urban water dynamics requires an integrated and multidisciplinary approach. The advancement of technology has greatly aided our ability to monitor and model urban dynamics with increasing accuracy. This era of technological advancement has expedited our ability to better capture data, monitor change and predict future changes under an array of land-use and climate change scenarios. Satellite technology has aided our ability to track the urban extent and real-time in-situ monitoring has revolutionised the way we capture and observe data. As technology continues to develop, urban hydrologists are increasing well positioned to elucidate the dynamics of urban catchments. The UK NERC Changing Water Cycle programme aims to determine some of the impacts of land-use and climate change impacts on the hydrological cycle and water quality dynamics.

Simulations from two state-of-the-art global climate models within phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are dynamically downscaled according to the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). The downscaling is performed using the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) with 25-km grid spacing, interactively coupled to a one-dimensional lake model. Both downscaled models produce atmospheric warming and increased cold-season precipitation. The Great Lakes' ice cover is projected to dramatically decline and, by the end of the century, become confined to the northern shallow lakeshores during mid-to-late winter. Projected reductions in ice cover and greater dynamically induced wind fetch lead to enhanced lake evaporation and resulting total lake-effect precipitation, although with increased rainfall at the expense of snowfall. A general reduction in the frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms is simulated during the twenty-first century, except with increases around Lake Superior by the midcentury when local air temperatures still remain low enough for wintertime precipitation to largely fall in the form of snow. Despite the significant progress made here in elucidating the potential future changes in lake-effect snowstorms across the Great Lakes basin, further research is still needed to downscale a larger ensemble of CMIP5 model simulations, ideally using a higher-resolution, nonhydrostatic regional climate model coupled to a three-dimensional lake model.","[Notaro, Michael; Bennington, Val; Vavrus, Steve] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Notaro, M (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Climat Res, 1225 West Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mnotaro@wisc.edu,,,NOAA Climate Change Data and Detection; NOAA/Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory; Michigan Department of Natural Resources (from Environmental Protection Agency),NOAA Climate Change Data and Detection; NOAA/Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Michigan Department of Natural Resources (from Environmental Protection Agency),"This study was funded by grants and contracts from NOAA Climate Change Data and Detection, NOAA/Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, and Michigan Department of Natural Resources (from Environmental Protection Agency funding).

The diagnostics are based on in situ observations of ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapor profiles ( obtained on board the NASA ER-2 research aircraft, near 65 degrees N and during 1997), and their interrelationships in the UTLS. The first diagnostic compares the observed and modeled UTLS trace gas profiles in a relative altitude coordinate. The second one compares the observed and modeled UTLS tracer relationships. The third one compares the observed and modeled thickness of the tropopause transition layer. Together, they characterize the model's ability to reproduce the observed chemical distribution in the UTLS region and chemical transition across the extratropical tropopause. These are key indicators of whether the contributions of dynamics and chemistry to this region are correctly represented in the models. These diagnostics are used to evaluate the performance of an NCAR chemistry-transport model (CTM), MOZART-3, and a chemistry-climate model (CCM), WACCM3. Results from four model runs with different meteorological fields and grid resolution are examined. Overall, the NCAR models show qualitative agreement with the observations in the location of the chemical transition across the extratropical tropopause. Quantitatively, there are significant differences between the modeled and the observed chemical distributions. Both the meteorological field and grid resolutions are contributing factors to the differences.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Pan, LL (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",liwen@ucar.edu,"Pan, Laura L/A-9296-2008","Pan, Laura L/0000-0001-7377-2114",,,,,41,44,44,1,7,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The methodology challenges the assumption that the change needed to meet the carbon targets can be reached with incremental, non-invasive behavior engineering techniques such as nudging or gamification. Instead, it explores the potential of disruptive communication to push citizens out of their comfort zones and into creative modes of re-creating futures. This is done by confronting us with consequences of consumption by means of art and eco-visualizations. The aim being to achieve awareness, mental flexibility, and spurring debate. Thus, we invite them to react - and act upon these reactions by communicating their feelings or thoughts. This is used as an entrance point for broader and/or deeper engagement in a structured three-step methodology; (1) Framing: A disruptive element is introduced into the local environment. This triggers an emotional reaction, which then is taken up in a process of framing the problem and working with solutions. (2) Twisting: in a guided process, the initial energy from the emotional confrontation is twisted into a creative exploration of innovative solutions, from the perspective of the children. (3) Using: The last stage is using the developed solutions in the local social system (or refining them further). The methodology is being applied in cooperation with a primary school, and is iteratively adjusted and evaluated in a formative, action-research based approach scenario. NiYF is to stimulate societal engagement through deliberately confronting stakeholders with unexpected and potentially upsetting appearances of nature, climate effects, or carbon-neutral lifestyle scenarios. We have verified the practical usefulness and potential of the methodology and found that NiYF triggers societal engagement and transition, negotiating responsibilities and unlocking action potentials. We also found that eco-anxiety, denial, self-efficacy and cognitive dissonance form children's understanding of plastic. The project marks a paradigm shift from creating knowledge to using knowledge to create action, and a focus on learning from evaluating and adapting the approach in the field.","[Lofstrom, Erica; Klockner, Christian A.; Nesvold, Ine H.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Psychol Citizens Environm & Safety, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Lofstrom, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Psychol Citizens Environm & Safety, Trondheim, Norway.",erica.lofstrom@ntnu.no,,,Climate-KIC; Norwegian Research Fund [302111],Climate-KIC; Norwegian Research Fund,"This project has received funding from Climate-KIC for a pilot study, and has been awarded funding for a full scale project from the Norwegian Research Fund (grant number 302111).",,27,1,1,5,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The predictive ability of the model is tested across 606 lakes, with 91% of the lakes showing a daily root mean square error smaller than 1.5 degrees C. Model performance was better at mid-latitudes and decreased towards the equator.

The year-to-year retreat of Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent is faster in summer than winter, which has been identified as one of the most striking features of satellite observations as well as of state-of-the-art climate model projections. This is typically understood to imply that the sea ice cover is most sensitive to climate forcing in summertime, and previous studies have explained this by calling on factors such as the surface albedo feedback. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, it is the wintertime sea ice extent that retreats fastest in climate model projections. Here, it is shown that the interhemispheric differences in the model projections can be attributed to differences in coastline geometry, which constrain where sea ice can occur. After accounting for coastline geometry, it is found that the sea ice changes simulated in both hemispheres in most climate models are consistent with sea ice retreat being fastest in winter in the absence of landmasses. These results demonstrate that, despite the widely differing rates of ice retreat among climate model projections, the seasonal structure of the sea ice retreat is robust among the models and is uniform in both hemispheres.","[Eisenman, Ian; Schneider, Tapio] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Eisenman, Ian; Battisti, David S.; Bitz, Cecilia M.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",California Institute of Technology; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Eisenman, I (corresponding author), CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",ian@gps.caltech.edu,"Eisenman, Ian/B-9329-2009; Bitz, Cecilia M/S-8423-2016; Schneider, Tapio/A-7038-2014; Battisti, David S/A-3340-2013","Bitz, Cecilia M/0000-0002-9477-7499; Schneider, Tapio/0000-0001-5687-2287; Battisti, David S/0000-0003-4871-1293; Eisenman, Ian/0000-0003-0190-2869",TPF Postdoctoral Fellowship through the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences; NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; Davidow Discovery Fund,TPF Postdoctoral Fellowship through the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences; NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); David and Lucile Packard Fellowship(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Davidow Discovery Fund,"This work was supported by a TPF Postdoctoral Fellowship through the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, a NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship administered by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship, and the Davidow Discovery Fund.

Currently developed regional and local climate change scenarios for the Czech Republic assess the uncertainty based on state-of-the-art Global Climate Model (GCM) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) ensembles. Present study focuses on multi-model spread of projected changes in long-term monthly means and inter-annual variability of monthly mean minimum, mean and maximum daily air temperature and monthly mean precipitation. We concentrate in more detail on the simulation of CNRM-ESM2-1, the driving GCM for the convection permitting ALADIN-Climate/CZ simulation contributing to the local scenarios in very high resolution. For this GCM, we also analyze a mini-ensemble with perturbed initial conditions to evaluate the range of internal climate variability. The results for the Czech Republic reveal minor differences in model performance in the reference period whereas quite substantial inter-generation shift in projected future change towards higher air temperature and lower summer precipitation in CMIP6 comparing to CMIP5. One of the prominent features across GCM generations is the pattern of summer precipitation decrease over central Europe. Further, projected air temperature increase is higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, implying increase of thermal continentality of climate. On the other hand, slight increase of winter precipitation and tendency towards decrease of summer precipitation lead to projected decrease of ombric continentality. The end of 21st century projections also imply higher probability of dry summer periods, higher precipitation amounts in the cold half of the year and extremely high temperature in summer. Regarding the CNRM-ESM2-1, it is often quite far from the multi-model median. Therefore, we strictly recommend to accompany any analysis based on the simulation of nested Aladin-CLIMATE/CZ with proper uncertainty estimate. The range of uncertainty connected to internal climate variability based on one GCM is often quite large in comparison to the range of whole CMIP6 ensemble. It implies that when constructing climate change scenarios for the Central Europe region, attention should be paid not only to structural uncertainty represented by inter-model differences and scenario uncertainty, but also to the influence of internal climate variability.","[Holtanova, Eva; Belda, Michal; Halenka, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Atmospher Phys, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Holtanova, E (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Atmospher Phys, Prague, Czech Republic.",Eva.Holtanova@matfyz.cuni.cz,,,Technology Agency of the Czech Republic; PERUN [SS02030040];  [SS04030013],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic; PERUN; ,"The research was funded by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (Grant No. SS02030040, PERUN and Grant No. SS04030013 SEEPIA).",,56,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

It is shown by means of a new global climate model, which does not employ flux adjustments, that the multidecadal SST variability is closely related to variations in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). The close correspondence between the North Atlantic SST and THC variabilities allows, in conjunction with the dynamical inertia of the THC, for the prediction of the slowly varying component of the North Atlantic climate system. It is shown additionally that past variations of the North Atlantic THC can be reconstructed from a simple North Atlantic SST index and that future, anthropogenically forced changes in the THC can be easily monitored by observing SSTs. The latter is confirmed by another state-of-the-art global climate model. Finally, the strong multidecadal variability may mask an anthropogenic signal in the North Atlantic for some decades.","Inst Meereskunde, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Bracknell, Berks, England",Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Latif, M (corresponding author), Inst Meereskunde, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",mlatif@ifm.uni-kiel.de,"Marsland, Simon J/A-1453-2012; Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016","Marsland, Simon J/0000-0002-5664-5276; Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604",,,,,36,226,232,0,30,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

We leverage the exceptional access to hitherto overlooked affective dynamics in one organizational context made possible by the introduction of a video art installation in a commercial art gallery. The artwork enabled both the all-female staff and the researchers to observe, feel and reflect on both the invisible force of body shame and the empowering forces of communal laughter and reciprocal generosity. Our analysis reveals how the repetition of loving encounters around the artwork moved the staff away from crippling individualized anxiety and shame and towards more joyful and carefree possibilities. It further suggests that the organization's feminist culture and climate of psychological safety facilitated the trajectory from shame to joy through love. By surfacing and explaining such affective pathways to freedom as an important form of emancipatory politics in the context of injurious, discriminatory bodily norms, we contribute to both scholarship on bodily discipline in the workplace and recent work on the critical potential of affect.","[Pouthier, Vanessa] Univ Melbourne, Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sondak, Harris] Univ Utah, Business & Eth, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of Melbourne; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Pouthier, V (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Management & Mkt, 198 Berkeley St,Level 10, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",vpouthier@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,60,9,9,5,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0170-8406,1741-3044,,ORGAN STUD,Organ.

We attempt to discuss spatial scale patterns (macro-, meso- and microscale) according to their degree of importance in structuring sandy-beach nematode assemblages. This review will provide a substantial background on current knowledge of sandybeach nematodes, and can be used as a starting point to delineate further investigations in this field. Over decades, sandy beaches have been the scene of studies focusing on community and population ecology, both related to morphodynamic models. The combination of physical factors (e.g. grain size, tidal exposure) and biological interactions (e.g. trophic relationships) is responsible for the spatial distribution of nematodes. In other words, the physical factors are more important in structuring nematodes communities over large scale of distribution while biological interactions are largely important in finer-scale distributions. It has been accepted that biological interactions are assumed to be of minor importance because physical factors overshadow the biological interactions in sandy beach sediments; however, the most recent results from in-situ and ex-situ experimental investigations on behavior and biological factors on a microscale have shown promise for understanding the mechanisms underlying larger-scale patterns and processes. Besides nematodes are very promising organisms used to understand the effects of pollution and climate changes although these subjects are less studied in sandy beaches than distribution patterns.","[Maria, Tatiana F.] Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro UNIRIO, Dept Ecol & Recursos Marinhos, Ave Pasteur,458, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Vanaverbeke, Jan; Vanreusel, Ann] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Esteves, Andre M.] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Ave Prof Moraes Rego,S-N,Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Ghent University; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Maria, TF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro UNIRIO, Dept Ecol & Recursos Marinhos, Ave Pasteur,458, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",tatiana_fabricio@yahoo.com.br,"Maria, Tatiana/AAW-4483-2020; ESTEVES, ANDRE M/B-8113-2009","ESTEVES, ANDRE M/0000-0003-0921-2731",Special Research Fund of Ghent University [BOF-GOA 01GA1911W]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [CNPq 312143/2013-3],Special Research Fund of Ghent University(Ghent University); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Renata Alves and Alex Silva are acknowledged for their help with GIS Mapping Software and the map quality, respectively.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the building performance and develop a reliable building simulation, which will be employed in the second phase of the study: developing affordable and feasible passive design strategies to support the energy-efficient building systems of the construction industry. This paper reports on the results from the first phase of the study where a quantitative methodology, including indoor and outdoor environmental monitoring, in-situ measurements and building simulation modelling, was adopted. The performance of a case study was modelled and simulated via employing Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) software suite. The results from the base-case were analysed according to the adaptive thermal comfort of Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Technical Memorandum 52 guidelines: The Limits of Thermal Comfort-Avoiding Overheating in European Buildings. The spaces studied within the case study house were observed to exceed the acceptable limits of thermal comfort; particularly, the large bedroom within this zone exceeded the upper limit for overheating up to 11 h daily. Furthermore, the results from the monitoring study indicate a high risk of summertime overheating across all the case study settings, especially during short-term peaks in outdoor temperatures. The main reasons for the problematic thermal performance were identified as well-insulated and fully air-tight building fabric, the lack of sufficient ventilation through the living spaces and excessive heat gains through the composite cladding material.

However, to stabilize the climate at a warming level closer to the present day, such as the well below 2 degrees C aspiration in the Paris Agreement, a net-zero carbon emission by 2050 is still insufficient. The recent IPCC special report calls for a massive scheme to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere, in addition to decarbonization, to reach negative net emissions at the mid-century mark. Another ambitious proposal is solar-radiation-based geoengineering schemes, including injecting sulfur gas into the stratosphere. Despite being in public debate for years, these two leading geoengineering schemes have not been directly compared under a consistent analytical framework using global climate models. Here we present the first explicit analysis of the hydroclimate impacts of these two geoengineering approaches using two recently available large-ensemble (>10 members) model experiments conducted by a family of state-of-the-art Earth system models. The CO2-based mitigation simulation is designed to include both emission cuts and carbon capture. The solar-radiation-based mitigation simulation is designed to inject sulfur gas strategically at specified altitudes and latitudes and run a feedback control algorithm to avoid common problems previously identified such as the overcooling of the tropics and large-scale precipitation shifts. Our analysis focuses on the projected aridity conditions over the Americas in the 21st century in detailed terms of the potential mitigation benefits, the temporal evolution, the spatial distribution (within North and South America), the relative efficiency, and the physical mechanisms. We show that sulfur injection, in contrast to previous notions of leading to excessive terrestrial drying (in terms of precipitation reduction) while offsetting the global mean greenhouse gas (GHG) warming, will instead mitigate the projected drying tendency under RCP8.5. The surface energy balance change induced by sulfur injection, in addition to the well-known response in temperature and precipitation, plays a crucial role in determining the overall terrestrial hydroclimate response. However, when normalized by the same amount of avoided global warming in these simulations, sulfur injection is less effective in curbing the worsening trend of regional land aridity in the Americas under RCP8.5 when compared with carbon capture. Temporally, the climate benefit of sulfur injection will emerge more quickly, even when both schemes are hypothetically started in the same year of 2020. Spatially, both schemes are effective in curbing the drying trend over North America. However, for South America, the sulfur injection scheme is particularly more effective for the sub-Amazon region (southern Brazil), while the carbon capture scheme is more effective for the Amazon region. We conclude that despite the apparent limitations (such as an inability to address ocean acidification) and potential side effects (such as changes to the ozone layer), innovative means of sulfur injection should continue to be explored as a potential low-cost option in the climate solution toolbox, complementing other mitigation approaches such as emission cuts and carbon capture (Cao et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate the urgent need for multi-model comparison studies and detailed regional assessments in other parts of the world.","[Xu, Yangyang; Diao, Chenrui] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lin, Lei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tilmes, Simone; Dagon, Katherine; Simpson, Isla] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Xia, Lili] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Cheng, Wei] Cornell Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY USA; [Wang, Zhili] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhili] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Chem CMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Burnell, Lorna] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Nottingham, England",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Cornell University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); University of Nottingham,"Xu, YY (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Lin, L (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Lin, L (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai 519000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yangyang.xu@tamu.edu; linlei3@sysu.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhili/K-4111-2019; diao, chenrui/AAC-2610-2022; Xu, Yangyang/I-1930-2018","Wang, Zhili/0000-0002-4392-3230; diao, chenrui/0000-0001-9482-7153; Xu, Yangyang/0000-0001-7173-7761; Tilmes, Simone/0000-0002-6557-3569; Dagon, Katherine/0000-0002-4518-8225","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602701]; NSF [1841308, 1852977]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Lei Lin is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2016YFA0602701).

EP intensification can reach maximum super Clausius-Clapeyron rate (>= $\ge $+7% per K warming) rate, implying a new normal of extreme events get more extreme, which is consistently for both Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 and 4.5. The intensification is lower for moderate and light precipitation. Also, global warming was found to dampen the urban effect on EP events. The EP enhancement is attributed to the increased atmospheric moisture and convective inhibition due to enhanced low-level stratification that delays a convection to develop until it becomes more intense.","[Doan, Quang-Van; Kusaka, Hiroyuki] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Doan, Quang-Van; Chen, Fei] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Dipankar, Anurag] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Khan, Ansar] Univ Calcutta, Dept Geog, Lalbaba Coll, Kolkata, India; [Hamdi, Rafiq] Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Roth, Matthias] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Cockrell Sch Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Tsukuba; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Calcutta; Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium; National University of Singapore; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Doan, QV (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;Doan, QV (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",doan.van.gb@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Niyogi, Dev/H-6326-2013; Chen, Fei/B-1747-2009","Niyogi, Dev/0000-0002-1848-5080; Chen, Fei/0000-0003-2573-3828","JSPS KAKENHI [19H01155, 20K13258]; NASA IDS Grant [80NSSC20K1262]; USDA NIFA Grants [2015-67003-23460]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); NASA IDS Grant; USDA NIFA Grants","This research is funded by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Nos. 20K13258; JSPS KAKENHI Grant Nos. 19H01155; NASA IDS Grant #80NSSC20K1262; USDA NIFA Grants 2015-67003-23460.

These fossils are from Gzhelian deposits of different coalfields in Leon Province (Castilla y Leon, NW Spain). Among the insect orders, we have described the archaeorthopteran Hispanopteron romerali gen. et sp. nov., the Paoliida Simplexpaolia prokopi gen. et sp. nov., the megasecopterans Mischoptera bergidensis sp. nov. and Corydaloides leonensis sp. nov., in addition to an unnamed prothoracic winglet of palaeodictyopteran. The taxon Hispanopteron romerali is the sixth archaeorthopteran described or cited from the Iberian Peninsula, and increases the impressive diversity of the superorder. Simplexpaolia prokopi represents a new genus and species of latest Carboniferous Paoliidae and the first representative of this family in Spain. Corydaloides leonensis sp. nov. and Mischoptera bergidensis sp. nov. represent the second and third records of the order Megasecoptera in Spain, respectively, as well as the first specimens of the Corydaloididae and Mischopteridae families in the Iberian Peninsula. The deposition of these insect remains together with different fossils of plants, and the previously published evidence of diverse plant-insect interactions, suggest that the Gzhelian entomofauna found in the vegetation of these Carboniferous forests had already occupied numerous ecological niches under a tropical climate. In addition, we have carried out the review of all insect remains, and evidence of plant-insect interactions found so far from the Carboniferous of the Iberian Peninsula, observing a higher diversity than expected.","[Santos, Artai A.; Diez, Jose B.] Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Xeociencias Marinas & Ordenac Terr, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Santos, Artai A.; Diez, Jose B.] Univ Vigo CIM UVIGO, Ctr Invest Marina, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Hernandez-Orue, Antonio] Univ Basque Country, Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea UPV EHU, Dept Geol, Part 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain; [Wappler, Torsten] Hess Landesmuseum Darmstadt, Dept Nat Hist, Friedenspl 1, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany; [Wappler, Torsten] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, Dept Palaeontol, Nussallee 8, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Penalver, Enrique] CSIC, Inst Geol & Minero Espana, IGME CS, C Cirilo Amoros 42, Valencia 46004, Spain; [Nel, Andre] Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB,CNRS,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France",Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo; CIM UVIGO; University of Basque Country; University of Bonn; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Sorbonne Universite,"Nel, A (corresponding author), Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB,CNRS,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France.",andre.nel@mnhn.fr,,"Hernandez-Orue, Antonio/0000-0002-6428-8889","Galician Government (Department of Culture, Education and University Planning); European Social Fund [ED481A-2019/243]","Galician Government (Department of Culture, Education and University Planning); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF))","This work is a contribution to the Medulas-Teleno UNESCO Global Geopark project.

The novelty of the game rests on the global scope and the representation of the drivers of anthropogenic emissions within the MEDEAS-World model, combined with a participatory simulation group dynamic flexible enough to be adapted to a diversity of contexts and participants. The performance of 13 game workshops with similar to 420 players has shown it has a significant pedagogical potential: the game is able to generate discussions on crucial topics which are usually outside the public realm such as the relationship between economic growth and sustainability, the role of technology, how human desires are limited by biophysical constraints or the possibility of climate tipping points.","[Capellan-Perez, Inigo; Alvarez-Antelo, David; Miguel, Luis J.] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Capellan-Perez, Inigo; Miguel, Luis J.] Univ Valladolid, Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.;Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",inigo.capellan@uva.es,"Miguel, Luis Javier/I-2829-2015; Capellán-Pérez, Iñigo/H-6069-2015; Álvarez-Antelo, David/AAC-6180-2020","Miguel, Luis Javier/0000-0002-8243-8596; Capellán-Pérez, Iñigo/0000-0002-3098-8027; Álvarez-Antelo, David/0000-0001-9738-3981",Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [FJCI-2016-28833],Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain,Inigo Capellan-Perez acknowledges financial support from the Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (no.

This paper demonstrates that a multimodel synthetic superensemble approach, when constructed with any set of coupled atmosphere-ocean models, can provide improved skill in seasonal climate prediction compared with single-member models or their ensemble mean for the south Asian summer monsoon region. However, performance of the superensemble tends to improve when a better set of input member models are used. As many as 13 state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean models were used in the synthetic superensemble algorithm. The merit of this technique lies in assigning differential weights to the member models. The rms errors, anomaly correlations, case studies of extreme events, and probabilistic skill scores are used here to assess these forecast skills. It was found that over the south Asian region the seasonal forecasts from the superensemble are, in general, superior to the forecasts of the individual member models, and their bias-removed ensemble mean at a significance level of 95% or more (based on a Student's t test) during the 13 yr of forecasts. Moreover, the skill of the superensemble was found to be better than those of the ensemble mean over smaller domains as well as during extreme events that were monitored, especially during the switch on and off of the Indian Ocean dipole, which seems to modulate the Indian monsoon rainfall. The results of this paper suggest that the superensemble provides somewhat consistent forecasts on the seasonal time scale. This methodology needs to be tested for real-time seasonal climate forecasting over the south Asian region.","Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Chakraborty, A (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",arch@io.met.fsu.edu,"Chakraborty, Arindam/M-9044-2014","Chakraborty, Arindam/0000-0002-4288-0216",,,,,42,28,29,0,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Despite state-of-the-art climate models capturing the rapid nature of Arctic climate change, termed Arctic amplification, they significantly disagree on its magnitude. Using a regional, process-oriented surface energy budget analysis, we argue that differences in seasonal energy exchanges in sea ice retreat regions via increased absorption and storage of sunlight in summer and increased upward surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter contribute to the inter-model spread. Models able to more widely disperse energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more, suggesting that differences in the local Arctic atmospheric circulation response contribute to the inter-model spread. We find that the principle mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in Arctic amplification operate locally on regional scales, requiring an improved understanding of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions to reduce the spread.","[Boeke, Robyn C.] Sci Syst Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Taylor, Patrick C.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Climate Sci Branch, Hampton, VA 23681 USA",Science Systems and Applications Inc; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center,"Taylor, PC (corresponding author), NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Climate Sci Branch, Hampton, VA 23681 USA.",patrick.c.taylor@nasa.gov,,,NASA Interdisciplinary Studies Program [NNH12ZDA001N-IDS],NASA Interdisciplinary Studies Program,"This work is funded by the NASA Interdisciplinary Studies Program grant NNH12ZDA001N-IDS.

This variability is partially caused by the dependence of several long-term feedback mechanisms on the reference climate state. Indeed, state-of-the-art GCMs present a large spread of control climate states probably due to the lack of a suitable reference for constraining the climatology of preindustrial simulations. We assemble a new gridded database of long-term ground surface temperatures (LoST database) obtained from geothermal data over North America, and we explore its use as a potential reference for the evaluation of GCM preindustrial simulations. We compare the LoST database with observations from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) database, as well as with five past millennium transient climate simulations and five preindustrial control simulations from the third phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) and the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The database is consistent with meteorological observations as well as with both types of preindustrial simulations, which suggests that LoST temperatures can be employed as a reference to narrow down the spread of surface temperature climatologies on GCM preindustrial control and past millennium simulations.","[Cuesta-Valero, Francisco Jose; Garcia-Garcia, Almudena] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Environm Sci Program, St John, NF, Canada; [Cuesta-Valero, Francisco Jose; Garcia-Garcia, Almudena; Beltrami, Hugo; Jaume-Santero, Fernando] St Francis Xavier Univ, Climate & Atmospher Sci Inst, Antigonish, NS, Canada; [Zorita, Eduardo] Hemlholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Jaume-Santero, Fernando] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Fis, Dept Fis Tierra & Astrofis, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Memorial University Newfoundland; Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Complutense University of Madrid,"Beltrami, H (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Climate & Atmospher Sci Inst, Antigonish, NS, Canada.",hugo@stfx.ca,"Cuesta-Valero, Francisco/AAA-6747-2020; García-García, Almudena/AGW-0891-2022","Cuesta-Valero, Francisco/0000-0003-1577-671X; Jaume-Santero, Fernando/0000-0002-8441-3798; GARCIA GARCIA, ALMUDENA/0000-0003-1333-4774",Canada Research Chairs Program [CRC 230687]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; NSERC [DG 140576948],Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research has been supported by the Canada Research Chairs Program (grant no.

In this study, we focus on the role of the Atlantic Ocean (AO) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability on the ISMR. There are basically two ways by which AO SSTs can impact the ISMR: a direct pathway in which the AO may directly force the ISMR in the absence of interactions with other dominant forcings like ENSO, and an indirect pathway in which AO forces ENSO and modulates the ENSO teleconnection to ISMR. These two pathways are studied with the help of sensitivity experiments performed with a Coupled General Circulation Model. Two pairs of decoupling experiments have been done. In the first, the SST variability in the tropical AO or Pacific Ocean (PO) is removed by nudging the SST in these regions from a control run's SST climatology. In the second set, the SST nudging is performed from the observed SST climatology, which allows us to assess the robustness of the results and the specific role of the model's SST mean-state biases. The direct pathway linking tropical AO SST variability onto ISMR is insignificant in the PO decoupled experiments or in recent observations. Furthermore, these experiments suggest on the contrary that many AO SST anomalous patterns could be forced by ISMR. On the other hand, for the indirect pathway, the AO decoupled experiments demonstrate that AO SST variability modulates the onset and decaying phases of ENSO events. Despite ENSO is as strong and persists longer than in the control simulation, the AO SST nudging resulted in a significant weakening of the inverse relationship between ENSO and ISMR. The ENSO-monsoon relationship is mainly modulated during the ENSO decaying phase. The upper-level divergent wind flows mainly from the Pacific to the AO resulting in rainfall suppression in the AO, but only in a weak forcing on ISMR during boreal summer of the ENSO decaying year in the AO decoupled experiments. Thus, the AO rainfall variability in these experiments is decoupled from the surface and mainly modulated by the upper-level convergence or divergence induced by the remote ENSO forcing. Finally, the rectification of the AO SST mean-state biases in the CGCM also induces an El Nino-like mean pattern over the tropical Pacific during boreal spring and promotes a stronger ENSO during its peak phase. This demonstrates that the prominent AO SST mean-state biases in current CGCMs further complicate the dynamical prediction and simulation of ISMR and ENSO.","[Terray, Pascal] Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN IPSL, Sorbonne Univ UPMC, CNRS IRD MNHN, Campus Univ Pierre & Marie Curie,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Joseph, Ligin] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, Brest, France; [Sooraj, K.

Water diplomacy is an innovative approach and strategic tool to resolve water issues at local and trans-boundary scales when water conflicts rise in sharing water resources. Complex water supply and sharing issues arise from the existence of multiple stakeholders such as agriculture, industry, urban and domestic users, environmental use, and others competing for scarce water. Water diplomacy may contribute to solving a variety of water conflicts and in this sense is a tool for sustainable water resources management. This paper presents a review of water diplomacy focusing on various themes such as the vitality of water as a resource, virtual water, water conflicts, international water law, and management of trans-boundary waters that are reviewed in this paper in the context of searching for cogent water diplomacy strategies. This work's findings show that conflicts about trans-boundary waters are more common in developing countries than in developed countries.

Virtual water may prevent future water conflicts by reducing water demand and water stresses and providing suitable conditions for negotiation between countries.

Here, we reviewed the state of the art of modeling approaches and compared the conceptual design of these models with recent experimental findings. We show that many models adopt an aeration stress (AS) principle where surplus water reduces air-filled porosity, with implications for root growth. However, subsequent effects of AS within each model vary considerably. In some cases, AS inhibits biomass accumulation (e.g. AquaCrop), altering processes prior to biomass accumulation such as light interception (e.g. APSIM), or photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulation (e.g. SWAGMAN Destiny). While many models account for stage-dependent waterlogging effects, few models account for experimentally observed delays in phenology caused by waterlogging. A model intercomparison specifically designed for long-term waterlogged conditions (APSIM-Oryza) with models developed for dryland conditions with transient waterlogging would advance our understanding of the current fitness for purpose of exsiting frameworks for simulating transient waterlogging in dryland cropping systems. Of the point-based dynamic models examined here, APSIM-Soybean and APSIM-Oryza simulations most closely matched with the observed data, while GLAM-WOFOST achieved the highest performance of the spatial-regional models examined. We conclude that future models should incorporate waterlogging effects on genetic tolerance parameters such as (1) phenology of stress onset, (2) aerenchyma, (3) root hydraulic conductance, (4) nutrient-use efficiency, and (5) plant ion (e.g. Fe/Mn) tolerance. Incorporating these traits/effects into models, together with a more systematic model intercomparison using consistent initialization data, will significantly improve our understanding of the relative importance of such factors in a systems context, including feedbacks between biological factors, emergent properties, and sensitive variables responsible for yield losses under waterlogging.","[Liu, Ke; Zhang, Yunbo; Tian, Xiaohai; Zhou, Meixue] Yangtze Univ, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Grain Ind, Sch Agr, Jingzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ke; Harrison, Matthew Tom; Shabala, Sergey; Ahmed, Ibrahim; Zhou, Meixue] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Burnie, Tas, Australia; [Shabala, Sergey] Foshan Univ, Int Res Ctr Environm Membrane Biol, Foshan, Peoples R China; [Meinke, Holger] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Yangtze University; University of Tasmania; Foshan University; University of Tasmania,"Harrison, MT (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Burnie, Tas, Australia.",matthew.harrison@utas.edu.au,"Harrison, Matthew Tom/C-2434-2014; Meinke, Holger/GRS-6385-2022; Liu, Ke/ABC-5398-2021; Liu, Ke/AFP-9161-2022; Liu, Ke/AEV-5843-2022; Harrison, Matthew/AAH-8915-2020; , Meixue/C-2387-2014; Meinke, Holger/C-7215-2013","Harrison, Matthew Tom/0000-0001-7425-452X; Liu, Ke/0000-0002-8343-0449; Harrison, Matthew/0000-0001-7425-452X; , Meixue/0000-0003-3009-7854; Meinke, Holger/0000-0003-2657-3264; Ahmed, Ibrahim/0000-0001-5597-7087; Shabala, Sergey/0000-0003-2345-8981","Grain Research Development Corporation [UMU00050, 9176582]; State Key Research and Development Program, China [2016YFD0300108, 2017YFD0301405]; Yangtze University Excellence Doctoral Dissertation Development Program","Grain Research Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp); State Key Research and Development Program, China; Yangtze University Excellence Doctoral Dissertation Development Program","This work was supported by the Grain Research Development Corporation (grants UMU00050 and 9176582), the State Key Research and Development Program, China (grants 2016YFD0300108 and 2017YFD0301405), and Yangtze University Excellence Doctoral Dissertation Development Program.",,110,20,21,13,35,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,2328-4277,,EARTHS FUTURE,Earth Future,DEC,2020,12,,,,,,e2020EF001801,10.1029/2020EF001801,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001801,,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PM2UZ,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000603662300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

A significant amount of the energy the Earth receives from the Sun is redistributed around the world by the hydrological cycle in the form of latent heat flux(1). Changes in the hydrological cycle have a direct impact on droughts, floods, water resources and ecosystem services. Observed land precipitation(2-4) and global river discharges(5) do not show an increasing trend as might be expected in a warming world(6-11). Here we show that this apparent discrepancy can be resolved when the effects of tropospheric aerosols are considered. Analysing state-of-the-art climate model simulations, we find for the first time that there was a detectable weakening of the hydrological cycle between the 1950s and the 1980s, attributable to increased anthropogenic aerosols, after which the hydrological cycle recovered as a result of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The net result of these two counter-acting effects is an insignificant trend in the global hydrological cycle, but the individual influence of each is substantial. Reductions in air pollution have already shown an intensification in the past two decades(12-14) and a further rapid increase in precipitation could be expected if the current trend continues.","[Wu, Peili; Christidis, Nikolaos; Stott, Peter] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Wu, PL (corresponding author), Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",peili.wu@metoffice.gov.uk,"; Stott, Peter/N-1228-2016","Wu, Peili/0000-0001-7908-7062; Stott, Peter/0000-0003-4853-7686",Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme-DECC/Defra [GA01101]; NERC [NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme-DECC/Defra; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme-DECC/Defra (GA01101).

Substantial winter warming over the TP will likely lead, directly or indirectly, to a series of geological disasters such as snow and glacial avalanches. Hence, for better adaptation to climate change, it is vital to project the future change in winter temperature over the TP. However, the current state-of-the-art climate models involved in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) still produce strong cold biases over most parts of the TP in their historical simulations. On the basis of selecting the optimal models, here we use the statistical downscaling method to constrain the projected winter temperature in CMIP6 models. The results show that the regions with the strongest winter warming over the TP will be near the Himalayas and the densely populated eastern regions. The constrained warming magnitude is much greater than that in the ensemble mean of the original 32 CMIP6 models or six best models over these regions. Therefore, early warning and forecasting services should be strengthened for the future temperature over these regions. Moreover, the long-term spatial warming varies greatly under four different future emission scenarios. Under the most severe scenario, the increase in winter temperature near the Himalayas exceeds 10 degrees C, which will greatly destabilize glaciers in the region, while the increase is only 4 degrees C-6 degrees C under the weakest scenario. Therefore, it is urgent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to control the future temperature increase at hotspots of climate vulnerability such as the TP.","[Peng, Yuzhuo; Duan, Anmin; Hu, Wenting; Tang, Bin; Li, Xinyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yuzhuo; Duan, Anmin; Hu, Wenting; Tang, Bin; Li, Xinyu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Duan, Anmin] Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xianyi] Inst Atmospher Composit, State Key Lab Severe Weather LASW, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xianyi] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Xiamen University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS)","Duan, AM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Duan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Duan, AM (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",amduan@lasg.iap.ac.cn,,"Peng, Yuzhuo/0000-0002-2606-6986","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070404]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41725018, 91937302]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19070404) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41725018 and 91937302).,,70,3,3,18,45,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Irrigated agriculture is responsible for about 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, consuming the most amount of water. However, the diverted water in irrigation systems is often not utilized efficiently because of poor water management at different spatial scales, resulting in a system efficiency of only 30-50% in most Asian countries. Typically, improving water management in irrigated areas requires accurate information on various water balance parameters while also considering a changing climate across different spatial scales. There have been technical limitations in getting accurate and reliable information on various key water balance parameters with the conventional approaches used in the recent past. In the twenty-first century, considerable advances have been made in using satellite imagery, including processing and geospatial algorithms, to estimate hydro-meteorological fluxes and relevant components at different spatial scales. This paper provides a perspective on the application of innovative and non-conventional approaches to water resources management in the Murray Darling basin, Australia, the Indus basin, Pakistan and the Amu Darya basin, Uzbekistan. Examples of the state-of-the-art tools described in this paper include: (i) using geoinformatics to monitor the diagnostic and operational performance of large irrigation schemes; (ii) quantifying groundwater and surface water to better manage these two resources using geoinformatics; (iii) forecasting irrigation supply and demand at high spatial and temporal scales using hydrological modelling based on the nodal network; (iv) forecasting crop yield production by satellite remote sensing. The approaches in this study clearly demonstrate that new monitoring and planning tools and methods are highly effective in improving irrigation water management in the 'space age' (for the purposes of this paper, space age refers to a period in which earth observation satellites are available to accurately monitor agricultural practices and water balance parameters such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration). The application of these innovative tools can assist in strategizing, diagnosing, monitoring and improving the performance of irrigation systems to grow more crop per drop of water while minimizing environmental impacts and dealing with climate change impacts.","[Hafeez, Mohsin; Awan, Usman Khalid] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, Lahore, Pakistan",PCSIR Laboratories Complex,"Hafeez, M (corresponding author), Water & Climate, 12 Km Multan Rd, Lahore, Pakistan.",m.hafeez@cgiar.org,,,,,,,42,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1531-0353,1531-0361,,IRRIG DRAIN,Irrig.

The CORDEX East Asia calls for a dynamical downscaling of climate change projections under the new SSP scenarios. In this study, the state-of-the-art regional climate model RegCM4 with a horizontal resolution of 25 km was used to dynamically downscale future climate changes, which were derived from the global climate model FGOALS-g3, under multiple SSP scenarios over the CORDEX East Asia Phase II domain. Compared to the driving global model FGOALS-g3, the downscaling exhibited added value in the simulation of present-day mean and extreme rainfall over China in terms of both spatial pattern correlation and biases. The largest improvements were found over the Pearl River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin. For the period of 2081-2100 under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the areas in China with increases in the projected mean and extreme rainfall generally overlapped with the areas with substantial climatological mean and extreme rainfall in both RegCM4 and FGOALS-g3, which highlights the importance of simulated climatology in projecting future rainfall changes. The moisture budget analyses indicated that the projected increases in summer mean rainfall were mainly attributed to thermodynamic processes associated with the increased moisture. The mean and extreme rainfall was most sensitive to the increased emission scenarios in the Northwest Interior River Basin and least sensitive in southern China. From SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5, larger fractions of land area and population would be affected by greater increased and more intense rainfall. If the emissions were reduced from SSP5-8.5 to SSP1-2.6, over 80% of the impacts would be avoided over most regions in China.","[Zou, Liwei; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zou, LW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zoulw@mail.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875132]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,"This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606003), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41875132), and the Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change.

We constructed seasonal water and nutrient budgets for two connected shallow lakes, Lakes Mogan and Eymir, located in Central Anatolia, Turkey. The study period covered 20 years with alternations between dry and wet years as well as restoration efforts including sewage effluent diversion and biomanipulations in Lake Eymir. Both lakes experienced a 1-2 m water level drop during a drought period and a subsequent increase during the wet period, with seasonal water level fluctuations of 0.60 to 0.70 m. During wet years with high water levels, small seasonal differences were observed with a nutrient peak in spring caused by external loading and nutrient loss via retention during summer. During years with low water levels, nutrient concentrations increased due to internal and external loading, exacerbated by evaporative water loss. In Lake Eymir, a shift to eutrophic conditions with turbid water occurred under low water level conditions and consequent internal loading of P from the sediment, causing high nutrient concentrations in summer. Our results indicate a threat of lakes drying out in the semi-arid climate zone if evaporation increases and precipitation decreases as anticipated from the global climate change predictions.

These rapid changes have important implications for near-shore ecology, sedimentology, water management, tourism, and industrial commerce throughout the Great Lakes region. Attempts to reconstruct climatic controls of lake level variability from tree rings have either been based on spatially and temporally limited tree-ring data sets or tree-ring records from sites in the Pacific Northwest teleconnected to Great Lakes climate. The necessary local tree-ring chronologies to develop more robust reconstructions of climate and its relation to Great Lakes levels simply do not exist. A particularly evident gap in available data exists in Lower Michigan, where logging in the 1800s removed most old growth forests. Here we report the development of three new tree-ring chronologies derived from a pier near the mouth of the Kalamazoo River that was constructed ca. 1871. The new chronologies include multi-century Pinus resinosa (1673-1878), Quercus spp. (1628-1847), and Tsuga canadensis (1643-1864) tree-ring data that exhibit patterns of correlation among reference chronologies of the same species indicative of origins within the Great Lakes Region, and possibly Lower Michigan. Our results illustrate the excellent potential to develop a more complete network of sites with tree-ring data throughout the Michigan-Huron Basin by utilizing wood incorporated into historical structures.

Twenty terrestrial and 20 marine climate proxies are used to identify long-term trends in humidity involving transitions from humid to arid conditions and vice versa. The frequency distribution of episodes of relative aridity across these records is calculated for the period 6300-2000 BC, so that the results may be interpreted in the context of the established arid episodes associated with RCC around 6200 and 2200 BC (the 8.2 and 4.2 kyr events). We identify two distinct episodes of heightened aridity in the early-mid 4th, and late 4th millennium BC. These episodes cluster strongly at 3600-3700 and 3100-3300 BC. There is also evidence of localised aridity spikes in the 5th and 6th millennia BC. These results are used as context for the interpretation of regional and local archaeological records with a particular focus on case studies from western Syria, the middle Euphrates, southern Israel and Cyprus. Interpretation of the records involves the construction of plausible narratives of human-climate interaction informed by concepts of adaptation and resilience from the literature on contemporary (i.e. 21st century) climate change and adaptation. The results are presented alongside well-documented examples of climatically-influenced societal change in the central and eastern Sahara, where detailed geomorphological studies of ancient environments have been undertaken in tandem with archaeological research. While the narratives for the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean remain somewhat speculative, the use of resilience and adaptation frameworks allows for a more nuanced treatment of human climate interactions and recognises the diversity and context-specificity of human responses to climatic and environmental change. Our results demonstrate that there is a need for more local environmental data to be collected 'at source' during archaeological excavations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

According to Peter Bakker, president and CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD, buildings are the largest energy consumers in the world economy, accounting for over one- third of final energy use and approximately 30% of global carbon emissions [1]. These figures do not take into account the energy and carbon emissions due to production of building materials or for logistics and building construction. The demand for both energy and resources is soaring as global construction booms, especially in countries such as China and India. This means that developments in building practice can significantly contribute to tackling climate change and energy use. The use of ETFE foils as a new transparent material substitute for glass provides the potential for not only vast savings in material quantities but simultaneously makes possible a new type of space for living and working. The environmental benefits are presented as results of a comparative study between glass and ETFE solutions on two projects in Germany, Domaquaree in Berlin and Kapuzinergraben in Aachen, based on a life cycle analysis. The social benefits will be presented using the example of Kingsdale School in London and Kuwait Avenues, Kuwait. It will be shown that the introduction of ETFE foil systems in modern architecture will significantly contribute not only to environmental sustainability, but also create economic and social advantages compared to more classic building materials.

These similar constructions, while being built regardless of their context, do not correspond to their environment and have the least effect in moderating weather conditions. According to statistics, in 2009 Iran's oil and gas consumption were 1.4 which is 3.1 times higher than the world average consumption. It is reported that residential sector accounted for 42% of the total energy consumption in the country during the period from 1998 to 2008. The southern Iranian marginal rim has one of the world's most critical climates; consideration of climatic components in housing design process is therefore essential in this area. Over the centuries, Climate consideration has been a fundamental principle in the design of vernacular Iranian houses, and application of these indigenous patterns in modern contemporary constructions of hot-humid region since it optimized the energy consumption and resultd in higher rate of thermal comfort. Climatic patterns of these vernacular houses not only affect the external characteristics of the building, but also are involved with the configuration and properties of the internal spaces. This paper is introducing functional spaces patterns in vernacular houses of Bushehr using by grounded theory parameters. This paper tries to clarify whether these patterns are in accordance with the climatic characteristics. Moreover, the extent to which the configuration of the living spaces is influenced by hot-humid climate has been investigated. This paper has applied objectives to establish the patterns and climatic solutions for classification of internal spaces in vernacular houses of Bushehr, so that it can be used in new-built dwellings to improve thermal comfort for building occupants in the mentioned region. The method of analysis and resultant in this research is qualitative based and answering the questions are found by grounded theory and data gathering from chosen samples, classification, analysis and finally choosing related data and their integration. Data gathering are conducted by the use of theoretical studies and analysis of vernacular houses documents and also in-depth analysis. Choosing the houses for further study, open and axial coding, and analysis by research pattern has was the first initial which was followed by the selective coding which leads to integration and introduction of vernacular house patterns. Final step comprises the study of typology and climatic pattern of vernacular houses in accordance with the climate and thermal comfort implications of the region; and the last step is research consequences. Climate calendar table according to Givoni indoors comfort zone of Bushehr show that using passive solar systems and mechanical heating are needed to improve the comfort level in cold months of the year. In summer time, mechanical dehumidification is needed from noon until midnight. In other times, the comfort level is provided or can be provide by using thermal mass and natural ventilation. Wind calendar table of Bushehr also indicates that sea breeze blows from north and north-west in every months from noon till 18: 30 and sometimes in morning. Integration of the data in selective coding explains that the vernacular houses of Bushehr are introverted and all the sides of the courtyard have been used for summer and winter spaces. Courtyards have north-west to south-east alignment. Approximately 14% of the whole is assigned to courtyard, which provides shadow on the interior walls because of small size of it. Using shading devices and porches and tall walls of courtyard are the other preparations for providing more shadow in the courtyard. Semi open spaces are located in northeast, north-west and south-west sides and semi open staircases are located in four corners of the courtyard. The composition of semi open spaces and staircases, courtyard and their orientation toward open air acts like a passive system of ventilation. This system works as a solar chimney when there are no breezes. Windows around the house help the ventilation system. The houses are stretched towards the central courtyard due to the wide-open and semi-open spaces and also closed spaces. This paper indicates that the climatic typology of the houses is in accordance with climate classification of towns in meso-climatic scale by studying the characteristic of vernacular houses and the climate in Busher. Studies reveal that architectural characteristics of vernacular houses are compatible with meso-climatic and local morphology in Bushehr. In addition, this research shows that, architectural characteristics of vernacular houses will improve the level of comfort in summer and winter; however, there are times in which thermal comfort cannot be provided by these vernacular provisions. This research indicates that the application of the climatic patterns in each zone of the southern region of Iran can improve the comfort level in new-built dwellings. This paper reveals that vernacular houses in hot-humid climate of Bushehr are in accordance with meso-climate classification in terms of typology and in terms of patterns and living spaces characteristic and configuration of plan based on context.","[Nikghadam, Niloufar] Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran South Branch, Fac Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Nikghadam, N (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran South Branch, Fac Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",n_nikghadam@azad.ac.ir,,,,,,,25,0,1,1,2,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 23, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,MAR,2015,32,,,,29,42,,,,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH0SC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000450017300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

On one hand, the world of Blade Runner 2049 is ravaged by climate change, creating an inhospitable environment. On the other, the film profoundly disavows this new anthropogenic condition by foregrounding the iconic designs of the first film to counterintuitively produce a neon world of technological consumption, reproductive futurity and human perfectibility. The economic franchise logic that demands uncritical repetition of elements directly derived from the much earlier original film in order to build brand continuity for its core audience produces a fundamental tension between the franchise storyworld (a known narrative past that leads to a predictable narrative future) and the Anthropocene world (an unseen and unsettling event that has resulted in an unpredictable present and unknown future). The logics of inheritance and reproduction that fuel both franchise and 2049's plot thus intersect, producing a narrative drive and visual register that actively disavows the conditions of catastrophic climate change that the film's worldbuilding otherwise makes visible. And it is this contradiction that makes 2049 truly of and for the Anthropocene as we know it; it is hard built into its ontology yet ignored at the level of human action.","[Hamblin, Sarah] Univ Massachusetts, Cinema Studies & English, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [O'Connell, Hugh C.] Univ Massachusetts, English, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Hamblin, S (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Cinema Studies & English, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,,,,,32,6,6,0,2,LIVERPOOL UNIV PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"4 CAMBRIDGE ST, LIVERPOOL L69 7ZU, ENGLAND",1754-3770,1754-3789,,SCI FICT FILM TELEV,Sci.

Within-species genetic variation plays an important role in persistence of populations under such changes by providing building blocks for adaptation. The brackish-water Baltic Sea is predicted to experience a significant desalination by the end of this century. The Baltic Sea is dominated, in terms of biomass, by a few species with locally adapted populations, making it a suitable model for studying shifting biotic interactions under changing abiotic conditions. We exposed two foundation species of brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus radicans, to end-of-the-century projected salinity together with grazing pressure in experimental tanks. We measured growth, grazing and phlorotannin content and compared these traits between the current and projected future salinity conditions, between Fucus species, and between high and low genotypic diversity groups. Grazing, phlorotannin content and growth of both F. radicans and F. vesiculosus all showed genotypic variation. Future decreased salinity hampered growth of F. vesiculosus irrespective of genotypic diversity of the experimental population. Furthermore, the growth response to desalination showed variation among genotypes. F. radicans was more susceptible to grazing than F. vesiculosus, and, in the high genetic diversity group of the latter, grazing was higher in the future than in current salinity. Climate change induced hyposalinity will thus challenge Fucus populations at their range margins in the Baltic Sea both because of the growth deterioration and changes in grazing. Differences between the species in these responses indicate a better ability of F. radicans to cope with the changing environment. Our results emphasize the complexity of biotic interactions in mediating the climate change influences as well as the importance of genetic diversity in coping with climate change.","[Milec, Leona J.

Research purpose: We expanded the Job Demands and Resources (JD-R) model by proposing psychosocial safety climate (PSC) as a precursor to job demands and job resources. As PSC theoretically influences the working environment, the study hypothesized that PSC has an impact on performance via both health erosion (i. e. burnout) and motivational pathways (i. e. work engagement). Motivation for the study: So far, integration of PSC in the JD-R model is only tested in a Western context (i. e. Australia). We tested the emerging construct of PSC in Malaysia, an Eastern developing country in the Asian region. Research design, approach and method: A random population based sample was derived using household maps provided by Department of Statistics, Malaysia; 291 employees (response rate 50.52%) from the State of Selangor, Malaysia participated. Cross-sectional data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Main findings: We found that PSC was negatively related to job demands and positively related to job resources. Job demands, in turn, predicted burnout (i. e. exhaustion and cynicism), whereas job resources predicted engagement. Both burnout and engagement were associated with performance. Bootstrapping showed significant indirect effects of PSC on burnout via job demands, PSC on performance via burnout and PSC on performance via the resources-engagement pathway. Practical/managerial implications: Our findings are consistent with previous research that suggests that PSC should be a target to improve working conditions and in turn reduce burnout and improve engagement and productivity. Contribution/value-add: These findings suggest that JD-R theory may be expanded to include PSC as an antecedent and that the expanded JD-R model is largely valid in an Eastern, developing economy setting.","[Idris, Mohd A.; Dollard, Maureen F.; Winefield, Anthony H.] Univ South Australia, Ctr Appl Psychol Res, Work & Stress Res Grp, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Idris, Mohd A.] Univ Malaya, Fac Art & Social Sci, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",University of South Australia; Universiti Malaya,"Idris, MA (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Ctr Appl Psychol Res, Work & Stress Res Grp, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",idrma001@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Idris, Mohd Awang/F-5113-2011; Dollard, Maureen F./E-7040-2011; Winefield, Anthony/F-4003-2013","Idris, Mohd Awang/0000-0001-7995-9617; Dollard, Maureen F./0000-0002-3128-8727; Winefield, Anthony/0000-0001-5027-6687",,,,,72,30,30,0,2,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-5200,2071-0763,,SA J IND PSYCHOL,SA J.

This 'tragedy of the horizon' is explored through three specific lenses on early Anthropocene futures. We begin with the dominant scientific evidence: mathematical and probabilistic modelling synthesised into increasingly rigorous and sophisticated scenarios for assessing policy options and broadening societal understanding. We then draw on the set of values, institutions, laws, and symbols through which people imagine their social whole in what Sheila Jasanoff describes as sociotechnical imaginaries. We also draw on institutional epistemologies as reflected in two global assessment initiatives: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has been described as a 'view from nowhere', and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, a 'view from everywhere', though analysis has concluded that both organisations merely offer 'views from somewhere'. We then present examples of other early Anthropocene imaginaries from writers, activists, and philosophers. The arc through these suggests both common themes and broad variation in underlying assumptions and world views. We argue that, especially in a post-truth world, a much richer form of (re)visioning the future is required in a project that must span far beyond the biophysical and include the full breadth of the social sciences and humanities. Without the inclusion of multiple underlying, competing, and creative long-term perspectives, society in general, and research in particular, may not adequately illuminate the complex possible future trajectories.","[Frame, Bob] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Cradock-Henry, Nicholas A.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand",University of Canterbury; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Frame, B (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Gateway Antarctica, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",research@frameworks.nz,,"Cradock-Henry, Nicholas/0000-0002-4409-9976; Frame, Bob/0000-0003-2447-4174",New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation's Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge [GNS-RNC044]; New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change programme [A26085],New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation's Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge; New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change programme,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business and Innovation's Resilience to Nature's Challenges National Science Challenge (GNS-RNC044), and the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change programme (A26085).",,123,0,0,5,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

Of the various renewable energy resources available, micro-hydro-power and pico-hydro-power remain very popular in both developed and developing countries. Since 2006, significant growth has spurted in the use of artificial free-surface vortices to generate low and ultra-low-head hydropower following the development of the so-called gravitational water vortex hydropower plant. The technology works on the principle of harnessing hydroelectric power from the high angular velocity experienced in the core of a whirlpool generated in a vortex chamber. In this article, a state-of-the-art review is undertaken on the vortex hydropower technology including a historical review of the technology, the underlying hydraulic principles of such devices, overview of research and technologies that have been deployed to date together with an evaluation of their performance and key findings. Currently, there are 19-22 known live vortex hydropower technologies operating internationally with key academic and commercial research activity in Europe and Asia. The average efficiency from these sites was found to be in the region of 53% which is lower than conventional propeller turbines but higher than waterwheel systems. It was found that the vortex plant, due to its ability to sustain relatively high efficiencies at low heads and small to medium flow rates, addresses a gap in the current turbine application chart. Its key advantage lies in the high-power densities produced compared with conventional technologies. The system also demonstrates potential to be able to function as a fish passage; however, stronger validation is required to prove this for a range of turbine systems. Finally, the authors propose a number of areas that should be investigated that should provide immediate improvements to the turbine in terms of performance.","[Timilsina, Ashesh Babu; Bajracharya, Tri Ratna] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Pulchowk Campus, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Mulligan, Sean] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Engn & Informat, Galway, Ireland; [Timilsina, Ashesh Babu; Bajracharya, Tri Ratna] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Ctr Energy Studies, Kathmandu, Nepal",Tribhuvan University; Institute of Engineering (IOE) - Nepal; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Tribhuvan University; Institute of Engineering (IOE) - Nepal,"Timilsina, AB (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Pulchowk Campus, Kathmandu, Nepal.;Timilsina, AB (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Ctr Energy Studies, Kathmandu, Nepal.",abtimilsina@pcampus.edu.np,,"Mulligan, Sean/0000-0002-6396-2253; Bajracharya, Tri Ratna/0000-0003-3364-0488; Timilsina, Ashesh Babu/0000-0001-6068-3809","Ministry of Energy, Government of Nepal; Center for Energy Studies, Institute of Engineering","Ministry of Energy, Government of Nepal; Center for Energy Studies, Institute of Engineering","Authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Ministry of Energy, Government of Nepal and Center for Energy Studies, Institute of Engineering.

The concept of thermally adaptive walls is that the thermal performance of walls can be dynamically changed based on cooling/heating demands to adapt to the climate better and achieve a higher level of energy saving. However, the concept of thermally adaptive walls has been rarely mentioned. Research on thermal adaptive walls technology is in its infancy, mostly scattered and unsystematic. This article briefly classifies and organizes the existing technologies for thermally adaptive walls. The working principles and thermal performance of thermally adaptive walls are discussed. Specifically, phase change material (PCM) integrated walls can effectively transfer the peak load in time and reduce the heat gain/loss of buildings. The thermal resistance (R-value) of dynamic insulation walls can be adjusted based on the cooling/heating demand to achieve the purpose of adapting to the climate. PCM integrated dynamic insulation walls combine the advantages of the above two and better reflect thermal adaptability. Moreover, the critical challenges in the application of thermally adaptive wall technologies are discussed, which highlight future research priorities for their application in buildings.

The details of the CAS FGOALS-f3-L model, experiment settings and output datasets are briefly introduced. The datasets include monthly and daily outputs from the atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea-ice component models of CAS FGOALS-f3-L, and all these data have been published online in the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, ). The three ensembles are initialized from the 600th, 650th and 700th model year of the preindustrial experiment (piControl) and forced by the same historical forcing provided by CMIP6 from 1850 to 2014. The performance of the coupled model is validated in comparison with some recent observed atmospheric and oceanic datasets. It is shown that CAS FGOALS-f3-L is able to reproduce the main features of the modern climate, including the climatology of air surface temperature and precipitation, the long-term changes in global mean surface air temperature, ocean heat content and sea surface steric height, and the horizontal and vertical distribution of temperature in the ocean and atmosphere. Meanwhile, like other state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, there are still some obvious biases in the historical simulations, which are also illustrated.

Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs), particularly forest gap models (FGMs), have been suggested as suitable tools for such joint predictions. However, DVMs generally feature a large number of parameters that need to be estimated and may cause considerable uncertainty in model outputs. In addition, model sensitivity may depend on environmental conditions, stand composition and development stage. We systematically evaluated the parameter sensitivity on simulated basal area of the state-of-the art FGM ForClim along a wide ecological gradient to analyze model behavior and identify key parameters and processes that cause the highest variability in model output. We applied the revised Morris screening method at 30 representative sites across Europe, and compared results for monospecific and mixed stands at two system states in time, i.e. early and late succession (dynamic equilibrium). The most influential parameters were related to tree establishment, the water and light regimes, growth and temperature, whereby the relative parameter influence of the latter strongly varied with climate. Further, model sensitivity differed between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late succession, reflecting the differential influence of ecological processes with stand structure. We conclude that the parameter sensitivity of complex models should be analyzed individually for several system states of interest.

Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem-wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long-term, spatio-temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long-term surveys (30-40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time-series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem-wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate-driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi-trophic trait-based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem-wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.","[Pecuchet, Laurene; Kortsch, Susanne; Nordstrom, Marie C.] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland; [Pecuchet, Laurene] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Tromso, Norway; [Lindegren, Martin] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Ctr Ocean Life, Lyngby, Denmark; [Calkiewicz, Joanna; Margonski, Piotr] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Gdynia, Poland; [Jurgensone, Iveta; Strake, Solvita] Latvian Inst Aquat Ecol, Riga, Latvia; [Otto, Saskia A.] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fishery Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Putnis, Ivars] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm BIOR, Riga, Latvia","Abo Akademi University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Technical University of Denmark; National Marine Fisheries Research Institute; University of Hamburg; Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health & Environment BIOR","Pecuchet, L (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland.",laurene.pecuchet@uit.no,"Kortsch, Susanne/AAP-8101-2021; Nordström, Marie C./C-8956-2012; Margonski, Piotr/M-2169-2015; Kortsch, Susanne/AAA-2231-2020","Kortsch, Susanne/0000-0002-6495-4781; Nordström, Marie C./0000-0001-5763-1813; Margonski, Piotr/0000-0002-8767-1880; Pecuchet, Laurene/0000-0002-8930-8786; Jurgensone, Iveta/0000-0002-0811-1747; Lindegren, Martin/0000-0002-9185-951X; Calkiewicz, Joanna/0000-0003-2123-1660","Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland; National Centre for Research and Development, Poland; Projekttrager Julich, Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; Swedish Research Council Formas; VKR Center for Ocean Life; VILLUM fonden young investigator grant [13159]; Latvian State research program 'The value and dynamic of Latvia's ecosystems under changing climate, EVIDEnT'","Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland; National Centre for Research and Development, Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); Projekttrager Julich, Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); VKR Center for Ocean Life; VILLUM fonden young investigator grant; Latvian State research program 'The value and dynamic of Latvia's ecosystems under changing climate, EVIDEnT'","This study is an outcome of the BONUS BLUEWEBS project, supported by the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union and the Academy of Finland (LP, SK, MCN), the National Centre for Research and Development, Poland (PM, JC), Projekttrager Julich, Germany (SO), the State Education Development Agency of Latvia (IP) and the Swedish Research Council Formas.

In the UK and Greece, the numbers and distribution of heterotrophic bacteria were not strongly related to seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall. At Portchester Castle, qualitative changes in bacterial populations have been observed; actinomycetes were found only on decayed stone and dominant on stone from Tell Basta, in semi-arid Egypt. In the Minoan palace at Petras and the fortifications of Khania higher counts of halotolerant heterotrophic bacteria were found in sheltered areas on stone showing other biological growths and salt efflorescence. For all monuments, stones of tower mechanical strength supported higher bacterial counts and electron mj,,,copy showed extensive sheets of biofilm, Estimations of carbohydrate in stone could also be related to whether the sites were exposed or protected. There is evidence to suggest that variations in the nature of bacterial populations may be dependent on season in temperate regions and in the Mediterranean climate related to the location within the monument. Bio film production and perhaps halotolerance provide means by which bacteria resist adverse changes in moisture levels. Extreme fluctuations in moisture may induce major shifts in bacterial populations selecting filamentous, spore-forming types that penetrate deeper into the stone.","Univ Portsmouth, Sch Biol Sci, Portsmouth PO1 2DY, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"May, E (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Biol Sci, King Henry Bldg,King Henry 1 St, Portsmouth PO1 2DY, Hants, England.",,"Abdulla, Hesham/H-6433-2014","Abdulla, Hesham/0000-0001-6901-1611",,,,,47,23,24,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,,0-306-46377-6,,,,2000,,,,,49,62,,,,,,14,Art; Microbiology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Art; Microbiology,BQ62V,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000088999300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study presents an existing climate of the archaeological sites, sanitation, and wastewater technologies to recognize the different elements that influenced the evolution of the civilization mystery. In addition, it is recommended that the weather and climate conditions in southwest Asia were the foremost controlling element in resolving the destiny of the Indus and Mehrgarh civilizations. Furthermore, the rural tradition was mostly adapted by the increasing rate of western depressions (winter rains), as well as monsoon precipitation in the region. The factors that affected the climate of both civilizations with the passage of time might be population growth, resource conflicts, technological advancement, industrial revolution, Aryan invasion, deforestation, migration, disasters, and sociocultural advancement. The communities residing in both civilizations had well developed agriculture, sanitation, water management, wells, baths, toilets, dockyards, and waterlogging systems and were the master of the water art.","[Khan, Saifullah] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Inst Social Sci, Multan 60000, Punjab, Pakistan; [Yilmaz, Nese] Istanbul Univ, Fac Aqut Sci, Dept Freshwater Resources & Management, TR-34134 Istanbul, Turkey; [Valipour, Mohammad] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Valipour, Mohammad] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Water Resources Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Valipour, Mohammad] King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Dept Meteorol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Angelakis, Andreas N.] Agr Res Institut Crete, HAO Demeter, Iraklion 71300, Greece; [Angelakis, Andreas N.] Union Hellen Water Supply & Sewerage Operators, Larisa 41222, Greece",Bahauddin Zakariya University; Istanbul University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; King Abdulaziz University,"Valipour, M (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Valipour, M (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Water Resources Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Valipour, M (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Dept Meteorol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",saifullahkhan33@gmail.com; nyilmaz@istanbul.edu.tr; valipour@hawaii.com; angelak@edeya.gr,,"YILMAZ, NESE/0000-0002-6487-7405",,,,,57,1,1,3,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2021,20,,,,,,2813,10.3390/w13202813,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13202813,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WN4WI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000711769500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The estimated changes in climatic conditions including increasing temperature, with particular attention to the summer means, together with the expected changes in the temporal precipitation distribution pose enormous challenge to the agriculture. Currently, dynamic system models are most frequently used tools that are capable of estimating the prospective effects of climate change on agro-ecosystems. A deterministic biogeochemical model is presented that is developed by Hungarian scientists within the framework of the AgroMo project. The main goal of the AgroMo project is to develop climate-smart strategies in order to mitigate the effect of potential future hazards in the context of climate change by 1) creating a complex, state-of-the-art experimental platform; 2) producing ten new, 0.1 degrees spatial resolution climate scenarios based on the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios; 3) developing an integrated assessment and modeling framework that is capable of simulating every major land use types; 4) analyzing/simulating a great number of adaptation strategies that can be used to support decision makers. Based on the preliminary simulation results, climate change will most likely expose significant negative impact on the spring sown crops in Hungary. Although, the yield losses could be avoided with irrigation or could be mitigated with earlier sowing, the role of winter crops is likely to become more significant in Hungary in the future.","[Pokovai, Klara] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Dept Soil Phys & Water Management, Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Herman Otto Ut 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Hollos, Roland; Bottyan, Emese; Kis, Anna; Pongracz, Rita; Hidy, Dora; Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, Pazmany P Setany 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Hollos, Roland; Bottyan, Emese; Kis, Anna; Pongracz, Rita; Hidy, Dora; Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Excellence Ctr, Fac Sci, Brunszvik U 2, H-2462 Martonvasar, Hungary; [Barcza, Zoltan] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Pasztor, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Dept Soil Mapping & Environm Informat, Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Herman Otto Ut 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Marton, Tibor; Fodor, Nandor] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Crop Prod Dept, Agr Inst, Brunszvik U 2, H-2462 Martonvasar, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Agricultural Research; Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Agricultural Research; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Agricultural Research,"Pokovai, K (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Dept Soil Phys & Water Management, Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Herman Otto Ut 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary.",pokovai.klara@agrar.mta.hu,"Pongracz, Rita/AHC-3783-2022; Pongracz, Rita/AGX-4838-2022; Barcza, Zoltán/G-3880-2014; Pasztor, Laszlo/B-3270-2014","Pongracz, Rita/0000-0001-7591-7989; Barcza, Zoltán/0000-0002-1278-0636; Pasztor, Laszlo/0000-0002-1605-4412; Pokovai, Klara/0000-0001-5438-161X",Szechenyi 2020 programme; European Regional Development Fund; Hungarian Government [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00028]; grant Advanced research supporting the forestry and wood-processing sector's adaptation to global change and the 4th industrial revolution - OP RDE [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803],Szechenyi 2020 programme; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Hungarian Government; grant Advanced research supporting the forestry and wood-processing sector's adaptation to global change and the 4th industrial revolution - OP RDE,"The research was funded by the Szechenyi 2020 programme, the European Regional Development Fund, the Hungarian Government (GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00028), and it was supported by the grant Advanced research supporting the forestry and wood-processing sector's adaptation to global change and the 4th industrial revolution, No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803 financed by OP RDE.",,49,3,3,0,4,HUNGARIAN METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE,BUDAPEST,"PO BOX 38, BUDAPEST, H-1525, HUNGARY",0324-6329,,,IDOJARAS,Idojaras,APR-JUN,2020,2,,SI,,209,225,,10.28974/idojaras.2020.2.4,http://dx.doi.org/10.28974/idojaras.2020.2.4,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,MA3BR,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000541793200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the lack of long-term observations of surface energy fluxes, not to mention spatially extensive ones, limits our understanding of how the surface energy distribution has responded to a warming climate over recent decades (1979-2009) at the national scale in China. Using four state-of-the-art reanalysis products with long-term surface energy outputs, we identified robust changes in surface energy partitioning, defined by the Bowen ratio (BR = SHF/LHF), over different climate regimes in China. Over the past three decades, the net radiation showed an increasing trend over almost the whole of China. The increase in available radiative energy flux, however, was balanced by differential partitioning of surface turbulent fluxes, determined by local hydrological conditions. In semi-arid areas, such as Northeast China, the radiative energy was transferred largely into SHF. A severe deficiency in near-surface and soil moistures led to a significant decreasing trend in LHF. The combined effect of increased SHF and decreased LHF resulted in significant upward trends in the BR and surface warming over Northeast China. In contrast, in the wet monsoon regions, such as southern China, increased downward net radiation favored a rise in LHF rather than in SHF, leading to a significant decreasing trend in the BR. Meanwhile, the increased LHF partly cancelled out the surface warming. The warming trend in southern China was smaller than that in Northeast China. In addition to impacts on heat-related events, the changes in the BR also reflected recent cases of extreme drought in China. Our results indicate that information regarding the BR may be valuable for drought monitoring, especially in regions prone to such conditions.","[Qian, Yitian; Hsu, Pang-Chi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Chi-Han] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Appl Hydrometeorol Res Inst, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Hsu, PC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pangchi@nuist.edu.cn,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Qian, Yitian/0000-0002-2790-9092","Natural Science Foundation (NSF) of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20140046]; NSF of China [41375100]","Natural Science Foundation (NSF) of Jiangsu Province, China; NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.

Based on ethnographic data from the rapidly urbanizing oasis metropolis urumchi in China's northwestern borderlands, this paper goes beyond such a localized view of climate responsiveness. It analyzes how individual thermal practices of residents are linked to the interests of the state and to socio-cultural notions of thermal comfort. Through the classification of Xinjiang as part of China's northern Heating Zone, the keeping warm of individual bodies becomes part of a territorializing strategy. There are, however, clear seasonal differences in how indoor residential spaces are regulated to maintain bodily comfort. In winter, apartment owners and residents enjoy the amenities of the state-financed heating infrastructure. In summer, cooling strategies depend on more neoliberalized, individual, social, and architectural ways to lower indoor temperatures. This paper unfolds the diversity of thermal discourses and practices that characterize urumchi citizens' creation of comfortable residential spaces throughout the seasons. The data outlines that houses as infrastructures are far from being simple containers that keep residents' bodies warm. Instead, the socio-technical organization of thermal spaces interferes with territorial strategies and ethnic place-making.","[Kobi, Madlen] Univ Svizzera Italiana Lugano, Acad Architettura, Inst Hist & Theory Art & Architecture, Largo Bernasconi 2, CH-6850 Mendrisio, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Kobi, M (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana Lugano, Acad Architettura, Inst Hist & Theory Art & Architecture, Largo Bernasconi 2, CH-6850 Mendrisio, Switzerland.",madlen.kobi@usi.ch,,"Kobi, Madlen/0000-0001-6644-4083",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This work was supported by the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [132387,157397].",,48,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1538-7216,1938-2863,,EURASIAN GEOGR ECON,Eurasian Geogr.

The project should be development focused on sustainability, explore the passive strategies and the energy generation potential of fa ades and roof. In this paper we analyze for the first time in Brazil and under current solar photovoltaic (PV) module prices, the technical and economic potential of integrating state-of-the-art, frameless, glass glass thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV modules on a commercial building fa ade and roof, and evaluate the economic feasibility of replacing traditional fa ade materials like architectural glass and aluminum composite material with sleek black PV modules in six Brazilian cities. The technical analysis consisted in evaluating the energy performance of a four-storey office building for each of the six cities under analysis. The technical analysis showed that it is possible to fully meet the energy demand of the office building with PV integration in all the Brazilian cities evaluated. While the local climate has a significant impact on the energy consumption due mostly to air conditioning loads, PV energy production follows the same trend. Most importantly, the economic analysis showed that with the declining costs of photovoltaics, replacing conventional fa ade building materials with PV modules is not only an innovative approach but also of economic benefit.

Previous works seldomly focused on bivariate flood quantiles under climate change at a national scale, and fewer flooding projections quantified the estimation uncertainty sourced from sample size limitation. This study systematically investigates the changes in bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume with incorporation of sampling uncertainty for 151 catchments over China, with climate trajectories projected by a set of multi-model ensemble under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. After correcting the systematical biases of eight CMIP5 GCM outputs, four state-of-the-art hydrological models are driven and validated for each catchment, and the best-simulation model is selected to project future streamflow scenarios. The copula function is employed to construct the joint distribution of flood peak and volume, and then the most likely realizations of bivariate quantiles are derived under different Joint Return Periods (JRPs), with the uncertainty envelope quantified with the area of 90% confidence ellipse by a copula-based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty (C-PBU) approach. Our results project an overall ascending trend of temperature and precipitation over China, and the bivariate flood quantiles and corresponding estimation uncertainty of most catchments in the future period (2056-2100) are much larger than the baseline (1961-2005), despite accompanied by substantial climate model uncertainty and spatial variability in magnitude. Many basins would be subjected to a dramatic increase of flood magnitude by over 50%, while only few basins are projected to experience a decreasing flood risk, suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to a warming climate over China.","[Yin, Jiabo; Guo, Shenglian; Gu, Lei; He, Shaokun; Ba, Huanhuan; Tian, Jing; Li, Qianxun; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [He, Shaokun] Delft Univ Technol, Water Resources Sect, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Delft University of Technology,"Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",jboyn@whu.edu.cn; slguo@whu.edu.cn; shisan@whu.edu.cn; he_shaokun@whu.edu.cn; hhba@whu.edu.cn; jingtian@whu.edu.cn; qianxunli@whu.edu.cn; jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Gu, Lei/GWQ-6785-2022","Guo, shenglian/0000-0002-8594-4988; Yin, Jiabo/0000-0002-2305-8729","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51539009, 51579183]; 111 Project Fund of China [B18037]; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark [18-M01-DTU]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project Fund of China; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,"This study was financially supported by the funding from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant NO. 51539009, 51579183), and the 111 Project Fund of China (B18037).

This paper is a contribution to non-native tree species (NNTS) introduction and use in Croatia, aiming at providing state of the art of NNTS as well as overview of studies and examples of possible management opportunities. Because of the complexity of the matter and growing need to further investigate risks and challenges of NNTS in Croatia, authors have continued their research and will publish the results in a separate paper. Amount of the area occupied by NNTS forest cultures point to the conclusion that the use of these tree species in forest practice is not reached by far and the nursery production does not back up the need for NNTS use. Paper also provides a comprehensive overwiev of different aspects and benefits of the use of NNTS in Croatia. For example, increased wood production and non-wood forest products; production of high quality timber in short-time periods; use of fast-growing tree species for bioenergy production in higher proportion and enhancement of ecosystem services. Increase of stability and adaptive capacity of forest stands by the use of NNTS is highlighted as new silvicultural option for facing climate change. Their use in reforestation or conversion of degraded forest to more valuabe and more resistant/resilient stands offers new possibilities. Integrated and site-specific management is a strategy, which seems to be an appropriate approach for guidelines for the introduction and management of NNTS in Croatia. The use of high productive, resistant NNTS presents new silvicultural solution especially important in terms of site amelioration and enhancement of resistance and resilience of forest stands, which is the most important component of adaptive forest management strategies.","[Dodan, Martina; Peric, Sanja] Croatian Forest Res Inst, Div Silviculture, Cvjetno Naselje 41, Jastrebarsko 10450, Croatia; [Brus, Robert] Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry & Renewable Forest Resources, Jamnikarjeva 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Eisold, Anne-Mareen] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phytomed, Kochhannstr 4, D-10249 Berlin, Germany; [Nicolescw, Valeriu-Norocel] Univ Transylvania Brasov, Fac Silviculture & Forest Engn, Sirul Beethoven 1, Brasov 500123, Romania; [Orsanic, Milan] Svetosimunska 25, HR-10002 Zagreb, Croatia; [Pratasiene, Kristina] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Environm & Ecol Dept, Studentu Str 11, LT-53361 Kaunas Dist, Lithuania",Croatian Forest Research Institute; Humboldt University of Berlin; Transylvania University of Brasov; Vytautas Magnus University,"Dodan, M (corresponding author), Croatian Forest Res Inst, Div Silviculture, Cvjetno Naselje 41, Jastrebarsko 10450, Croatia.",martinat@sumins.hr; robert.brus@bf.uni-lj.si; anne-mareen.eisold@hu-berlin.de; nvnicolescu@unitbv.ro; milan.orsanic3@zg.t-com.hr; k.grityte@gmail.com; sanjap@sumins.hr,"Đodan, Martina/C-7410-2019; Nicolescu, Valeriu-Norocel/ABB-6283-2020","Đodan, Martina/0000-0001-9871-1975; ",Management Committee of COST Action [FP 1403],Management Committee of COST Action,"We would like to thank the Management Committee of COST Action FP 1403 Non-native tree species for European forests - experiences, risks and opportunities (NNEXT) for providing the opportunity and finances to initiate this research and to acknowledge possibilities of NNTS in Croatian forestry through discussions in the scope of Training school.

Cooling loads represent an important share of the total energy consumption in warm climates, especially in commercial and office buildings. Moreover, mechanical systems will still be needed in most cases to cope with cooling loads, even after considering passive cooling strategies in the design of the building and its facade. Solar cooling technologies present interesting assets, being based on environmentally friendly cooling processes, driven by solar and thus renewable energy. However, their application in the built environment remains greatly limited. This paper assesses several solar cooling technologies in terms of their potential for facade integration; aiming to promote widespread application in buildings throughout the development of integrated architectural facade products. The assessment is based on a state-of-the-art review and discussion of key attributes for facade integration of selected technologies; and a qualitative evaluation of their suitability to respond to main product related barriers for the integration of building services identified in an earlier work by the authors. The cooling principles behind the operation of the assessed technologies have been extensively presented in the literature, so this paper focuses exclusively on key aspects to overcome barriers related to the technical feasibility, physical integration, durability, performance, and aesthetics of future integrated concepts. Results show that the suitability of the assessed technologies varies according to each particular barrier. Hence, no technology currently fits all required aspects. Nonetheless, the use of thermoelectric modules and compact units based on absorption technologies are regarded as the most promising for the development of either integral building components, or modular plug & play systems for facade integration. In any case, this is heavily conditioned to further efforts and explorations in the field to overcome identified challenges and knowledge gaps.","[Prieto, Alejandro; Knaack, Ulrich; Klein, Tillmann] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural Engn Technol, Architectural Facades & Prod Res Grp, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Auer, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Architecture, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Delft University of Technology; Technical University of Munich,"Prieto, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural Engn Technol, Architectural Facades & Prod Res Grp, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",A.I.Prietohoces@tudelft.nl; U.Knaack@tudelft.nl; Thomas.Auer@tum.de; T.Klein@tudelft.nl,,"Prieto, Alejandro/0000-0003-3386-7682","CONICYT, the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [7484/2013]","CONICYT, the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile","This paper is part of the ongoing Ph.D. research project titled COOLFACADE: Architectural integration of solar cooling technologies in the building envelope, developed within the Architectural Facades & Products Research Group (AF&P) of the Department of Architectural Engineering + Technology, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).

This includes both routine and severe weather events. For example, with precipitation events, local topography and weather influence water runoff and infiltration, which directly affect flooding as well as drinking water quality and availability. The impact of such events creates issues of public safety. Thus, the availability of highly localized weather model predictions focused on public safety and operations of infrastructure can mitigate the impact of severe weather. This is especially true if the lead time for the availability of such predictions enables proactive allocation and deployment of resources to minimize recovery time from severe events. Typically information at such a scale is simply not available. Hence, the ability of municipalities to proactively respond to these events is limited. Available continental- or regional-scale weather models are not appropriately matched to the temporal or spatial scale of such operations. While near-real-time assessment of observations of current weather conditions may have the appropriate geographic locality, by its very nature it is only directly suitable for reactive response. To address this gap, we use state-of-the-art physical weather models at the spatial scale of the city's infrastructure to avoid this mismatch in predictability. Model results are coupled to data-driven stochastic models to represent the actionable prediction of weather (business) impacts. In some cases, an intermediate physical model may be required to translate predicted weather into the phenomena that lead to such impacts. We have applied these ideas to several cities with a diversity of impacts and weather concerns and show how this coupled model methodology enables prediction of storm impacts on local infrastructure. We also discuss how this concept can be extended to a climate scale in order to evaluate the potential localized impacts of a warming planet and the effectiveness o strategies being used to mitigate such impacts.","[Treinish, L.; Praino, A.; Tewari, M.] IBM Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Hertell, B.] WeatherIntel LLC, Brookfield, CT 06804 USA",International Business Machines (IBM),"Treinish, L (corresponding author), IBM Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",lloydt@us.ibm.com; appraino@us.ibm.com; mtewari@us.ibm.com; brandonhertell@weather-intel.com,,"Treinish, Lloyd/0000-0002-9912-8885","IBM; City Government of Rio de Janeiro, Consolidated Edison of New York, DTE Energy, Hydro One; Vermont Electric Company","IBM(International Business Machines (IBM)); City Government of Rio de Janeiro, Consolidated Edison of New York, DTE Energy, Hydro One; Vermont Electric Company","We would like to thank IBM for supporting this research and development.

Their complexity, however, creates challenges for model analysis and data integration. A solution is to interface DGVMs with established statistical computing environments. Here we introduce rLPJGUESS, an R-package that couples the widely used DGVM LPJ-GUESS with the R environment for statistical computing, making existing R-packages and functions readily available to perform complex analyses with this model. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework by using rLPJGUESS to perform several otherwise laborious tasks: first, a set of single simulations, followed by global and local sensitivity analyses, a Bayesian calibration with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and a predictive simulation with multiple climate scenarios. Our example highlights the opportunities of interfacing existing models in earth and environmental sciences with state-of-the-art computing environments such as R.","[Bagnara, Maurizio; Gonzalez, Ramiro Silveyra; Dormann, Carsten F.; Hartig, Florian] Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Bagnara, Maurizio; Steinkamp, Joerg; Hickler, Thomas; Werner, Christian] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Gonzalez, Ramiro Silveyra] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Reifenberg, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ, Geosci, Dept Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hartig, Florian] Univ Regensburg, Fac Biol & Preclin Med, Theoret Ecol, Univ Str 3, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Freiburg; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Regensburg,"Bagnara, M (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",maurizio.bagnara@senckenberg.de,"Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Steinkamp, Joerg/G-5622-2010","Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Steinkamp, Joerg/0000-0002-7861-8789; Werner, Christian/0000-0001-7032-8683; Silveyra Gonzalez, Ramiro/0000-0002-3430-8383; bagnara, maurizio/0000-0002-9004-7886",DFG Priority Program 1374 Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories; project CONECT [DO 786/8-1],DFG Priority Program 1374 Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories; project CONECT,"We used weather data from the Biodiversity Exploratories (http://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/1/home/).We thank the managers of the three Exploratories, Konstans Wells, Swen Renner, Sonja Gockel, Kerstin Wiesner, Andreas Hemp, Martin Gorke and all former managers for their work in maintaining the plot and project infrastructure; Simone Pfeiffer, Maren Gleisberg and Christiane Fischer for giving support through the central office, Jens Nieschulze and Michael Owonibi for managing the central data base, and Markus Fischer, Eduard Linsenmair, Dominik Hessenmoller, Daniel Prati, Ingo Schoning, Francois Buscot, Ernst-Detlef Schulze, Wolfgang W.

We compute G for a 3-year period with the MATCH model driven by NCEP reanalyses. Last contact time is resolved in 3-d intervals, and last-contact location is resolved with a global tiling of 41 patches concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere. The transport climate is quantified for four midlatitude receptor regions in terms of the seasonal mean surface-origin and transit-time partitioning of the column burden, the surface flux of newly arriving air, and the distribution of air mass in transit from source to receptor surface. At long transit times a nearly receptor-independent pattern of last-contact location is governed by where air is injected into the upper troposphere by deep convection and the high terrain of Tibet. The receptor origin composition of the column burden changes only slowly after similar to 40 d for winter and fall, while the composition of the flux onto the receptor continues to change at similar to 60 d. European and SE Asian air contribute comparably to the flux onto eastern North America, in spite of SE Asian air having the dominant burden. The flux of European air onto SE Asia in winter and fall is larger than the flux of SE Asian air onto Europe. The surface-to-surface transport mass distribution, R, is used to identify transit-time-dependent source-receptor teleconnections.","[Holzer, Mark; Hall, Timothy M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Holzer, Mark] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Atmospher Sci Program, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Holzer, Mark] Langara Coll, Dept Phys, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Holzer, Mark; Hall, Timothy M.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University; University of British Columbia; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Holzer, M (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.",hm2220@columbia.edu; thall@giss.nasa.gov,"Holzer, Mark/E-8735-2011","Holzer, Mark/0000-0002-9568-1763; Hall, Timothy/0000-0003-1755-4889",,,,,44,8,8,0,4,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Among the claimed benefits are mild processing conditions, process simplicity, flexibility, high resolution potential, and lead omission, Most of the presently available knowledge on the utility and reliability of conductive adhesives has been gathered with silver filled isotropic conductive epoxy adhesives (ICA's). In addition, the use of gold or nickel filled anisotropic conductive film or paste adhesives has been investigated quite intensively, Even conductive adhesive joints made with unfilled nonconductive adhesives are being considered for flip chip applications. To date, quite some work has been published demonstrating the usefulness and limitations of isotropic adhesives to bond a variety of IC (e.g., QFP) discrete (e.g., SOT) and passive components (R and C) under different climate conditions using various circuit- and component-metallizations. Most of the isotropic conductive adhesives require noble metallizations (e.g., Au or AgPd) to survive harsh environmental conditions as for instance 85 degrees C/85%RH and temperature cycling from -40 to +125 degrees C, Most of the adhesives give bad results on SnPb surfaces, a few special types show better results in 85 degrees C/85%RH, Deterioration of the electrical properties is due to an increase in the contact resistance. The bulk resistance of the adhesive, although considerably higher than that of solder, usually remains quite constant. On passivated Cu substrates reasonable good results are obtained. With Au finished surfaces large components may give problems in drop tests and temperature cycling due to insufficient bond area, unfavorable bond geometries or failures due to thermal expansion differences. The use of a coating or glob top on the leads may overcome these problems. With Au coated plastic spheres filled anisotropic conductive adhesives [ACA(F)] results opposite to the ICA's were obtained. For QFP80 (Au) joints with ACAF on FR-4 (Au) considerable increase in R-value was found after Temperature Humidity (TH) testing at 85 degrees C/85%RH and Temperature Cycling (TC,-20/100 degrees C), while with QFP80 (SnPb) R-values did not increase. This was found to be due to the formation of microsolder bridges, Microsolder joints can also be made with commercially available SnBi filled ACA. Some insight has been developed into the possible failure causes with ICA's, Surface oxidation of SnPb and interfacial cracks and delamination have for instance been observed, although the extent of their contributions under various conditions still needs to be resolved, The danger of Ag migration seems to be low as long as no liquid water is present. In summary, present results indicate that reliable connections with conductive adhesives even under harsh climate conditions are possible with the right choice of adhesive and metallizations of components and boards.","Philips Ctr Mfg Technol, NL-5600 Eindhoven, Netherlands",Philips,"Jagt, JC (corresponding author), Philips Ctr Mfg Technol, NL-5600 Eindhoven, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,51,129,131,1,66,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1070-9886,,,IEEE T COMPON PACK A,IEEE Trans Compon.

During the past decades, a comprehensive understanding of feedstock structure, fast pyrolysis kinetics, product distribution, and transport effects that govern the process has allowed to design better pyrolysis reactors and/or catalysts. A variety of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks, like corn stover, pinewood, poplar, and model compounds like glucose, xylan, monolignols have been utilized to study the thermal decomposition at or close to fast pyrolysis conditions. Significant progress has been made in understanding the kinetics by developing unique setups such as drop-tube, PHASR, and micropyrolyzer reactors in combination with the use of advanced analytical techniques such as comprehensive gas and liquid chromatography (GC, LC) with time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). This has led to initial intrinsic kinetic models for biomass and its main components, namely cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, validated using experimental setups where the effects of heat and mass transfer on the performance of the process, expressed using Biot and pyrolysis numbers, are adequately negligible. Yet, not all aspects of fast pyrolysis kinetics of biomass components are equally well understood. The use of time-resolved or multiplexed experimental techniques can further improve our understanding of reaction intermediates and their corresponding kinetic mechanisms. The novel experimental data combined with first principles based multiscale models can reshape biomass pyrolysis models and transform biomass fast pyrolysis to a more selective and energy efficient process.

Work stress can appear as a result of the relationship between the individual, the work environment and the individual perception of threatening factors derived from work, which endangers physical, psychological and social well-being and increases the probability of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption is a frequent behavior in the working population, as a negative coping with stress. The objective of this work was to know the state of the art of the relationship between the work environment, work stress and alcohol consumption in workers. Methods: Systematic review of primary studies in English, Portuguese and Spanish from 2009 to 2019, the study population was workers of both sexes. Search in multiple databases: PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, EBSCO Host, Redalyc; the Google Scholar search engine was used to obtain full-text documents. Three reviewers participated in the data selection and extraction process independently, agreeing on the results. Results: 533 studies were found, of which 17 met the eligibility criteria. An association was identified between the work environment (work environment) and/or work stress with the consumption of alcohol in the working population, a meta-analysis was also analyzed which concludes that the workers who presented greater work stress were low-risk drinkers of 20 g/day (2 UBEs) for men and 10 g/day (1 UBE) for women; and risk drinkers with 40 g/d (4 UBEs/day) in men and >20-25 g/d (2-2.5 UBEs/day) in women.

Such procedure could resolve practical issues in damage research, liability issues and forensic investigations. A substantial number of attempts for fingerprinting of building materials, including cement, has already been carried out during the last decades. Most of them were based on concentration analysis of the main elements/components. This review provides an overview of provenance studies of cement and the main approaches commonly used. Provenance studies of cement via isotope techniques are also presented and discussed as representatives of the state-of-the-art in the field. Due to the characteristic properties and the occurrence of carefully selected isotope ratios, unique fingerprints of different kinds of materials can be provided by these methods. This property has largely been explored in various scientific fields such as geo- and cosmochemistry, food forensics, archaeology, geochronology, biomedical studies, and climate change processes. However, the potential of isotope techniques in cement and concrete research for provenance studies has barely been investigated. Therefore, the review outlines a suitable approach using isotope ratios, which could lead to reliable provenancing of cementitious materials in the future.","[Kazlagic, Anera; Vogl, Jochen] Fed Inst Mat Res & Testing, Div Inorgan Trace Anal 11, Richard Willstater Str 1, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Gluth, Gregor J.

The present paper synthesizes the new simulations of both the twentieth- and twenty-first-century arctic freshwater budget components for use in the IPCC AR4, and attempts to determine whether demonstrable progress has been achieved since the late 1990s. Precipitation and its difference with evapotranspiration are addressed over the Arctic Ocean and its terrestrial watersheds, including the basins of the four major rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean: the Ob, the Yenisey, the Lena, and the Mackenzie. Compared to the previous [IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR)] generation of AOGCMs, there are some indications that the models as a class have improved in simulations of the Arctic precipitation. In spite of observational uncertainties, the models still appear to oversimulate area-averaged precipitation over the major river basins. The model-mean precipitation biases in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have retained their major geographical patterns, which are at least partly attributable to the insufficiently resolved local orography, as well as to biases in large- scale atmospheric circulation and sea ice distribution. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean is also slightly oversimulated. The simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean is in qualitative agreement between the models as well as with observational and reanalysis data. This is also generally the case for the seasonality of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean's terrestrial watersheds, with a few exceptions. Some agreement is demonstrated by the models in reproducing positive twentieth- century trends of precipitation in the Arctic, as well as positive area-averaged P-E late-twentieth-century trends over the entire terrestrial watershed of the Arctic Ocean. For the twenty-first century, three scenarios are considered: A2, A1B, and B1. Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and its watersheds increases through the twenty-first century, showing much faster percentage increases than the global mean precipitation. The arctic precipitation changes have a pronounced seasonality, with the strongest relative increase in winter and fall, and the weakest in summer. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean increases for all scenarios from all major river basins considered, and is generally about twice as large as the increase of freshwater from precipitation over the Arctic Ocean (70 degrees-90 degrees N) itself. The across-model scatter of the precipitation increase for each scenario is significant, but smaller than the scatter between the climates of the different models in the baseline period.","Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; Voeikov Main Geophys Observ, St Petersburg, Russia; Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Walsh, JE (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",jwalsh@iarc.uaf.edu,"Pavlova, Tatiana V/D-1456-2016; Zhang, Xiangdong/A-9711-2009; Kattsov, Vladimir M/D-1467-2016","Zhang, Xiangdong/0000-0001-5893-2888; Walsh, John/0000-0001-9541-5927; Kattsov, Vladimir/0000-0001-9108-3670",,,,,35,104,104,0,17,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

The models were all driven by the WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI) meteorological dataset, but used different datasets for non-meteorologic inputs and were run at various spatial and temporal resolutions, although all data were re-sampled to a common 0.5 degrees spatial and daily temporal resolution. For the evaluation, we used a broad range of performance metrics related to important aspects of the hydrograph. We found pronounced inter-model performance differences, underscoring the importance of hydrological model uncertainty in addition to climate input uncertainty, for example in studies assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change. The uncalibrated GHMs were found to perform, on average, better than the uncalibrated LSMs in snow-dominated regions, while the ensemble mean was found to perform only slightly worse than the best (calibrated) model. The inclusion of less-accurate models did not appreciably degrade the ensemble performance. Overall, we argue that more effort should be devoted on calibrating and regionalizing the parameters of macro-scale models. We further found that, despite adjustments using gauge observations, the WFDEI precipitation data still contain substantial biases that propagate into the simulated runoff. The early bias in the spring snowmelt peak exhibited by most models is probably primarily due to the widespread precipitation underestimation at high northern latitudes.","[Beck, Hylke E.] Princeton Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [van Dijk, Albert I.

Here, we assess changes in temperature and heat waves over different regions of the African continent, with a focus on spatiotemporal trends and the time of emergence of change in hot extremes from natural variability. We analyse absolute and relative threshold indices. Data sets include temperatures from observations (CRUTS4.03 and BEST) and from three representative state-of-the-art reanalyses (ERA5, MERRA2 and JRA-55) for the common period 1980-2018. Statistically significant warming is observed over all regions of Africa in temperature time series from CRU observations and reanalysis data, although the trend strength varies between data sets. Also, extreme temperatures and heat wave indices from BEST observations and all reanalysis data sets reveal increasing trends over all regions of the African continent. However, there are differences in both trend strength and time evolution of heat wave indices between different reanalysis data sets. Most data sets agree in identifying 2010 as a peak heat year over Northern and Western Africa while Eastern and Southern Africa experienced the highest heat wave occurrence in 2016. Our results clearly reveal that heat wave occurrences have emerged from natural climate variability in Africa. The earliest time of emergence takes place in the Northern Africa region in the early 2000s while in the other African regions emergence over natural variability is found mainly after 2010. This also depends on the respective index metrics, where indices based on more consecutive days show later emergence of heat wave trends. Overall, significant warming and an increase in heat wave occurrence is found in all regions of Africa and has emerged from natural variability in the past one or two decades.","[Engdaw, Mastawesha Misganaw; Steiner, Andrea K.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria; [Engdaw, Mastawesha Misganaw] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, FWF DK Climate Change, Graz, Austria; [Ballinger, Andrew P.; Hegerl, Gabriele C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Steiner, Andrea K.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, Inst Phys, Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz; University of Edinburgh; University of Graz,"Engdaw, MM (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria.;Engdaw, MM (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, FWF DK Climate Change, Graz, Austria.",mastawesha.engdaw@uni-graz.at,"Steiner, Andrea K/F-7980-2017","Steiner, Andrea K/0000-0003-1201-3303; Ballinger, Andrew/0000-0003-3704-1976; Engdaw, Mastawesha Misganaw/0000-0001-8224-2369",Austrian Science Fund [W1256],Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: W1256",,55,3,3,6,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

This situation is changing and this is for several reasons: There is a clear shift from attention for heating energy to the total energy use (heating, cooling, lighting, fans,...); There is increased attention for thermal comfort in summer, indoor air quality and lighting; There is an increased availability of more complex components who often have variable characteristics (e.g. climate facades, demand controlled ventilation,...); The new European Directive on Energy Performance will oblige all EU member states to have such assessment procedures for ALL buildings and ALL kind of components; As a result, a whole range of needs can be identified whereby there clearly are important scientific challenges.

This was achieved by comparing off-line simulations against observations and a detailed state-of-the-art model over a range of experimental conditions. Results showed that the standard LSM, which uses fixed vegetation and soil parameter values, systematically underestimated evapotranspiration, partly due to underestimating bare soil evaporation, which appeared to be a conceptual problem. In dry summer conditions, transpiration was seriously underestimated. The bias in surface runoff and percolation was not of the same sign for all three locations. A sensitivity analysis, set up to explore the impact of using standard parameter values, found that implementing site specific soil hydraulic properties had a significant effect on runoff and percolation at all three sites. Evapotranspiration, however, was affected only slightly at the temperate humid climate sites. Under semi-arid conditions, introducing site specific soil hydraulic properties plus a realistic rooting depth improved simulation results considerably. Future adjustments to the standard LSM should focus on parameter values of soil hydraulic functions and rooting depths and, conceptually, on the bare soil evaporation parameterisation and the soil bottom boundary condition. Implications of changing soil hydraulic properties for future large-scale simulations were explored briefly. For Europe, soil data requirements can be fulfilled partly by the recent data base HYPRES. Sandy and loamy sand soils will then cover about 65% of Europe, whereas in the present model 100% of the area is loam.

Due to climate change, the earth's temperature has increased and reached a higher level in recent years that in turn results in a distressed environment for all living beings for survival. All the consequences that scientists warned would occur as a result of global climate change in the past are now occurring: rapid sea-level rise, sea ice loss and longer, more intense heat waves. Geopolymer materials are considered as one of the solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the cement industry. Geopolymers provide the industry with great potential and sustainable alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). However, when subjected to flexure and tension stresses, the geopolymer's inherent brittleness displays drawbacks like OPC; both need fibre reinforcement to control cracks propagation, enhance toughness and deformation. As a result, the development of fibre-reinforced geopolymer composites (FRGC) has attracted increased attention, with a wide range of fibres being used. This study presents a review of the published papers on the FRGC; the research papers were reviewed and classified into sub-categories depending on the fibres type. The physical, mechanical and microstructural properties of geopolymer composites were discussed in detail. By reviewing the literature, it is evident that the FRGC can be a potential solution for structural applications with excellent performance. The improvements in geopolymer properties with the fibre addition have paved the way for further studies in this regard to exploring its performance in unused areas.","[Abbas, Al-Ghazali Noor; Aziz, Farah Nora Aznieta Abdul; Nasir, Noor Azline Mohd] Univ Putra Malaysia UPM, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Housing Res Ctr HRC, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abdan, Khalina] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Trop Forestry & Forest Prod INTROP, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Huseien, Ghasan Fahim] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, Singapore 117566, Singapore",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; National University of Singapore,"Abbas, AGN; Aziz, FNAA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia UPM, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Housing Res Ctr HRC, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",na706050@gmail.com; farah@upm.edu.my,,,"Ministry of Education, Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FRGS/1/2020/TKO/UPM/02/32, 5540372]","Ministry of Education, Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this research by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2020/TKO/UPM/02/32) with Vot no: 5540372 for research work entitled `An investigation of characterization and parametric effect of kenaf bast fibre in the properties of geopolymer kenaf reinforced concrete'.",,176,6,6,42,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0618,1879-0526,,CONSTR BUILD MATER,Constr.

In this work, we present a selection of state-of-the-art Neural Networks (NN) for the prediction of water temperatures in six streams in Germany. We show that the use of methods that compare observed and predicted values, exemplified with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), is not sufficient for their assessment. Hence we introduce additional analysis methods for our models to complement the state-of-the-art metrics. These analyses evaluate the NN's robustness, possible maximal and minimal values, and the impact of single input parameters on the output. We thus contribute to understanding the processes within the NN and help applicants choose architectures and input parameters for reliable water temperature prediction models.","[Mohr, Stefanie; Drainas, Konstantina; Geist, Juergen] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Theoret Comp Sci, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Mohr, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Theoret Comp Sci, Munich, Germany.",,,,DFG Research Training Group on Continuous Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems (GRK 2428); AquaKlif project of the Bayklif network - Bavarian State Ministry of Science and Arts (Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kunst),DFG Research Training Group on Continuous Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems (GRK 2428); AquaKlif project of the Bayklif network - Bavarian State Ministry of Science and Arts (Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kunst),"This work was financially supported by the DFG Research Training Group on Continuous Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems (GRK 2428) and the AquaKlif project of the Bayklif network funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and Arts (Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kunst).

In the absence of external forcing, all three models produce centennial variability in the mean zonal sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) gradients in the equatorial Pacific with counterparts in the extratropics. The centennial pattern in the tropical Pacific is dissimilar to that of the interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in that the most prominent expression in temperature is found beneath the surface of the western Pacific warm pool. Some global repercussions nevertheless are analogous, such as a hemispherically symmetric atmospheric wave pattern of alternating highs and lows. Centennial variability in western equatorial Pacific SST is a result of the strong asymmetry of interannual ocean heat content anomalies, while the eastern equatorial Pacific exhibits a lagged, Bjerknes-like response to temperature and convection in the west. The extratropical counterpart is shown to be a flux-driven response to the hemispherically symmetric circulation anomalies emanating from the tropical Pacific. Significant centennial-length trends in the zonal SST and SLP gradients rivaling those estimated from observations and model simulations forced with increasing CO2 appear to be inherent features of the internal climate dynamics simulated by all three models. Unforced variability and trends on the centennial time scale therefore need to be addressed in estimated uncertainties, beyond more traditional signal-to-noise estimates that do not account for natural variability on the centennial time scale.","[Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02544 USA; [Smerdon, Jason E.; Seager, Richard] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Fidel Gonzalez-Rouco, Jesua] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Columbia University; Complutense University of Madrid,"Karnauskas, KB (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 360 Woods Hole Rd,MS 23, Woods Hole, MA 02544 USA.",kk@whoi.edu,"Smerdon, Jason E/F-9952-2011; González-Rouco, Jesús Fidel/B-1761-2012","González-Rouco, Jesús Fidel/0000-0001-7090-6797; Seager, Richard/0000-0003-4772-9707",WHOI Ocean and Climate Change Institute (OCCI); NOAA [NA10OAR431037],WHOI Ocean and Climate Change Institute (OCCI); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments throughout the review process, and Delia Oppo for her constructive feedback on an early draft of this manuscript.

Here, we explore variation in and covariation of two sources of information to address rates of treeline change on one mountain face in the central Rocky Mountains: repeat photography and remote sensing. The repeat photography work involved assembling and quantitatively comparing four photographs that span 148 years. The remote sensing analyses covered a shorter period (35 years) but provided quantitative measurements and fuller landscape coverage. The repeat photography results demonstrated pronounced elevational advance of erect forest, at a rate 1.8 m/year during 2004-2020. The remote sensing analyses reflected similar processes but also reflected considerable infilling of tree cover near treeline; consequent increases in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in the upper forested areas may thus indicate treeline advance or changes in forest characteristics below treeline. Overall, these results document (1) acceleration in rise of treeline at this site in recent decades and (2) elevational compression of vegetation zones above treeline, with important implications for conservation of nonforested alpine ecosystems. Integrating multiple streams of evidence offers complementary views and insights in analyzing this phenomenon.","[Peterson, A.

The future development of forest landscapes is very much dependent on how forest owners act and what goes on in the wider world; thus, models are needed that incorporate these aspects. The objective of this study is to assess how nine European state-of-the-art forest DSSs cope with these issues. The assessment focuses on the ability of these DSSs to generate landscape-level scenarios to explore the output of current and alternative forest management models (FMMs) in terms of a range of ESs and the robustness of these FMMs in the face of increased risks and uncertainty. Results show that all DSSs assessed in this study can be used to quantify the impacts of both stand- and landscape-level FMMs on the provision of a range of ESs over a typical planning horizon. DSSs can be used to assess how timber price trends may impact that provision over time. The inclusion of forest owner behavior as reflected by the adoption of specific FMMs seems to be also in the reach of all DSSs. Nevertheless, some DSSs need more data and development of models to estimate the impacts of climate change on biomass production and other ESs. Spatial analysis functionality needs to be further developed for a more accurate assessment of the landscape-level output of ESs from both current and alternative FMMs.","[Nordstrom, Eva-Maria; Eriksson, Ljusk Ola] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Resource Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Nieuwenhuis, Maarten; Black, Kevin; Corrigan, Edwin; Lundholm, Anders] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Forestry, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Baskent, Emin Zeki] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Forestry, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey; [Biber, Peter; Poschenrieder, Werner] TUM, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Borges, Jose G.; Marto, Marco] Univ Lisbon, Sch Agr, Forest Res Ctr, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bugalho, Miguel N.] Univ Lisbon, Sch Agr, Ctr Appl Ecol CEABN InBIO, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Corradini, Giulia; Masiero, Mauro; Pettenella, Davide; Zoccatelli, Davide] Univ Padua, TeESAF Dept, Vle Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Felton, Adam; Lindbladh, Matts; Lodin, Isak] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Box 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Forsell, Nicklas; Korosuo, Anu] IIASA, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Hengeveld, Geerten; Hoogstra-Klein, Marjanke] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Mozgeris, Gintautas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Forest Management & Wood Sci, Studentu 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Lithuania; [Sedmak, Robert; Tucek, Jan] Tech Univ Zvolen, Dept Forest Management & Geodesy, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; [Sedmak, Robert] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Forest Management, Kamycka 1176, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Zoccatelli, Davide] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus Givat Ram, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University College Dublin; Karadeniz Technical University; Technical University of Munich; Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Padua; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Wageningen University & Research; Vytautas Magnus University; Technical University Zvolen; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Nordstrom, EM (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Resource Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.;Nieuwenhuis, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Forestry, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",eva-maria.nordstrom@slu.se; maarten.nieuwenhuis@ucd.ie; eminzekibaskent@gmail.com; peter.biber@lrz.tum.de; kevin.g.black@gmail.com; joseborges@isa.ulisboa.pt; migbugalho@isa.ulisboa.pt; giulia.corradini@unipd.it; edwint.corrigan@gmail.com; ola.eriksson@slu.se; adam.felton@slu.se; forsell@iiasa.ac.at; geerten.hengeveld@wur.nl; marjanke.hoogstra@wur.nl; korosuo@iiasa.ac.at; matts.lindbladh@slu.se; isak.lodin@slu.se; anders.lundholm@ucdconnect.ie; marcovmarto@isa.ulisboa.pt; mauro.masiero@unipd.it; gintautas.mozgeris@asu.lt; davide.pettenella@unipd.it; werner.poschenrieder@lrz.tum.de; sedmak@tuzvo.sk; tucek@tuzvo.sk; zoccatelli.davide@gmail.com,"Marto, Marco/AAE-8679-2020; SEDMÁK, Róbert/AAC-8155-2019; Biber, Peter/AAP-2681-2020; Borges, Jose/A-4131-2008; Bugalho, Miguel N/J-2993-2013; BASKENT, Emin Zeki/AAI-6886-2021; Pettenella, Davide/B-6874-2012","Marto, Marco/0000-0003-3855-9689; Biber, Peter/0000-0002-9700-8708; Borges, Jose/0000-0002-0608-5784; Bugalho, Miguel N/0000-0002-7081-657X; BASKENT, Emin Zeki/0000-0003-2053-0298; Mozgeris, Gintautas/0000-0002-8480-6006; Forsell, Nicklas/0000-0002-4984-3231; Corradini, Giulia/0000-0001-8636-868X; Nieuwenhuis, Maarten/0000-0002-3883-4559; Black, Kevin/0000-0002-9502-961X; Tucek, Jan/0000-0003-4538-6894; Sedmak, Robert/0000-0002-4757-6811; Pettenella, Davide/0000-0002-7403-9560","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [676754]; Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT) [IF/01171/2014, UID/AGR/00239/2013, SFRH/BD/108225/2015]",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 676754.

Empirical evidence increasingly shows that short episodes of high temperature experienced around flowering can have large negative impacts on cereal grain yields, a phenomenon increasingly referred to as heat stress. Crop models are currently the best tools available to investigate how crops will grow under future climatic conditions, though the need to include heat stress effects has been recognized only relatively recently. We reviewed literature on both how key crop physiological processes and the observed yields under production conditions are impacted by high temperatures occurring particularly in the flowering and grain filling phases for wheat, maize and rice. This state of the art in crop response to heat stress was then contrasted with generic approaches to simulate the impacts of high temperatures in crop growth models. We found that the observed impacts of heat stress on crop yield are the end result of the integration of many processes, not all of which will be affected by a high temperature regime. This complexity confirms an important role for crop models in systematizing the effects of high temperatures on many processes under a range of environments and realizations of crop phenology. Four generic approaches to simulate high temperature impacts on yield were identified: (1) empirical reduction of final yield, (2) empirical reduction in daily increment in harvest index, (3) empirical reduction in grain number, and (4) semi-deterministic models of sink and source limitation. Consideration of canopy temperature is suggested as a promising approach to concurrently account for heat and drought stress, which are likely to occur simultaneously. Improving crop models' response to high temperature impacts on cereal yields will require experimental data representative of field production and should be designed to connect what is already known about physiological responses and observed yield impacts.

Thus land surface information is crucial to the global and regional weather and climate predictions. China has built abundant meteorological stations that collect land surface data with good quality for many years. But applications of these data in their numerical weather and climate prediction models are quite low efficient. To take the advantages of land surface data in numerical weather and climate models, we have developed a three dimension variational (3DVar) Land Data Assimilation Scheme (LDAS). In Part 1 of this paper, we present the mathematical design of the 3DVar LDAS. By assimilating a single point observational datum into a background setup, the LDAS is tested to demonstrate its capability and usage. In the other part of this paper, we will demonstrate the results and error analysis of assimilating China's air temperature observational data of the meteorological stations into ECMWF's model background using the 3DVar Land Data Assimilation Scheme.","Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sino US Cooperat Ctr Remote Sensing, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Gao, W (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sino US Cooperat Ctr Remote Sensing, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",,"Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022",,,,,,9,1,1,0,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6377-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,E2982,E2982,62982E,10.1117/12.679994,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.679994,,,8,Ecology; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,BFM14,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243026400066,View Full Record in Web of Science

(2) Did life persist during the LGM? (3) Which shifts in ecosystems can be detected? (4) Does the fire-record testify for the presence of humans and their environmental impact? (5) How old is Neolithisation in the world's largest highlands? The results of this integrated multi-disciplinary investigation revealed (1) the meso-climatic effect of the Himalayan arc's relief channeled westerlies with West-Himalayan forest-pollen types into the southern Tibetan highlands, with (2) higher winter-precipitation, slightly lower summer precipitation, and the persistence of life for plants, and herbivores and therefore probably hunters. (3) The most arid period occurred between 17.8 and 15 cal kyr B.P., possibly synchronous with the Heinrich 1 event. Around 14.8 cal kyr B.P. humidity increased with torrential rains of high erosive power on sparsely plant-covered slopes and lasted until 4 cal kyr B.P.

Black carbon increased steadily until 11 cal kyr B.P. and sharply peaked with high fluctuations around 10 cal kyr B.P., indicating high frequency intensive fires at the beginning of the Holocene. Between 10 and 6 cal kyr B.P. fire frequency decreases, with a slight peak around 4 cal kyr B.P.

Here we introduce a 178year, seasonally resolved coral oxygen isotopic record from Clarion Island (18 degrees N, 115 degrees W), a sampling a subtropical region that is strongly influenced by the decadal-scale fluctuations of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and a region that serves as a critical locus for the communication of climate anomalies with the tropics. This Mexican Pacific coral record is highly correlated to coral records from the central tropical Pacific and tree ring records from western North America. Significant changes in the amplitude of oceanic decadal variability in the early nineteenth century are mirrored in the drought reconstructions in western North America. The spatial manifestation of this relationship was relatively invariant, despite notable changes in the climatic mean state.","[Sanchez, S. C.; Charles, C.

The initialization of 4C was based on a thinning experiment of the TU Dresden, started in 1959 in the forest district Buchfart. The growth of four experimental plots was simulated up to 2006 by using historical climate data and from 2007 onwards using three climate scenarios up to the year 2058. Both the business balance and the carbon storage balances were discounted by a rate of 2% per anno. It turns out that a possible future climate change has a significant impact on the business balance and the carbon storage balance. The carbon storage balance from 1959 to 2058 ranges between 505 t C ha(-1) (OK scenario, weak thinning from above; see Table 3) and 712 t C ha(-1) (3K scenario, no management) or with 2% discount rate between 173 t C ha(-1) (OK scenario, weak thinning from above) and 235 t C ha(-1) (3K scenario, no management). The initial value of the experimental plots in 1959 was negative on all experimental sites with an average of -3469 (sic) ha(-1) (Table 1) and rose to 2058 by an average of 26 753 (sic) ha(-1) (Table 4). The averaged management costs during this period amounted to 305 (sic) ha(-1) yr(-1), whereas the proceeds by the sale of timber were on average 303 (sic) ha(-1) yr(-1). The capital-value of the four experimental sites, expanded by the increase of the liquidation value and discounted with a discount rate of 2% per anno, fluctuated in 2058 between 3111 (sic) ha(-1) (OK scenario, no management) and 8283 (sic) ha(-1) (3K scenario, heavy thinning from above). The study shows that from an economic point of view it is often more appropriate to abandon the usual thinning management of beech stands with heavy thinning from above in favour of management fostering stronger carbon storage. With medium thinning from below 27 t C ha(-1) were stored additionally and with no management 38 t C ha(-1) in comparison with heavy thinning from above. The increase in carbon storage in the forest by medium thinning from below and no management was, however, associated with additional costs or lower revenues of 112 (sic) and 123 (sic) per additional ton of carbon stored respectively (Table 5). These costs form the lower price limit at which a management change could pay off economically in the forest.","[Borys, A.; Lasch-Born, P.; Suckow, F.; Reyer, C.; Gutsch, M.] Potsdam Inst Klimafolgenforsch eV, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Hanewinkel, M.] Univ Freiburg, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Hanewinkel, M.] Eidg Forsch Anstalt WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Freiburg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Borys, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Klimafolgenforsch eV, Postfach 60120, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",Alexander.Borys@gmx.de,"Reyer, Christopher/A-5515-2013; hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","Reyer, Christopher/0000-0003-1067-1492; hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621",,,,,38,3,3,1,17,J D SAUERLAENDERS VERLAG,BAD ORB,"BERLINER STRASSE 46, 63619 BAD ORB, GERMANY",0002-5852,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

Phenology models are classically used in ecology and agronomy to project future phenological changes. With our increasing understanding of the environmental cues affecting bud development, phenology models also increase in complexity. But, we expect these cues, and the underlying physiological processes, to have varying influence on bud break date predictions depending on the specific weather patterns in winter and spring. Here, we evaluated the parameter sensitivity of state-of-the-art process-based phenology models that have been widely used to predict forest tree species phenology. We used sensitivity analysis to compare the behavior of models with increasing complexity under specific climatic conditions. We thus assessed whether the influence of the parameters and modeled processes on predictions varies with winter and spring temperatures. We found that the prediction of the bud break date was mainly affected by the response to forcing temperature under current climatic conditions. However, the impact of the parameters driving the response to chilling temperatures and to photoperiod on the prediction of the models increased with warmer winter and spring temperatures. Interaction effects between parameters played an important role on the prediction of models, especially for the most complex models, but did not affect the relative influence of parameters on bud break dates. Our results highlighted that a stronger focus should be given to the characterization of the reaction norms to both forcing and chilling temperature to predict accurately bud break dates in a larger range of climatic conditions and evaluate the evolutionary potential of phenological traits with climate change.","[Gauzere, Julie; Lucas, Camille; Chuine, Isabelle] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Gauzere, Julie; Ronce, Ophelie] Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, IRD,EPHE, Montpellier, France; [Davi, Hendrik] INRA, URFM UR0629, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Gauzere, Julie] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Charlotte Auerbach Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, Midlothian, Scotland",UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); INRAE; University of Edinburgh,"Gauzere, J (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.;Gauzere, J (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, IRD,EPHE, Montpellier, France.;Gauzere, J (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Charlotte Auerbach Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, Midlothian, Scotland.",Julie.Gauzere@ed.ac.uk,"Davi, Hendrik/AAD-7436-2021","Davi, Hendrik/0000-0001-8828-3145; Gauzere, Julie/0000-0003-4420-6185", [ANR-13-ADAP-0006],,We thank Claude Bruchou and Guillaume Marie for helpful discussions on the approach and results of this manuscript.

We employ pollen data from lakes, reflecting regional vegetation, and small forest hollows, reflecting local vegetation, from Russia, Finland and Sweden to reconstruct the long-term forest composition. As potential drivers of the Holocene forest dynamics we consider climate, generated from a climate model and oxygen isotope data, past forest fires generated from sedimentary charcoal data and human population size derived from radiocarbon dated archaeological findings. We apply the statistical method of variation partitioning to assess the relative importance of these environmental variables on long-term boreal forest composition. The results show that climate is the main driver of the changes in Holocene boreal forest composition at the regional scale. However, at the local scale the role of climate is relatively small. In general, the importance of forest fires is low both at regional and local scales. The fact that both climate and forest fires explain relatively small proportions of variation in long-term boreal vegetation in small forest hollow records demonstrates the complexity of factors affecting stand-scale forest dynamics. The relative importance of human population size was low in both the prehistorical and the historical time periods. However, this is the first time that this type of data has been used to statistically assess the importance of human population size on boreal vegetation and the spatial representativeness of the data may cause bias to the analysis.","[Kuosmanen, Niina; Seppa, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 64, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Alenius, Teija; Tallavaara, Miikka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies Archae, POB 59, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Bradshaw, Richard H.

From nuanced speeches in the House of Commons and House of Lords, I move tentatively outwards by gesturing to the moment of truth in reified concepts, seeking to pry them open in their non-identity with art objects of the Anthropocene that are understood within a context of ecological poetics.","[Bristow, Tom] Univ Durham, English Studies, Hallgarth House, Durham DH1 3AY, England",Durham University,"Bristow, T (corresponding author), Univ Durham, English Studies, Hallgarth House, Durham DH1 3AY, England.",thomas.bristow@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,78,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-725X,1469-2899,,ANGELAKI,Angelaki-J Theor.

We measured eggspace' temperatures adjacent to natural egg clutches in populations distributed across a range of latitudes (36 degrees 8-44 degrees 6) and altitudes (213-3171 m). Eggs laid > 50 cm above the ground averaged 3.1 degrees C cooler than ambient air at 1 m height, while eggs at < 1 cm height averaged 15.5 degrees C hotter than ambient, ranging up to 47 degrees C. Because of differences in egg height, eggs at 3171 m elevation and 20.6 degrees C ambient air experienced mean eggspace temperatures 7 degrees C hotter than those at 213 m elevation and ambient 33.3 degrees C. Experimental eggs survived for one hour at 45 degrees C but were killed by 48 degrees C. Eggs laid low, by positively geotactic butterflies, risked thermal stress. However, at populations where eggs were laid lowest, higher oviposition would have incurred incidental predation from grazers. Interpopulation variation in phenology influenced thermal environment and buffered exposure to thermal stress. At sites with hotter July temperatures, the single annual flight/oviposition period was advanced such that eggs were laid on earlier dates, with cooler ambient temperatures. The insects possessed two mechanisms for advancing egg phenology; they could advance timing of larval diapause-breaking and/or shorten the life cycle by becoming smaller adults. Mean weight of newly-eclosed females varied among populations from 92 to 285 mg, suggesting that variable adult size did influence phenology. Possible options for in situ mitigation of thermal stress include further advancing phenology and raising egg height. We argue that these options exist, as evidenced by current variation in these traits and by failure of E. editha to conform to restrictive biogeographic constraints, such as the expectation that populations at equatorial and poleward range limits be confined to higher and lower elevations, respectively. This optimistic example shows how complex local adaptation can generate resilience to climate warming.","[Bennett, Nichole L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Severns, Paul M.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA; [Parmesan, Camille] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Parmesan, Camille] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Singer, Michael C.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Washington State University; University of Plymouth; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Plymouth,"Bennett, NL (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",michael.singer@plymouth.ac.uk,"Parmesan, Camille/GVT-5674-2022","Parmesan, Camille/0000-0002-1515-274X",National Science Foundation [DGE-1110007]; NSF DEB [02-15436],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Paul Ehrlich introduced MCS to Edith's checkerspot in 1967.

Here we present a 620,000-year environmental record from Chew Bahir, southern Ethiopia, which is proximal to key fossil sites. Our record documents the potential influence of different episodes of climatic variability on hominin biological and cultural transformation. The appearance of high anatomical diversity in hominin groups coincides with long-lasting and relatively stable humid conditions from similar to 620,000 to 275,000 years bp (episodes 1-6), interrupted by several abrupt and extreme hydroclimate perturbations. A pattern of pronounced climatic cyclicity transformed habitats during episodes 7-9 (similar to 275,000-60,000 years bp), a crucial phase encompassing the gradual transition from Acheulean to Middle Stone Age technologies, the emergence of Homo sapiens in eastern Africa and key human social and cultural innovations. Those accumulative innovations plus the alignment of humid pulses between northeastern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean during high-frequency climate oscillations of episodes 10-12 (similar to 60,000-10,000 years bp) could have facilitated the global dispersal of H. sapiens.","[Foerster, Verena; Schaebitz, Frank] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog Educ, Cologne, Germany; [Asrat, Asfawossen] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Min & Geol Engn, Palapye, Botswana; [Asrat, Asfawossen] Addis Ababa Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Brown, Erik T.; Stockhecke, Mona] Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Brown, Erik T.; Stockhecke, Mona] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Chapot, Melissa S.; Roberts, Helen M.; Lamb, Henry F.] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Deino, Alan] Berkeley Geochronol Ctr, Berkeley, CA USA; [Duesing, Walter; Kaboth-Bahr, Stefanie; Trauth, Martin H.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Potsdam, Germany; [Grove, Matthew] Univ Liverpool, Dept Archaeol Class & Egyptol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Hahn, Annette] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Junginger, Annett] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Junginger, Annett] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Palaeoenvironm, Tubingen, Germany; [Lane, Christine S.; Vidal, Celine M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Opitz, Stephan] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Cologne, Germany; [Noren, Anders] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, LacCore CSDCO, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Tiedemann, Ralph] Univ Potsdam, Unit Evolutionary Biol Systemat Zool, Potsdam, Germany; [Vogelsang, Ralf] Univ Cologne, Inst Prehist Archaeol, Cologne, Germany; [Cohen, Andrew S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lamb, Henry F.] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin, Ireland",University of Cologne; Addis Ababa University; University of Oxford; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; Aberystwyth University; Berkeley Geochronolgy Center; University of Potsdam; University of Liverpool; University of Bremen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); University of Cambridge; University of Cologne; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Potsdam; University of Cologne; University of Arizona; Trinity College Dublin,"Foerster, V (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geog Educ, Cologne, Germany.",V.Foerster@uni-koeln.de,"Trauth, Martin H/A-6293-2008; Junginger, Annett/A-1909-2017; Bronk Ramsey, Christopher/A-3277-2012; Roberts, Helen/I-1041-2012","Trauth, Martin H/0000-0001-5164-7267; Junginger, Annett/0000-0003-3486-0888; Asrat, Asfawossen/0000-0002-6312-8082; Bronk Ramsey, Christopher/0000-0002-8641-9309; Roberts, Helen/0000-0001-9649-2377; Foerster, Verena/0000-0002-3480-5769; Chapot, Melissa/0000-0001-7945-0175; Brown, Erik T/0000-0001-7154-2729; Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766","National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-1338553]; International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP); German Research Foundation (DFG) [SPP 1006 ICDP, SCHA 472/13, SCHA 472/18, TR 419/8, TR 419/10, TR 419/16, FO 734/2, CRC 806, 57444011]; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K014560/1]; University of Potsdam Open Topic Postdoc Program; Swiss National Science Foundation [P300P2 158501]; NSF [EAR 1322017]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); University of Potsdam Open Topic Postdoc Program; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Support for HSPDP has been provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grants (EAR-1338553: A.S.C.) and the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP).

However, system performances are dependent on PCMs ' integrated forms, heat transfer enhancement solutions, system operating modes, together with optimal geometrical and operating parameters. In this study, passive, active, and combined passive/active solutions in PCMs systems have been comprehensively reviewed, when being applied in heating, cooling and electrical systems, together with a dialectical analysis on advantages and disadvantages. In addition to novel system designs, interdisciplinary applications of machine learning have been reviewed and formulated, from perspectives of reliable structures, smart operational controls, and stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction. Furthermore, a generic methodology with a systematic and hierarchical procedure has been proposed, with the implementation of machine-learning based technique for optimisations during both design and operation periods. The mechanisms of machine learning techniques were characterised as the simplifications of modelling and optimization processes, through the errors-driven update, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. Several technical challenges were identified, such as the heat transfer enhancement, the novel structural configurations and the flexible switch on operating modes. Finally, identified challenges on machine learning include the development of advanced learning algorithms for efficient performance predictions, optimal structural configurations on neural networks, the trade-off between computational complexity and reliable optimal solutions, and so on. The formulated climate-adaptive designs, intelligent operations, uncertainty-based analysis and optimisations with interdisciplinary machine learning techniques can promote PCMs applications in sustainable buildings.","[Zhou, Yuekuan; Wen, Tao; Yan, Jun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqian] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengxuan; Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Natl Ctr Int Res Collaborat Bldg Safety & Environ, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Bldg Energy Conservat & En, Changsha 412007, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhixiong] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Engn Thermophys, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; City University of Hong Kong; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, SQ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuekuan.zhou@outlook.com; candyz129@sina.com,"DING, Zhixiong/AAX-7793-2020; Liu, Zhengxuan/ABC-6467-2021; Zhou, Yuekuan/ABE-4194-2020; Zhengxuan, Liu/AAW-3873-2021","DING, Zhixiong/0000-0002-7518-2828; Zhengxuan, Liu/0000-0002-2761-5078; ZHENG, Siqian/0000-0002-8436-4367; Zhou, Yuekuan/0000-0003-2038-0314",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); Hunan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"This research is supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, City University of Hong Kong, Hunan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

We carried out a survey among modeling groups to show an evolution from models able only to deal with land-cover change to more sophisticated approaches that allow also for the partial integration of land management changes. For the longer term a comprehensive land management representation can be anticipated for all major models. To guide the prioritization of implementation, we evaluate ten land management practicesforestry harvest, tree species selection, grazing and mowing harvest, crop harvest, crop species selection, irrigation, wetland drainage, fertilization, tillage, and firefor (1) their importance on the Earth system, (2) the possibility of implementing them in state-of-the-art ESMs, and (3) availability of required input data. Matching these criteria, we identify low-hanging fruits for the inclusion in ESMs, such as basic implementations of crop and forestry harvest and fertilization. We also identify research requirements for specific communities to address the remaining land management practices. Data availability severely hampers modeling the most extensive land management practice, grazing and mowing harvest, and is a limiting factor for a comprehensive implementation of most other practices. Inadequate process understanding hampers even a basic assessment of crop species selection and tillage effects. The need for multiple advanced model structures will be the challenge for a comprehensive implementation of most practices but considerable synergy can be gained using the same structures for different practices. A continuous and closer collaboration of the modeling, Earth observation, and land system science communities is thus required to achieve the inclusion of land management in ESMs.","[Pongratz, Julia; Naudts, Kim] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Dolman, Han; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Don, Axel] Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Braunschweig, Germany; [Erb, Karl-Heinz] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Wien, Inst Social Ecol Vienna SEC, Vienna, Austria; [Fuchs, Richard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Geog Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Herold, Martin] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jones, Chris] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Catholic Univ Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] FNRS, FRS, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] FNRS, FRS, Brussels, Belgium",Max Planck Society; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Universite Catholique Louvain; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Pongratz, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.",julia.pongratz@mpimet.mpg.de,"Herold, Martin/F-8553-2012; Meyfroidt, Patrick/G-7768-2012; Jones, Chris/I-2983-2014; Naudts, Kim/AAN-6015-2020; Pongratz, Julia/AAG-3274-2019; Kuemmerle, Tobias/B-4340-2008; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/F-6684-2011; Erb, Karlheinz/F-1282-2016; Naudts, Kim/O-4551-2017","Herold, Martin/0000-0003-0246-6886; Jones, Chris/0000-0002-7141-9285; Naudts, Kim/0000-0001-6108-180X; Kuemmerle, Tobias/0000-0002-9775-142X; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1121-1869; Erb, Karlheinz/0000-0002-8335-4159; Naudts, Kim/0000-0001-6108-180X; Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457; Pongratz, Julia/0000-0003-0372-3960",International Space Science Institute (Bern); German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program [PO 1751/1-1]; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS/Belgium); UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; EU H project CRESCENDO [641816]; FP7 LUC4C [603542]; NESSC,International Space Science Institute (Bern); German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS/Belgium)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; EU H project CRESCENDO; FP7 LUC4C; NESSC,"International Space Science Institute (Bern); German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program, Grant/Award Number: PO 1751/1-1; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS/Belgium); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme, Grant/Award Number: GA01101; EU H2020 project CRESCENDO, Grant/Award Number: 641816; FP7 LUC4C, Grant/Award Number: 603542; NESSC",,135,62,63,8,89,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

They are used to better understand and manage systems, either directly or via models. Given the complexity and spatiotemporal variability of geophysical systems (e.g., precipitation), a lack of sufficient data is a perennial problem, which is exacerbated by various drivers, such as climate change and urbanization. In recent years, crowdsourcing has become increasingly prominent as a means of supplementing data obtained from more traditional sources, particularly due to its relatively low implementation cost and ability to increase the spatial and/or temporal resolution of data significantly. Given the proliferation of different crowdsourcing methods in geophysics and the promise they have shown, it is timely to assess the state of the art in this field, to identify potential issues and map out a way forward. In this paper, crowdsourcing-based data acquisition methods that have been used in seven domains of geophysics, including weather, precipitation, air pollution, geography, ecology, surface water, and natural hazard management, are discussed based on a review of 162 papers. In addition, a novel framework for categorizing these methods is introduced and applied to the methods used in the seven domains of geophysics considered in this review. This paper also features a review of 93 papers dealing with issues that are common to data acquisition methods in different domains of geophysics, including the management of crowdsourcing projects, data quality, data processing, and data privacy. In each of these areas, the current status is discussed and challenges and future directions are outlined.","[Zheng, Feifei; Tao, Ruoling; Maier, Holger R.; Zhang, Tuqiao] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Maier, Holger R.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Maier, Holger R.] Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Res Cluster Leader, East Melbourne, Australia; [See, Linda] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Savic, Dragan] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Savic, Dragan] Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Chen, Qiuwen] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Ctr Ecoenvironm Res, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Assumpcao, Thaine H.; Solomatine, Dimitri; Popescu, Ioana] IHE, Dept Integrated Water Syst & Governance, Delft, Netherlands; [Yang, Pan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Pan; Heidari, Bardia; Cai, Ximing] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL USA; [Rieckermann, Joerg] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Minsker, Barbara] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Dallas, TX USA; [Bi, Weiwei] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Solomatine, Dimitri] Delft Univ Technol, Water Resources Sect, Delft, Netherlands; [Solomatine, Dimitri] RAS, Water Problems Inst, Moscow, Russia",Zhejiang University; University of Adelaide; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); KWR Watercycle Research Institute; University of Exeter; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Southern Methodist University; Zhejiang University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Water Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Zheng, FF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",feifeizheng@zju.edu.cn,"Yang, Pan/AAK-2193-2020; Maier, Holger R/B-9639-2008; Popescu, Ioana/B-8476-2011; Savic, Dragan A/G-2071-2012; Popescu, Ioana/AAI-4968-2021; Rieckermann, Jorg/B-2314-2009","Yang, Pan/0000-0001-7609-7230; Maier, Holger R/0000-0002-0277-6887; Popescu, Ioana/0000-0002-1009-5424; Savic, Dragan A/0000-0001-9567-9041; Popescu, Ioana/0000-0002-1009-5424; Heidari Haratmeh, Bardia/0000-0002-1265-6416; Rieckermann, Jorg/0000-0003-4227-2429; See, Linda/0000-0002-2665-7065; Assumpcao, Thaine/0000-0003-3334-3352",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51708491]; National Science and Technology Major Project for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2017ZX07201004]; Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51761145022]; Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre; FP7 ERC CrowdLand grant [617754]; Horizon2020 LandSense project [689812]; Horizon 2020 European Union project SCENT (Smart Toolbox for Engaging Citizens into a People-Centric Observation Web) [688930]; WeSenseIt project (EU) [308429]; Russian Science Foundation [17-77-30006]; ENSUF/FFG [860918]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400600],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Major Project for Water Pollution Control and Treatment; Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); FP7 ERC CrowdLand grant; Horizon2020 LandSense project; Horizon 2020 European Union project SCENT (Smart Toolbox for Engaging Citizens into a People-Centric Observation Web); WeSenseIt project (EU); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); ENSUF/FFG; National Key Research and Development Program of China","Feifei Zheng and Tuqiao Zhang are funded by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0400600), The National Natural Science Foundation of China (51708491), National Science and Technology Major Project for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2017ZX07201004), and the Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51761145022).

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between spirituality (the Scale of Spirituality; dimensions include religious spirituality, expanding consciousness, searching for meaning, sensitivity to art, doing good, and sensitivity to inner beauty), religious fundamentalism (the Religious Fundamentalism Scale), support for right-wing authoritarianism (the Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale), climate concerns (the Environmental Concern Scale), and pro-environmental behavior (the Pro-Environmental Behavior Scale). The cross-sectional study involved 512 Poles aged 18-63 (M = 34.63, SD = 5.96; Mdn = 33), including 51% females. Multiple regression analysis revealed that two dimensions of spirituality (sensitivity to art and doing good) and religious fundamentalism are significant and opposite predictors of climate concern and pro-environmental behavior. Spirituality appeared to foster increased climate concern and caring behavior, while religious fundamentalism negatively predicted the same variables. Mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between religion and environmentalism could be explained in part by differences in support for right-wing authoritarianism (authoritarianism itself was negatively related to environmental outcomes). In addition, analysis of variance revealed that believers (70% of participants in the study were Catholic) showed significantly lower scores regarding climate concerns and pro-environmental behavior than non-believers, yet the inclusion of support for right-wing authoritarianism as a covariate in the equation reduced intergroup differences to statistical insignificance. The data obtained suggest that religious attitudes and socio-political views may play important roles in solving environmental problems.","[Skalski, Sebastian Binyamin; Loichen, Teresa; Surzykiewicz, Janusz] Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Fac Philosophy & Educ, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany; [Skalski, Sebastian Binyamin; Surzykiewicz, Janusz] Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ Warsaw, Fac Educ, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland; [Toussaint, Loren L.] Luther Coll, Dept Psychol, Decorah, IA 52101 USA; [Uram, Patrycja; Kwiatkowska, Anna] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, PL-00950 Warsaw, Poland",Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Psychology of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Skalski, SB (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Fac Philosophy & Educ, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany.;Skalski, SB (corresponding author), Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ Warsaw, Fac Educ, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland.",s.skalski@uksw.edu.pl,"Skalski, Sebastian Binyamin/HHM-6325-2022","Skalski, Sebastian Binyamin/0000-0002-6336-7251; Toussaint, Loren/0000-0001-8876-1848",Polish Social Psychological Society (a grant program for junior members),Polish Social Psychological Society (a grant program for junior members),This research was funded by the Polish Social Psychological Society (a grant program for junior members).,,57,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The analyzed system includes the PV generator, the electric battery, the vapor compression chiller, the air-conditioned building and the controller technologies. Systems with split-devices for direct air-cooling and also water-based systems for cooling ceilings are considered. The simulation studies are carried based on the Modelica library BuildingSystems and also in combination with the building simulation tool EnergyPlus and the framework for co-simulation BCVTB. In a first step, principal questions about the system design of photovoltaic-driven cooling systems under hot and dry climate conditions are analyzed, e.g. to find out matching system parameters like installed PV-power, battery capacity, vapor chiller cooling power taking into account the thermal capacity of the air-conditioned building. For this purpose, a pure Modelica system model with a simplified one-zone thermal building model is used. In a second step, a use case of a multi-zone building is studied, in which the building envelope is modeled with EnergyPlus and the air-conditioning system and the control strategy in Modelica. Both sub-models are integrated with BCVTB to the system model.

This paper addresses the question of how to provide the best operational strategy to validate satellite-derived skin sea surface temperature (SSTskin) measurements. High quality in situ observations obtained using different state-of-the-art infrared radiometer systems are used to characterize the relationship between the SSTskin, the subsurface SST at depth (SSTdepth), and the surface wind speed. Data are presented for different oceans and seasons. These data indicate that above a wind speed of approximately 6 m s(-1) the relationship between the SSTskin and SSTdepth, is well characterized for both day- and nighttime conditions by a cool bias of -0.17 +/- 0.07 K rms. At lower wind speeds, stratification of the upper-ocean layers during the day may complicate the relationship, while at night a cooler skin is normally observed. Based on these observations, a long-term global satellite SSTskin validation strategy is proposed. Emphasis is placed on the use of autonomous, ship-of-opportunity radiometer systems for areas characterized by prevailing low-wind speed conditions. For areas characterized by higher wind speed regimes, well-calibrated, quality-controlled, ship and buoy SSTdepth observations, corrected for a cool skin bias, should also be used. It is foreseen that SSTdepth data will provide the majority of in situ validation data required for operational satellite SST validation. We test the strategy using SSTskin observations from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer, which are shown to be accurate to approximately 0.2 K in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and using measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer.

A better understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of thermal stratification of the upper-ocean layers during low-wind speed conditions is fundamental to improvements in SST validation and development of multisensor satellite SST products.","Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Inland & Marine Waters Unit, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Meteorol & Phys Oceanog Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Remote Sensing Syst, Santa Rosa, CA USA; Rutherford Appleton Lab, Space Sci & Technol Dept, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; CSIRO Marine Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Miami; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC); STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Miami,"Donlon, CJ (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Inland & Marine Waters Unit, TP272, I-21020 Ispra, Italy.",craig.donlon@jrc.it,,"Ward, Brian/0000-0002-6763-5778; Gentemann, Chelle/0000-0002-2250-3106",,,,,58,480,503,1,72,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Here CloudSat-based diagnostics for near-surface precipitation frequency are implemented in publicly available software that is widely used for climate model evaluation. The new diagnostics are definition aware and scale aware. As a result, the diagnostics enable robust assessment of modeled near-surface precipitation frequency at a range of intensity classes. The new diagnostics are used to evaluate precipitation frequency in a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). CESM1 rains and snows too frequently, a bias that is especially pronounced for light rain. Conversely, while rare in both observations and CESM1, the heaviest rainfall events occur too infrequently in CESM1. Though the spatial distribution of snowfall events matches observations well, CESM1 also exhibits excessive snow frequency biases. Despite these biases, projected CESM1 changes in reflectivity-based diagnostics provide interesting insights into what a future 94-GHz radar could detect in a warmer world. With 3 degrees C of global warming, a future CloudSat-class mission would detect substantial conversion of snow to rain at midlatitudes, a narrowing of the Tropical Pacific rain belt, increased light rain in subtropics, and increased snow frequency in polar regions. The future CESM1 simulations also provide evidence that present-day spatial and magnitude biases imprint themselves on precipitation frequency changes. In summary, new precipitation frequency diagnostics for a range of precipitation intensities robustly expose climate model biases and inform expectations for observable future precipitation changes in a warming world.","[Kay, Jennifer E.; Yettella, Vineel] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kay, Jennifer E.; Yettella, Vineel] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [L'Ecuyer, Tristan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Pendergrass, Angeline] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Chepfer, Helene; Guzman, Rodrigo] Univ Paris 06, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Kay, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Kay, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jennifer.e.kay@colorado.edu,"L'Ecuyer, Tristan S/E-5607-2012; Pendergrass, Angeline G/I-2946-2017; Kay, Jennifer/C-6042-2012; Yettella, Vineel/P-5520-2016","L'Ecuyer, Tristan S/0000-0002-7584-4836; Pendergrass, Angeline G/0000-0003-2542-1461; Kay, Jennifer/0000-0002-3625-5377; Guzman, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7653-1276; Yettella, Vineel/0000-0002-9425-9130",National Science Foundation; NASA [15-CCST15-0025]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES),National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales),"We thank Brian Eaton and Dave Bailey for their help in troubleshooting CESM simulations and code.

These future conditions affect the resilience and sustainability of ecosystems, alter biogeographic zones, and impact biodiversity. Deep-time records of paleoclimate provide insight into the climate system over millions of years and provide examples of conditions very different from the present day, and in some cases similar to model projections for the future. In addition, the deep-time paleoecologic and sedimentologic archives provide insight into how species and habitats responded to past climate conditions. Thus, paleoclimatology provides essential context for the scientific understanding of climate change needed to inform resource management policy decisions. The Pliocene Epoch (5.3-2.6 Ma) is the most recent deep-time interval with relevance to future global warming. Analysis of marine sediments using a combination of paleoecology, biomarkers, and geochemistry indicates a global mean annual temperature for the Late Pliocene (3.6-2.6 Ma) similar to 3 degrees C warmer than the preindustrial. However, the inability of state-of-the-art climate models to capture some key regional features of Pliocene warming implies future projections using these same models may not span the full range of plausible future climate conditions. We use the Late Pliocene as one example of a deep-time interval relevant to management of biodiversity and ecosystems in a changing world. Pliocene reconstructed sea surface temperatures are used to drive a marine ecosystem model for the North Atlantic Ocean. Given that boundary conditions for the Late Pliocene are roughly analogous to present day, driving the marine ecosystem model with Late Pliocene paleoenvironmental conditions allows policymakers to consider a future ocean state and associated fisheries impacts independent of climate models, informed directly by paleoclimate information.","[Dowsett, Harry] US Geol Survey, Florence Bascom Geosci Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Jacobs, Peter] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Jacobs, Peter; de Mutsert, Kim] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA USA; [de Mutsert, Kim] Univ Southern Mississippi, Div Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; George Mason University; University of Southern Mississippi,"Dowsett, H (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Florence Bascom Geosci Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA.",hdowsett@usgs.gov,,,U.S. Geological Survey Climate RD Program,U.S. Geological Survey Climate RD Program,Funding for this work was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey Climate R&D Program.,,97,0,0,3,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

This is done with the Loss and Damage (L&D) mechanism of the UNFCCC in mind. Relevant insights are provided for climate policy negotiators and policymakers on how risk management and adaptation interact with L&D solutions, and vice versa, on how L&D-related activities can support risk reduction and adaptation in vulnerable countries. Particular attention is devoted to how risk management can help society confront the impacts of weather disasters in relation to anthropogenic climate change. A holistic view of risk management is presented by discussing: the state-of-the art of risk assessment methods; (cost-benefit) evaluations of risk management options; household-scale risk reduction strategies; insurance schemes for residual risk and their relations with risk reduction; and the design of adaptation pathways to cope with uncertain timing and intensity of climate change impacts. Each topic is illustrated with concrete case studies. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the links between disaster risk management, climate adaptation and the L&D mechanism.","[Botzen, W. J.

Supplementary to previous work, our focus is on changes on the monthly scale. The global mean annual influx of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere is projected to increase by 53% between the years 2000 and 2100 under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas scenario. The change in ozone mass flux (OMF) into the troposphere is positive throughout the year with maximal increase in the summer months of the respective hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH) this summer maximum STE increase is a result of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, whilst in the Southern Hemisphere(SH) it is due to equal contributions from decreasing levels of ozone depleting substances (ODS) and increasing GHG concentrations. In the SH the GHG effect is dominating in the winter months. A large ODS-related ozone increase in the SH stratosphere leads to a change in the seasonal breathing term which results in a future decrease of the OMF into the troposphere in the SH in September and October. The resulting distributions of stratospheric ozone in the troposphere differ for the GHG and ODS changes due to the following: (a) ozone input occurs at different regions for GHG-(midlatitudes) and ODS-changes (high latitudes); and (b) stratospheric ozone is more efficiently mixed towards lower tropospheric levels in the case of ODS changes, whereas tropospheric ozone loss rates grow when GHG concentrations rise. The comparison between the moderate RCP6.0 and the extreme RCP8.5 emission scenarios reveals that the annual global OMF trend is smaller in the moderate scenario, but the resulting change in the contribution of ozone with stratospheric origin (O3s) to ozone in the troposphere is of comparable magnitude in both scenarios. This is due to the larger tropospheric ozone precursor emissions and hence ozone production in the RCP8.5 scenario.","[Meul, Stefanie; Langematz, Ulrike; Kroeger, Philipp; Oberlander-Hayn, Sophie] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany; [Joeckel, Patrick] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR eV, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Langematz, U (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany.",ulrike.langematz@met.fu-berlin.de,"Jöckel, Patrick/C-3687-2009","Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [LA 1025/13-2, LA 1025/14-2, FOR 1095]; North-German Supercomputing Alliance (HLRN)",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); North-German Supercomputing Alliance (HLRN),This work has been funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the DFG Research Unit FOR 1095 Stratospheric Change and its Role for Climate Prediction (SHARP) under grants LA 1025/13-2 and LA 1025/14-2.

This study deals with the potential correlations between human thermal conditions, the encircling microclimate, and the physical structure of the city. Through long-term numerical simulations, the disclosed study analyses the influence of the urban street configurations on the thermal bioclimate within urban canyons, specifically upon open balconies in the most populated district of Barcelona: The Eixample. The simulated thermal conditions were carried out in the human biometeorological RayMan Pro model using local climatic data, to determine the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) within four generated scenarios, with similar morphological properties of the Eixample district. The findings reveal that streets with axes oriented NS and SE-NW provide the best thermal conditions for balconies, achieving acceptable PET values (18 degrees C < PET <29 degrees C) on both facades. On the other hand, EW streets presented high thermal stress conditions (over 43,4% of the time) for those balconies located in the north side of the canyon. Open balconies at heights below 12 metres are the most comfortable ones during summer daytime, with acceptable thermal conditions that range between 50,4% and 82,5% of the time. The highest frequencies of acceptable thermal conditions were found on balconies located at 6 metres and 9 metres high on the east, south and southeast facades of the NS, EW and NE-SW oriented streets respectively (from 77% to 83% of the time). These configurations provide the most suitable thermal conditions during the studied summer periods by having frequencies of heat stress below 20%. Our results and recommendations contribute to bridge the gap between human biometeorology, public health, and architectural and urban planning. Some areas of its direct application are the use of balconies in periods of confinement; decision-making on the sale or rental of apartments; and the promotion of bioclimatic retrofit projects at an urban and architectural scale supported by local governments.","[Rodriguez-Algeciras, Jose] Univ Camaguey, Dept Architecture, Camaguey, Cuba; [Tablada, Abel] Technol Univ Havana JA Echeverria CUJAE, Dept Architecture, Havana, Cuba; [Nouri, A.

AMOC strengthening occurs through a densification of the North Atlantic, driven by anomalous surface freshwater fluxes due to increased evaporation. These are related to persistent North Atlantic atmospheric circulation anomalies, driven by forced changes in the stratosphere, associated with anomalously weak solar irradiance during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Within a period of approximately 100 years the 11-year smoothed ensemble mean AMOC strengthens by 1.5 Sv and subsequently weakens by 1.9 Sv, representing respectively approximately 3 and 4 standard deviations of the 11-year smoothed control simulation. The solar-induced variability of the AMOC has various relevant climate impacts, such as a northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, anomalous Amazonian rainfall, and a sustained increase in European temperatures. While this model has only a partial representation of the atmospheric response to solar variability, these results demonstrate the potential for solar variability to have a multidecadal impact on North Atlantic climate.","[Menary, Matthew B.; Scaife, Adam A.] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Menary, MB (corresponding author), Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",matthew.menary@metoffice.gov.uk,,"Menary, Matthew/0000-0002-9627-2056","European Community [GA212643]; Joint DECC; Defra Hadley Centre Climate Programme, DECC/Defra [GA01101]","European Community(European Commission); Joint DECC; Defra Hadley Centre Climate Programme, DECC/Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's 7th framework programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. GA212643 (THOR: Thermohaline Overturning-at Risk'' 2008-2012) and was supported by the Joint DECC and Defra Hadley Centre Climate Programme, DECC/Defra (GA01101).

The artwork, in this view, is material being that has been transfigured and shot through with subjectivity. The work of art, what art does and how it works have all been understood as mediating between the otherwise irreconcilable opposites of historical spirit and the mute material world, between communicative thought and the unresponsiveness otherness of nature. I revisit this aesthetic tradition from the perspective of the Anthropocene, the proposed name of the new geological epoch of the present, distinguished by the fact that collective human action has now acquired the scale of a world-shaping natural force. The Anthropocene is at once a geological epoch and a historical period. What forms of narrative might possibly relate these two temporal orders together? What other aesthetic categories might help us think through the conceptual impasse of the Anthropocene present? How might aesthetic experience illuminate the history of Anthropocene? What natural histories might artworks tell today? My speculative endpoint: the Anthropocene globe is the universal artwork of the contemporary moment.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Ford, TH (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",thomas.ford@unimelb.edu.au,,"Ford, Thomas/0000-0001-9267-1992",,,,,34,0,0,1,9,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1872-261X,1872-2636,,J PHILOS HIST,J.

Concurrent with this cultural phase is a climatic regime characterized by a substantial increase in forest fires associated with persistent summer drought: the Fraser Valley Fire Period (FVFP). Culturally, the Marpole phase is characterized by the widespread appearance of large houses, standardized art forms, and elaborate burials. Interactions among people of this region intensfied and were, as today, economically, socially, and ideologically linked to the lower Fraser River system. Ecologically, the FVFP likely resulted in a regional decline in salmon abundance and/or predictability, especially in small streams and offshore areas, but also more berries and wildlife, and easier overland access via trail networks. The ecological diversity of the lower Fraser region, both terrestrial and riverine, resulted in both more abundant and more predictable resources than surrounding areas during this period of changing climate. We hypothesize that social and economic networks throughout the Gulf of Georgia were solidified during the Marpole phase to ensure access to Fraser resources and allow social buffering of resource uncertainty We suggest that the differential availability of resources also allowed and encouraged individuals who had access to Fraser Valley resources to gain relatively greater prestige.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Quaternary Sci Program, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University; Northern Arizona University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Northern Arizona University,"Lepofsky, D (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,"Hallett, Douglas/G-4968-2011","MATHEWES, ROLF/0000-0001-7637-199X",,,,,162,64,64,0,14,SOC AMER ARCHAEOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"900 SECOND ST., NE  STE 12, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-3557 USA",0002-7316,,,AM ANTIQUITY,Am.

PlioMIP examines the consistency of model predictions in simulating Pliocene climate and their ability to reproduce climate signals preserved by geological climate archives. Here we provide a description of the aim and objectives of the next phase of the model intercomparison project (PlioMIP Phase 2), and we present the experimental design and boundary conditions that will be utilized for climate model experiments in Phase 2. Following on from PlioMIP Phase 1, Phase 2 will continue to be a mechanism for sampling structural uncertainty within climate models. However, Phase 1 demonstrated the requirement to better understand boundary condition uncertainties as well as uncertainty in the methodologies used for data-model comparison. Therefore, our strategy for Phase 2 is to utilize state-of-the-art boundary conditions that have emerged over the last 5 years. These include a new palaeogeographic reconstruction, detailing ocean bathymetry and land-ice surface topography. The ice surface topography is built upon the lessons learned from offline ice sheet modelling studies. Land surface cover has been enhanced by recent additions of Pliocene soils and lakes. Atmospheric reconstructions of palaeo-CO2 are emerging on orbital timescales, and these are also incorporated into PlioMIP Phase 2. New records of surface and sea surface temperature change are being produced that will be more temporally consistent with the boundary conditions and forcings used within models. Finally we have designed a suite of prioritized experiments that tackle issues surrounding the basic understanding of the Pliocene and its relevance in the context of future climate change in a discrete way.","[Haywood, Alan M.; Dolan, Aisling M.; Hunter, Stephen J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Dowsett, Harry J.] US Geol Survey, Eastern Geol & Paleoclimate Sci Ctr, MS 926A,12201 Sunrise Valley Dr, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Rowley, David] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Univ Tokyo, CCSR, Tokyo, Japan; [Otto-Bliesner, Bette] CGD NCAR, CCR, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Chandler, Mark A.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Lunt, Daniel J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Pound, Matthew; Salzmann, Ulrich] Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Dept Geog, Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Leeds; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Chicago; University of Tokyo; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Bristol; Northumbria University,"Dolan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.m.dolan@leeds.ac.uk,"Otto-Bliesner, Bette/AAY-7691-2020; Lunt, Daniel J/G-9451-2011; Salzmann, Ulrich/H-9929-2017; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013","Lunt, Daniel J/0000-0003-3585-6928; Salzmann, Ulrich/0000-0001-5598-5327; Dolan, Aisling/0000-0002-9585-9648; Chandler, Mark/0000-0002-6548-227X; Rowley, David/0000-0001-9767-9029; Pound, Matthew/0000-0001-8029-9548; Otto-Bliesner, Bette/0000-0003-1911-1598; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952; Dowsett, Harry/0000-0003-1983-7524","European Research Council under the European Union [278636]; EPSRC-supported Past Earth Network; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I016287/1, NE/G009112/1, NE/H006273/1]; US National Science Foundation; NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program (NASA) [NNX14AB99A]; NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M008363/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I016287/1, NE/G009112/1, NE/H006273/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/M008363/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/H006273/1, NE/G009112/1, NE/I016287/1] Funding Source: UKRI","European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); EPSRC-supported Past Earth Network(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program (NASA); NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","A.

With a sample of 417 restaurant and retail employees, the results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that possessing a visible tattoo was associated with increased odds of experiencing unwanted sexual attention. Perceived inclusion climate attenuated this relationship, whereby individuals with visible tattoos were less likely to experience unwanted sexual attention in a more favorable climate.

Interviewees focused mainly on general air quality-related understandings (60.2%), although cognitive skills (22.0%) and specific concepts (17.8%) were also mentioned. The major categories of desired air-quality understandings identified in interviews included sources, impact, detection, and transport of air pollutants. Identified cognitive skills focused on information-gathering and -evaluating abilities, enabling informed air-quality decision making. Eight Learning Goal Sets generated from interview data and validated via peer and member checks helped guide a content analysis of six undergraduate liberal arts chemistry textbooks. Overall, sampled chemistry textbooks supported the previously identified air-quality concepts and skills.

A set of 80 commercial inverters are analysed to obtain the typical efficiency curves of state-of-the-art low-, medium-, and high-efficiency inverters. Four locations worldwide with high annual DNI levels and different average values of the weather variables influencing HCPV performance are studied. Results show that the inverter can be sized between 84% and 112% of the rated capacity of the HCPV generator at Concentrator Standard Test Conditions depending on the scenario considered for maximizing the final energy yield of the system.

This article initially explores how the development of the impending national Australian curriculum replete with a high stakes testing regime and a website, My School, with its propensity to create league tables is problematic if an improved quality education for all Australian children is the goal. It contends that continuing to ignore the need for new ways of thinking about curriculum and pedagogy will continue to contribute to educational inequities. Recent research and writing from similar educational initiatives in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America support these assertions. Secondly, this article discusses the need to consider research about the potential role the arts can play in transforming children's learning across the curriculum to improve both academic and affective outcomes.

The impact of these factors on the analysis must be assessed and corrected in a procedure called Homogenization, before computing any trends. An unbiased analysis is essential for the East Mediterranean climate change, which suffers from scarcity of long and reliable datasets. Here, for the first time, we address these problems by jointly applying some of the state-of-the-art homogenization methods, to long-term Israeli temperature records (TX and TN) at five different meteorological stations throughout the period of 1950-2011. All of the studied time series were found to be inhomogeneous, where instrumentational issues were responsible for almost 50% of the breaks. The most frequent adjustments range between [-0.6, +0.6] C-o while some larger adjustments do not fall within the range of the [-1, +1] degrees C interval. The adjustment of these breaks is crucial because they introduce large errors that may lead to wrong conclusions about the estimated trends. The difference in the seasonal and annual trends between raw and homogenized series was analysed applying the Mann-Kendall test. The general annual trend differences before and after homogenization, fell within the range of [-0.12, 0.16] C-o/decade. Based on the homogenized dataset, a highly significant positive trend was found for the annual TN with 0.15 degrees C/decade (p = .002) whereas the TX trend was 0.10 degrees C/decade (p = .051). In general, the maximum temperature trends are lower and less statistically significant than those for minimum temperature. The most pronounced seasonal trends were recorded for the summer, which was characterized by significant positive trends for (0.15 degrees C/decade) and (0.23 degrees C/decade), while the winter had mainly no significant positive trends.","[Yosef, Yizhak; Alpert, Pinhas] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Geosci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yosef, Yizhak] Israel Meteorol Serv, Bet Dagan, Israel; [Aguilar, Enric] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Ctr Climate Change C3, Tarragona, Spain",Tel Aviv University; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Yosef, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Geosci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",yizhakyosef@mail.tau.ac.il,"Aguilar, Enric/L-4971-2014","Aguilar, Enric/0000-0002-8384-377X",,,,,58,21,21,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Poor air quality associated with high aerosol concentrations is among the leading health risks worldwide, causing millions of attributable excess deaths and years of life lost every year. Besides their health impact, aerosols are also influencing climate through interactions with clouds and solar radiation with an estimated negative total effective radiative forcing that may compensate about half of the positive radiative forcing of carbon dioxide but exhibits a much larger uncertainty. Heterogeneous and multiphase chemical reactions on the surface and in the bulk of solid, semisolid, and liquid aerosol particles have been recognized to influence aerosol formation and transformation and thus their environmental effects. However, atmospheric multiphase chemistry is not well understood because of its intrinsic complexity of dealing with the matter in multiple phases and the difficulties of distinguishing its effect from that of gas phase reactions. Recently, research on atmospheric multiphase chemistry received a boost from the growing interest in understanding severe haze formation of very high PM2.5 concentrations in polluted megacities and densely populated regions. State-of-the-art models suggest that the gas phase reactions, however, are not capturing the high concentrations and rapid increase of PM2.5 observed during haze events, suggesting a gap in our understanding of the chemical mechanisms of aerosol formation. These haze events are characterized by high concentrations of aerosol particles and high humidity, especially favoring multiphase chemistry. In this Account, we review recent advances that we have made, as well as current challenges and future perspectives for research on multiphase chemical processes involved in atmospheric aerosol formation and transformation. We focus on the following questions: what are the key reaction pathways leading to aerosol formation under polluted conditions, what is the relative importance of multiphase chemistry versus gas-phase chemistry, and what are the implications for the development of efficient and reliable air quality control strategies? In particular, we discuss advances and challenges related to different chemical regimes of sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) under haze conditions, and we synthesize new insights into the influence of aerosol water content, aerosol pH, phase state, and nanoparticle size effects. Overall, there is increasing evidence that multiphase chemistry plays an important role in aerosol formation during haze events. In contrast to the gas phase photochemical reactions, which are self-buffered against heavy pollution, multiphase reactions have a positive feedback mechanism, where higher particle matter levels accelerate multiphase production, which further increases the aerosol concentration resulting in a series of record-breaking pollution events. We discuss perspectives to fill the gap of the current understanding of atmospheric multiphase reactions that involve multiple physical and chemical processes from bulk to nanoscale and from regional to global scales. A synthetic approach combining laboratory experiments, field measurements, instrument development, and model simulations is suggested as a roadmap to advance future research.","[Su, Hang; Cheng, Yafang; Poeschl, Ulrich] Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Cheng, YF (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",yafang.cheng@mpic.de,"Su, Hang/A-6226-2010; Cheng, Yafang/F-9362-2010; Pöschl, Ulrich/A-6263-2010","Su, Hang/0000-0003-4889-1669; Cheng, Yafang/0000-0003-4912-9879; Pöschl, Ulrich/0000-0003-1412-3557",,,,,66,46,46,26,101,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0001-4842,1520-4898,,ACCOUNTS CHEM RES,Accounts Chem.

To mitigate heat in public spaces, thermal conditions must be assessed in the context of human exposure and space use. Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) is an integrated radiation metric that quantifies the total heat load on the human body and is a driving parameter in many thermal comfort indices. Current sensor systems to measure MRT are expensive and bulky (6-directional setup) or slow and inaccurate (globe thermometers) and do not sense space use. This engineering systems paper introduces the hardware and software setup of a novel, low-cost thermal and visual sensing device (MaRTiny). The system collects meteorological data, concurrently counts the number of people in the shade and sun, and streams the results to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server. MaRTiny integrates various micro-controllers to collect weather data relevant to human thermal exposure: air temperature, humidity, wind speed, globe temperature, and UV radiation. To detect people in the shade and Sun, we implemented state of the art object detection and shade detection models on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The system was tested in the field, showing that meteorological observations compared reasonably well to MaRTy observations (high-end human-biometeorological station) when both sensor systems were fully sun-exposed. To overcome potential sensing errors due to different exposure levels, we estimated MRT from MaRTiny weather observations using machine learning (SVM), which improved RMSE. This paper focuses on the development of the MaRTiny system and lays the foundation for fundamental research in urban climate science to investigate how people use public spaces under extreme heat to inform active shade management and urban design in cities.","[Kulkarni, Karthik K.; Jayasuriya, Suren] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ USA; [Schneider, Florian A.] Arizona State Univ, Coll Global Futures, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Gowda, Tejaswi; Jayasuriya, Suren; Middel, Ariane] Arizona State Univ, Sch Arts Media & Engn, Tempe, AZ USA; [Middel, Ariane] Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp & Augmented Intelligence, Tempe, AZ USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Jayasuriya, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ USA.;Jayasuriya, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Arts Media & Engn, Tempe, AZ USA.",sjayasur@asu.edu,"Schneider, Florian A./GZM-6597-2022","Schneider, Florian A./0000-0003-4250-5720","National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1942805]; NSF [CNS-1951928, DEB-1832016]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), grant number CMMI-1942805 (CAREER: Human Thermal Exposure in Cities - Novel Sensing and Modeling to Build Heat-Resilience), NSF CNS-1951928 (Understanding Heat Resiliency via Physiological, Mental, and Behavioral Health Factors for Indoor and Outdoor Urban Environments), and DEB-1832016 (Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program CAP LTER).

Here we diagnose causes of this intermodel spread using a simple model that approximates future SIA based on present SIA and the sensitivity of SIA to Arctic temperatures. This model accounts for 70%-95% of the intermodel variance, with the majority of the spread arising from present-day biases. The remaining spread arises from intermodel differences in Arctic warming, with some contribution from differences in the local sea-ice sensitivity. Using observations to constrain the projections moves the probability of an ice-free Arctic forward by 10-35 years when compared to unconstrained projections. Under a high-emissions scenario, an ice-free Arctic will likely (>66% probability) occur between 2036 and 2056 in September and between 2050 and 2068 from July to October. Under a medium-emissions scenario, the likely date occurs between 2040 and 2062 in September and much later in the 21st century from July to October.","[Bonan, David B.; Schneider, Tapio] CALTECH, Environm Sci & Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Eisenman, Ian] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wills, Robert C.

Numerical climate models are increasingly being used by climate scientists to inform water management. However, successful transitions from climate models (0(10-100 km)) to water resources studies (0(100 m-1 km)) still need improved data structures and modeling strategies to resolve spatial scale mismatch. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic lake-level modeling framework that consists of a state-of-the-art land surface model Noah-MP, a vector-based river routing scheme - RAPID, and a lake mass-balance model. By conducting a case study for Lake Buchanan, we demonstrate the capability of the framework in predicting lake levels at seasonal lead times. The experiments take into account different runoff resolutions, model initialization months, and multiple lead times. Uncertainty analyses and sensitivity tests are also conducted to guide future research. New hydrological insights: Different from traditional grid-based solutions, the framework is directly coupled on the vector-based NHDPlus dataset, which defines accurate hydrologic features such as rivers, dams, lakes and reservoirs. The resulting hybrid framework therefore allows for more flexibility in resolving scaling-issues between large-scale climate models and fine-scale applications. The presented hindcast results also provide insight into the influences of baseline LSM resolutions, initialization months, and lead times, which would ultimately help improve lake-level forecast skills.

As a net effect, global temperature increasingly warms up and will further increase in the future if CO2 concentration in the atmosphere keeps going up. Plants sequestrate a large amount of atmospheric CO2 via photosynthesis, thus greatly mediate the global warming. In this study, we aim to model the temporal dynamics of photosynthesis for various different vegetation types and further understand controlling factors of photosynthesis machinery. Our results showed that the photosynthesis and its interactions with climate drivers, such as temperature, precipitatin, radiation, and vapor pressure deficit, has an internal system memory about 14 days. Thus, the predictive model could be best trained with historical data of the past two weeks and could best predict future temporal evolution of photosynthesis in the following two weeks. Our leave-one-out experiment also showed that temperature and solar radiation dramatically control grassland and forest photosynthesis activity.","[Zhu, N.

The present study documents poleward movements of up to eight species of nominally 'tropical' macroinvertebrates (molluscs, polychaetes, crustaceans and foraminifera) from intertidal mudflats on the south east coast of Australia. The speed of movement was comparable with that for Australian marine fauna generally, but was particularly fast for worms and molluscs (similar to 70-300 km decade(-1)) and may be facilitated by the southward flowing East Australia Current. Further, two temperate taxa appear to have extended their ranges northwards. Changes in species biogeographic ranges raises questions surrounding the response of ecological processes within the altered and novel species combinations, including processes that underpin valuable ecosystem services. Using biological traits analysis to investigate how the observed species range changes might have impacted mudflat ecosystem functioning, and to predict the possible impacts of further poleward movements of tropical taxa. Our models suggest the changes to date, and those likely to occur in the near future, are within the envelope whereby ecological functioning is maintained by functional compensation and redundancy within the mudflat assemblage. However, in the most extreme scenario the replacement of temperate by tropical taxa resulted in major changes in ecological functioning with potential impacts on nutrient cycling and C-cycling, undermining the potential of these mudflats to continue to deliver critical ecosystem services. The widespread nature of biogeographic range shifts and the value of coastal systems should add further weight to calls for global action to mitigate global temperature change.","[Caswell, Bryony A.; Dissanayake, Navodha G.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Parklands Dr, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Dissanayake, Navodha G.; Frid, Christopher L.

To do that, we use an energy-relevant and physical-based approach, namely, PenPan model, to comprehensively evaluate GCM performance with respect to their ability to simulate annual, seasonal, and monthly statistics of E-pan (and its radiative and aerodynamic components, E-p,E-R and E-p,E-A). The results indicated that most GCMs generally captured the spatial pattern and seasonal cycle of E-pan, E-p,E-R, and E-p,E-A. However, regional means of annual and monthly E-pan, E-p,E-R, and E-p,E-A were underestimated by most GCMs mainly due to negatively biased surface air temperature (T-a) and vapor pressure deficit (vpd) outputted/simulated by the GCMs. Overall, the discrepancies among GCMs in estimating the regional statistics (regional means and seasonal cycles) of E-p,E-A were relatively larger than that of E-p,E-R, which indicates considerable uncertainties in the calculation of the aerodynamic component of evaporation based on the GCM outputs. Moreover, a few GCMs captured negative trends of regional mean annual and seasonal E-pan, E-p,E-R, and E-p,E-A well over the period of 1961- 2000, but most showed positive trends. The underestimation of net radiation (R-n) and overestimation of wind speed at 2m (u(2)) in most GCMs may, to some extent, accentuate/compensate the negative biases in GCM-estimated annual and seasonal E-pan, E-p,E-R, and E-p,E-A. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating observation of pan evaporation and well-validated PenPan model to evaluate GCM performance on atmospheric evaporative demand that is relevant to projections of future drought and regional water-energy budgets.","[Liu, Wenbin; Sun, Fubao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Sun, FB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Sunfb@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Sun, Fubao/Q-2421-2019; Sun, Fubao/G-4441-2010; Liu, Wenbin/AAB-2665-2021","Sun, Fubao/0000-0003-3358-8229; Liu, Wenbin/0000-0002-9569-6762","Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology in Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); National Science Foundation of China [41401037, 41330529]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0401401, 2016YFA0602402]; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resource Research, CAS [Y5V50019YE]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China [2014DFA71910]","Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology in Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resource Research, CAS; International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","This research was supported by the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology in Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and the National Science Foundation of China (41401037 and 41330529), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0401401 and 2016YFA0602402), the CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program (Fubao Sun), the Initial Founding of Scientific Research (Y5V50019YE) from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resource Research, CAS, and the International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China (2014DFA71910).

Many new residential projects with poor choices of material and ventilation have led to a faster rise in sick building syndrome (SBS) in Dubai than in any other country, and the IAQ (indoor air quality) has become more critical. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde (HCHO) affect the health of residents, producing the phenomenon known as SBS (sick building syndrome). It has been reported that wood materials used for furniture and wooden windows and doors are a significant source of indoor air pollution in new houses. This paper aims to identify the factor elements emitting harmful chemical substances, such as VOCs and HCHO, from wooden mashrabiya (traditional Arabic window) by examining the characteristics of the raw and surface materials through test pieces. As a methodology, a small chamber system was used to test the amount of hazardous chemicals generated for each test piece. For Total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and HCHO, the blank concentration before the injection and the generation after seven days were measured. The results showed that to reduce TVOC, it is necessary to secure six months or more as a retention period for raw materials and surface materials. The longer the retention period, the smaller the TVOC emission amount. In the case of mashrabiya, an HCHO low-emitting adhesive and maintenance for one month or more are essential influencing factors. It was proven that using raw materials with a three-month or more retention period and surface materials with a one-month or more retention period is safe for indoor mashrabiya. This study is the first study in the Middle East to identify factors and characteristics that affect the emission of hazardous chemicals from wood composite materials, such as wood mashrabiya, that affect indoor air quality in residential projects in Dubai. It analyzes the correlation between emission levels and the retention period of raw and surface materials, in order to provide a new standard for indoor air pollutants.","[Jung, Chuloh; Al Qassimi, Nahla] Ajman Univ, Dept Architecture, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Hlth & Sustainable Bldg Res Ctr, POB 346, Ajman, U Arab Emirates",Ajman University,"Jung, CL (corresponding author), Ajman Univ, Dept Architecture, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Hlth & Sustainable Bldg Res Ctr, POB 346, Ajman, U Arab Emirates.",c.jung@ajman.ac.ae; c.jung@ajman.ac.ae,,"Jung, Chuloh/0000-0002-0898-8450",,,,,47,4,4,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,2842,10.3390/su14052842,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14052842,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW7XG,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000771421000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the application of these various stylistic terms could imply that the design of the Exhibition Building is open to various interpretations, these terms refer to stylistic categories that are themselves contested. In light of this, the implications of such stylistic attributions are considered in relation to Ernst Gombrich's propositions about the stylistic terms of art history. Gombrich argues that most such terms have their origins in normative judgements, and while they become seemingly naturalised as taxonomic categories, they do not entirely transcend their ideological origins. Following on from this, the paper points to tacit propositions about the affiliations of the Exhibition Building's architecture entailed in the stylistic descriptions applied to it.","[Walker, Paul] Univ Melbourne, Architecture, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [King, Stuart] Univ Tasmania, Sch Architecture & Design, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Tasmania,"King, S (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Architecture & Design, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",stuart.king@utas.edu.au,"King, Stuart/J-7926-2014","King, Stuart/0000-0003-0041-0184",,,,,43,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1033-1867,2164-4756,,FABRICATIONS,Fabrications,,2007,2,,,,27,+,,10.1080/10331867.2007.10539609,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10331867.2007.10539609,,,22,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,V69ES,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000211422900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Annual electricity consumption of this simulated model was reduced by 48% using very low power density appliances and an Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) water heater with an Energy Star label to supply hot water. Then, a grid-connected PV system with a capacity of 29 kW was used to provide the annual electricity demand.

Since cloud processes occur from micrometer to synoptic scales, their couplings with the other components of the Arctic climate system and their overall role in modulating the energy budget at different spatio-temporal scales is challenging to quantify. The in-situ measurements, as limited in space and time as they are, still reveal the complex nature of cloud microphysical and thermodynamical processes in the Arctic. However, the synoptic scale variability of cloud systems can only be obtained from the satellite observations. A considerable progress has been made in the last decade in understanding cloud processes in the Arctic due to the availability of valuable data from the multiple campaigns in the Central Arctic and due to the advances in the satellite remote sensing. This chapter provides an overview of this progress. First an overview of the lessons learned from the recent in-situ measurement campaigns in the Arctic is provided. In particular, the importance of supercooled liquid water clouds, their role in the radiation budget and their interaction with the vertical thermodynamical structure is discussed. In the second part of the chapter, a climatological overview of cloud properties using the state-of-the-art satellite based cloud climate datasets is provided. The agreements and disagreements in these datasets are highlighted. The third and the fourth parts of the chapter highlight two most important processes that are currently being researched, namely cloud response to the rapidly changing sea-ice extent and the role of moisture transport in to the Arctic in governing cloud variability. Both of these processes have implications for the cloud feedback in the Arctic.","[Devasthale, Abhay] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, Atmospher Remote Sensing Unit, Dept Res & Dev, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Sedlar, Joseph] Univ Colorado Boulder, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci CIRES, Boulder, CO USA; [Tjernstrom, Michael] Univ Stockholm MISU, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tjernstrom, Michael] Univ Stockholm, Bert Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kokhanovsky, Alexander] Vitrociset Belgium SPRL, Darmstadt, Germany",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Stockholm University,"Kokhanovsky, A (corresponding author), Vitrociset Belgium SPRL, Darmstadt, Germany.",abhay.devasthale@smhi.se; joseph.sedlar@Colorado.edu; michaelt@misu.su.se; a.kokhanovsky@vitrocisetbelgium.com,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Sedlar, Joseph/AAD-1060-2022","Sedlar, Joseph/0000-0003-3101-9401",SMHI; EU Horizon 2020 project INTAROS; Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet),SMHI; EU Horizon 2020 project INTAROS; Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet)(Swedish Research Council),"Abhay Devasthale would like to acknowledge the support from SMHI, EU Horizon 2020 project INTAROS and Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet).

Emotion is commonly associated with logical decision making, perception, human interaction, and to a certain extent, human intelligence itself. With the growing interest of the research community towards establishing some meaningful emotional interactions between humans and computers, the need for reliable and deployable solutions for the identification of human emotional states is required. Recent developments in using electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion recognition have garnered strong interest from the research community as the latest developments in consumer-grade wearable EEG solutions can provide a cheap, portable, and simple solution for identifying emotions. Since the last comprehensive review was conducted back from the years 2009 to 2016, this paper will update on the current progress of emotion recognition using EEG signals from 2016 to 2019. The focus on this state-of-the-art review focuses on the elements of emotion stimuli type and presentation approach, study size, EEG hardware, machine learning classifiers, and classification approach. From this state-of-the-art review, we suggest several future research opportunities including proposing a different approach in presenting the stimuli in the form of virtual reality (VR). To this end, an additional section devoted specifically to reviewing only VR studies within this research domain is presented as the motivation for this proposed new approach using VR as the stimuli presentation device. This review paper is intended to be useful for the research community working on emotion recognition using EEG signals as well as for those who are venturing into this field of research.","[Suhaimi, Nazmi Sofian; Mountstephens, James; Teo, Jason] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Comp & Informat, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Teo, J (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Comp & Informat, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.",jtwteo@ums.edu.my,"Teo, Jason/E-2690-2016","Teo, Jason/0000-0003-2415-5915","Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysia [ICF0001-2018]","Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysia(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia)","This work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysia (ref.

Despite accelerated climate change in the Arctic, few studies have examined nest phenology shifts in arctic breeding species. We investigated whether CIDs have advanced for the most abundant breeding shorebird and passerine species at a long-term monitoring site in arctic Alaska. We pooled data from three additional nearby sites to determine the explanatory power of snow melt and ecological variables (predator abundance, green-up) on changes in breeding phenology. As predicted, all species (semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla, pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos, red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus, red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius, Lapland longspur, Calcarius lapponicus) exhibited advanced CIDs ranging from 0.40 to 0.80 days/year over 9 years. Timing of snow melt was the most important variable in explaining clutch initiation advancement (climate/snow hypothesis) for four of the five species, while green-up was a much less important explanatory factor. We found no evidence that high predator abundances led to earlier laying dates (predator/re-nest hypothesis). Our results support previous arctic studies in that climate change in the cryosphere will have a strong impact on nesting phenology although factors explaining changes in nest phenology are not necessarily uniform across the entire Arctic. Our results suggest some arctic-breeding shorebird and passerine species are altering their breeding phenology to initiate nesting earlier enabling them to, at least temporarily, avoid the negative consequences of a trophic mismatch.","[Liebezeit, J.

In the Baltic Sea, the rockweed Fucus vesiculosus is distributed along a decreasing salinity gradient from the North Atlantic entrance to the low-salinity regions in the north-eastern margins, thus, demonstrating a remarkable tolerance to hyposalinity. The underlying mechanisms for this tolerance are still poorly understood. Here, we exposed F. vesiculosus from two range-margin populations to the hyposaline (2.5 PSU - practical salinity unit) conditions that are projected to occur in the region by the end of this century as a result of climate change. We used transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) to determine the gene expression patterns associated with hyposalinity acclimation, and examined the variation in these patterns between the sampled populations. Results Hyposalinity induced different responses in the two populations: in one, only 26 genes were differentially expressed between salinity treatments, while the other population demonstrated up- or downregulation in 3072 genes. In the latter population, the projected future hyposalinity induced an acute response in terms of antioxidant production. Genes associated with membrane composition and structure were also heavily involved, with the upregulation of fatty acid and actin production, and the downregulation of ion channels and alginate pathways. Changes in gene expression patterns clearly indicated an inhibition of the photosynthetic machinery, with a consequent downregulation of carbohydrate production. Simultaneously, energy consumption increased, as revealed by the upregulation of genes associated with respiration and ATP synthesis. Overall, the genes that demonstrated the largest increase in expression were ribosomal proteins involved in translation pathways. The fixation rate of SNP:s was higher within genes responding to hyposalinity than elsewhere in the transcriptome. Conclusions The high fixation rate in the genes coding for salinity acclimation mechanisms implies strong selection for them. The among-population differentiation that we observed in the transcriptomic response to hyposalinity stress suggests that populations of F. vesiculosus may differ in their tolerance to future desalination, possibly as a result of local adaptation to salinity conditions within the Baltic Sea. These results emphasise the importance of considering interspecific genetic variation when evaluating the consequences of environmental change.","[Rugiu, Luca; Panova, Marina; Pereyra, Ricardo Tomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci Tjarno, SE-45296 Stromstad, Sweden; [Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland",University of Gothenburg; University of Turku,"Rugiu, L (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci Tjarno, SE-45296 Stromstad, Sweden.",luca.rugiu@gu.se,"; Pereyra, Ricardo/B-8977-2013","Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585; Pereyra, Ricardo/0000-0002-9635-5433",BONUS BAMBI Project; BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland [273623],BONUS BAMBI Project; BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland,"This study was funded by the BONUS BAMBI Project and was supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union's Seventh Programme for Research, Technological Development, and Demonstration and the Academy of Finland (grant decision number 273623).",,95,6,6,0,13,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2164,,,BMC GENOMICS,BMC Genomics,13-Jan,2020,1,,,,,,42,10.1186/s12864-020-6470-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6470-y,,,17,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,KM1TT,31931708,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000513904600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dobuzhinskiy,,"In the first third of the 20th century in the climate of diversity trends and directions in art, ekphrasis was claimed both in fiction and in memoirs, and intermediality was a permanent part of memoirs of Russian artists. Many Russian artists of the first third of the 20th century wrote the memoirs, among them I. Repin, K. Korovin, Z. Serebriakova, K. Somov, Eu. Lanceray, A. Ostroumova-Lebedeva, A. Goncharov, A. Rodchenko, M. Chagall, W. Kandinsky, P. Filonov. The consideration of the memoirs of the artists of the World of Art M. V. Dobuzhinskiy's Memories and A.N. Benois' My Memories is important because the activity of the World of Art was a major cultural event in the Russian art of the end of the 19th - early 20th centuries and had an influence on the related fields of the arts. Unlike most of associations of artists, the range of interests of the World of Art, and especially one of its outstanding representatives A.N. Benois, was very extensive and diverse. The members of the World of Art, besides painting and graphics, created stage sets for performances and ballets, they created the interior design, often appeared in print, made book illustrations - all of this is reflected in the memoirs of the artists. Ekphrasis in the memoirs of A.N. Benois and M.V. Dobuzhinskiy is reflected in the descriptions of the artistic techniques and methods, references of the paintings of the great masters and contemporary artists, narration of their own work on paintings, decorations, pictures, recollections of the exhibitions, visits of galleries and museums. In the autobiographical texts of both artists of the World of Art, My Memories of A.N. Benois and Memories of M.V. Dobuzhinskiy, ekphrasis is a component of the inter-medial system art - literature, which becomes a kind of the author's strategy in the cognition of life and art. The ekphrasis of the artists' memoirs becomes a source for the thematic polyphony of the autobiographical works. The visual perception of the reality, including through foreign pictorial imagery, predetermined the fact that the World of Art does not resort to a detailed descriptive ekphrasis and invests more artistic potential in the very mention of the art artifact. Ekphrasis in the memoir works of the artists is a way to appeal to their own art, to identify themselves in an artistic environment reflecting a process of creative search and formation of the artist.","[Galkova, Alyona, V] Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia",Tomsk State University,"Galkova, AV (corresponding author), Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.",kalosagahtos@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2306-2061,2311-3774,,TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZD,Tekst Kniga Knigoizd.,AUG,2016,2,,,,27,48,,10.17223/23062061/11/3,http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/23062061/11/3,,,22,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH4LO,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000453174000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nonetheless, the current knowledge on the biology, ecology of these species is scattered and no efficient management strategies are currently available. Based on the existing literature and field observations from the French forest health service, we firstly identified the prominent BWB species implicated in oak declines in Europe. Secondly we performed a state of the art on the biology and ecology of these species, with a particular reference to the interactions with their host trees. Finally considerations were made on how climate change could affect these interactions. Six species, namely Agrilus biguttatus, Coraebus florentinus, Coraebus undatus, Cerambyx cerdo, Platypus cylindrus and Scolytus intricatus are frequently implicated in oak declines in Europe. The interactions with their hosts regarding selection and resistance are generally poorly known. Likewise, these beetles are associated with a diverse microbial community, which composition and implication in the biology of insects and decline processes is unclear in most cases. Climate change will probably increase the frequency and distribution of oak declines in Europe. It will also likely modify the interactions between oaks and these beetles by promoting contributing factors of decline, modifying directly and indirectly host resistance, phenology and attractiveness, and beetles development, distribution and interaction with microorganisms. Evidences point out that the increase in temperature has already favored the distribution and development of C florentinus and could enhance the development of other species. Potential research prospects are proposed, aiming at acquiring missing basic knowledge and improving the currently limited management strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional method is to adjust numerical climate models to simulate high-resolution situation, which is quite time and resource consuming. Recently, deep learning methods have provided an appreciable new insight and successfully downscale in multiple climate phenomena. However, existing models simply treat downscaling problem as image super-resolution problem and extract the spatial features from high resolution (HR) climate data directly, which ignores the detailed physical varieties and produce low credibility. In this paper, we take El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events as example and formulate SST pattern downscaling as a multi-scale pattern fusion problem. Meanwhile, in order to cover that all conditions describing the internal physical structure, we find the optimal probability distributions of the output HR SST pattern. Based on this formalization, we further implement a deep learning model named Multi-scale Bayesian convolution network (MSBCNN). We evaluate our model on the monthly air-sea data from 1870 to 2014 and carry out real-world 2014/2015 ENSO SST pattern downscaling. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our formalization, which outperforms than the other traditional approaches and state-of-the-art models.","[Mu, Bin; Qin, Bo; Yuan, Shijin] Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Mu, B (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",binmu99@163.com; brunoqin@163.com; yuanshijin@163.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [Grant22120190207]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1506402],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant22120190207), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2018YFC1506402).",,12,0,0,5,10,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-7281-9928-3,,,,2020,,,,,359,362,,10.1109/ICECTT50890.2020.00086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICECTT50890.2020.00086,,,4,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),,BR0TI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000630470800079,View Full Record in Web of Science

In general, this engagement involves small numbers and, in the current climate, is unlikely to receive sufficient investment to make a difference at a population level. Less recognised is an emerging field of epidemiological research on the health impact of 'general cultural attendance'. This provides evidence that simply going to a museum, art gallery, film or concert on a regular basis increases longevity, and that culture is a separate variable. This article summarises this evidence and looks at the strategic implications for cultural organisations from the perspective of a practitioner. If cultural attendance can help address health inequalities, and if the best way to overcome the psychological and social barriers to cultural attendance is personal contact with a trusted guide, the article outlines a system where voluntary and statutory organisations can refer people to cultural organisations who might benefit from them. The former would need to be able to guarantee a high quality and friendly welcome that recognises the needs of first-time users from excluded groups.

In arid and semi-arid regions, tailoring reliable forecasts has the potential to improve water management by using key hydroclimate variables months in advance. This article analyses and compares the performance of two common approaches (empirical and hybrid dynamical-statistical) in seasonal climate forecasting over a drought-prone area located in Southwest Asia including Iran. Empirical models are framed as a baseline skill that hybrid models need to outperform. Both approaches provide probabilistic forecasts of precipitation and temperature using canonical correlation analysis to provide forecasts at 0.25 degrees resolution. Empirical models are developed based on the large-scale observed atmosphere-ocean patterns for forecasting using antecedent climate anomalies as predictors, while the hybrid approach makes use of model output statistics to correct systematic errors in dynamical climate model forecast outputs. Eight state-of-the-art dynamical models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble project are analysed. Individual models with the highest goodness index are weighted to develop seven different hybrid dynamical-statistical Multi-model Ensembles. In this study, (October-December) and (January-February) are considered as target seasons which are the most important periods within the water year for water resource allocation to the agriculture sector. The results show that the hybrid approach has improved performance compared to the raw general circulation models and purely empirical models, and that the performance of the hybrid models is season-dependent. Seasonal forecasts of precipitation (temperature) have a higher skill in OND (JFM). In addition, in most cases, Multi-model Ensemble (MME) is more skillful than the empirical models and outperforms individual dynamical models. However, the best individual model might be as skillful as the MME given the target season and region of interest.","[Najafi, Husain] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany; [Najafi, Husain; Massah Bavani, Ali R.] Univ Tehran, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, Aburaihan Campus, Tehran, Iran; [Robertson, Andrew W.] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Palisades, NY USA; [Irannejad, Parviz] Univ Tehran, Inst Geophys, Dept Space Phys, Tehran, Iran; [Wanders, Niko] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Tehran; Columbia University; University of Tehran; Utrecht University; Princeton University,"Najafi, H; Bavani, AMR (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, Aburaihan Campus, Tehran, Iran.",husain.najafi@ufz.de; armassah@ut.ac.ir,"Wanders, Niko/AAJ-2334-2021","Wanders, Niko/0000-0002-7102-5454; Najafi, Husain/0000-0002-0412-3572; Massah Bavani, Ali Reza/0000-0002-5433-1791",NOAA; NSF; NASA; DOE; University of Tehran,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); University of Tehran(University of Tehran),"The authors thank the NMME program partners and acknowledge the help of NCEP, IRI, and NCAR personnel in creating, updating and maintaining the NMME archive.

We report on a detailed, comprehensive phylo-geographic study on the similar to 4 kb mtDNA sequence in underground blind mole rats of the family Spalacidae (or subfamily Spalacinae) from the East Mediterranean steppes. Our study aimed at testing the presence of periodicities in branching patterns on a constructed phylogenetic tree and at searching for congruence between branching events, tectonic history and paleoclimates. In contrast to the strong support for the majority of the branching events on the tree, the absence of support in a few instances indicates that network-like evolution could exist in spalacids. In our tree, robust support was given, in concordance with paleontological data, for the separation of spalacids from muroid rodents during the first half of the Miocene when open, grass-dominated habitats were established. Marine barriers formed between Anatolia and the Balkans could have facilitated the separation of the lineage Spalax'' from the lineage Nannospalax'' and of the clade leucodon'' from the clade xanthodon''. The separation of the clade ehrenbergi'' occurred during the late stages of the tectonically induced uplift of the Anatolian high plateaus and mountains, whereas the separation of the clade vasvarii took place when the rapidly uplifting Taurus mountain range prevented the Mediterranean rainfalls from reaching the Central Anatolian Plateau. The separation of Spalax antiquus and S. graecus occurred when the southeastern Carpathians were uplifted. Despite the role played by tectonic events, branching events that show periodicity corresponding to 400-kyr and 100-kyr eccentricity bands illuminate the important role of orbital fluctuations on adaptive radiation in spalacids. At the given scale, our results supports the Court Jester'' hypothesis over the Red Queen'' one.","[Hadid, Yarin; Snir, Sagi; Pavlicek, Tomas; Nevo, Eviatar] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Hadid, Yarin; Snir, Sagi; Pavlicek, Tomas; Nevo, Eviatar] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Nemeth, Attila; Kazmer, Miklos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Budapest, Hungary; [Nemeth, Attila; Kazmer, Miklos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Paleontol, Budapest, Hungary; [Csorba, Gabor; Major, Agnes] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Budapest, Hungary; [Mezhzherin, Sergey; Rusin, Mikhail] Schmalhausen Inst Zool, Kiev, Ukraine; [Coskun, Yuksel] Dicle Univ, Sci & Art Fac, Dept Biol, Diyarbakir, Turkey",University of Haifa; University of Haifa; Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Schmalhausen Institute of Zoology of NASU; Dicle University,"Hadid, Y (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",pavlicek@research.haifa.ac.il,"S, Mezhzherin/L-1583-2019; Kazmer, Miklos/D-1517-2013; Pavlicek, Tomas/C-4768-2008; Rusin, Mikhail/O-5809-2016","S, Mezhzherin/0000-0002-8863-0562; Kazmer, Miklos/0000-0003-1092-1316; Rusin, Mikhail/0000-0003-4349-4795",Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel); Council for Higher Education (Israel); European Union; European Social Fund; Hungarian National Science Fund (OTKA) [K67583]; Ancell-Teicher Research Foundation of Genetics and Molecular Evolution;  [TAMOP 4.2.1./B-09/1/KMR-2010-0003],"Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel)(Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel); Council for Higher Education (Israel); European Union(European Commission); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Hungarian National Science Fund (OTKA)(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Ancell-Teicher Research Foundation of Genetics and Molecular Evolution; ","We thank the Ministry of Science and Technology and Council for Higher Education (both Israel) for providing scholarships to YH.

It plays a prominent role in aquatic ecosystems, and it is crucial to functions from nutrient cycling to energy transfer in food webs. Coastal and estuarine ecosystem structure and function are strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures; however, there are large gaps in our understanding of the responses of inorganic nutrient and organic matter fluxes between benthic habitats and the water column. We illustrate the varied nature of physical and biological benthic-pelagic coupling processes and their potential sensitivity to three anthropogenic pressures - climate change, nutrient loading, and fishing - using the Baltic Sea as a case study and summarize current knowledge on the exchange of inorganic nutrients and organic material between habitats. Traditionally measured benthic-pelagic coupling processes (e.g., nutrient exchange and sedimentation of organic material) are to some extent quantifiable, but the magnitude and variability of biological processes are rarely assessed, preventing quantitative comparisons. Changing oxygen conditions will continue to have widespread effects on the processes that govern inorganic and organic matter exchange among habitats while climate change and nutrient load reductions may have large effects on organic matter sedimentation. Many biological processes (predation, bioturbation) are expected to be sensitive to anthropogenic drivers, but the outcomes for ecosystem function are largely unknown. We emphasize how improved empirical and experimental understanding of benthic-pelagic coupling processes and their variability are necessary to inform models that can quantify the feedbacks among processes and ecosystem responses to a changing world.","[Griffiths, Jennifer R.; Nascimento, Francisco J.

Wildfires are the cause of major ecological and economic impacts in this region, and the increasing evidence of climate change consequences in this region raises concerns on the future impacts of fires in the Iberian forests ecosystems. Our results confirm that the inter-annual variability of total burnt area is mainly controlled by meteorological conditions, in spite of the current efforts for fire control and suppression. We also show that this meteorology dominance over fire activity is not only true during the fire season itself, but also that certain specific meteorological backgrounds (such as prolonged droughts) may enhance the risk for severe wildfire episodes in some areas. Based on a previous classification of the Iberian Peninsula into four distinct pyro-regions, we developed statistical models which reproduce about two thirds of the inter-annual variability of the burnt area, using meteorological variables as predictors (calibrated with data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis). Specific models were developed for each sub-domain, testing their robustness for extrapolation under climate-change conditions. Using an ensemble of state-of-the-art RCM future climate scenarios, we present future BA projections considering two alternative techniques of statistical correction of model data often used in climate change impact studies: (1) unbiasing method; (2) delta change method. Our results clearly project large increases in mean burnt areas for all the considered pyro-regions, despite some fluctuations regarding each considered technique. By 2075, mean burnt areas could be about two to three times larger than in the present, taking into account current climate projections for the next century, and non-significant changes in other external factors, such as human activity, fire suppression or land use.

The amount of allergenic proteins produced by pollen, or pollen allergenicity, is regulated by both genes and the environment. As a result, even closely related plant taxa may release pollen with distinctly different allergen contents. Here, we determined the variability in atmospheric exposure to the major Artemisia pollen allergen, Art v 1, during the pollination seasons of two common species, i.e., A. vulgaris (early flowering species) and A. campestris (late flowering species), in Poznan, Poland (2013-2015). Artemisia pollen grains were collected using Hirst-type volumetric trap, while Art v 1 was collected by a two-stage cascade impactor (PM10 and PM>10 air fractions) and quantified by immunoenzymatic analysis. The results showed that daily Art v 1 levels correlated significantly with mean daily concentrations of Artemisia pollen (from r = 0.426 to r = 0.949, depending on air fraction and peak of the season). Significant differences were observed between 1) the median pollen allergenicity indifferent seasons (from 2.5 to 4.7 pg Art v 1/pollen) and 2) the median pollen allergenicity in different peak periods of the season (from 1.8 to 6.7 pg Art v 1/pollen). During the late peak (flowering of A. campestris), the median pollen allergenicity was significantly higher (on average by 63%, p< 0.05) than that during A. vulgaris flowering. The highest mean seasonal pollen allergenicity was observed during the wettest season, while the lowest was observed during the driest season (from July-August). In summary, our study showed distinct differences in Artemisia pollen allergenicity, that were not only related to daily and seasonal variability, which may exceed 800% and 80%, respectively but also noticeable when two common Artemisia species were compared. Therefore, we argue that variability in pollen allergenicity (both seasonal and species-specific) should be considered in future studies assessing pollen exposure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This comprehensive review provides the state-of-the-art of CO(2)capture using adsorbents prepared from various waste materials, which are categorized on the basis of their generation processes such as pyrolysis, combustion, smelting, and petroleum-related upgrading. These include biomass waste, sludge, polymer wastes, by-product of fuel and waste combustion processes such as fly ash and other biomass-based ashes, and byproducts of smelting and petroleum processes such as red mud, steel and iron slag, carbide slag, and petroleum and coal residues. In general, biomass waste derived adsorbents (up to 21 mmol/g and 3900 m(2)/g), and petroleum and coal-based sorbents (160-900 mg/g and 850 to 3800 m(2)/g) exhibited the highest CO(2)adsorption capacities and the highest surface areas. The technological and economic feasibilities of these waste-derived sorbents for the simultaneous removal of multicomponent pollutants (SOx, NOx, H-g and CO2) need to be further assessed in future studies, focusing on the development of more resistant and kinetically stable adsorbents using adsorption capacity, temperature and pressure as a design metrics; and techno-economic and life-cycle assessments to aid in the scale-up of adsorbents with outstanding laboratory-scale performances to industrial applications.

However, direct measurement of global terrestrial ET is not feasible. Here, we first reviewed the basic theory and state-of-the-art approaches for estimating global terrestrial ET, including remote-sensing-based physical models, machine-learning algorithms and land surface models (LSMs). We then utilized 4 remote-sensing-based physical models, 2 machine-learning algorithms and 14 LSMs to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in global terrestrial ET. The results showed that the ensemble means of annual global terrestrial ET estimated by these three categories of approaches agreed well, with values ranging from 589.6 mm yr(-1) (6.56 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1)) to 617.1 mm yr(-1) (6.87 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1)). For the period from 1982 to 2011, both the ensembles of remote-sensing-based physical models and machine-learning algorithms suggested increasing trends in global terrestrial ET (0.62 mm yr(-2) with a significance level of p < 0.05 and 0.38 mm yr(-2) with a significance level of p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the ensemble mean of the LSMs showed no statistically significant change (0.23 mm yr(-2), p > 0.05), although many of the individual LSMs reproduced an increasing trend. Nevertheless, all 20 models used in this study showed that anthropogenic Earth greening had a positive role in increasing terrestrial ET. The concurrent small interannual variability, i.e., relative stability, found in all estimates of global terrestrial ET, suggests that a potential planetary boundary exists in regulating global terrestrial ET, with the value of this boundary being around 600mm yr(-1). Uncertainties among approaches were identified in specific regions, particularly in the Amazon Basin and arid/semiarid regions. Improvements in parameterizing water stress and canopy dynamics, the utilization of new available satellite retrievals and deep-learning methods, and model-data fusion will advance our predictive understanding of global terrestrial ET.","[Pan, Shufen; Pan, Naiqing; Tian, Hanqin; Shi, Hao] Auburn Univ, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36832 USA; [Pan, Naiqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Arora, Vivek K.] Univ Victoria, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Environm Canada, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Haverd, Vanessa] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kato, Etsushi] IAE, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1050003, Japan; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Phys Inst, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Lombardozzi, Danica] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Nabel, Julia E.

This is essential in positioning and navigation, geophysics, geodynamics, oceanography and other sciences related to the climate and Earth's environment. One of the major sources of gravity data is satellite altimetry that provides gravity data with almost 75% surface of the Earth. Satellite altimetry also provides data to study local, regional and global geophysical processes, the geoid model in the areas of oceans and seas. This technique can be successfully used to study the ocean mean dynamic topography. The results of the investigations and possible products of altimetry will provide a good material for the GGOS (Global Geodetic Observing System) and institutions of IAS (International Altimetry Service). This paper presents the achievements in satellite altimetry in all the above disciplines obtained in the last years. First very shorly basic concept of satellite altimetry is given. In order to obtain the highest accuracy on range measurements over the ocean improved of altimetry waveforms performed on the ground is described. Next, significant improvements of sea and ocean gravity anomalies models developed presently is shown.

It is also shown that a small area of photovoltaics on rooftops can supply building demand, highlighting the favorable solar potential for the location. Future climate projections, for 2050, within the lifetime of many buildings, are expected to lead to higher energy demand, particularly in the summer. The increase in photovoltaic capacity to address that higher demand will open the opportunity to replace a significant fraction of gas usage with solar-powered heat pumps in the heating season.

Besides, the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change are exerting pressure towards less polluting sources of energy and strategies to diminish energy losses. In this environmental context, lithium compounds are an attractive alternative to store energy in thermal energy storage systems due to their thermodynamic features, which make such compounds a relevant strategy for energy storage, for instance, capturing residual energy from several industrial activities. Here a review of the current state of the art and new technological advances reflected by the scientific literature and the patented inventions using lithium as a relevant compound for thermochemical energy storage has been performed. Throughout a search on different databases, it is proposed a simplified process to support our findings and the analysis of this data. Thus, several important advances in thermochemical energy storage using chemical reaction and sorption systems were evidenced. The literature also showed that the majority of the analysed investigation included in our data set are based on sorption technologies. This review suggests the need for systematisation in reporting critical data to facilitate a common understanding with regards to the advances in energy storage, especially when referring to heat storage density. The importance of lithium in thermochemical systems in the future will probably keep increasing, particularly in systems where several lithium salts have shown to be excellent doping agents and working pairs of materials included in different matrices.","[Marin, P.

Recent data syntheses show that drought sensitivity varies considerably among plants from different climate zones, but state-of-the-art LSMs currently assume the same drought sensitivity for all vegetation. We tested whether variable drought sensitivities are needed to explain the observed large-scale patterns of drought impact on the carbon, water and energy fluxes. We implemented data-driven drought sensitivities in the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) LSM and evaluated alternative sensitivities across a latitudinal gradient in Europe during the 2003 heatwave. The model predicted an overly abrupt onset of drought unless average soil water potential was calculated with dynamic weighting across soil layers. We found that high drought sensitivity at the most mesic sites, and low drought sensitivity at the most xeric sites, was necessary to accurately model responses during drought. Our results indicate that LSMs will over-estimate drought impacts in drier climates unless different sensitivity of vegetation to drought is taken into account.","[De Kauwe, M.

Within this work a state-of-the-art market review of the best performing fenestration products has been carried out, along with an overview of possible future research opportunities for the fenestration industry. The focus of the market review was low thermal transmittance (U-value). The lowest centre-of-glass U-g-values found was 0.28 and 0.30 W/m(2) K, which was from a suspended coating glazing product and an aerogel glazing product, respectively. However, the majority of high performance products found were triple glazed. The lowest frame U-value was 0.61 W/m(2) K. Vacuum glazing, smart windows, solar cell glazing, window frames, self-cleaning glazing, low-emissivity coatings and spacers were also reviewed, thus also representing possibilities for controlling and harvesting the solar radiation energy. Currently, vacuum glazing, new spacer materials and solutions, electrochromic windows and aerogel glazing seem to have the largest potential for improving the thermal performance and daylight and solar properties in fenestration products. Aerogel glazing has the lowest potential U-values, similar to 0.1 W/m(2) K, but requires further work to improve the visible transmittance. Electrochromic vaccum glazing and evacuated aerogel glazing are two vacuum-related solutions, which have a large potential. There may also be opportunities for completely new material innovations, which could revolutionize the fenestration industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One of its initiatives is to assess the characteristics of the materials that will be needed in order to achieve the 2020 targets, in terms both of amounts of materials and their technical specifications, along with the way to get there for the latter. The Materials Initiative was created to foster a roadmap which is based on a scientific assessment of the current situation. This paper presents the work of the author in the (wind turbine) electricity generator part of that assessment, it includes the aspects of technology and system state-of-the-art; material supply status; on-going research and players; materials specification targets for 2020/2030 and beyond. The assessment found that the performance of permanent magnets is the single item potentially to provide the most significant improvement in component specification, but that in order to achieve this perhaps new chemical components -based on rare earths, as currently, or not-will be necessary in order to achieve these high-performance magnets. The search for these new materials is stimulated by the current dependency of the world in a nearly-monopolistic supplier of rare earth elements. The assessment also concluded that the improvement of materials specifications is challenging but achievable in most areas, and a crucial aspect for the necessary cost reductions in wind energy production.

Here, we examine southern UK sub-hourly 10 min rainfall from Met Office state-of-the-art convective-permitting model simulations for the present and future climate. Observational studies have shown that the duration of rainfall can decrease with temperature in summer in some regions. The duration decrease coincides with an intensification of sub-hourly rainfall extremes. This suggests that rainfall duration and sub-hourly rainfall intensity may change in future under climate change with important implications for future changes in flash flooding risk. The simulations show clear intensification of sub-hourly rainfall, but we fail to detect any decrease in rainfall duration. In fact, model results suggest the opposite with a slight (probably insignificant) lengthening of both extreme and non-extreme rainfall events in the future. The lengthening is driven by rainfall intensification without clear changes in the shape of the event profile. Other metrics are also examined, including the relationship between intense 10 min rainfall and temperature, and return levels changes; all are consistent with results found for hourly rainfall. No evaluation of model performance at the sub-hourly timescale is possible, highlighting the need for high-quality sub-hourly observations. Such sub-hourly observations will advance our understanding of the future risks of flash flooding.","[Chan, S. C.; Fowler, H.

However, there is a need for improved opportunities for youth to participate and have their voices heard in both contexts. Our Photovoice study explores youth perceptions of the capability of youth to participate in disaster risk reduction and climate change action. We conducted six focus groups from February 2019 to June 2019 with four teenaged youth participants in Ottawa, Canada, hosting two virtual Photovoice exhibitions in 2021. Our results highlight 11 themes across a variety of topics including youth as assets, youth-adult partnerships, political action on consumerism, social media, education, accessibility, and art as knowledge translation. We provide four calls to action, centering youth participation and leadership across all of them, to guide stakeholders in how to improve disaster risk reduction and climate change initiatives by meaningfully including youth as stakeholders.","[Pickering, Christina J.; Al-Baldawi, Zobaida; McVean, Lauren; Amany, Raissa A.; Adan, Munira; Baker, Lucy; Al-Baldawi, Zaynab; L.

This led to the development of new thermal insulation renders with lower thermal conductivities (lambda) (lambda < 0.040 W m(-1) K-1). However, their mechanical and water resistance performance has also decreased. In this context, this research discusses the performance of a multilayer thermal insulation system with a super-insulating thermal render (lambda < 0.030 W m(-1) K-1), to be applied on the exterior, subjected to a Mediterranean climate. A set of mechanical, physical, and microstructural tests were conducted. Within the scope of this study, it was possible to improve the render's mechanical performance and water resistance, when protective layers were applied in a multilayer system. When its performance is compared with other multilayer products currently in the market, this new solution presents competitive results, which further encourage the tests in real operative conditions.","[Pedroso, Marco; Flores-Colen, Ines; Silvestre, Jose Dinis; Gloria Gomes, M.; de Brito, Jorge] Univ Lisbon, IST, CERIS, DECivil, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, Luis] Tiling Act, St Gobain Weber, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Pedroso, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, IST, CERIS, DECivil, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",marco.pedroso@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; ines.flores.colen@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; jose.silvestre@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; maria.gloria.gomes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; Luis.Silva@saint-gobain.com; Pedro.Sequeira@saint-gobain.com; jb@civil.ist.utl.pt,"da Glória Gomes, Maria/I-1293-2012; Silvestre, José Dinis/C-1699-2009; Flores-Colen, Inês/A-6635-2013; de Brito, Jorge/A-4299-2008","da Glória Gomes, Maria/0000-0003-1499-1370; Silvestre, José Dinis/0000-0002-3330-2000; Flores-Colen, Inês/0000-0003-4038-6748; de Brito, Jorge/0000-0001-6766-2736; Pedroso, Marco/0000-0002-8119-6847","CERIS Research Centre, IST, University of Lisbon; Portuguese FCT -Foundation for Science and Technology; Saint-Gobain Weber Portugal; COMPETE 2020 project [POCI-01-0247-FEDER-017417]; FCT [SFRH/BD/132239/2017]","CERIS Research Centre, IST, University of Lisbon; Portuguese FCT -Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); Saint-Gobain Weber Portugal; COMPETE 2020 project; FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of CERIS Research Centre, IST, University of Lisbon, Portuguese FCT -Foundation for Science and Technology, Saint-Gobain Weber Portugal, and COMPETE 2020 project POCI-01-0247-FEDER-017417.

The reconstruction gives a more rigorous picture of climate and environmental change during the Middle Pliocene and provides a new boundary condition for future general circulation model (GCM) studies. Location Global. Methods Compilation of Middle Pliocene vegetation data from 202 marine and terrestrial sites into the comprehensive GIS data base TEVIS (Tertiary Environmental Information System). Translation into an internally consistent classification scheme using 28 biomes. Comparison and synthesis of vegetation reconstruction from palaeodata with the outputs of the mechanistically based BIOME4 model forced by climatology derived from the HadAM3 GCM. Results The model results compare favourably with available palaeodata and highlight the importance of employing vegetation-climate feedbacks and the anomaly method in biome models. Both the vegetation reconstruction from palaeobotanical data and the BIOME4 prediction indicate a general warmer and moister climate for the Middle Pliocene. Evergreen taiga as well as temperate forest and grassland shifted northward, resulting in much reduced tundra vegetation. Warm-temperate forests (with subtropical taxa) spread in mid and eastern Europe and tropical savannas and woodland expanded in Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts. Discrepancies which occurred between data reconstruction and model simulation can be related to: (1) poor spatial model resolution and data coverage; (2) uncertainties in delimiting biomes using climate parameters; or (3) uncertainties in model physics and/or geological boundary conditions. Main conclusions The new global biome reconstruction combines vegetation reconstruction from palaeobotanical proxies with model simulations. It is an important contribution to the further understanding of climate and vegetation changes during the Middle Pliocene warm interval and will enhance our knowledge about how vegetation may change in the future.","[Salzmann, U.; Lunt, D.

Since one of the sample sets had been mounted with Elmer's glue products in core-mounts for dendrochronological examination, we investigate whether pretreatment can remove this potential contaminant before C-14 dating. We find that even in (unrealistic) cases of extensive glue contamination this can be largely/successfully - removed - making it likely that the samples in this study, where, moreover, only wood samples without traces of glue were employed, can provide accurate C-14 dates. Dendro-C-14-wiggle-matching was then employed to provide precise calendar dates for the two tree-ring sequences. The last extant ring of the Ipi-ha-ishutef coffin lies ca. 2081-2064 BC (95.4% probability), supporting, but refining, its assumed date. In the case of the Senusret III boat, we find a temporary, small, but important offset within the period ca. 2200-1900 BC in contemporary C-14 ages between the Levant and central and northern Europe. It is suggested this is likely a result of exaggeration of normal seasonal variations in the uptake of C-14 and its latitudinal distribution caused by climate change in the 2200-1900 BC/4200-3900 Cal BP (y2k) interval. A date for the last extant ring of the Senusret III boat is probably around 1898/95-1879/76 BC (95.4% probability) - more consistent with a high Middle Kingdom Egyptian chronology.

The East Africa region is used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving plants. With a wide range of ecosystems and 771 protected areas covering nearly one quarter of the land area, East Africa is an ideal location to assess the effectiveness of protected areas through distribution modelling of the genus Acacia. Methods - Herbarium specimen data (2,047 records) were collated from East Africa for 65 taxa (species, subspecies, varieties) from the genus Acacia. Generalised Additive Models were used to determine climatic drivers, and thence to extrapolate climatic suitability across the region. For two Acacia taxa, we investigated the potential for climate-induced range-shifts using a downscaled regional climate model under two IPCC scenarios. Key results - Approximately two thirds of Acacia diversity hotspots had < 10% coverage by protected areas. Furthermore, the protected area network covered less of the predicted ranges of the Acacia taxa and contained fewer taxa per unit area than would be expected under randomised placement. Areas with suitable climate for high-elevation, moisture-dependent taxa such as A. abyssinica subsp. calophylla are predicted to contract their potential range by up to 80% towards mountain peaks, where protected areas are dominated by low-level protection forest reserves. Conversely, the area of suitable environment for a xerophytic low-elevation species (A. turnbulliana) is predicted to increase by up to 77%. Conclusions - East Africa's national parks may not be preserving an important component of ecosystem diversity, a situation exacerbated by climate change. Even within the genus Acacia, different species are predicted to respond differently to climate change. Priority areas for research and conservation are identified based on overlap between predicted high Acacia diversity and gaps in the collection record, with northern and eastern Kenya highlighted as particularly important. High elevation protected areas are also predicted to become increasingly important as climatic refugia in a warmer future.","[Marshall, Andrew R.; Platts, Philip J.; Marchant, Rob] Univ York, Dept Environm, York Inst Trop Ecosyst Dynam KITE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Marshall, Andrew R.; Platts, Philip J.; Marchant, Rob] Univ York, Dept Environm, Ctr Integrat Res Conservat & Learning CIRCLE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Marshall, Andrew R.] Flamingo Land Ltd, Kirby Misperton YO17 6UX, N Yorkshire, England; [Platts, Philip J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Gereau, Roy E.] Missouri Bot Garden, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Kindeketas, William] Tanzania Commiss Sci & Technol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kang'ethe, Simon] Natl Museums Kenya, E African Herbarium, Nairobi, Kenya",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of Cambridge; Missouri Botanical Gardens,"Marshall, AR (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Environm, York Inst Trop Ecosyst Dynam KITE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",andy.marshall@york.ac.uk,"Platts, Philip J./C-2002-2009","Platts, Philip J./0000-0002-0153-0121",Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation grant; Udzungwa Forest Project; Flamingo Land Theme Park and Zoo; Marie-Curie [MEXT-CT-2004-517098]; Leverhulme Trust (UK),Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation grant; Udzungwa Forest Project; Flamingo Land Theme Park and Zoo; Marie-Curie(European Commission); Leverhulme Trust (UK)(Leverhulme Trust),"This work was funded by a Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation grant to RG, RM and ARM.

We present a case study on collaborative planning process, which contributed to the development of adaptive FRM in one of the largest river basins in Finland. The focus was on the possibility and acceptability of using large regulated lakes as storage for flood water in an extreme flood event to decrease flood damage at the downstream riverside towns. We defined an extreme flood event that would cause dramatic flood damage and developed tools for simulating the event with alternative regulation strategies using Watershed Simulation and Forecasting System (WSFS). We organized a stakeholder event to demonstrate the alternative lake regulation strategies, their socio-economic consequences, and to discuss their acceptability. We found that storing flood water in the lakes above the regulation limits and preparing for winter floods in advance by lowering the lakes in the autumn can minimize the total damage in the target area. The majority of stakeholders considered these actions acceptable in an extreme flood event, regardless of deliberately induced flooding of areas where no floods have occurred for over 50 years. However, lowering the lakes in the autumn on annual basis gained less support. We emphasize the importance of deliberations on the FRM procedures and responsibilities in extreme flood events with the stakeholders in advance to increase adaptive capacity and legitimacy of decisions.","[Soderholm, K.; Dubrovin, T.; Veijalainen, N.; Vehvilainen, B.; Marttunen, M.] SYKE, Finnish Environm Inst, Freshwater Ctr, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Pihlajamaki, M.] Univ Oulu, Water Resources & Environm Engn Res Grp, POB 4300, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Pihlajamaki, M.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pihlajamaki, M.] SYKE, Finnish Environm Inst, Environm Policy Ctr, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; University of Oulu; University of Helsinki; Finnish Environment Institute,"Soderholm, K (corresponding author), SYKE, Finnish Environm Inst, Freshwater Ctr, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland.",kimmo.soderholm@ymparisto.fi,"Veijalainen, Noora/AAN-4826-2020; Marttunen, Mika/G-3134-2019","Marttunen, Mika/0000-0001-9494-4181; Pihlajamaki, Mia/0000-0003-1322-0558; Veijalainen, Noora/0000-0003-4665-933X",Finnish Academy; Strategic Research Council; BONUS (Art 185); EU; Academy of Finland,Finnish Academy(Academy of Finland); Strategic Research Council; BONUS (Art 185); EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This paper is a contribution from three research projects: i) ClimWater -project financed by the Finnish Academy, ii) Winland -project financed by Strategic Research Council, and iii) the BONUS GOHERR -project, which has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and the Academy of Finland.

These natural hazards highly impact the lives and livelihoods of the people living in the region. However, our understanding of the precipitation patterns and their impact on related hazardous events and/or agricultural productivity is hampered by a dearth of in situ precipitation observations. Here, we propose an evaluation of gridded precipitation products as potential candidates filling this hiatus. We evaluate three state-of-the-art gridded products, the ERA5 reanalysis, IMERG satellite observations, and a simulation from the convection-permitting climate model (CPM), COSMO-CLM, for their ability to represent precipitation totals, timing, and precipitation probability density function. The evaluation is performed against observations from 11 gauge stations that provide at least 2.5 years of hourly and half-hourly data, recorded between 2011 and 2016. Results indicate a poor performance of ERA5 with a persistent wet bias, mostly for stations in the rain shadow of the mountains. IMERG gives the best representation of the precipitation totals as indicated by bias score comparisons. The CPM outperforms both ERA5 and IMERG in representing the probability density function, while both IMERG and the CPM have a good skill in capturing precipitation seasonal and diurnal cycles. The better performance of CPM is attributable to its higher resolution. This study highlights the potential of using IMERG and CPM precipitation estimates for hydrological and impact modeling over the Rwenzori Mountains, preferring IMERG for precipitation totals and CPM for precipitation extremes.","[Nakulopa, Faluku; Van de rkelen, Inne; Thiery, Wim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium; [van de Walle, Jonas; van Lipzig, Nicole P.

The aim of this work is to review the thermal performance of buildings integrated with various energy-saving strategies and to recommend suitable passive techniques for buildings located in various climatic types. The passive techniques such as PCM, insulation, natural and/or night ventilation techniques were investigated and recommendations were made based on the Koppen-Geiger climatic classifications. A variety of reviews discussing the different aspects of the selection of passive techniques for building applications are available in the literature. Still, knowledge of which technique suits a particular climate and the factors that influence its selection is necessary for all engineers, architects, research personnel, and students who are into building applications. The outcomes of the detailed literature review are as follows: Buildings integrated with PCM, insulation, natural and/or night ventilation significantly reduce the building's energy demands. The crucial factors in selecting an appropriate technique for a specific building are building type and location, weather patterns, and ventilation potential and strategies. Hence, before selecting any technique, it is recommended to analyse the feasibility of the technique for a particular building for an entire year in terms of thermal performance and cost benefits; and Finally, insulation integration at the outer building surface is recommended for Type A and B climates, while insulation integration at the inner building surface is recommended for Type C and D climates. In general, PCM integration is not beneficial for Type A climates, while integrating PCM at the outer building surface is recommended for Type B climates. Similarly, PCM integration at the middle or innermost layer of the building envelopes yielded better results for Type C and D climates. Reframing the building codes and standards for reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climatic changes is recommended for a healthy, comfortable lifestyle and a clean environment.

In this paper, we reviewed 294 articles published between 1995-2019, to evaluate the state of the art use of models and scenarios to investigate the effects of land use change and climate change on natural and social-ecological systems. Our review focuses on three issues. The first explores the extent to which the environmental dynamics of land use and climate change were jointly analyzed and the spatial scales associated with such integrated studies. The second explores the modelling methodologies and approaches used in the scenario analysis. The third explores the methods for developing or building scenarios. Results show that in most predictions there is little integration of key drivers of change. We find most forecasting studies use a sectoral modelling approach through dynamic spatially distributed models. Most articles do not apply a participatory approach in the development of scenarios. Based on this review, we conclude that there are some gaps in how scenario analysis on natural and social-ecological systems are conducted. These gaps pose a challenge for the use of models and scenarios as predictive tools in decision-making processes in the context of global change.","[Guaita Garcia, Noelia] Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Edificio Ciencias, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain; [Martinez Fernandez, Julia] New Water Culture Fdn, Pedro Cerbuna 12, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Fitz, Carl] Univ S Florida, Sch Geosci, 1936 Harbortown Dr, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",Universidad de Alcala,"Garcia, NG (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Edificio Ciencias, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain.",noegugar@gmail.com; juliamf@um.es; carlfitz3@gmail.com,"Martinez-Fernandez, Julia/J-9681-2012","Martinez-Fernandez, Julia/0000-0001-8675-947X; Guaita-Garcia, Noelia/0000-0002-2274-1761",,,,,107,6,6,2,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,18,,,,,,7542,10.3390/su12187542,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187542,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OK0VP,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000584371100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus policy instruments which foster participation in International Environmental Agreements (IEA) are in demand. Among the instruments under discussion are trade sanctions. Multi-region optimal growth models are a state of the art tool for integrated assessment, but introducing trade sanctions distorts the competitive equilibrium, making it difficult to compute numerically. We introduce trade and trade sanctions into a model of coalition stability to assess the potential of trade sanctions to support an IEA. Trade is modeled by having all countries produce a generic output good, but adopting national product differentiation (Armington assumption). Coalitions are free to impose tariffs on imports from non-cooperating countries. We solve the model numerically using a refined version of Negishi's [Negishi,T., 1960. Welfare economics and existence of an equilibrium fora competitive economy. Metroeconomica 12, 92-97] basic algorithm. We then apply the model to analyze the influence of tariffs on international cooperation. The model suggests that there is indeed a significant potential to raise participation through trade sanctions, even when goods from different countries are nearly perfect substitutes. Furthermore we investigate the effect of trade sanctions on global welfare, environmental effectiveness, and the credibility of the tariff mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The observed maximum surface pressure response in the North Atlantic occurs 2-4 years after solar maximum, and some model studies have identified that atmosphere-ocean feedbacks explain the multi-year lag. Alternatively, medium-to-high energy electron (MEE) precipitation, which peaks in the declining phase of the solar cycle, has been suggested as a potential cause of this lag. We use a coupled (ocean-atmosphere) climate prediction model and a state-of-the-art MEE forcing to explore the respective roles of irradiance and MEE precipitation on the NAO variability. Three decadal ensemble experiments were conducted over solar cycle 23 in an idealized setting. We found a weak ensemble-mean positive NAO response to the irradiance. The simulated signal-to-noise ratio remained very small, indicating the predominance of internal NAO variability. The lack of multi-annual lag in the NAO response was likely due to lagged solar signals imprinted in temperatures below the oceanic mixed-layer re-emerging equatorward of the oceanic frontal zones, which anchor ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. While there is a clear, yet weak, signature from UV irradiance in the atmosphere and upper ocean over the North Atlantic, enhanced MEE precipitation on the other hand does not lead to any systematic changes in the stratospheric circulation, despite its marked chemical signatures.","[Guttu, Sigmund; Stordal, Frode] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Orsolini, Yvan] Norwegian Inst Air Res, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway; [Orsolini, Yvan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Ottera, Odd Helge; Tartaglione, Nazario] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr AS, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [Ottera, Odd Helge; Tartaglione, Nazario] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Omrani, Nour-Eddine] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Verronen, Pekka T.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Space & Earth Observat Ctr, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Verronen, Pekka T.] Univ Oulu, Sodankyla Geophys Observ, Sodankyla 99600, Finland; [Rodger, Craig J.] Univ Otago, Dept Phys, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Clilverd, Mark A.] British Antarctic Survey UKRI NERC, Cambridge BIQQ 1ZZ, England",University of Oslo; Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Oulu; University of Otago; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey,"Guttu, S (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0315 Oslo, Norway.",sigmund.guttu@geo.uio.no; yvan.orsolini@nilu.no; frode.stordal@geo.uio.no; odot@norceresearch.no; Noureddine.Omrani@uib.no; nazario.tartaglione@gmail.com; pekka.verronen@fmi.fi; craig.rodger@otago.ac.nz; MACL@bas.ac.uk,"Verronen, Pekka T/G-6658-2014; Rodger, Craig J/A-1501-2011; Tartaglione, Nazario/ABQ-7348-2022; Otterå, Odd Helge/AAD-5006-2022; Omrani, Noue-Eddine/GQQ-7245-2022; Verronen, P.

This paper proposes an autonomous desalination system fully powered by solar energy. This system mainly consists of a salt gradient solar pond coupled to an organic Rankine cycle that drives the pumps of a reverse osmosis desalination unit. For each of these three components, a theoretical model is elaborated, and validated with numerical and/or experimental data. Then, each model is combined with a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal design and operating parameters. The optimization tests revealed that the hybrid pressure vessel can produce fresh water at a salinity of 376.6 mg/l with a specific energy consumption of about 2.1 kWh/m(3). A recuperative organic Rankine cycle was optimized to supply the desalination unit, composed of 31 hybrid pressure vessels and 3 pressure exchanger devices, with 0.28 MW of electric power with an exergy efficiency around 54%. In addition, the results predicted that the solar pond land required to run the desalination unit at a daily drinking water production of about 2380.8 m(3) is almost 33.6% smaller in the semi-arid climate compared to the Mediterranean one. The designed desalination plant can supply drinking water over 73.3% of the year, 61.2% of whom without interruption, in semi-arid climate compared to only 50% in the Mediterranean one. The discussion of the results includes some technics suggested to enhance the feasibility of the current plant.","[El Mansouri, Abdelfattah; Hasnaoui, M.; Amahmid, A.; Hasnaoui, Safae] UCA, Phys Dept, LMFE, Fac Sci Semlalia, BP 2390, Marrakech, Morocco",Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech,"Hasnaoui, M (corresponding author), UCA, Phys Dept, LMFE, Fac Sci Semlalia, BP 2390, Marrakech, Morocco.",abdelfattah.elmansouri@edu.uca.ac.ma; hasnaoui@uca.ac.ma; amahmid@uca.ac.ma; safae.hasnaoui@edu.uca.ac.ma,"el mansouri, abdelfattah/GSN-6953-2022","el mansouri, abdelfattah/0000-0003-4097-2827",,,,,51,18,18,0,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

The European policy and legal framework is used to illustrate how this new technology, international electricity market integration, and the distribution of wind and solar natural resources lead to the need for continent-wide internationally coordinated network planning with a view on long-term greenhouse gas reduction. First, the technical and economic aspects of UHV transmission are described, including, e.g., converter configurations and internal and external insulation. Then, UHV transmission is put into the context of other broad current questions of power system development: AC and DC, microgrids, smart grids, power electronics, overhead lines, cables, and gas-insulated lines. The final part discusses the European legal framework for climate protection and for transmission system operator (TSO) cooperation in the new, legally mandated European transmission system operator association ENTSO-E, in particular for joint European grid planning and for R&D. This example shows how UHV technology development can contribute to market integration and economic and environmental goals for continent-wide and internationally coordinated transmission development as one option in international long-term system studies.","[Hammons, Thomas James] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0PZ, Lanark, Scotland; [Lescale, Victor F.] ABB AB HVDC, S-77180 Ludvika, Sweden; [Uecker, Karl] Siemens AG, Power Transmiss Solut HVDC FACTS, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Haeusler, Marcus] Siemens AG, Syst Engn HVDC, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Retzmann, Dietmar] Siemens AG, Tech Mkt HVDC FACTS, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Staschus, Konstantin; Lepy, Sebastien] ENTSO E, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of Glasgow; Siemens AG; Siemens Germany; Siemens AG; Siemens Germany; Siemens AG; Siemens Germany,"Hammons, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0PZ, Lanark, Scotland.",T.Hammons@btinternet.com; victor.lescale@se.abb.com; karl.uecker@siemens.com; marcus.haeusler@siemens.com; dietmar.retzmann@siemens.com; konstantin.staschus@entsoe.eu; Sebastien.lepy@rte-france.com,,"Staschus, Konstantin/0000-0002-5026-6988",,,,,57,86,94,0,45,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9219,,,P IEEE,Proc.

PDSIARTS, a revised self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index, was computed for China over 1982-2016 using satellite leaf-area indices combined with monthly climate data interpolated from 2000 high-density stations. Drought climatology was analysed against climate factors. The results show that temperature has increased at a rate of 0.38 degrees C per decade (p < .001) in China in the past 35 years (1982-2016). However, over the same interval, China and the northern China region became wetter. PDSI(ARTS)increased at a rate of 0.03 yr(-1)(p < .001) across China during 1982-2016. The analogous increase of PDSI(ARTS)in northern China was 0.05 yr(-1)(p < .001). In China, the 5-year interval from 2012 to 2016 was the wettest 5 years in the 35-year interval. This arises from the coupled effects of decreased potential evaporation (E-p) and increased precipitation (P-r). The implication is that temperature increase does not necessarily indicate increased drought. A potential complication is that the 2015/16 El Nino event induced the highestP(r)in southern China for 1982-2016, and northern China still had plentifulP(r)in 2015/16, which further contributed to the wettest 2-years (2015/16) during the past 35 years in the whole of China. This study highlights the joint impacts ofP(r)andE(p)on the dry/wet changes and the possibility of extremely wet events in the warming future.","[Yan, Hao; Guo, An-Hong] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Hao; Shugart, Herman H.] Univ Virginia, Environm Sci Dept, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Wang, Shao-Qiang; Wang, Jun-Bang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shao-Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zai-Chun] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA","China Meteorological Administration; University of Virginia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen; Boston University","Yan, H (corresponding author), Natl Meteorol Ctr, Zhongguancun South St 46, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yanhaon@hotmail.com,"Myneni, Ranga B./AAU-6088-2021; Zhu, Zaichun/I-5374-2014; Zhu, Zaichun/ABD-2040-2021","Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; yan, hao/0000-0002-5287-3298",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571327],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC1502402; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41571327",,59,0,0,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Experimentation during the last two to three decades using a large variety of approaches has provided sufficient information to conclude that enrichment of atmospheric CO2 may have severe impact on terrestrial ecosystems. This impact is mainly due to the changes in the organic C dynamics as a result of the effects of elevated CO2 on the primary source of organic C in soil, i.e., plant photosynthesis. As the majority of life in soil is heterotrophic and dependent on the input of plant-derived organic C, the activity and functioning of soil organisms will greatly be influenced by changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this review, we examine the current state of the art with respect to effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil microbial communities, with a focus on microbial community structure. On the basis of the existing information, we conclude that the main effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil microbiota occur via plant metabolism and root secretion, especially in C3 plants, thereby directly affecting the mycorrhizal, bacterial, and fungal communities in the close vicinity of the root. There is little or no direct effect on the microbial community of the bulk soil. In particular, we have explored the impact of these changes on rhizosphere interactions and ecosystem processes, including food web interactions.","[Drigo, Barbara; Kowalchuk, George A.; van Veen, Johannes A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Microbial Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; [Kowalchuk, George A.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Veen, Johannes A.] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"van Veen, JA (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Microbial Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",b.drigo@nioo.knaw.nl; g.kowalchuk@nioo.knaw.nl; h.vanveen@nioo.knaw.nl,"Kowalchuk, George A/C-4298-2011; Drigo, Barbara/AAJ-9484-2021; van Veen, Johannes A/C-3697-2011; Drigo, Barbara/AAR-9447-2021","Drigo, Barbara/0000-0002-3301-0470; Drigo, Barbara/0000-0002-3301-0470; Kowalchuk, George/0000-0003-3866-0832",,,,,135,174,183,9,191,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The membrane contactor is an emerging and promising membrane technology for PCC as it integrates the benefits of both liquid absorption (high selectivity) and membrane separation (modularity and compactness). This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the research work carried out so far on membrane contactor technology in PCC. It details common aspects of membrane contactors, such as technological advantages, membrane wetting, mass transfer and module design, as well as new advances (e.g., new membranes and absorbents used in absorption processes) and novel applications (e.g., direct CO2 stripping and integrated heat recovery in desorption processes). Moreover, the difference in performance between membrane absorption and conventional absorption is also compared and discussed. Lastly, we discuss the status and progress of membrane contactors in PCC and offer some recommendations for future work.

However, no Paleolithic rock paintings have yet been confirmed in the East Asia mainland, partly due to the lack of suitable dating materials. The rock paintings distributed at more than 70 sites in the Jinsha River valley, Yunnan Province, southwestern China, include the naturalistic outlines of large mammals, which superficially resemble the Magdalenian rock art in Europe. Wanrendong Cave in Tiger Leaping Gorge, has preserved typical Jinsha River rock paintings, associated with some precipitates of secondary carbonates (i.e., speleothem). High precision U-series dating of 13 small speleothems, with a total of 36 subsamples overlying or underlying the pigment layers, revealed that these red paintings were created during the Pleistocene - Holocene transition, representing the oldest absolutely dated rock paintings from China so far. Our results show that at least three painting phases in Wanrendong Cave can be precisely constrained: similar to 13,000-13,580 yr B.P., similar to 10,540-10,830 yr B.P., and similar to 8370-8700 yr B.P. These intervals are substantially earlier than the timing of agriculture in Yunnan Province (similar to 4600 yr BP), indicating that these paintings were created by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. Additionally, these intervals coincide with the Bolling-Allerod and early Holocene warming periods, suggesting a possible link between the rock painting activity and climate changes.","[Wu, Yun; Li, Yinghua] Wuhan Univ, Archaeol Inst Yangtze Civilizat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun; Ji, Xueping] Yunnan Inst Cultural Rel & Archaeol, Kunming 650118, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Yanuo; Jin, Mangu; Shao, Qingfeng] Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Tacon, Paul S.

As one of a growing number of Latin American artists committed to combating the institutionalized forgetfulness'' of human rights violations throughout the hemisphere, Hernandez-Salazar deploys geographically-rich photographic installations to help his society remember its difficult past. The installations, known as Street Angel, are like ghosts haunting the graves of the murdered, fortresses of the powerful, bastions of the complicit. By shedding light on these ghostly angels, this article reveals the important role of photography, as a crucial vehicle of memory, in bearing witness to the unimaginable horrors that consumed much of the twentieth century, as well as that technology's limitations. It also shows how remembrances of those atrocities depend on urban space for their grounding, articulation, and maintenance. Finally, by probing the artistic impulse and political sensibility that created Guatemala City's angels of memory, it makes the case that, in the combustible political climate of post-war Central America, the work of remembering the past is not an antiquarian exercise: the labor of memory is a fundamental component of building a just society.","[Hoelscher, Steven] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Amer Studies, 430 Burdine Hall, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Hoelscher, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Amer Studies, 430 Burdine Hall, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",hoelscher@mail.utexas.edu,,,Embassy of Switzerland in Guatemala,Embassy of Switzerland in Guatemala,"This article would not have been possible without the collaborative support and encouragement of Daniel Hernandez-Salazar and Oscar Ivan Maldonado.

This article engages with indoor climate control in an urbanising environment. It considers urban architecture as a social field characterised by the interaction of diverse actors such as architects, policymakers, investors and residents. Based on ethnographic data from subtropical Chongqing (China) in winter, the broader aim is to outline an urban architectural anthropology that approaches the house from a holistic perspective with regard to its materiality, namely by considering both its structure and interior architecture, all embedded in the larger political and economic context. With regard to thermal comfort, architects often focus on the qualities of the material structure of a building for indoor climate control, while social science approaches tend solely to consider the objects and practices inside those structures. In following a practice-arrangement nexus approach as put forward by Schatzki (2010), I propose to think the two levels as interrelated. Ethnography-based research thus contributes significantly to grasping how people react to buildings and make themselves comfortable in social, socio-material and thermal terms.","[Kobi, Madlen] Univ Svizzera Thailand, Inst Hist & Theory Art & Architecture, Largo Bernasconi 2, Mendrisio, Switzerland",,"Kobi, M (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Thailand, Inst Hist & Theory Art & Architecture, Largo Bernasconi 2, Mendrisio, Switzerland.",madlen.kobi@usi.ch,,"Kobi, Madlen/0000-0001-6644-4083",Swiss National Science Foundation [157397],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"This article is based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2017, which was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant 157397).

The Zuojiang Huashan Rock Art Cultural Landscape in Guangxi is the most important World Heritage for prehistorical culture in southwestern China. However, knowledge about the natural environment and associated historic human-climate interactions during the period of cliff painting creation remains scarce, which has been an obstacle to understanding the process of regional civilization. Here, we report a pollen record from the core distributing region of Huashan cliff paintings to interpret the natural environment and climate changes, and further to discuss how and why ancient people create these giant cliff paintings based on the relationships of human-climate interactions. Pollen results imply an existence of a mixed broad-leaf and conifer forest in the woodland landscape at Huashan region before 1860 cal. yr BP, after which pine forests were more prevalent. During the cliff painting period from 2370 to 2115 cal. yr BP, broad-leaf and conifer trees dominated the tree layer and provided the key source materials for painting. It can be reasonably assumed that people used stake or ladder to climb the cliffs and created the cliff paintings during a humid climate condition from 2560 to 2000 cal. yr BP. Furthermore, the humid climate during 2700 and 2400 cal. yr BP had been interrupted by short-term drought episodes. These turbulent climate episodes probably played the role of disasters and impacted on the human activities, leading to the social-political tensions and the out-break of war. During the Qin and Han Dynasties, social-political changes relieved the pressure from natural climate changes and led to a more stable society, in which the creating of cliff paintings was gradually fading. Our results manifest the necessity to analyze the natural environment and social-political background in combination in this study on ancient human activities.","[Li, Kai; Liao, Mengna; Ni, Jian] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yunfa] Nat Hist Museum Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg, Nanning 530022, Peoples R China","Zhejiang Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Ni, J (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Chen, YF (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg, Nanning 530022, Peoples R China.",nijian@zjnu.edu.cn; chenyunfa@163.com,"Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050; Li, Kai/0000-0002-6197-4082","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0502101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41662002]; Natural History Museum of Guangxi, China; China Scholarship Council","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural History Museum of Guangxi, China; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

It is a long-lived ENSO-like pattern of Pacific climate variability with a period of 10-30 years. The general picture is that the anomalously warm (cool) SSTs in the central North Pacific are always accompanied by the anomalously cool (warm) SSTs along the west coast of America and in the central east tropical Pacific with comparable amplitude. In general, there are two classes of opinions on the origin of this low-frequency climate variability, one thinking that it results from deterministically coupled modes of the Pacific ocean-atmosphere system, and the other, from stochastic atmospheric forcing. The deterministic origin emphasizes that the internal physical processes in an air-sea system can provide a positive feedback mechanism to amplify an initial perturbation, and a negative feedback mechanism to reverse the phase of oscillation. The dynamic evolution of ocean circulation determines the timescale of the oscillation. The stochastic origin, however, emphasizes that because the atmospheric activities can be thought as having no preferred timescale and are associated with an essentially white noise spectrum, the ocean response can manifest a red peak in a certain low frequency range with a decadal to interdecadal timescale. In this paper, the authors try to systematically understand the state of the art of observational, theoretical and numerical studies on the PDO and hope to provide a useful background reference for current research.","Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Sci & Geophys Fluid Dynam, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Yang, HJ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,54,17,29,0,6,CHINA OCEAN PRESS,BEIJING,"INTERNATIONAL DEPT, 8 DA HUI SHI, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

However, in the absence of fundamental and globally recognized approach evaluating wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) energy performance, these policies could be economically wasteful. This paper gives an overview of the literature of WWTP energy-use performance and of the state of the art methods for energy benchmarking. The literature review revealed three main bench marking approaches: normalization, statistical techniques and programming techniques, and advantages and disadvantages were identified for each one. While these methods can be used for comparison, the diagnosis of the energy performance remains an unsolved issue. Besides, a large dataset of WWTP energy consumption data, together with the methods for synthesizing the information, are presented and discussed. It was found that no single key performance indicators (KPIs) used to characterize the energy performance could be used universally. The assessment of a large data sample provided some evidence about the effect of the plant size, dilution factor and flowrate. The technology choice, plant layout and country of location were seen as important elements that contributed to the large variability observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessments of future climate are generally based on the ensemble mean of state-of-the-art climate model projections, which prefigures a gradual warming over Europe for the 21st century. However, a few models project single or multiple O(10) year temperature drops over the North Atlantic due to a collapsing subpolar gyre (SPG) oceanic convection. The occurrence of these decadal-scale cold waves may have strong repercussions over the continent, yet their actual impact is ruled out in a multi-model ensemble mean analysis. Here, we investigate these potential implications for viticulture over Europe by coupling dynamical downscaled EUR-CORDEX temperature projections for the representative concentration pathways (RCP)4.5 scenario from seven different climate models-including CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 exhibiting a SPG convection collapse-with three different phenological models simulating the main developmental stages of the grapevine. The 21st century temperature increase projected by all the models leads to an anticipation of all the developmental stages of the grapevine, shifting the optimal region for a given grapevine variety northward, and making climatic conditions suitable for high-quality wine production in some European regions that are currently not. However, in the CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 model, this long-term warming trend is suddenly interrupted by decadal-scale cold waves, abruptly pushing the suitability pattern back to conditions that are very similar to the present. These findings are crucial for winemakers in the evaluation of proper strategies to face climate change, and, overall, provide additional information for long-term plans of adaptation, which, so far, are mainly oriented towards the possibility of continuous warming conditions.","[Sgubin, Giovanni; Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, EPOC, F-33615 Pessac, France; [de Cortazar-Atauri, Inaki Garcia] INRA, Agroclim US1116, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Ollat, Nathalie; van Leeuwen, Cornelis] Univ Bordeaux, EGFV, Bordeaux Sci Agro, INRA,ISVV, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Sgubin, G (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, EPOC, F-33615 Pessac, France.",giovanni.sgubin@u-bordeaux.fr,"Swingedouw, Didier/D-1408-2010; de Cortazar-Atauri, Iñaki Garcia/U-4007-2019; Swingedouw, Didier/M-5471-2019","Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; de Cortazar-Atauri, Iñaki Garcia/0000-0001-6941-9844; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850",French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-45],French National Research Agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This research was funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), grant number ANR-10-LABX-45.",,69,10,10,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JUL,2019,7,,,,,,397,10.3390/agronomy9070397,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy9070397,,,22,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,IN4QQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000478660500039,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present work is part of an ongoing research based on the hypothesis that the inevitable deleterious effects of the RH natural cycle may be prevented or minimized if a deformation threshold is assigned to each monitored endangered object prior to exposure to structural damage. In this paper the characterization of the behavior of a softwood sample (1.0 cm thick) submitted to RH abrupt cycles has been performed, in terms of mass and rate of displacement of the surface. The exemplary study is based on the concept of recording the RH impact directly from the material surface, allowing us to identify diversity in reaction with time, which in turn could determine the onset of structural changes prior to irreversible damage. The RH impact is measured as surface deformation from interference fringes, using a custom-made real time holography system with interferometric precision termed digital holographic speckle-pattern interferometry (DHSPI). The main observations presented here are a hysteresis in the dynamic sorption isotherm and a greater rate of displacement during the drying. A long-term experiment was performed to identify signs of ageing of the sample. The evolution of the mass and the rate of displacement stayed similar, an offset with an interesting behavior was observed and highlights ageing of wood. In order to produce a future preventive model for distinct art objects it is necessary to determine a deformation threshold for each material. In this context the study was planned to continue with organic samples bearing variable density and thickness under longer-term RH cycles and monitoring until the samples show visible signs of irreversible damage.","[Tornari, Vivi; Andrianakis, Michalis; Kosma, Kyriaki] IESL, FORTH, 100 N Plastira Str, Iraklion 70013, Crete, Greece; [Basset, Thomas] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon I, Univ Lyon, Phys Dept, Ecole Normale Super Lyon ENS, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France; [Kosma, Kyriaki] Hellen Mediterranean Univ, Inst Plasma Phys & Lasers, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece",Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Hellenic Mediterranean University,"Tornari, V (corresponding author), IESL, FORTH, 100 N Plastira Str, Iraklion 70013, Crete, Greece.",vivitor@iesl.forth.gr,,"Tornari, Vivi/0000-0001-7198-9504; Andrianakis, Michalis/0000-0002-2572-342X",ENS,ENS,This research was funded by ENS internship funding to student Thomas Basset.,,37,4,4,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2313-433X,,,J IMAGING,J.

Our points of departure are the need in scenario practice to embrace uncertainty, discomfort and knowledge gaps, and the connected need to capture and make productive fundamental plurality among understandings of the future. To help respond to these needs, we introduce what Nelson Goodman calls worldmaking. It holds that there is no singular, objective world (or real reality), and instead that worlds are multiple, constructed through creative processes instead of given, and always in the process of becoming. We then explore how worldmaking can operationalise discordant pluralism in scenario practice by allowing participants to approach not only the future but also the present in a constructivist and pluralistic fashion; and by extending pluralism to ontological domains. Building on this, we investigate how scenario worldmaking could lead to more imaginative scenarios: worldmaking is framed as a fully creative process which gives participants ontological agency, and it helps make contrasts, tensions and complementarities between worlds productive. We go on to propose questions that can be used to operationalize scenario worldmaking, and conclude with the expected potential and limitations the approach, as well as suggestions for practical experimentation.

We employ the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM)-a fully-coupled forecasting system-to assimilate SST observations with the ensemble Kalman filter. Predictions of NorCPM are compared to predictions from the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) project. The global prediction skill of NorCPM at 6- and 12-month lead times is higher than the averaged skill of the NMME. A new metric is introduced for ranking model skill. According to the metric, NorCPM is one of the most skilful systems among the NMME in predicting SST in most regions. Confronting the skill to a large historical ensemble without assimilation, shows that the skill is largely derived from the initialisation rather than from the external forcing. NorCPM achieves good skill in predicting El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) up to 12 months ahead and achieves skill over land via teleconnections. However, NorCPM has a more pronounced reduction in skill in May than the NMME systems. An analysis of ENSO dynamics indicates that the skill reduction is mainly caused by model deficiencies in representing the thermocline feedback in February and March. We also show that NorCPM has skill in predicting sea ice extent at the Arctic entrance adjacent to the north Atlantic; this skill is highly related to the initialisation of upper ocean heat content.","[Wang, Yiguo; Counillon, Francois; Keenlyside, Noel; Kimmritz, Madlen; Gao, Yongqi] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Keenlyside, Noel; Svendsen, Lea] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Keenlyside, Noel; Svendsen, Lea] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Gleixner, Stephanie] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Dai, Panxi] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yongqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Wang, YG (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway.",yiguo.wang@nersc.no,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; gao, yongqi/N-9347-2014","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Svendsen, Lea/0000-0002-0181-3332; Dai, Panxi/0000-0002-4614-3045; Wang, Yiguo/0000-0001-9544-8382; Counillon, Francois/0000-0002-6412-3806","Center for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Center; Norwegian Research Council [229774/E10, 270733]; NordForsk under the Nordic Centre of Excellence (ARCPATH) [76654]; Trond Mohn Foundation [BFS2018TMT01]; ERC [648982]; Norwegian Program for supercomputer [NOTUR2, NN9039K, NN9385K, NORSTORE, NS9039K, NS9207K]",Center for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Center; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); NordForsk under the Nordic Centre of Excellence (ARCPATH); Trond Mohn Foundation; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Norwegian Program for supercomputer,"This study was co-funded by the Center for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Center, the Norwegian Research Council under the EPOCASA (229774/E10) and SFE (270733) research projects, the NordForsk under the Nordic Centre of Excellence (ARCPATH, 76654), and the Trond Mohn Foundation under the project number BFS2018TMT01.

However, errors in a given model in the high-frequency domain, primarily due to unresolved gravity features, can result in errors in the estimated along-track freeboard. These errors are exacerbated in areas with a sparse lead distribution in consolidated ice pack conditions. Additionally model errors can impact ocean geostrophic currents, derived from satellite altimeter data, while remaining biases in these models may impact longer-term, multisensor oceanographic time series of sea level change in the Arctic. This study focuses on an assessment of five state-of-the-art Arctic MSS models (UCL13/04 and DTU15/13/10) and a commonly used GGM (EGM2008). We describe errors due to unresolved gravity features, intersatellite biases, and remaining satellite orbit errors, and their impact on the derivation of sea ice freeboard. The latest MSS models, incorporating CryoSat-2 sea surface height measurements, show improved definition of gravity features, such as the Gakkel Ridge. The standard deviation between models ranges 0.03-0.25 m. The impact of remaining MSS/GGM errors on freeboard retrieval can reach several decimeters in parts of the Arctic. While the maximum observed freeboard difference found in the central Arctic was 0.59 m (UCL13 MSS minus EGM2008 GGM), the standard deviation in freeboard differences is 0.03-0.06 m.","[Skourup, Henriette; Andersen, Ole Baltazar] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, Lyngby, Denmark; [Farrell, Sinead Louise] NOAA, Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, College Pk, MD USA; [Farrell, Sinead Louise] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hendricks, Stefan; Ricker, Robert; Haas, Christian] Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Armitage, Thomas W.

Hence issues of quality assessment are important, particularly in the face of the traditionalism of university teaching and examining, but in practice quality assessment has had little, if any, effect on this traditionalism. Instead it has led to a shift from unjustified total trust to equally unjustified total lack of trust and a corresponding shift from collegial to top down management. The latter is now so firmly entrenched in universities that the first step towards the general introduction of a component of creativity into university curricula (isolated examples of creativity can readily be found) may well require an academic revolt. There have been aspects of creativity in the most traditional curricula - even in the sciences - for a long time, but really hopeful signs pointing to the introduction of aspects of creativity into whole curricula are in: The move from teacher-centred to student-centred learning The expression of this move in the form of problem-based and enquiry-based curricula A move from positivist to interpretivist assessment and, in particular, assessment in general from unseen papers to portfolios","[Elton, Lewis] Univ Manchester, Ctr Excellence Enquiry Based Learning, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Elton, L (corresponding author), 3 Great Quarry, Guildford GU1 3XN, Surrey, England.",l.elton@pcps.ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1474-273X,2040-0896,,ART DES COMMUN HIGH,Art Des.

Interestingly, the potential for energy optimization and energy savings is high but requires detailed models capable of considering various system configurations and control systems. This paper provides an open-source modeling framework capable of simulating and optimizing the design and the control of both the greenhouse and the generation systems covering all energy needs. The proposed model is composed of sub-models from different scientific fields: a greenhouse climate model, a crop yield model, a large number of energy generation and storage units models and different rule-based control strategies. The association of such state-of-the-art models in a single framework provides a powerful tool for optimization purposes and allows the definition of completely customized systems by means of an object-oriented interface. In this work, various control strategies are defined and simulated, thus demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed model. Results indicate that, by performing minor changes to the control of the thermal screen, heating consumption can be reduced by 3% without any loss in crop yield. The control of heat-generation units also has a significant impact on the operational costs, which vary by up to 17% when self-consumption levels are accounted for in the control strategy.","[Altes-Buch, Queralt; Quoilin, Sylvain; Lemort, Vincent] Univ Liege, Fac Appl Sci, Energy Syst Res Unit, Allee Decouverte 17, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege,"Altes-Buch, Q (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Fac Appl Sci, Energy Syst Res Unit, Allee Decouverte 17, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",qaltes@uliege.be,,"Quoilin, Sylvain/0000-0002-2064-209X",Walloon Region of Belgium [1510610],Walloon Region of Belgium,The authors would like to thank the Walloon Region of Belgium for funding this research in the context of the EcoSystemePass project (convention 1510610).,,53,1,1,4,12,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1996-3599,1996-8744,,BUILD SIMUL-CHINA,Build.

Reduced-impact logging for climate (RIL-C) is proposed as a way to maintain timber production while minimizing forest damage. Here we synthesize data from 61 coordinated field-based surveys of logging impacts in seven countries across the tropics. We estimate that tropical selective logging emitted 834 Tg CO2 in 2015, 6% of total tropical greenhouse gas emissions. Felling, hauling, and skidding caused 59%, 31%, and 10% of these emissions, respectively. We suggest that RIL-C incentive programs consider a feasible target carbon impact factor of 2.3 Mg emitted per Mg of timber extracted. Operational modifications are needed to achieve this target, such as reduced wood waste, narrower haul roads, and lower impact skidding equipment. Full implementation would reduce logging emissions by 44% (366 Tg CO2 year(-1)) and deliver 4% of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement from tropical countries, while maintaining timber supplies.","[Ellis, Peter W.; Gopalakrishna, Trisha; Griscom, Bronson W.] Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Ave,Suite 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Goodman, Rosa C.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Putz, Francis E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118526, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Roopsind, Anand] Boise State Univ, Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Umunay, Peter M.; Gregoire, Timothy G.] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 360 Prospect, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Zalman, Joey] Fdn Forest Management & Prod Control, Martin Luther Kingweg 283, Paramaribo, Suriname; [Ellis, Edward A.] Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Invest Trop, Col Ctr CP, Morelos 44, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Moh, Karen] World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Nature Conservancy; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Idaho; Boise State University; Yale University; Universidad Veracruzana; World Wildlife Fund,"Ellis, PW (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Ave,Suite 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.",pellis@tnc.org,"Umunay, Peter/AAS-4870-2020","Ellis, Edward A./0000-0001-8972-4846",Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; International Paper,Doris Duke Charitable Foundation(Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF)); International Paper,"This work was supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and International Paper.

Floating offshore wind turbines, which allow harnessing the large untapped wind resources in deep waters, are highly complex and coupled systems. Subsystem-level optimisations result in suboptimal designs, implying that an integrated design approach is important. Literature saw a few attempts on multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating wind turbines, with varying results, proving the need for an efficient, and sufficiently accurate, integrated approach. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art approaches to multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating support structures. The choice of the optimisation framework architecture, support platform design variables, constraints and objective functions are investigated. The techno-economic analysis models are closely examined, focusing on the approaches to achieving the optimum accuracy-efficiency balance. It is shown that the representation of the fully coupled system within the optimisation framework requires the introduction of a more complex multidisciplinary analysis workflow. Methods to increase the efficiency of such frameworks are indicated. Non-conventional support structure configurations can be conceived through the application of more advanced parametrisation schemes, which is feasible together with design space size reduction techniques. The set of design criteria should be extended by operation and maintenance cost, and power production metrics. The main technical limitations of the frameworks adopted so far include the inability to accurately analyse a diverse range of support structure topologies in multiple design load cases within a common framework. The cost approximation models should be extended by the chosen aspects of pre-operational phases, to better explore the benefits of the floating platforms.","[Patryniak, Katarzyna; Collu, Maurizio] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, Montrose St, Glasgow City G4 0LZ, Scotland; [Coraddu, Andrea] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech, Maritime & Mat Engn, Mekelweg, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",University of Strathclyde; Delft University of Technology,"Patryniak, K (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, Montrose St, Glasgow City G4 0LZ, Scotland.",katarzyna.patryniak@strath.ac.uk; maurizio.collu@strath.ac.uk; a.coraddu@tudelft.nl,"Coraddu, Andrea/Q-2690-2018","Coraddu, Andrea/0000-0001-8891-4963; Collu, Maurizio/0000-0001-7692-4988; Patryniak, Katarzyna/0000-0002-5096-4401","University of Strathclyde REA, United Kingdom","University of Strathclyde REA, United Kingdom","This work was supported by the University of Strathclyde REA 2022, United Kingdom.

In their claims, these antiliberal regimes progressively adopted modernist aesthetics as the privileged paradigm for the modernization of the public sphere. However, it was not simply a totalitarian, and therefore largely political, modernity, but also an attempt to find an aesthetic dimension, that of realism, which could document the cultural and political climate of the day. By analysing some significant aesthetic debates unfolding in literary journals and by looking at Moravia's Gli indifferenti, in this article we shall discuss the new theorization of the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity and the construction of the new man's urban reality as key steps towards the creation of the new Italian novel within the fascist system of the arts.","[Billiani, Francesca] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Billiani, F (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,72,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0075-1634,1748-6181,,ITAL STUD,Ital.

This shift capitalizes on local expertise and knowledge, empowering communities to take ownership of response strategies, with an increased focus on building resilience to nexus shocks. This comes at a time when the ability of local authorities to lead responses to nexus shocks is decreasing due to lack of capacity, funding and a statutory requirement to better respond to the impacts of climate change. We examine local resilience to nexus shocks and climate impacts as a complex process of collaboration, communication, adaptation, learning from past events and preparing for future shocks. Drawing on examples of resilience to extreme weather events in the UK, this review paper assesses: (1) local responses to nexus shocks in the UK; (2) how and what evidence is used to inform decision-making in response to nexus shocks; and (3) how stakeholders increase local resilience to nexus shocks when faced with gaps in knowledge.

The spatio-temporal data, whether captured through remote sensors (global earth observations), ground and ocean sensors (e.g., soil moisture sensors, buoys), social media and hand-held, traffic-related sensors and cameras, medical imaging (e.g., MRI), or large scale simulations (e.g., climate) have always been big. A common thread among all these big collections of datasets is that they are spatial and temporal. Processing and analyzing these datasets requires high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures. Various agencies, scientific communities and increasingly the society at large rely on spatial data management, analysis, and spatial data mining to gain insights and produce actionable plans. Therefore, an ecosystem of integrated and reliable software infrastructure is required for spatial temporal big data management and analysis that will serve as crucial tools for solving a wide set of research problems from different scientific and engineering areas and to empower users with next-generation tools. This vision requires a multidisciplinary effort to significantly advance domain research and have a broad impact on the society. The areas of research discussed in this paper include (i) spatial data mining, (ii) data analytics over remote sensing data, (iii) processing medical images, (iv) spatial econometrics analyses, (v) Map-Reduce based systems for spatial computation and visualization, (vi) CyberGIS systems, and (vii) foundational parallel algorithms and data structures for polygonal datasets, and why HPC infrastructures, including harnessing graphics accelerators, are needed for time-critical applications.","[Prasad, Sushil K.; Aghajarian, Danial; McDermott, Michael; Shah, Dhara] Georgia State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Mokbel, Mohamed] Univ Minnesota, Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Puri, Satish] Marquette Univ, Math Stat & Comp Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Rey, Sergio J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Spatial Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Shekhar, Shashi; Xe, Yiqun] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Vatsavai, Ranga Raju] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Wang, Fusheng; Liang, Yanhui; Vo, Hoang] SUNY Stony Brook, Biomed Informat Dept, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Wang, Shaowen] Univ Illinois, Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Marquette University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Prasad, SK (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",sprasad@gsu.edu; mokbel@umn.edu; satish.puri@marquette.edu; sergio.rey@ucr.edu; shekhar@cs.umn.edu; rvatsavai@ncsu.edu; fusheng.wang@stonybrook.edu; shaowen@illinois.edu,"Puri, Satish/ABH-9619-2020; McDermott, Michael Francis/GZM-5330-2022; Mokbel, Mohamed/AAX-6146-2021","Wang, Fusheng/0000-0002-9369-9361; Mokbel, Mohamed/0000-0002-6686-1757; Puri, Satish/0000-0003-1180-500X; Prasad, Sushil/0000-0002-2028-0703; Vatsavai, Ranga Raju/0000-0002-7083-0267","NSF [1205650, 1421935, ACI 1443054, IIS 1350885, IIS-1320580]; USDOD grant [HM0210-13-1-0005]; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1541063] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDOD grant; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),Prasad's group research is partially supported by NSF grant 1205650.

Biases concerning the AW layer are commonly related to insufficient resolution and excessive mixing in the ocean component as well as unrealistic Atlantic-Arctic Ocean exchange. Based on sensitivity experiments with FESOM1.4, the ocean-sea-ice component of the global climate model AWI-CM1, we show that even if all impediments for simulating AW realistically are addressed in the ocean model, new biases in the AW layer develop after coupling to an atmosphere model. By replacing the wind forcing over the Arctic with winds from a coupled simulation we show that a common bias in the atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP) gradient and its associated wind bias lead to differences in surface stress and Ekman transport. Fresh surface water gets redistributed leading to changes in halosteric height distribution. Those changes lead to strengthening of the anticyclonic surface circulation in the Canadian Basin, so that the deep counterflow carrying warm AW gets reversed and a warm bias in the Canadian Basin develops. The SLP and anticyclonic wind bias in the Nordic Seas weaken the cyclonic circulation leading to reduced AW transport into the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait but increased AW transport through the Barents Sea Opening. These effects together lead to a cold bias in the Eurasian Basin. An underestimation of sea ice concentration can significantly amplify the induced ocean biases.","[Hinrichs, C.; Wang, Q.; Koldunov, N.; Semmler, T.; Sidorenko, D.; Jung, T.] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Wang, Q.] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Mu, L.] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology","Hinrichs, C (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.",Claudia.Hinrichs@awi.de,"Jung, Thomas/J-5239-2012; Semmler, Tido/B-7666-2017","Jung, Thomas/0000-0002-2651-1293; Semmler, Tido/0000-0002-2254-4901; Mu, Longjiang/0000-0001-5668-8025; Wang, Qiang/0000-0002-2704-5394; Sidorenko, Dmitry/0000-0001-8579-6068",European Union [727862]; Helmholtz Association; Projekt DEAL,European Union(European Commission); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Projekt DEAL,"C.

Of 16 surveyed cases in Dalian, 73% adopted a high-performance building envelope system. Energy-saving technologies were favored and demonstrated worthwhile economic benefits. In 80% of the cases high-performance green materials had been used. Resource-saving technologies also were widely adopted. In addition to analyzing all the data collected, the study under-took an in-depth analysis of one building. A representative three-star green public building in Dalian, China, was chosen as a case study for analyzing the energy consumption and operating performance. The study found that energy use intensity of the case-study building is 68.02 kW-hours per square meter per year(kWh/(m2 center dot a)). It saves 44.14 kWh/m2 center dot a compared with a conventional building in the same climate, thanks to its energy efficiency systems and integration of renewable energy. The water consumption of the building when operating was 0.41 cubic meter per square meter(m3/m2) per year, which is even lower than the design value. The case-study building also demonstrated good indoor environmental quality throughout different seasons. Finally, practical methods and suggestions were derived from evaluating and discussing effective technologies in the 16 buildings surveyed. The research led to recommendations for developing green buildings in cold and coastal climates. It also provides a substantial guidance for the energy-saving design of green buildings and the application of appropriate technologies in cold coastal cities.","[Su, Yuan; Wang, Linwei] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Su, Yuan; Feng, Wei; Zhou, Nan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94530 USA; [Wang, Luyuan] Foshan City Planning & Surveying Informat Gen Ins, Foshan, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Su, Y (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",suyuan@dlut.edu.cn,"Su, Yuan/AHE-5443-2022; Feng, Wei/AAX-7062-2020","Su, Yuan/0000-0001-9958-9107; Feng, Wei/0000-0003-3702-5554",National Key RD Program [2016FYC0700100]; Dalian Highlevel Talent Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project [2017RQ107]; China Scholarship Council [201906065035]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Energy Foundation,National Key RD Program; Dalian Highlevel Talent Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Energy Foundation,"This work is supported by National Key R&D Program (2016FYC0700100) , Dalian Highlevel Talent Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project (2017RQ107) and China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906065035) for the financial assistance provided to support this research.

Retrieval of optically effective ACRI from accurately calculated scattering and absorption properties of an internal-mixed aerosol model with BC and dust coated with sulfate, roughly representing ambient aged multicomponent BC particles, are performed. The sensitivities of retrieved optically effective ACRI to particle size distribution and composition ratio are explored, and the popular volume weighted average (VWA) method and Bruggeman effective medium (BEM) theory are also considered for comparison. The optically effective ACRIs depicts dramatic variation for monodisperse size parameter larger than pi, as opposed to almost a constant for size parameter less than pi, whereas the VWA and BEM can hardly provide acceptable effective ACRIs for coarse BC composite particles. The retrieved optically effective ACRI are sensitive to both size distribution and composition ratio, and becomes more sensitive to particle size distribution with aerosols containing more BC content. As BC volume content reaches similar to 4%, the VWA overestimates the imaginary part of effective ACRI with significant bias when compared with the optically effective ACRI, indicating overestimated aerosol absorption in most atmospheric environments in aerosol-climate models employing the VWA. We suggest that the optically effective ACRI, rather than the ACRI given by the VWA, should be applied to account for coarse BC-containing particles in the state-of-the-art aerosol-climate models.","[Zhang, Xiaolin; Mao, Mao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, ESMC,Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, China Meteorol Adm,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecas, Minist Educ KLME,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Key La, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaolin; Chen, Hongbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Middle Atmosphere & Global Environm Obser, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaolin; Mao, Mao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaolin] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Satellite Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration","Mao, M (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, ESMC,Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, China Meteorol Adm,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecas, Minist Educ KLME,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Key La, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",mmao@nuist.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41505127, 21406189]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150901]; Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education [KLME201810]; Key Laboratory of Middle Atmosphere and Global Environment Observation, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences [LAGEO-2019-04]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2015r002, 2014r011]; Key Lab of Photovoltaic and Energy Conservation Materials, Chinese Academy of Sciences [PECL2019KF006]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education; Key Laboratory of Middle Atmosphere and Global Environment Observation, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST; Key Lab of Photovoltaic and Energy Conservation Materials, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Nos. 41505127, 21406189), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20150901), and Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education (No. KLME201810).

The simulation of the pool of inhibited cloudiness (hereafter referred to as PIC) and associated cloud variability have been analysed in the historical run of 26 models which participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and it is shown that the current state of the art general circulation models (GCMs) still have difficulties in properly simulating the PIC. The pool covers an area greater than 1 million km(2) between 3 degrees-13 degrees N and 77 degrees-90 degrees E over the southwest Bay of Bengal (BoB); persisting throughout the ASM and interestingly it is surrounded by the deep convective region. The majority of the models could not simulate cloud variability over the ASM. The performance of National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) version 2.0, which is being used for operational monsoon prediction over the Indian region, is also tested to evaluate its fidelity in capturing PIC. The moist convective process in the default CFSv2 is found to be one of the major sources of uncertainty in its monsoon prediction. In this study, evaluation of the default CFSv2 (CTRL) and suites of modified CFSv2 have been carried out. The default version of CFSv2 has the simplified Arakawa Schubert (SAS) as convection scheme and Zhao and Carr (ZC) as microphysics. In another modification, the SAS is changed to revised simplified Arakawa Schubert (RSAS) keeping the microphysics unchanged. Further, a more physically based cloud scheme (WRF Single Moment 6-class microphysics-WSM6) is used with SAS and RSAS for comparison of simulation of PIC. Among the CMIP5 models, ACESS-1-0, GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES are able to represent the PIC reasonably well. CFSCR has shown an improved fidelity in comparison to the CTRL, CTRL-WSM and RSAS and other CMIP5 models. The impact of cloud microphysics in CTRL-WSM and CFSCR appears to play an important role in the simulation of the PIC.","[Roy, Kumar; Mukhopadhyay, Parthasarathi; Murali Krishna, Ravuri Phani; Ganai, Malay; Mahakur, Mata] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Parameterizat & Anal Grp, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Narayan Rao, Thota; Nair, Anish K.

In state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models (CCMs), RW effects are well resolved while the majority of GW effects have to be parameterized. Here, we analyze orographic GW (OGW) interaction with resolved dynamics in a comprehensive CCM on daily time scales. For this, we apply a recently developed method of strong OGW drag event composites for three pronounced northern hemisphere OGW hotspots. We show that strong OGW drag events are associated with anomalous resolved wave propagation in the stratosphere. Causal links are inferred from previously published work and are supported by the anomalies in zonal circulation and wave activity tendencies. The nature of these anomalies varies depending on the hotspot region, which underlines the parameterized OGW-resolved dynamics interaction being a two-way process. Plain Language Summary The majority of atmospheric waves are generated near the surface and propagate subsequently upward in the atmosphere. This includes Rossby waves that are resolved in climate models and small-scale gravity waves (GWs) that commonly have to be parameterized. In the middle atmosphere, the waves eventually break, thereby dissipating their momentum and energy, which influences atmospheric dynamics. The interaction of GWs with the large-scale circulation is to date poorly understood. In this study, we associate regionally enhanced GW drag with anomalies in resolved wave propagation in the stratosphere in a comprehensive chemistry-climate model on the time scale of days. For this, we identify strong orographic GW (OGW) events for the three most pronounced northern hemisphere OGW hotspots and construct composites of anomalies of selected variables with respect to the climatological mean. We find that the response of the resolved wavefield strongly depends on the hotspot region, leading to diverse consequences on the large-scale stratospheric circulation. Strong OGW events in the hotspots are in turn determined by the resolved fields from the surface to the level of OGW dissipation, which highlights the two-way coupling between OGWs and resolved flow.","[Sacha, P.; Eichinger, R.; Pisoft, P.] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Atmospher Phys, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sacha, P.; Rieder, H.

This study evaluates the performance of seven state-of-the-art GCMs in simulating the summer monsoon rainfall on a seasonal scale over the period of 1982-2008 using the GCM reforecasts. The rainfall simulated by the models is compared with the IMD observed rainfall dataset at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. Preliminary analysis of spatial pattern and statistics shows that the models IITM-CFSv2, NCEP-CFSv2 and ECMWF are some of the prominent models that capture the seasonal rainfall pattern and possess good skill. ECMWF performs very well in simulating the rainfall pattern as well as the rainfall intensities. Comprehensive statistical analysis such as standard deviation ratio and skill scores concludes that the IITM-CFSv2 produces the rainfall pattern as well as the variability of the summer monsoon better than its counterparts. The multi-model simple mean also tends to improve with the addition of IITM-CFSv2. Though the rainfall trend and variance simulated by IITM-CFSv2 is quite in agreement with the observed, there lies a significant dry bias over the north-west India. The mean simulated rainfall is quite less with the CFSv2 models. Though the IITM-CFSv2 simulates lesser rainfall at all the four-lead times, it is quite capable in capturing the rainfall variability. The models ECMWF and GFDLA04 are well performers in terms of mean rainfall estimates whereas the models CFSv2 is better in terms of reproducing the rainfall variability.","[Mohanty, M. R.; Maurya, R.

However, many new papers published in this century reveal that new research gaps are found and more works were carried out to address the limitations of the old techniques. The main objective of this review is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the insight-based techniques developed in the 21st century, particularly those developed for single impurity network of the fixed flow rate problems. Comparisons were also made between these recent techniques and those developed for the fixed load problems in the past Century. Various How rate targeting techniques developed for water reuse/recycle, regeneration, and wastewater treatment are reviewed in detail, along with the network design techniques that achieve the established targets.

It suggests that vulnerability assessments based on a livelihood concept that includes climate information and key socio-economic variables can overcome the narrow focus of common one-dimensional vulnerability studies. Both current and future climatic risks can be managed better if there is appropriate policy and institutional support together with technological interventions to address the complexities of multiple risks that agriculture has to face. This would require effective partnerships among agencies dealing with meteorological and hydrological services, agricultural research, land degradation and food security issues.

CHP and tri-generation systems offer high energy conversion efficiency and hence the potential to reduce fuel costs and CO2 emissions. This article serves to provide a state-of-the-art review of fuel cell technology operating in the domestic built environment in CHP and tri-generation system applications. The review aims to carry out an assessment of the following topics: (1) the operational advantages fuel cells offer in CHP and tri-generation system configurations, specifically, compared to conventional combustion-based technologies such as Stirling engines, (2) how decarbonisation, running cost and energy security in the domestic built environment may be addressed through the use of fuel cell technology, and (3) what has been done to date and what needs to be done in the future. The article commences with a review of fuel cell technology, then moves on to examine fuel cell CHP systems operating in the domestic built environment, and finally explores fuel cell tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications. The article concludes with an assessment of the present development of, and future challenges for, domestic fuel cells operating in CHP and trigeneration systems. As fuel cells are an emergent technology the article draws on a breadth of literature, data and experience, mostly from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, America and Australia. Fuel cells are a technology of the future here today, providing a change in the way heat and power are supplied to end users. Fuel cells operating in CHP and tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications could finally provide the means by which energy generation can transfer from centralised to decentralised locales in a sustainable and effective manner.

Here, we present an assessment from the CanSISE Network on trends in the historical record of snow cover (fraction, water equivalent) and sea ice (area, concentration, type, and thickness) across Canada. We also assess projected changes in snow cover and sea ice likely to occur by mid-century, as simulated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) suite of Earth system models. The historical datasets show that the fraction of Canadian land and marine areas covered by snow and ice is decreasing over time, with seasonal and regional variability in the trends consistent with regional differences in surface temperature trends. In particular, summer sea ice cover has decreased significantly across nearly all Canadian marine regions, and the rate of multi-year ice loss in the Beaufort Sea and Canadian Arctic Archipelago has nearly doubled over the last 8 years. The multi-model consensus over the 2020-2050 period shows reductions in fall and spring snow cover fraction and sea ice concentration of 5-10% per decade (or 15-30% in total), with similar reductions in winter sea ice concentration in both Hudson Bay and eastern Canadian waters. Peak pre-melt terrestrial snow water equivalent reductions of up to 10% per decade (30% in total) are projected across southern Canada.","[Mudryk, Lawrence R.; Derksen, Chris; Howell, Stephen; Laliberte, Fred] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Thackeray, Chad] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Sospedra-Alfonso, Reinel] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Vionnet, Vincent] Ctr Etud Neige, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grenoble, France; [Kushner, Paul J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Brown, Ross] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Waterloo; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Toronto; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Mudryk, LR (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada.",lawrence.mudryk@canada.ca,"Vionnet, Vincent/AFZ-4794-2022; Kushner, Paul J/H-6716-2016; Thackeray, Chad/ABD-8474-2021; Derksen, Chris/S-9828-2017; Vionnet, Vincent/F-5446-2018","Vionnet, Vincent/0000-0002-9142-9739; Kushner, Paul J/0000-0002-6404-4518; Thackeray, Chad/0000-0002-3757-9015; Derksen, Chris/0000-0001-6821-5479; Vionnet, Vincent/0000-0002-9142-9739; Laliberte, Frederic/0000-0001-9668-1418; Brown, Ross/0000-0001-7196-2686; Sospedra-Alfonso, Reinel/0000-0002-4472-5607",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Climate Change and Atmospheric Research Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium; University of Toronto,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Climate Change and Atmospheric Research Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Environment and Climate Change Canada; Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium; University of Toronto(University of Toronto),"This work represents Deliverable 2 of the CanSISE Network.

J,"Hindelang, L",,,,"Hindelang, Laura",,,"Oil media: Changing portraits of petroleum in visual culture between the US, Kuwait, and Switzerland",CENTAURUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,art history; fossil energy; oil media; petroleum; postage stamps; visual culture,,"This article examines three cases of mid-20th-century oil media-oil-related imagery, iconographies, and media-in visual culture: a series of popular science books entitled The Story of Oil published in the US, an oil-themed set of Kuwaiti postage stamps (1959), and an art exhibition in Zurich (1956) titled Welt des Erdols: Junge Maler sehen eine Industrie (World of Petroleum: Young Artists See an Industry). While depicting crude oil in its natural habitat was a common photographic theme in the early 20th-century United States, the material discussed shows that, by the mid-20th century, crude oil no longer had the same visual presence. The iconography of oil in the three case studies came to rely increasingly on images of oil infrastructure and on context-specific depictions of living within petro-modernity or petro-culture, meaning lifestyles fueled by cheap fossil energy. However, it is not just the changes in visual representations of petroleum that matter; any debate about the visibility and invisibility of petroleum has to take into account the very media through which petroleum has become visually communicated-that is, the precise forms of oil's mediatization. The aesthetic negotiation of petroleum through media-based visual representations has been crucial for the dematerialization of fossil matter in its conversion to fossil energy, as well as the decoupling of sites of extraction from sites of production and consumption in the public imagination. As petro-culture has morphed into national or even global culture (rather than representing just one possible energy source among many), oil media has paved the way for our intimate relationship with fossil energy-dependent lifestyles, which is one of the biggest drivers of climate change.","[Hindelang, Laura] Univ Bern, Inst Art Hist, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Hindelang, L (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Art Hist, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",laura.hindelang@ikg.unibe.ch,,"Hindelang, Laura/0000-0002-9195-9190",,,,,60,2,2,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-8994,1600-0498,,CENTAURUS,Centaurus,NOV,2021,4,,SI,,675,694,,10.1111/1600-0498.12418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1600-0498.12418,,21-Nov,20,History & Philosophy Of Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),History & Philosophy of Science,XV0MC,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000717319600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is also the case for Jan and Hubert Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece, which is located in one of the chapels of the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium. Years of poor conservation conditions have led to an urgent conservation treatment in 2010 and a conservation and restoration campaign that started in 2012 and will continue through 2019. In order to contribute to a better understanding of the state of preservation of the altarpiece and the display conditions and to assess damage risks related to the current location, this paper presents the results of a two-year monitoring campaign of the climate conditions in the glass cage in the Saint Bavo Cathedral in which the altarpiece is displayed. Based on the results of the first year, measures were taken to improve the indoor climate, including the installation of a local heating and humidification system. These new conditions were monitored during the second year of the measurement campaign and are representative for the display conditions today. The results of the second year showed that exposure to high humidity's was effectively reduced but conditions with large short-term humidity variations still occurred. However, given a correct management of the new heating and humidification systems, risks for mechanical damage may be largely eliminated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A rigorous comparison of CRI-Strat 2 with the earlier version, CRI-Strat, is performed in UKCA in addition to an evaluation of three mechanisms, CRI-Strat 2, CRI-Strat and the standard UKCA chemical mechanism, StratTrop v1.0, against a wide array of surface and airborne chemical data. CRI-Strat 2 comprises a state-of-the-art isoprene scheme, optimized against the Master Chemical Mechanism v3.3.1, which includes isoprene peroxy radical isomerization, HOx recycling through the addition of photolabile hydroperoxy aldehydes (HPALDs), and isoprene epoxy diol (IEPOX) formation. CRI-Strat 2 also features updates to several rate constants for the inorganic chemistry, including the reactions of inorganic nitrogen and O(D-1). The update to the isoprene chemistry in CRI-Strat 2 increases OH over the lowest 500m in tropical forested regions by 30%-50% relative to CRI-Strat, leading to an improvement in model-observation comparisons for surface OH and isoprene relative to CRI-Strat and StratTrop. Enhanced oxidants also cause a 25% reduction in isoprene burden and an increase in oxidation fluxes of isoprene and other biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) at low altitudes with likely impacts on subsequent aerosol formation, atmospheric lifetime, and climate. By contrast, updates to the rate constants of O(D-1) with its main reactants relative to CRI-Strat reduces OH in much of the free troposphere, producing a 2% increase in the methane lifetime, and increases the tropospheric ozone burden by 8 %, primarily from reduced loss via O(D-1) + H2O. The changes to inorganic nitrogen reaction rate constants increase the NOx burden by 4% and shift the distribution of nitrated species closer to that simulated by StratTrop. CRI-Strat 2 is suitable for multi-decadal model integrations and the improved representation of isoprene chemistry provides an opportunity to explore the consequences of HOx recycling in the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1). This new mechanism will enable a re-evaluation of the impact of BVOCs on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and further probe the feedback between the biosphere and the climate.","[Weber, James; Archer-Nicholls, Scott; Abraham, Nathan Luke; Shin, Youngsub M.; Archibald, Alex T.] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Abraham, Nathan Luke; Archibald, Alex T.] Univ Cambridge, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Bannan, Thomas J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Percival, Carl J.] CALTECH, NASA, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Bacak, Asan] Ankara Univ, Inst Accelerator Technol, Turkish Accelerator & Radiat Lab, Golbasi Campus, TR-06830 Ankara, Turkey; [Artaxo, Paulo] Univ Sao Paulo, Phys Inst, Rua Matao 1371, BR-05351015 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Jenkin, Michael] Atmospher Chem Serv, Okehampton EX20 4BQ, Devon, England; [Khan, M.

Two identical insulated boxes were then constructed; one facade was equipped with the aerogel glazing sample and the other was prepared with a conventional double-layer glazing. An onsite measurement of the boxes' internal thermal properties was then conducted. The two boxes were placed within the same outdoor environment. The temperature, humidity, and enthalpy values were calculated with the boxes facing different orientations and in a variety of weather conditions. The performance of the silica aerogel glazing was then evaluated by both experimental and theoretical analysis.

These shading typologies are praised as passive vernacular systems that stood the test of time as low energy design strategies. Despite the increased interest in adopting these vernacular strategies in contemporary buildings, there is a lack of studies investigating the relationship between different screen geometries, perforation percentage, form, materiality, and their impacts on indoor environmental quality of the perimeter spaces from both the visual as well as the thermal qualities and quantities. While the impacts of screen shading systems on the building's shape have been previously studied, few studies compared the impacts of these screen systems on thermal comfort in different hot climate zones. In addition, their energy savings, cooling loads, and multi-comfort potential have not been studied comprehensively to unveil the combined impacts of these systems on the building and its occupants. This paper aims to assess dynamic energy performance and indoor thermal comfort of three screen shading geometries in two different hot climate zones; Lahore, Pakistan, a hot-humid climate and Doha, Qatar, a hot-arid climate. The paper reports on a multi-method approach research design combining a field assessment of three screen-shading systems with different geometries and perforation percentages. Experimental performance of the different systems were simulated using a dynamic environmental modelling software, Integrated Environments Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES-VE) Apache thermal engine. The simulation was performed for an ASHRAE typical year meteorological weather data for the two representative city locations. Independent variables including screen geometry, depth, and perforation percentages were manipulated for both south and west-facing glazed facades of an existing office building. The dependent variables assessed were reductions in energy performance, solar heat gain coefficient, lighting energy, and improved indoor thermal comfort. Results from our field studies and computational environmental modelling revealed that screens with 3-5 cms in depth and 30% perforation ratio with 1:1 perforation width to depth ratio improve thermal comfort in office buildings and energy performance over larger perforated screens for Doha, Qatar climate zone. Screens with 50% perforation ratio, however, were better suited for Lahore, Pakistan climate zone. Thermal comfort, however, was better achieved with variable perforation ratios, especially for hot-humid climates such as, Lahore, Pakistan. Various degrees of permutations of screen geometries revealed that solar screens voids and patterns perform differently in hot climate zones and results should not be generalized across the Middle East region due to various micro-climates within and between cities of the region ranging","[Elzeyadi, Ihab] Univ Oregon, Dept Architecture, High Performance Environm Lab HiPE, Architecture, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Elzeyadi, Ihab] Univ Oregon, Dept Architecture, High Performance Environm Lab HiPE, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Batool, Ayesha] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Art Design & Architecture SADA, Islamabad, Pakistan",University of Oregon; University of Oregon; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Elzeyadi, I (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Architecture, High Performance Environm Lab HiPE, Architecture, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;Elzeyadi, I (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Architecture, High Performance Environm Lab HiPE, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",2378-2129,,,ASHRAE CONF PAPER,,,2018,,,,,,,CH-18-C035,,,,,8,Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,BP4TY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000554427300034,View Full Record in Web of Science

In our worst case, those requirements are 7-11 Gt C per year and 1,000-1,600 Gt C, respectively.

Indeed, they do not delegitimise the action of many domestic courts that have been dealing with a surprisingly high number of legal actions against Governments or public authorities for their unsatisfactory mitigation policies. Nonetheless, they are not without limits. On the one hand they do not take the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from individual States into account in order to calculate the causal link between damages and States' conduct; on the other hand the decisions are silent on the plaintiffs' status of victims for the violation of Art. 3 of the Convention, and therefore they do not take any stance on the right of the children that the protection of future generations are taken into account by the decisions of public institutions and authorities.

In 2012, ART jointly organized with the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists their second science workshop-Overcoming Challenges of Observation to Model Integration in Marine Ecosystem Response to Sea Ice Transitions-at the Institute of Oceanology, Polish Academy of Sciences, in Sopot. This workshop aimed to identify linkages and feedbacks between atmosphere ice ocean forcing and biogeochemical processes, which are critical for ecosystem function, land-ocean interactions and productive capacity of the Arctic Ocean.

Nevertheless, some processes, such as atmospheric chemical feedbacks, are still computationally expensive and are often ignored in climate simulations(1,2). Here we present evidence that the representation of stratospheric ozone in climate models can have a first-order impact on estimates of effective climate sensitivity. Using a comprehensive atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model, we find an increase in global mean surface warming of around 1 degrees C (similar to 20%) after 75 years when ozone is prescribed at pre-industrial levels compared with when it is allowed to evolve self-consistently in response to an abrupt 4 x CO2 forcing. The difference is primarily attributed to changes in long-wave radiative feedbacks associated with circulation-driven decreases in tropical lower stratospheric ozone and related stratospheric water vapour and cirrus cloud changes. This has important implications for global model intercomparison studies(1,2) in which participating models often use simplified treatments of atmospheric composition changes that are consistent with neither the specified greenhouse gas forcing scenario nor the associated atmospheric circulation feedbacks(3-5).","[Nowack, Peer J.; Abraham, N.

This climate of experimentation has seen a number of cultural geographers openly promote their interests in, and engagements with, the creative arts: some have explicitly developed practices in response to longer-standing geographical interests (e.g., Cresswell, 2013/2014; Gallagher, 2014; Gorman-Murray, 2014; Wylie, with Webster, 2014), while others have more established art practices that inform, and are informed by, their geographical work (e.g., Crouch, 2010; de Leeuw, 2012; Zebracki, n. d.). In this article, I explore the potential of poetry to animate accounts of geographical fieldwork via an intellectual engagement with the ideas and tenets of non-representational theory. I begin by outlining the history of ` poetry as method' in the social sciences and then acknowledge poetry's status within phenomenology. From there, I consider what a post-structuralist account of geographical fieldwork might entail, drawing from Deleuzian philosophy. Then, using three conjoined poems of my own as a vehicle, I critically analyse the work that poems do as research as well as the ways in which they operate in literary terms.","[Boyd, Candice P.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Boyd, CP (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",cboyd@unimelb.edu.au,,"Boyd, Candice/0000-0003-2796-8559",,,,,61,5,5,0,1,UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA-OKANAGAN,KELOWNA,"3333 UNIVERSITY WAY, KELOWNA, BC V1V 1V7, CANADA",1492-9732,,,ACME,Acme,,2017,2,,,,210,223,,,,,,14,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,FN7TW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000416222700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To disentangle the effect of rapid adjustment to a given forcing on the overall change in extreme precipitation, we use a linear regression method that has been previously applied to mean precipitation. Equilibrium experiments with preindustrial CO2 concentrations and reduced solar constant were compared with a four times CO2 concentration experiment for 10 state-of-the-art climate models. We find that the two forcing mechanisms, greenhouse gases and solar, impose clearly different rapid adjustment signals in the mean precipitation, while such difference is difficult to discern for extreme precipitation due to large internal variability. In contrast to mean precipitation, changes in extreme precipitation scale with surface temperature trends and do not seem to depend on the forcing mechanism.","[Sillmann, Jana; Stjern, Camilla Weum; Myhre, Gunnar] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Forster, Piers M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Sillmann, J (corresponding author), Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",jana.sillmann@cicero.oslo.no,"Forster, Piers M/F-9829-2010; Myhre, Gunnar/A-3598-2008; Stjern, Camilla Weum/ABA-6904-2020; Myhre, Gunnar/J-5483-2014; Sillmann, Jana/AAE-2560-2022; Sillmann, Jana/P-3482-2017","Forster, Piers M/0000-0002-6078-0171; Myhre, Gunnar/0000-0002-4309-476X; Myhre, Gunnar/0000-0002-4309-476X; Sillmann, Jana/0000-0002-0219-5345; Sillmann, Jana/0000-0002-0219-5345; Stjern, Camilla Weum/0000-0003-3608-9468","Research Council of Norway [230619, 229778]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N006038/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/N006038/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table S1 of this paper) for producing and making available their CMIP5 and GeoMIP model output.

The plant can be reviewed in three major parts; (i) liquid stream, (ii) sludge stream and (iii) odor control stream all having the latest state of the art technology and related equipments. The challenge in starting up the plant was related to the fact that only 20% of the flow was available in the form of hauled sewage to be hauled from septic tanks located in various parts of the city and also from the nearby industry which was uncontrollable. Furthermore, some parts of the plant were not ready to be commissioned on the day of the planned startup not to mention that effluent irrigation main was not complete to receive the treated sewage effluent (TSE) from the plant. A comprehensive commissioning plan was implemented and followed during the startup which was tailored according to the actual conditions. The plant commissioning was conducted in a phased sequence to cater for the expected and unexpected changes related to the inlet conditions. Commissioning and operation of the plant was carried for over 18 months with success considering the challenging and difficult conditions.","[Sarioglu, M.] MWH UK Ltd, POB 3020, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Sarioglu, M (corresponding author), MWH UK Ltd, POB 3020, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",Murat.Sarioglu@uk.mwhglobal.com,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,1,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1751-231X,,,WATER PRACT TECHNOL,Water Pract.

Here we identify an emergent relationship linking the long-term global land surface cooling due to SRM-SAI and the short-term cooling following the twentieth century major volcanic eruptions across an Earth system models ensemble. This emergent relationship, combined with observations and reanalysis data, is used to constrain the global land surface temperature (LT) response to reduced downward solar radiation. Based on these constraints, we find a mean decrease in land surface temperature of 0.44KW(-1)m(2), 20% smaller than the unconstrained multimodel mean. This new estimate may affect how trade-offs between cost, risk, and effectiveness of SRM-SAI might be considered. Plain Language Summary Solar radiation management by stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection has been proposed 10 years ago as means of limiting the harmful impacts of anthropogenic global warming in the absence of strong global efforts toward mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. However, in absence of real-world experiments, the efficiency of this method to counteract global warming as derived from model simulated remains poorly constrained. Here using state-of-the-art multimodel simulations, we have identified an emergent property of the Earth system between the decrease in solar radiation and the global land surface temperature. First, we relate long-term climate sensitivity to the short-term response of a natural observable analog in large volcanic eruptions. When applied to multiple data sets, which relate the observed temperature decrease to changes in incoming shortwave radiation, we constrain the model response to sulfate geoengineering. We find that state-of-the-art multimodel simulations overestimate the efficiency of this method to counteract global warming by about 20%.","[Plazzotta, Maxime; Seferian, Roland; Douville, Herve] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France; [Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Tjiputra, Jerry] Uni Res Climate, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Plazzotta, M (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France.",maxime.plazzotta@meteo.fr,"Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014; Tjiputra, Jerry/AAB-5896-2022; Séférian, Roland/ABD-5465-2021; Douville, Herve/H-5967-2018","Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150; Séférian, Roland/0000-0002-2571-2114; Tjiputra, Jerry/0000-0002-4600-2453; Douville, Herve/0000-0002-6074-6467","Meteo-France; CNRS; CERFACS; H2020 project CRESCENDO Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [641816]; U.S. Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; RCN; Bjerknes Centre [239965]","Meteo-France; CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); CERFACS; H2020 project CRESCENDO Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; U.S. Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); RCN; Bjerknes Centre","This work was supported by Meteo-France, CNRS, and CERFACS.

Three state-of-the-art atmospheric models forced by symmetric anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) patterns, mimicking strong ENSO events, are used to robustly diagnose symmetries and asymmetries in the extra-tropical ENSO response. Asymmetries arise in the sea-level pressure (SLP) response over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, as the response to La Nina tends to be weaker and shifted westward with respect to that of El Nino. The difference in amplitude can be traced back to the distinct energy available for the two ENSO phases associated with the non-linear diabatic heating response to the total SST field. The longitudinal shift is embedded into the large-scale Rossby wave train triggered from the tropical Pacific, as its anomalies in the upper troposphere show a similar westward displacement in La Nina compared to El Nino. To fully explain this shift, the response in tropical convection and the related anomalous upper-level divergence have to be considered together with the climatological vorticity gradient of the subtropical jet, i.e. diagnosing the tropical Rossby wave source. In the North Atlantic, the ENSO-forced SLP signal is a well-known dipole between middle and high latitudes, different from the North Atlantic Oscillation, whose asymmetry is not indicative of distinct mechanisms driving the teleconnection for El Nino and La Nina.","[Mezzina, Bianca; Garcia-Serrano, Javier] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Serrano, Javier; Blade, Ileana; Palmeiro, Froila M.] Univ Barcelona UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Batte, Lauriane; Ardilouze, Constantin] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Benassi, Marianna; Gualdi, Silvio] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Climate Simulat & Predict Div, Bologna, Italy; [Gualdi, Silvio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); University of Barcelona; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Mezzina, B (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain.",bianca.mezzina@bsc.es,"Palmeiro, Froila M./AAA-8250-2019; García-Serrano, Javier/I-5058-2015; Blade, Ileana/H-9348-2015; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015","Palmeiro, Froila M./0000-0002-4120-6174; García-Serrano, Javier/0000-0003-3913-0876; Blade, Ileana/0000-0003-1842-1711; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Batte, Lauriane/0000-0002-7903-9762; Benassi, Marianna/0000-0001-9196-6887; Ardilouze, Constantin/0000-0003-3949-4450; Mezzina, Bianca/0000-0002-1264-815X",MEDSCOPE project; AEMET (ES); ANR (FR); BSC (ES); CMCC (IT); CNR (IT); IMR (BE); Meteo-France (FR); European Union [690462]; Contratos Predoctorales para la Formacion de Doctores programme [BES-2016-076431]; Ramon y Cajal programme [RYC-2016-21181]; Spanish DANAE project [CGL2015-68342-R]; Spanish GRAVITOCAST project [ERC2018-092835],MEDSCOPE project; AEMET (ES); ANR (FR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); BSC (ES); CMCC (IT); CNR (IT); IMR (BE); Meteo-France (FR); European Union(European Commission); Contratos Predoctorales para la Formacion de Doctores programme; Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government); Spanish DANAE project; Spanish GRAVITOCAST project,"This work was supported by the MEDSCOPE project.

By conducting an eigenanalyses of simple linear air-sea coupled models, it is shown that two additional feedback processes are present when the variable oceanic mixed layer depth (MLD) is considered. The horizontal structures of the leading modes are similar to the WES mode, which shows a meridional dipole in the SST anomalies straddling the equator with cross-equatorial wind anomalies that represent the weakening/strengthening of the trade winds over the warm/cool SST anomalies. The coupling of the variable MLD with winds and SST more than doubles the growth rate of the WES mode and enhances the equatorward propagation of the coupled disturbances. The identified feedbacks operate as follows: The weaker winds associated with warm SST anomalies shoal the mixed layer through suppressed turbulent mixing, which causes the mixed layer to be more sensitive to the climatological shortwave radiation and amplifies the initial positive SST anomalies. Likewise, deepening of the mixed layer due to stronger winds acts to maintain the negative SST anomaly on the other side of the dipole. The MLD anomalies can also be generated by the buoyancy flux anomaly related to the wind-induced latent heat flux anomaly. The antiphase relationship between the SST and MLD anomalies seen in the simple model bears some resemblance to that which is observed in the observations and a state-of-the-art coupled model during the Atlantic meridional mode.","[Kataoka, Takahito; Tatebe, Hiroaki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; [Kimoto, Masahide; Watanabe, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo,"Kataoka, T (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.",tkataoka@15.alumni.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kataoka, Takahito/GRY-2961-2022","tatebe, hiroaki/0000-0002-2265-5847",MEXT through the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models; Japan Society for Promotion of Science [17K14392],"MEXT through the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models; Japan Society for Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","We thank Soon-Il An, Shoichiro Kido, Ingo Richter, Tomoki Tozuka, Junya Uchida, Jerome Vialard, Shang-Ping Xie, and Yutaka Yoshikawa (alphabetical order) for helpful discussions and comments.

This study examines the potential predictability limit of intraseasonal transitions between rainy to non-rainy phases (i.e., active to break phases) or vice versa over central Indian region during extreme monsoon using very high-resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) daily rainfall datasets. The present study reveals that the transitions from both active to break and break to active conditions are more predictable by similar to 8 days during the weak monsoon (WM) years compared to the strong monsoon (SM) years. Such asymmetric behavior in the limit of predictability could be linked to the distinct differences in the large-scale seasonal mean background instability during SM and WM years. The achievability of such predictability is further evaluated in a state-of-the-art climate model, the climate forecast system (CFSv2). It is demonstrated that the observed asymmetry in predictability limit could be reproducible in the CFSv2 model, irrespective of its spatial resolution. This study provides impetus for useful dynamical prediction of wet/dry spells at extended range during the extreme monsoon years.","[Sahai, A.

In this study, we develop the Permafrost Degradation and Greenhouse gasses Emission Model (PDGEM), which describes the thawing of the Arctic permafrost including the Yedoma layer due to climate change and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The PDGEM includes the processes by which high-concentration GHGs (CO2 and CH4) contained in the pores of the Yedoma layer are released directly by dynamic degradation, as well as the processes by which GHGs are released by the decomposition of organic matter in the Yedoma layer and other permafrost Our model simulations show that the total GHG emissions from permafrost degradation in the RCP8.5 scenario was estimated to be 31-63 PgC for CO2 and 1261-2821 TgCH(4) for CH4 (68th percentile of the perturbed model simulations, corresponding to a global average surface air temperature change of 0.05-0.11 degrees C), and 14-28 PgC for CO2 and 618-1341 TgCH(4) for CH4 (0.03-0.07 degrees C) in the RCP2.6 scenario. GHG emissions resulting from the dynamic degradation of the Yedoma layer were estimated to be less than 1% of the total emissions from the permafrost in both scenarios, possibly because of the small area ratio of the Yedoma layer. An advantage of PDGEM is that geographical distributions of GHG emissions can be estimated by combining a state-of-the-art land surface model featuring detailed physical processes with a GHG release model using a simple scheme, enabling us to consider a broad range of uncertainty regarding model parameters. In regions with large GHG emissions due to permafrost thawing, it may be possible to help reduce GHG emissions by taking measures such as restraining land development.","[Yokohata, Tokuta; Ito, Akihiko; Tanaka, Katsumasa] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Saito, Kazuyuki; Hajima, Tomohiro] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Environm Modeling & Applicat, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Ohno, Hiroshi] Kitami Inst Technol, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Engn, 165 Koen Cho, Kitami, Hokkaido 0908507, Japan; [Tanaka, Katsumasa] Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Iwahana, Go] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, 739,2160 Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Kitami Institute of Technology; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Yokohata, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",yokohata@nies.go.jp,"Tanaka, Katsumasa/B-8528-2013; Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019; Ito, Akihiko/P-2624-2017; Iwahana, Go/I-3500-2018","Tanaka, Katsumasa/0000-0001-9601-6442; Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988; Ito, Akihiko/0000-0001-5265-0791; Iwahana, Go/0000-0003-4628-1074","Ministry of Environment [2-1605, JPMEERF20162005]; Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency; NASA ABoVE (Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment [NNX17AC57A]; National Research Agency in France under the Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-19-MPGA-0008]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU Program) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency; NASA ABoVE (Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment; National Research Agency in France under the Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU Program) - Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This study was conducted as a part of the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund project (2-1605, JPMEERF20162005) Assessing and Projecting Greenhouse Gas Release from Large-scale Permafrost Degradation supported by the Ministry of Environment and the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency.

Despite the latest developments in sensor technologies, real-time determination of certain parameters is not easy or uneconomical. In such cases, the use of data-derived virtual sensors can be an effective alternative. In this paper, the feasibility of virtual sensing for water quality assessment is reviewed. The review focuses on the overview of key water quality parameters for a particular use case and the development of the corresponding cost estimates for their monitoring. The review further evaluates the current state-of-the-art in terms of the modeling approaches used, parameters studied, and whether the inputs were pre-processed by interrogating relevant literature published between 2001 and 2021. The review identified artificial neural networks, random forest, and multiple linear regression as dominant machine learning techniques used for developing inferential models. The survey also highlights the need for a comprehensive virtual sensing system in an internet of things environment. Thus, the review formulates the specification book for the advanced water quality assessment process (that involves a virtual sensing module) that can enable near real-time monitoring of water quality.","[Paepae, Thulane] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-2028 Doornfontein, South Africa; [Bokoro, Pitshou N.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Elect & Elect Engn Technol, Doornfontein, South Africa; [Kyamakya, Kyandoghere] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Smart Syst Technol, Transportat Informat Grp, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg; University of Klagenfurt,"Bokoro, PN (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Elect & Elect Engn Technol, Doornfontein, South Africa.",tpaepae@uj.ac.za; pitshoub@uj.ac.za; kyandoghere.kyamakya@aau.at,,"Kyamakya, Kyandoghere/0000-0003-0773-9476",,,,,154,10,10,9,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2021,21,,,,,,6971,10.3390/s21216971,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21216971,,,35,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,WX6NT,34770278,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000718711100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Besides highlighting ongoing research advancements in the LPL, the review provides a critical overview of the scientific information available on the large lake's ecosystems, identifying a few emerging research topics (e.g., aquatic omics' and high frequency monitoring). Many limnological investigations are linked to the concept of scientific monitoring, following a problem solving approach connected with the management of water resources. Experimental studies and modeling are restricted to specific niches. Overall, the scientific knowledge is quite scattered, showing hot-spots of specialized or integrated research in specific lakes and areas. The advancement of new knowledge in the LPL should rely on a better integration of scientific disciplines using multidisciplinary approaches, and on the continuous adoption of new advanced technologies and tools, contributing, besides basic research, to the next generation monitoring approaches. Finally, the preservation of LPL has to rely on water protection policies addressed towards the sustainable development of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, following the green and blue infrastructure concepts.","[Salmaso, Nico] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Anneville, Orlane] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, INRA, CARRTEL, 75 Bis Ave Corzent, F-74100 Thonon Les Bains, France; [Straile, Dietmar] Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Viaroli, Pierluigi] Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Parco Area Sci 11A, I-43124 Parma, Italy",Fondazione Edmund Mach; INRAE; University of Konstanz; University of Parma,"Salmaso, N (corresponding author), Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy.",nico.salmaso@fmach.it; orlane.anneville@inra.fr; pierluigi.viaroli@unipr.it,"Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Viaroli, Pierluigi/M-3762-2014; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015","Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; Viaroli, Pierluigi/0000-0002-6396-2894; Salmaso, Nico/0000-0001-6057-3642",European Regional Development Fund: Interreg V-A-Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Liechtenstein (Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein 2014-2020) [ABH060],European Regional Development Fund: Interreg V-A-Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Liechtenstein (Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein 2014-2020),"We would like to thank all the authors of this special issue for their efforts in preparing the papers that have contributed to establish the state of the art of limnology in the large and deep perialpine lakes.

The aim of the research was to identify the risk to museum collections, due to unbalanced moisture loads and unstable indoor air temperatures, as well as to identify possible causes of fluctuations in these parameters. This article focuses on assessing the impact of variable external and internal loads on the hygrothermal parameters of indoor air. The profile of internal hygrothermal loads in exhibition halls varied over time, which resulted in a temporary variation of the indoor environmental parameters. The lack of appropriate systems, shaping the microclimate in the analyzed museums, and the lack of automatic control in existing devices did not allow to maintain the temperature and relative humidity within appropriate limits. In the museums, the maximum indoor temperature values were higher than those recommended in the requirements.

Under such very dynamic interactions between the natural resources, climate and the socioeconomic sectors, scientists from different perspectives have a challenging task to provide up-to-date and reliable insights to guide potential sustainable management strategies. Through the case of the Souss-Massa, the present study aims to provide state of the art scientific research on water resources. It is based on data from publications in the two databases Scopus and Web of Science, unpublished papers and reports as well as various theses. The Vosviewer data visualization tool was used to analyze different aspects of the publications, including the time distribution of water resources related research, the research topics as well as the different approaches adopted by the authors. In addition, this review summarizes results of previous research investigations carried out on the quantity and quality of water resources in relation to agriculture as well as to climate change and variability. The study showed that the period 2016-2021 was the most significant in terms of the number of research papers published. The maps of publications analyzed showed that researchers working in the area focus more on the study of the quality, chemical processing and the impacts of climate change on the availability of water resources. The results showed that Souss-Massa is a region where an important amount of research on climate and water has been carried out. Hence, to keep up with the rapid evolution of land use and other anthropogenic actions in the basin there remain several gaps in knowledge and constraints to address. In order to provide potential research opportunities in the Souss-Massa basin, in terms of scope and methods, this review identifies several gaps in research namely data quality and availability, as well as gaps in water resources modelling. A detailed discussion has been provided on the possibilities to develop and address the research gaps in the region.","[Attar, Oumaima; Brouziyne, Youssef; Bouchaou, Lhoussaine; Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Int Water Res Inst, Benguerir 43150, Morocco; [Bouchaou, Lhoussaine] Ibn Zohr Univ, Lab Appl Geol & Geoenvironm, Fac Sci, BP 8106, Agadir 80000, Morocco; [Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Inst Rech Developpement IRD, Ctr Detudes Spati Biosphere Cesbio, Unite Mixte Rech UMR, F-31400 Toulouse, France",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Ibn Zohr University of Agadir,"Attar, O (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Int Water Res Inst, Benguerir 43150, Morocco.",oumaima.attar@um6p.ma; youssef.brouziyne@um6p.ma; lhoussaine.bouchaou@um6p.ma; abdelghani.chehbouni@um6p.ma,"; chehbouni, abdelghani/K-2096-2016","Youssef, BROUZIYNE/0000-0001-6710-9527; chehbouni, abdelghani/0000-0002-0270-1690",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,The authors express their gratitude to all of the assistance provided by individuals who assisted them in conducting the research.

The literature shows a wide range of pollutant emission models, whether empirical, database centric or regression based. In this paper, we propose and analyze 3 regression based models built on data from pollutant emission databases and knowledge models. The first model is based on an exponential regression that improves the results given in the state of the art.

These mass movements produce sediment, alter catchment behaviour and contribute to the dynamics and hazards of high alpine and proglacial areas. This chapter highlights the state of knowledge in the context of proglacial environments and reviews methods of investigating rock slope failure activity and causes. An alignment of extreme conditions and dynamic processes renders proglacial environments exceptionally prone to instability. Glacier retreat and climate change, following the Last Glacial Maximum and more recent stadials, has been a major catalyst for past and ongoing mass movements in alpine areas, and many slopes continue to respond to these legacy perturbations. Rock slope failure activity is preconditioned by rock mass properties and topography, and failures in alpine areas are typically prepared or triggered by: (i) fracture growth and seismicity arising from the unloading of glacial loads over millennial timescales, and (ii) rock fracture growth and loss of strength as a result of hydrological and thermal effects that fluctuate over daily to seasonal timescales, but are superimposed upon long-term trends related to climate change. These insights stem from a growing application of geomorphological, geotechnical, geochemical, geodetic and geophysical techniques that enable the assessment of stability factors and the activity of rock slope failures (both past and contemporary). The rich datasets are being used to inform new understanding of past and ongoing proglacial rock slope instabilities; this understanding will ultimately help to predict process dynamics, environmental change and to mitigate hazards resulting from rock slope failures.","[McColl, Samuel T.] Massey Univ, Geosci Grp, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Draebing, Daniel] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Landslide Res, Munich, Germany",Massey University; Technical University of Munich,"McColl, ST (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Geosci Grp, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",s.t.mccoll@massey.ac.nz,"McColl, Sam/AFO-5198-2022","McColl, Sam/0000-0002-2805-1761; Draebing, Daniel/0000-0001-6379-4707",,,,,170,21,21,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2366-8865,2366-8873,978-3-319-94184-4; 978-3-319-94182-0,GEOGR PHYS ENVIRON,Geography of the Physical Environment,,2019,,,,,119,141,,10.1007/978-3-319-94184-4_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94184-4_8,10.1007/978-3-319-94184-4,,23,"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,BR3RM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000648956300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the traditional landscape design often has some disadvantages, such as waste of design resources, serious design energy consumption, poor adaptability of design products, weak practicality, and fragile ecological structure. Based on this, this paper will fully consider the role of climate factors such as solar radiation, temperature, wind conditions, and relative temperature and humidity and air pollutants in landscape design. At the same time, various design factors in landscape design will be quantified and statistically analyzed by using the principle of nonlinear random matrix, so as to further optimize the index distribution of balanced design factors and optimize the landscape design scheme. In the actual principle design, this paper adopts the logic idea of digital garden design, based on the design process of garden logic design, garden design foundation preparation, garden design environment analysis, and digital garden design results display, and establishes a parametric digital garden forest model, so as to realize the digital design and simulation of intelligent garden. In the corresponding practical simulation part, this paper carried out an example verification based on the interior and exterior landscape design of a company and realized the establishment of the parametric analysis model of the case based on parametric and visual-related programmable software, thus completing the simulation design of functional components such as garden road layout optimization design, garden greening planting design, garden landscape visual creation effect design, and garden numerical service design; the experimental results show that compared with the traditional garden design, the garden designed in this paper has increased the degree of garden intelligence by about 30%, reduced the energy consumption by about 20% in the corresponding degree of energy conservation and environmental protection, and increased the degree of garden comfort by about 30%.","[Lu, Yao] Henan Univ Urban Construct, Art Design Coll, Pingdingshan 467000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yao] Dong a Univ, Sch Landscape Architecture, Busan 612022, South Korea; [Chen, Bingyan] Henan Univ Technol, Sch Design & Art, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Xin, Yicheng] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaofei] Henan Univ Urban Construction, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Pingdingshan 467000, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan University of Urban Construction; Dong A University; Henan University of Technology; Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture,"Chen, BY (corresponding author), Henan Univ Technol, Sch Design & Art, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.",20172080@hncj.edu.cn; artcby@haut.edu.cn; 992xin@gmail.com; 30030509@hncj.edu.cn,,,Henan Province Teaching Reform Project: Innovation and Practice of Talent Training Mode for New Construction Engineering Majors in the Digital Age;  [2021SJGLX529],Henan Province Teaching Reform Project: Innovation and Practice of Talent Training Mode for New Construction Engineering Majors in the Digital Age; ,AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Henan Province Teaching Reform Project: Innovation and Practice of Talent Training Mode for New Construction Engineering Majors in the Digital Age (No. 2021SJGLX529).,,29,0,0,3,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

Evidence suggests that the warming was largely due to a strengthening of the ocean circulation, particularly the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation(1,5-7). Since the mid-1990s direct and indirect measurements have suggested a decline in the strength of the ocean circulation(8,9), which is expected to lead to a reduction in northward heat transport(10,11). Here we show that since 2005 a large volume of the upper North Atlantic Ocean has cooled significantly by approximately 0.45 degrees C or 1.5 x 10(22) J, reversing the previous warming trend. By analysing observations and a state-of-the-art climate model, we show that this cooling is consistent with a reduction in the strength of the ocean circulation and heat transport, linked to record low densities in the deep Labrador Sea(9). The low density in the deep Labrador Sea is primarily due to deep ocean warming since 1995, but a long-term freshening also played a role. The observed upper ocean cooling since 2005 is not consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosols directly drive Atlantic temperatures(12).","[Robson, Jon; Ortega, Pablo; Sutton, Rowan] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Robson, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",j.i.robson@reading.ac.uk,"Ortega, Pablo/B-2829-2017; Robson, Jon/A-7677-2012; Ortega, Pablo/ABE-7884-2020","Ortega, Pablo/0000-0002-4135-9621; Robson, Jon/0000-0002-3467-018X; Ortega, Pablo/0000-0002-4135-9621; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583","Seasonal-to-Decadal Climate Prediction for the Improvement of European Climate Service project (SPECS) [GA 308378]; Dynamics and Predictability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning and Climate project (DYNAMOC) [NE/M005127/1]; NERC via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); ACSIS project; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M005127/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/M005127/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Seasonal-to-Decadal Climate Prediction for the Improvement of European Climate Service project (SPECS); Dynamics and Predictability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning and Climate project (DYNAMOC); NERC via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); ACSIS project; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the UK Met Office, and particularly M.

Advanced vehicles powered by low-carbon sources of electricity or hydrogen offer an alternative to conventional fossil-fuelled technologies. Yet, despite ambitious pledges and investments by governments and automakers, it is by no means clear that these vehicles will ultimately reach mass-market consumers. Here, we develop state-of-the-art representations of consumer preferences in multiple global energy-economy models, specifically focusing on the non-financial preferences of individuals. We employ these enhanced model formulations to analyse the potential for a low-carbon vehicle revolution up to 2050. Our analysis shows that a diverse set of measures targeting vehicle buyers is necessary to drive widespread adoption of clean technologies. Carbon pricing alone is insufficient to bring low-carbon vehicles to the mass market, though it may have a supporting role in ensuring a decarbonized energy supply.","[McCollum, David L.; Wilson, Charlie; Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [McCollum, David L.] Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Wilson, Charlie; Pettifor, Hazel] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Bevione, Michela; Carrara, Samuel; Emmerling, Johannes] FEEM, Climate & Sustainable Innovat CSI Program, Milan, Italy; [Bevione, Michela; Carrara, Samuel; Emmerling, Johannes] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Econ Anal Climate Impacts & Policy Div ECIP, Milan, Italy; [Edelenbosch, Oreane Y.; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Climate Air & Energy Dept, The Hague, Netherlands; [Edelenbosch, Oreane Y.; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Guivarch, Celine] CIRED, Ecole Ponts, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Karkatsoulis, Panagiotis; Paroussos, Leonidas] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Inst Commun & Comp Syst, E3MLab, Zografos, Greece; [Keppo, Ilkka; Rodriguez, Baltazar Solano] UCL, UCL Energy Inst, Cent House, London, England; [Lin, Zhenhong] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Transportat Anal, Knoxville, TN USA; [Lin, Zhenhong] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Knoxville, TN USA; [Broin, Eoin O.] CIRED, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Broin, Eoin O.] SMASH, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Ramea, Kalai] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Thermal Engn, Graz, Austria; [Riahi, Keywan] Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Sano, Fuminori] Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth RITE, Syst Anal Grp, Kyoto, Japan",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of East Anglia; Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Utrecht University; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; National Technical University of Athens; University of London; University College London; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University of California System; University of California Davis; Graz University of Technology; Colorado School of Mines; Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth,"McCollum, DL (corresponding author), IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria.;McCollum, DL (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",mccollum@iiasa.ac.at,"EMMERLING, Johannes/K-8283-2019; Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Broin, Eoin Ó/AAF-6032-2021; van Vuuren, Detlef P./A-4764-2009; Guivarch, Celine/D-9772-2019; Pettifor, Hazel/AAF-6393-2020; Lin, Zhenhong/AAJ-9468-2021; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011","EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913; Broin, Eoin Ó/0000-0003-0447-2032; van Vuuren, Detlef P./0000-0003-0398-2831; Guivarch, Celine/0000-0002-9405-256X; Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; McCollum, David/0000-0003-1293-0179; Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515; Pettifor, Hazel/0000-0003-3901-2693; Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Paroussos, Leonidas/0000-0001-8251-7270; Karkatsoulis, Panagiotis/0000-0003-1109-2214",ADVANCE project (FP7) of the European Commission [308329],ADVANCE project (FP7) of the European Commission,"We acknowledge funding provided by the ADVANCE project (FP7/2007-2013, grant agreement number 308329) of the European Commission.

The piece stems from commissioned research that took the form of an ethnography of an urban-supported housing scheme for people over 50 years of age. We discuss some tensions of conducting radical democratic performative work within a political climate characterized by the commodification of knowledge and marketization of science. This context provides a backdrop to subsequent reflections around performing praxis through a critical political and cultural engagement. Specifically, we consider how Under One Roof challenges dominant stories about homelessness, poverty, discrimination, alcohol and drug misuse, marginalization, and aging through privileging personal stories. We consider how students' participation through readings of the script during lectures made it possible, in Henry A.

Despite BIPV/T offering clear energetic and space saving advantages compared to separate BIPV and solar thermal, overheating occurs when no thermal demand exists, resulting in reduced yields, stagnation damage, and excessive fluid pressures. Whilst continuous fluid flows mitigate overheating, corresponding parasitic demands and space requirements are significant (pumps, large storage tanks or heat rejection equipment). This two-part study examines an alternative approach to BIPV/T, addressing overheating by combining BIPV and Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heater (ICSSWH) concepts. Solar heating capabilities of ICSSWH collectors are well established and their overnight heat loss characteristics provide passive overheating control. BIPV-ICSSWH approaches have yet to be investigated extensively. This paper (Part 1 of 2) reviews state-of-the-art and performance benchmarks in BIPV/T and ICSSWH; proposes new performance metrics enabling fairer comparisons; and develops a heat transfer model for BIPVICSSWH facade elements employing Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) to regulate absorber temperatures and heat losses. Multi-day solar thermal collection, photovoltaic generation, and overnight heat retention behaviours are simulated in different climates. The modelling results (experimentally validated in Part 2 of 2) suggests BIPV-PLVTD-ICSSWHs with single transparent covers and zeta approximate to 90% PLVTD diodicity achieve eta(T,col) approximate to 60% solar thermal efficiency at N approximate to 0.035m(2)K.W-1, PV/T performance ratio PRT3 approximate to 75%, and heat loss coefficient U(r,sys)A(sys)/u approximate to 20 W.m(-3) K-1. The novel BIPV-PLVTD-ICSSWH approach can reduce maximum stagnation by 20 degrees C compared to conventional BIPV/T and therefore support NZEB realisation during global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.","[Pugsley, Adrian; Zacharopoulos, Aggelos; Mondol, Jayanta Deb; Smyth, Mervyn] Ulster Univ, Ctr Sustainable Technol Www Cstulster Ac Uk, Sch Built Environm, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland; [Smyth, Mervyn] Ulster Univ, SolaForm Ltd Www Solaform Com, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland",Ulster University; Ulster University,"Pugsley, A (corresponding author), Ulster Univ, Ctr Sustainable Technol Www Cstulster Ac Uk, Sch Built Environm, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland.",a.pugsley@ulster.ac.uk; a.zacharopoulos@ulster.ac.uk; jd.mondol@ulster.ac.uk; m.smyth1@ulster.ac.uk,,"Pugsley, Adrian/0000-0002-1413-5956",Northern Ireland Department for the Economy; SolaForm Ltd; UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/T004819/1]; European Union FP7 COST Action Building Integration of Solar Thermal Systems [TU1205]; EPSRC [EP/T004819/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Northern Ireland Department for the Economy; SolaForm Ltd; UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); European Union FP7 COST Action Building Integration of Solar Thermal Systems; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This research was enabled in its early stages by studentship funding support from the Northern Ireland Department for the Economy.

In response, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is being reemphasized with calls to revive the practice. Ancient knowledge on RWH - mainly the collection through runoff, storage, and use of rainwater for various purposes - is still relevant, especially for dry environments. However, many old practices and technologies may not be suitable or feasible for the present and future. Little has been done to modernize and (or) develop new practices and technologies based on ancient indigenous knowledge. Modernizing old practices or developing new ones and using them in integrated rangelands restoration packages with enabling policy environment can unlock their potential in many water-scarce regions of the world. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of micro-catchment rainwater harvesting (MIRWH) in dry environments and discusses the opportunities available and the major obstacles faced in using it to restore degraded agro-pastoral ecosystems and support their sustainability. The review highlights the knowledge behind it, the practices developed over the years, and their relevance to today and the future. The paper indicates areas of modernization that can make it more feasible for the future of the dry environments, especially their role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Conventional and passive approaches to restoring/rehabilitating degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems are either too slow to show an obvious impact or not progressing satisfactorily. One main reason is that, because of land degradation, the majority of rain falling on such ecosystems and needed for revegetation is lost with little benefit being gained. Adopting a more progressive intervention to alter the processes of degradation and move towards new system equilibrium is required. MIRWH can enable a large portion of this otherwise lost rainwater to be stored in the soil, and, if used in an integrated packages including suitable plant species and sound grazing management, it may support meaningful vegetation growth and help system restoration. The Badia Benchmark project, implemented by ICARDA in Jordan and Syria, has demonstrated the potential for adoption at large scale in similar environments. This case study illustrates the potential and the constraints of this practice.","[Oweis, Theib Y.] IPDRE, 15 Khalid Abudalbouh St Abdoun Eshamali, Amman, Jordan; [Oweis, Theib Y.] ICARDA, 15 Khalid Abudalbouh St Abdoun Eshamali, Amman, Jordan",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Oweis, TY (corresponding author), IPDRE, 15 Khalid Abudalbouh St Abdoun Eshamali, Amman, Jordan.;Oweis, TY (corresponding author), ICARDA, 15 Khalid Abudalbouh St Abdoun Eshamali, Amman, Jordan.",t.oweis@cgir.org,,,NSERC,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research is sponsored by the NSERC Discovery Grant Development of a model-based phosphorus management tool for manure applications in subsurface drained field.,,128,14,14,2,52,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1208-6053,1181-8700,,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

Changing values for balancing environmental resources, multisectoral human system pressures, and more frequent climate extremes are increasing the complexity of operational decision making. Today, reservoir operations benefit from technological advances, including improved monitoring and forecasting systems as well as increasing computational power. Past research in this area has largely focused on improving solution algorithms within the limits of the available computational power, using simplified problem formulations that can misrepresent important systemic complexities and intersectoral interactions. In this study, we review the recent literature focusing on how the operation design problem is formulated, rather than solved, to address existing challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper contributes a comprehensive classification of over 300 studies published over the last years into distinctive categories depending on the adopted problem formulation, which clarifies consolidated methodological approaches and emerging trends. Our analysis also suggests that control policy design methods may benefit from broadening the types of information that is used to condition operational decisions, and from using emulation modeling to identify low-order, computationally efficient surrogate models capturing realistic representations of river basin systems' complexity in order to isolate key decision-relevant processes. These advances in reservoir operations hold significant promise for better addressing the challenges of conflicting human pressures and a changing world, which is particularly important, given the renewed interest in dam construction globally.","[Giuliani, M.; Castelletti, A.] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy; [Lamontagne, J.

The procedure is addressed to practitioners and hydrologists that operate in data-poor regions. To do so we use 1) goodness-of-fit metrics to conclude on the approximate convergence of the empirical distribution of annual rainfall totals to a normal shape and classify 3007 daily rainfall time series from the NOAA/NCDC Global Historical Climatology Network database, with at least 30 years of recordings, into Gaussian (G) and non-Gaussian (NG) groups; 2) logistic regression analysis to identify the statistics of daily rainfall that are most descriptive of the G/NG classification; and 3) a random-search algorithm to conclude on a set of constraints that allows classification of ART samples on the basis of the marginal statistics of daily rain rates. The analysis shows that the Anderson-Darling (AD) test statistic is the most conservative one in determining approximate Gaussianity of ART samples (followed by Cramer-Von Mises and Lilliefors's version of Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and that daily rainfall time series with fraction of wet days f(wd) < 0.1 and daily skewness coefficient of positive rain rates sk(wd) > 5.92 deviate significantly from the normal shape. In addition, we find that continental climate (type D) exhibits the highest fraction of Gaussian distributed ART samples (i.e., 74.45%; AD test at alpha = 5% significance level), followed by warm temperate (type C; 72.80%), equatorial (type A; 68.83%), polar (type E; 62.96%), and arid (type B; 60.29%) climates.","[Ruggiu, Dario; Viola, Francesco] Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Cagliari, Italy; [Langousis, Andreas] Univ Patras, Dept Civil Engn, Patras, Greece",University of Cagliari; University of Patras,"Ruggiu, D (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Cagliari, Italy.",dario.ruggiu@unica.it,"Viola, Francesco/E-9722-2013","Viola, Francesco/0000-0003-1716-192X",,,,,70,0,0,0,1,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

This paper reviews the risk assessment of permafrost and constructions. Permafrost temperature, permafrost type, topography and geomorphology and vegetation were considered in former works. Permafrost risks and disaster zones were classified in Tibet Plateau and the arctic regions. Engineering risk assessment in cold regions is mainly divided into frost heave risk and thaw settlement risk according to difference mechanism. The present risk evaluation of constructions (tunnel, bridge, roadbed etc.) focuses on the thermal and mechanical stability, and then the probability and risk of structural instability under multi-factors with traditional risk assessment method, such as the expert scoring method, the analytic hierarchy process, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method etc. But there are some shortcomings of these methods. They need large historical data and some of them are subjective. The key of risk evaluation of infrastructures in cold regions is to improve the understanding of the interaction between the infrastructure and ambient factors, especially the climate warming and humidifying. A general coupled model of hydro-thermo-salt-mechanical need to be founded to establish a relatively objective and reliable risk assessment method, combined with numerical simulation and traditional methods.","[Yu, Wenbing; Zhang, Tianqi; Lu, Yan; Hu, Da] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Frozen Soil Engn, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wenbing; Han, Fenglei; Zhou, Yuanfu] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Mt Bridge & Tunnel Engn, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wenbing; Han, Fenglei; Zhou, Yuanfu] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianqi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chongqing Jiaotong University; Chongqing Jiaotong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhang, TQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Frozen Soil Engn, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",zhangtianqi@lzb.ac.cn,"Hu, Da/T-2144-2019","Zhang, Tianqi/0000-0001-8841-7860","National Key Research and Development Plan [2018YFC0809600, 2018YFC0809601]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571070, 51708070]; Funds of Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of CAS [QYZDY-SSW-DQC011]; Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of NIEER, CAS [FEYS2019007];  [SKLFSE-ZQ-49];  [SKLFSE-ZT-21]","National Key Research and Development Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Funds of Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of CAS; Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of NIEER, CAS; ; ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan (2018YFC0809600, 2018YFC0809601) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571070, 51708070), the Funds of Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of CAS (QYZDY-SSW-DQC011), the Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of NIEER, CAS (FEYS2019007) and the fund (SKLFSE-ZQ-49,SKLFSE-ZT-21).",,256,22,23,25,113,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-232X,1872-7441,,COLD REG SCI TECHNOL,Cold Reg.

However, there is still lack of a robust modeling framework of the climate-glacier-streamflow in this water tower region, to project the future changes of glacier mass balance, glacier geometry, and the consequent impacts on runoff. Moreover, it is imperative to use the state-of-the-art sixth phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) to assess glacio-hydrology variations in future. In this study, we coupled a glacio-hydrological model (FLEXG) with a glacier retreat method (Delta h-parameterization) to simulate glacio-hydrological processes in the Dongkemadi Glacier (over 5155 m.a.s.l), which has the longest continuous glacio-hydrology observation on the headwater of Yangtze River. The FLEXG-Delta h model was forced with in-situ observed meteorological data, radar ice thickness, remote sensing topography and land cover data, and validated by measured runoff. The results showed that the model was capable to simulate hydrological processes in this glacierized basin, with Kling-Gupta efficiency (I-KGE) of daily runoff simulation 0.88 in calibration and 0.70 in validation. Then, forcing by the bias-corrected meteorological forcing from the eight latest CMIP6 Earth system models under two climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), we assessed the impact of future climate change on glacier response and its hydrological effects. The results showed that, to the end of simulation in 2100, the volume of the Dongkemadi Glacier would continuously retreat. For the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the glacier volume will decrease by 8.7 x 10(8) m(3) (74%) and 10.8 x 10(8) m(3) (92%) respectively in 2100. The glacier runoff will increase and reach to peak water around 2060 to 2085, after this tipping point water resources will likely decrease. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In two mountain areas with calcium-rich bedrocks, 106 sample plots (2 x 2 m) were selected by a stratified random sampling, to cover a broad range of snow cover, topography and vegetation composition. Study plots include both the northern boreal zone (NB), the low alpine zone (LA), and the middle alpine zone (MA). Soil data, soil temperature and day of snowmelt were sampled from all plots. Fifteen vegetation (cluster) types were classified by the use of TWINSPAN, and these were well separated in a DCA (Detrended Correspondence Analysis) ordination. A CVA (Canonical Variates Analysis) and Monte Carlo Permutation tests showed that the vegetation types were significantly associated with most of the measured environmental variables, with relative altitude, potassium, and Julian day of snowmelt as the most important variables. All study plots showed relatively high values for soil richness and were significantly negatively correlated with the Julian day when the soil temperature threshold (6 degrees C) was reached. The significant relationships between altitude, Julian day of snowmelt, and vegetation composition indicate that major changes may be expected as a consequence of an earlier snowmelt in a warmer world.","[Reinhardt, Stefanie; Odland, Arvid] Telemark Univ Coll, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Environm & Hlth Studies, N-3800 Bo In Telemark, Norway; [Reinhardt, Stefanie] Univ Bergen, Fac Math & Nat Scienes, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",University College of Southeast Norway; University of Bergen,"Reinhardt, S (corresponding author), Telemark Univ Coll, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Environm & Hlth Studies, N-3800 Bo In Telemark, Norway.",Stefanie.Reinhardt@hit.no,,,,,,,49,6,7,0,18,GEBRUDER BORNTRAEGER,STUTTGART,"JOHANNESSTR 3A, D-70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-269X,,,PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,Phytocoenologia,JUN,2013,4-Mar,,,,207,223,,10.1127/0340-269X/2013/0043-0534,http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0340-269X/2013/0043-0534,,,17,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,257FG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000327368400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The new drought indicator quantifies the conditional probability of drought, considering multiple drought-related climate features and their interactive effects, and can be used for forecasting with up to 3-month lead time. The approach was tested out-of-sample across several random selections of training and testing datasets, and demonstrated better predictive capabilities than commonly used drought indicators (e.g., Standardised Precipitation Index and Evaporative Demand Drought Index) in a range of performance metrics. Furthermore, it showed comparable performance to the (expert elicitation-based) US Drought Monitor (USDM), the current state-of-the-art record of historical drought in the USA. As well as providing an alternative historical drought indicator to USDM, the RF approach offers additional advantages by being automated, by providing drought information at the grid-scale, and by having forecasting capacity. While traditional drought metrics define drought as extreme anomalies in drought-related variables, the approach presented here reveals the full suite of circumstances that lead to impactful droughts. We highlight several combinations of climate features-such as precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture and change in water storage-that led to drought events not detected by commonly used drought metrics. The new RF drought indicator combines meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic drought, providing drought information for all impacted sectors. As a proof-of-concept, the RF drought indicator was trained on Texan climate data and droughts.","[Hobeichi, Sanaa; Abramowitz, Gab; Evans, Jason P.; Ukkola, Anna] UNSW Sydney, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hobeichi, Sanaa; Abramowitz, Gab; Evans, Jason P.; Ukkola, Anna] UNSW Sydney, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hobeichi, S (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Hobeichi, S (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",s.hobeichi@unsw.edu.au,"Hobeichi, Sanaa/GLQ-8369-2022; Evans, Jason/F-3716-2011","Evans, Jason/0000-0003-1776-3429; Ukkola, Anna/0000-0003-1207-3146; Hobeichi, Sanaa/0000-0001-6825-3854",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [CE170100023]; ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE200100086]; Australian Government,Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes(Australian Research Council); ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(Australian Research Council); Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR),"The authors acknowledge the support of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CE170100023).

It is therefore important to represent this mechanism in process-based forest growth models used in climate change impact analysis. 3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) is a widely used process-based model that operates on stand-scale and monthly time steps. Yet, this model is currently not able to account for changes in the growing season of deciduous tree species. Therefore, we developed a method to model a dynamic growing season length with 3-PG. This method presents a novel approach to model dynamic leaf phenology with a monthly-time step model. We used a linear regression for calculating leaf onset and leaf senescence dates in response to temperature averages. The changes in the order of magnitude of days are then translated into monthly fractions. Further, we made some improvements to previous approaches of modelling the deciduous leaf cycle with 3-PG and we parameterized two model versions of 3-PG for sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) stands in Southwest Germany. The two model versions differed in presenting a i) constant and ii) dynamic growing season length. We used these model versions to estimate changes in sessile oak forest productivity under future climate scenarios. By comparing both model versions, we could disentangle the net effect of lengthening of the growing season on stem growth. By the end of the century, we observed on average 3 - 8 % increase in accumulated stem growth resulting from a lengthening of the growing season. At 1 degrees C temperature increase, the lengthening of the growing season accounted for +3.3 % of accumulated stem growth (assuming unchanged precipitation). Leaf-unfolding advanced on average by 9 - 15 days and leaf senescence was delayed by 6 - 11 days for the period 2070-2100 compared to 1985-2015; for simulations of rcp 4.5 and 8.5 respectively. Overall, sessile oak productivity remained rather unchanged under future climate scenarios for Southwest Germany. Yet, we observed significant differences between sites (-6 % to +14 % in mean annual volume increment) as well as for different climate change scenarios and models (-2 % to +11 % in mean annual volume increment). We also modelled and discussed how assumptions on CO2 fertilization effects influenced 3-PG simulations.","[Noelte, Anja; Yousefpour, Rasoul; Hanewinkel, Marc] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Nolte, A (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",anja.noelte@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Nolte, Anja/0000-0003-1355-3942",German WaldKlimaFonds [28W-A-4-074-01]; Marie Skodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) project SuFoRun within European Union's H2020 research and innovation programme [691149],German WaldKlimaFonds; Marie Skodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) project SuFoRun within European Union's H2020 research and innovation programme,"The authors acknowledge funding from the German WaldKlimaFonds with grant number 28W-A-4-074-01.

Although these smart systems can provide adaptable shading during the year, they cannot meet the varying thermal comfort needs of building users in a short time because the microalgae medium's culture remains almost unchanged during the day. This paper reports on an innovative method that helps microalgae bioreactive facade respond to solar radiation and users' thermal needs in a short time. To achieve it, a smart window panel will be introduced, which contains two remotely-controlled adjustable bioreactors which can regulate the algae medium in height based on the users' thermal needs. This novel panel can serve as a bio-adaptable sunshade integrated with the building facade. Thus, the internal building thermal loads can be adjusted via the height of the bioreactor facade. Experimental and simulation research was conducted to compare the thermal performance of bioreactor facades at different microalgae medium height levels in the BSk climate zone. The results indicate that indoor and outdoor temperature differences for full, 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 medium height level every 15-minute time interval are 12.55, 11.50, 10.87, and 6.53, respectively, indicating that the full-height level has the most influence to control the thermal load of the system. According to the results, the bioreactor facade with adjustable medium height greatly impacts building thermal control in a short time.","[Talaei, Maryam; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad; Haghighi, Hadi Motevali; Atashdast, Ali] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Jalal Ale Ahmad St, Tehran 14115111, Iran; [Talaei, Maryam] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Azadi Sq, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Azari, Rahman] Penn State Univ, Coll Arts & Architecture, State Coll, PA 16801 USA",Tarbiat Modares University; Ferdowsi University Mashhad; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Mahdavinejad, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Jalal Ale Ahmad St, Tehran 14115111, Iran.",mahdavinejad@modares.ac.ir,,"Talaei, Maryam/0000-0002-9428-116X; Azari, Rahman/0000-0002-4844-639X",,,,,64,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

The benefits to the plant gained through the rhizobial-legume symbiosis can be further enhanced by associations of the legume with arbuscular mycorrhiza. The progressive engagement of the legume host with the rhizobial bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi requires an extensive exchange of signalling molecules. These signals alter the transcriptional profiles of the partners, guiding and enabling extensive microbial and fungal proliferation in the roots. Such interactions and associations are greatly influenced by environmental stresses, which also severely limit the productivity of legume crops. Part II of the Special Issue on Legumes provides new insights into the mechanisms that underpin sustainable symbiotic partnerships, as well as the effects of abiotic stresses, such as drought, waterlogging, and salinity on legume biology.

In such studies, statistics of crop yields are usually evaluated without the explicit consideration of sample size requirements. The purpose of this paper was to identify minimum sample sizes for the estimation of average, standard deviation and skewness of maize and winterwheat yields based on simulations carried out under a range of climate and soil conditions. Our results indicate that 15 years of simulated crop yields are sufficient to estimate average crop yields with a relative error of less than 10% at 95% confidence. Regarding standard deviation and skewness, sample size requirements depend on the degree of symmetry of the underlying population's distribution. For symmetric distributions, samples of 200 and 1500 yield observations are needed to estimate the crop yields' standard deviation and skewness coefficient, respectively. Higher degrees of asymmetry increase the sample size requirements relative to the estimation of the standard deviation, while at the same time the sample size requirements relative to the skewness coefficient are decreased.","[Lehmann, Niklaus] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agrifood & Agrienvironm Econ Grp, Inst Environm Decis, Sonneggstr 33 SOL C7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Finger, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Klein, Tommy; Calanca, Pierlu Gi] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Lehmann, N (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agrifood & Agrienvironm Econ Grp, Inst Environm Decis, Sonneggstr 33 SOL C7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",nlehmann@ethz.ch; robert.finger@wur.nl; tommy.klein@agroscope.admin.ch; pierluigi.calanca@agroscope.admin.ch,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",Swiss National Science Foundation [61],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation in the framework of the National Research Programme 61.

In this paper, 30-year simulations of daily maximum grid point temperatures are compared with the 30-year series recorded in Moravia. Attention is focused on annual cycles and autocorrelation functions. In estimating the autocorrelation coefficients, the standard procedure and jack-knife method are applied to the series with and without seasonal decomposition. It is shown that the jack-knife estimates of variance are generally smaller than those assessed by a standard technique for the series with seasonal cycle. However, if seasonal cycle is removed from the series, the jack-knife estimates of variance may become larger. The t-statistic shows that differences in autocorrelation among the stations as well as among the grid points are not statistically significant while differences between the stations and grid points proved to be statistically significant.

CESM is a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice-land model and its ocean component (the Parallel Ocean Program version 2; POP2) includes a biogeochemical component (the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model; BEC). MEDUSA was coupled to POP2 in an offline manner so that each of the models ran separately and sequentially with regular exchanges of necessary boundary condition fields. This development was done with the ambitious aim of a future application for long-term (spanning a full glacial cycle; i.e. similar to 10(5) years) climate simulations with a state-of-the-art comprehensive climate model including the carbon cycle, and was motivated by the fact that until now such simulations have been done only with less-complex climate models. We found that the sediment-model coupling already had non-negligible immediate advantages for ocean biogeochemistry in millennial-timescale simulations. First, the MEDUSA-coupled CESM outperformed the uncoupled CESM in reproducing an observation-based global distribution of sediment properties, especially for organic carbon and opal. Thus, the coupled model is expected to act as a better bridge between climate dynamics and sedimentary data, which will provide another measure of model performance. Second, in our experiments, the MEDUSA-coupled model and the uncoupled model had a difference of 0.2 parts per thousand or larger in terms of delta C-13 of bottom water over large areas, which implied a potentially significant model uncertainty for bottom seawater chemical composition due to a different way of sediment treatment. For example, an ocean model that does not treat sedimentary processes depending on the chemical composition of the ambient water can overestimate the amount of remineralization of organic matter in the upper sediment in an anoxic environment, which would lead to lighter delta C-13 values in the bottom water. Such a model uncertainty would be a fundamental issue for paleo model-data comparison often relying on data derived from benthic foraminifera.","[Kurahashi-Nakamura, Takasumi; Paul, Andre; Merkel, Ute; Schulz, Michael] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Kurahashi-Nakamura, Takasumi; Paul, Andre; Merkel, Ute; Schulz, Michael] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany; [Munhoven, Guy] Univ Liege, Lab Phys Atmospher & Planetaire, Liege, Belgium",University of Bremen; University of Bremen; University of Liege,"Kurahashi-Nakamura, T (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, Germany.;Kurahashi-Nakamura, T (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany.",tkurahashi@marum.de,"Schulz, Michael/P-7276-2016","Schulz, Michael/0000-0001-6500-2697; Merkel, Ute/0000-0001-9851-0575",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ: 01LP1505D],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research has been supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) (grant no.

Our study indicates that the number of human settlements found scattered over the peninsula have quadrupled from the prehistoric to historical periods and that this evolution occurred over periods of climate change and seismo-tectonic activity. We show that societal development occurs both during periods of harsh as well as favourable climatic conditions. At some times, some settlements develop while others decline. Well-known climate events such as the 4.2 ka and 3.2 ka events are recognizable in some of the palaeoclimatic records and a regional decline in the number and sizes of settlements occurs roughly at the same time, but their precise chronological fit with the archaeological record remains uncertain. Local socio-political processes were probably always the key drivers behind the diverse strategies that human societies took in times of changing climate. The study thus reveals considerable chronological parallels between societal development and palaeoenvironmental records, but also demonstrates the ambiguities in these correspondences and, in doing so, highlights some of the challenges that will face future interdisciplinary projects. We suggest that there can be no general association made between societal expansion phases and periods of advantageous climate.

Under the influence of climate change and intensified cryospheric melt, river runoff has changed markedly at the TP, with significant effects on the spatial and temporal water resource distribution that threaten water supply and food security for people living downstream. Despite some in situ observations and discharge estimates from state-of-the-art remote sensing technology, the total river runoff (TRR) for the TP has never been reliably quantified, and its response to climate change remains unclear. As part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road, the TP-River project aims to construct a comprehensive runoff observation network at mountain outlets (where rivers leave the mountains and enter the plains) for 13 major rivers in the TP region, thereby enabling TRR to be accurately quantified. The project also integrates discharge estimates from remote sensing and cryosphere-hydrology modeling to investigate long-term changes in TRR and the relationship between the TRR variations and westerly/monsoon. Based on recent efforts, the project provides the first estimate (656 +/- 23 billion m(3)) of annual TRR for the 13 TP rivers in 2018. The annual river runoff at the mountain outlets varies widely between the different TP rivers, ranging from 2 to 176 billion m(3), with higher values mainly corresponding to rivers in the Indian monsoon domain, rather than in the westerly domain.","[Wang, Lei; Yao, Tandong; Chai, Chenhao; Cuo, Lan; Su, Fengge; Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Yinsheng; Li, Xiuping; Qi, Jia; Liu, Jingshi; Wang, Yuanwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei; Yao, Tandong; Chai, Chenhao; Zhang, Fan; Qi, Jia; Wang, Yuanwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei; Yao, Tandong; Cuo, Lan; Su, Fengge; Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Yinsheng; Li, Xiuping] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Tandong; Yao, Zhijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zhidan] Minist Water Resources, Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, L (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wanglei@itpcas.ac.cn,"Wang, Lei/B-3113-2019; zhang, fan/E-2398-2018","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-7201-8715; zhang, fan/0000-0002-6714-9534; Wang, Yuanwei/0000-0001-7394-799X","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060202, XDA19070301]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [2019QZKK020604]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP),"This project was financially supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20060202 and XDA19070301), and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) (2019QZKK020604).

This fact, together with its strong mechanical anisotropy and other notable properties, makes natural ice an interesting model material for studying the high-temperature creep and recrystallization of rocks in Earth's interior. After having reviewed the major contributions of deep ice coring to the research on natural ice microstructures in Part I of this work (Faria et al., 2014), here in Part II we present an up-to-date view of the modern understanding of natural ice microstructures and the deformation processes that may produce them. In particular, we analyze a large body of evidence that reveals fundamental flaws in the widely accepted tripartite paradigm of polar ice microstructure (also known as the three-stage model, cf. Part I). These results prove that grain growth in ice sheets is dynamic, in the sense that it occurs during deformation and is markedly affected by the stored strain energy, as well as by air inclusions and other impurities. The strong plastic anisotropy of the ice lattice gives rise to high internal stresses and concentrated strain heterogeneities in the polycrystal, which demand large amounts of strain accommodation. From the microstructural analyses of ice cores, we conclude that the formation of many and diverse subgrain boundaries and the splitting of grains by rotation recrystallization are the most fundamental mechanisms of dynamic recovery and strain accommodation in polar ice. Additionally, in fine-grained, high-impurity ice layers (e.g. cloudy bands), strain may sometimes be accommodated by diffusional flow (at low temperatures and stresses) or microscopic grain boundary sliding via microshear (in anisotropic ice sheared at high temperatures). Grain boundaries bulged by migration recrystallization and subgrain boundaries are endemic and very frequent at almost all depths in ice sheets. Evidence of nucleation of new grains is also observed at various depths, provided that the local concentration of strain energy is high enough (which is not seldom the case). As a substitute for the tripartite paradigm, we propose a novel dynamic recrystallization diagram in the three-dimensional state space of strain rate, temperature, and mean grain size, which summarizes the various competing recrystallization processes that contribute to the evolution of the polar ice microstructure.

The intensity and large storm damage associated with Kyrill is explained based on synoptic and mesoscale environmental storm features, as well as on comparisons to previous storms. Kyrill appeared on weather maps over the US state of Arkansas about four days before it hit Europe. It underwent an explosive intensification over the Western North Atlantic Ocean while crossing a very intense zonal polar jet stream. A superposition of several favourable meteorological conditions west of the British Isles caused a further deepening of the storm when it started to affect Western Europe. Evidence is provided that a favourable alignment of three polar jet streaks and a dry air intrusion over the occlusion and cold fronts were causal factors in maintaining Kyrill's low pressure very far into Eastern Europe. Kyrill, like many other strong European winter storms, was embedded in a pre-existing, anomalously wide, north-south mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) gradient field. In addition to the range of gusts that might be expected from the synoptic-scale pressure field, mesoscale features associated with convective overturning at the cold front are suggested as the likely causes for the extremely damaging peak gusts observed at many lowland stations during the passage of Kyrill's cold front. Compared to other storms, Kyrill was by far not the most intense system in terms of core pressure and circulation anomaly. However, the system moved into a pre-existing strong MSLP gradient located over Central Europe which extended into Eastern Europe. This fact is considered determinant for the anomalously large area affected by Kyrill. Additionally, considerations of windiness in climate change simulations using two state-of-the-art regional climate models driven by ECHAM5 indicate that not only Central, but also Eastern Central Europe may be affected by higher surface wind speeds at the end of the 21st century. These changes are partially associated with the increased pressure gradient over Europe which is identified in the ECHAM5 simulations. Thus, with respect to the area affected, as well as to the synoptic and mesoscale storm features, it is proposed that Kyrill may serve as an interesting study case to assess future storm impacts.","[Fink, A.

The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by E-ns = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61-22.53%) and (8.26-8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.","[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi] Univ Anbar, Coll Engn, Dams & Water Resources Dept, Ramadi, Iraq; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Life Sci & Environm, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia; [Chau, Kwok-Wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Ton Duc Thang University; University of Anbar; University of Southern Queensland; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Chau, Kwok-wing/E-5235-2011; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi/I-6570-2016; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018","Chau, Kwok-wing/0000-0001-6457-161X; Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi/0000-0001-6240-5685; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137",,,,,171,352,359,54,546,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Crop contamination with these dangerous toxins transcends health, food security, and trade sectors. It cuts across the value chain, affecting farmers, traders, markets, and finally consumers. Diverse fungi within Aspergillus section Flavi contaminate crops with aflatoxins. Within these Aspergillus communities, several genotypes are not capable of producing aflatoxins (atoxigenic). Carefully selected atoxigenic genotypes in biological control (biocontrol) formulations efficiently reduce aflatoxin contamination of crops when applied prior to flowering in the field. This safe and environmentally friendly, effective technology was pioneered in the US, where well over a million acres of susceptible crops are treated annually. The technology has been improved for use in sub-Saharan Africa, where efforts are under way to develop biocontrol products, under the trade name Aflasafe, for 11 African nations. The number of participating nations is expected to increase. In parallel, state of the art technology has been developed for large-scale inexpensive manufacture of Aflasafe products under the conditions present in many African nations. Results to date indicate that all Aflasafe products, registered and under experimental use, reduce aflatoxin concentrations in treated crops by > 80% in comparison to untreated crops in both field and storage conditions. Benefits of aflatoxin biocontrol technologies are discussed along with potential challenges, including climate change, likely to be faced during the scaling-up of Aflasafe products. Lastly, we respond to several apprehensions expressed in the literature about the use of atoxigenic genotypes in biocontrol formulations. These responses relate to the following apprehensions: sorghum as carrier, distribution costs, aflatoxin-conscious markets, efficacy during drought, post-harvest benefits, risk of allergies and/or aspergillosis, influence of Aflasafe on other mycotoxins and on soil microenvironment, dynamics of Aspergillus genotypes, and recombination between atoxigenic and toxigenic genotypes in natural conditions.","[Bandyopadhyay, R.; Ortega-Beltran, A.; Kaptoge, L.] IITA, PMB 5320,Oyo Rd, Ibadan 200001, Nigeria; [Akande, A.] IITA, PMB 82,Garki GPO, Kubwa, Abuja, Nigeria; [Mutegi, C.] IITA, ILRI Campus,POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Atehnkeng, J.] IITA, Chitedze Res Stn, Off Mchinji Rd,POB 30258, Lilongwe 3, Malawi; [Senghor, A.

These sub-cities are broadly classified as a garden city (LCZ 5(A)), a resettlement colony (LCZ 3), a mixed land-use city (LCZ 5), and an industrial city (LCZ 5(6)). The surface UHI (UHISurf) is estimated using Google Earth Engine with MODIS, canopy layer UHI (UHIUCL) with meteorological data, and density using Spacematrix. The nighttime UHIUCL is 7.52 degrees C (LCZ 5 and LCZ(A)) and the UHI(Surf )is 5.2 degrees C (LCZ 5 and LCZ D). A major apprehension is the residual temperature at sunrise (5-8 degrees C) leading to high heat stress and detrimental health impacts. The heating and cooling rate, reduced by a factor of three is observed (LCZ 5-0.25 degrees C/h). The least UHI is experienced by LCZ 5(A) and the built density is highest in LCZ 3.

With regard to aeronautical applications, creating autonomous wireless sensor nodes can potentially help to drive the maintenance costs for civil aviation companies down, by converting some of the regular maintenance checks to an on demand basis. Thermoelectric energy harvesting can be used in environments where temperature differences occur naturally or are a byproduct of a process, preferentially in areas difficult to reach. By using phase change materials (PCMs) attached to one side of a thermoelectric generator (TEG), the temperature difference across the device can be temporarily enhanced, leading to increased electrical energy production. Thermoelectric energy harvesting using PCMs has been previously explored as an electrical energy source, in subfreezing temperature environments and its potential has been evaluated most recently both theoretically and experimentally, but most importantly proven over a six month flight test campaign. Furthermore, the performance of tailored TEGs in combination with different PCMs has been studied up to temperatures of 190 degrees C. In order to expand on previous results, state of the art TEG sets made by Micropelt were installed on two identical aluminium containers. The containers were redesigned to include a mounting ring for easier aircraft installation. Simulations as well as experiments in a climate chamber and on a hot plate were performed. With the latter approach the heating rates typically found near the pylon area are mimicked whereas the first is used to assess different potential ambient conditions in general. In addition, previously used erythritol is compared to H120 offered by PCM-Products Ltd., allowing to investigate and to evaluate the effect different PCMs have on the energy output.

We analyze multimodel ensemble simulations from phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and find that not only do Earth system models simulate positive SESA precipitation trends that are much weaker over the historical interval, but some models persistently simulate negative SESA precipitation trends under historical forcings. Similarly, 16-member ensembles from two atmospheric models forced with observed historical sea surface temperatures never simulate precipitation trends that even reach the lower bound of the observed trend's range of uncertainty. Moreover, while future twenty-first-century projections from CMIP6 yield positive ensemble mean precipitation trends over SESA that grow with increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the mean forced response never exceeds the observed historical trend. Preindustrial control runs from CMIP6 indicate that some models do occasionally simulate centennial-scale trends in SESA that fall within the observational range, but most models do not. Results point to significant uncertainties in the attribution of anthropogenically forced influences on the observed increases in precipitation over SESA while also suggesting that internal decadal-to-centennial variability of unknown origin and not present in state-of-the-art models may have also played a large role in generating the twentieth-to-twenty-first-century SESA precipitation trend.","[Varuolo-Clarke, Arianna M.; Smerdon, Jason E.; Williams, A.
