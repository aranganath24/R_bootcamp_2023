Investigating internal factor changes in metropolitan areas are of great significance for improving the quality of development in these areas. As an emerging national central city of China, Zhengzhou has experienced rapid urban expansion and urbanization. In this study, principal component analysis and the model and Geodetector model were used to comprehensively analyze the influencing factors of land use change in Zhengzhou from 1980 to 2015. Based on the CA-Markov model, we improved the accuracy of multi-criteria evaluation of suitability factors and simulated land use change in 2015. The results show that land use conversions in the study area between 1980 and 2015 were frequent, with the areas of farmland, woodland, grassland, water, and unused land decreasing by 5.00%, 17.12%, 21.59%, 18.31%, and 94.48%, respectively, while construction land increased by 53.61%. The key influences on land use change are the urbanization and growth of residential or non-agricultural populations. In 2035, the area of farmland in the study area will decrease by 11.09% compared with that in 2015 and construction land will increase by 38.94%, while the area of other land use types will not significantly change. Zhengzhou, as the center city, forms a diamond-shaped core development area of Zhengzhou-Kaifeng-Xinxiang-Jiaozuo, while Xuchang is considered an independent sub-center uniting the surrounding cities for expansion. With its radiation power of unipolar core development for many years and the developmental momentum of Zhengzhou-Kaifeng integration, Zhengzhou city jointly drives the economic development of the surrounding cities. The protection of farmland and control of the expansion of construction land are the major challenges for the Zhengzhou metropolitan area to achieve sustainable development.","[Zhao, Xiuyan; Miao, Changhong] Henan Univ, Key Res Inst Yellow River Civilizat & Sustainable, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiuyan; Miao, Changhong] Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China",Henan University; Henan University,"Miao, CH (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Key Res Inst Yellow River Civilizat & Sustainable, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China.;Miao, CH (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.",chhmiao@henu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171186]; Major Project of China National Social Science Fund in Art [21ZD03],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Project of China National Social Science Fund in Art,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Fund project host: Miao Changhong), grant number 42171186; The Major Project of China National Social Science Fund in Art (Foundation sub-project host: Miao Changhong), grant number 21ZD03.",,82,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Recent studies have pointed out a tight linkage between the atmospheric mole fractions of the NMHC ethane and the atmospheric growth rate of methane. Consequently, atmospheric NMHC are valuable indicators for tracking changes in anthropogenic emissions, photochemical ozone production, and greenhouse gases. This study investigates the 1950-2010 Northern Hemisphere atmospheric C-2-C-5 NMHC ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane by (a) reconstructing atmospheric mole fractions of these trace gases using firn air extracted from three boreholes in 2008 and 2009 at the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) site and applying state-of-the-art models of trace gas transport in firn, and by (b) considering eight years of ambient NMHC monitoring data from five Arctic sites within the NOAA Global Monitoring Division (GMD) Cooperative Air Sampling Network. Results indicate that these NMHC increased by similar to 40-120% after 1950, peaked around 1980 (with the exception of ethane, which peaked approximately 10 yr earlier), and have since dramatically decreased to be now back close to 1950 levels. The earlier peak time of ethane vs. the C-3-C-5 NMHC suggests that different processes and emissions mitigation measures contributed to the decline in these NMHC. The 60 yr record also illustrates notable increases in the ratios of the isomeric iso-/n-butane and iso-/n-pentane ratios. Comparison of the reconstructed NMHC histories with 19502000 volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions data and with other recently published ethane trend analyses from ambient air Pacific transect data showed (a) better agreement with North America and Western Europe emissions than with total Northern Hemisphere emissions data, and (b) better agreement with other Greenland firn air data NMHC history reconstructions than with the Pacific region trends. These analyses emphasize that for NMHC, having atmospheric lifetimes on the order of <2 months, the Greenland firn air records are primarily a representation of Western Europe and North America emission histories.","[Helmig, D.; Petrenko, V.; Hueber, J.; Thompson, C.; White, J.

Enhanced mesospheric cloud occurrence has frequently been detected near 80-kilometer altitude a few days after rocket launches. Here, unique evidence for cirrus formation in the tropopause region caused by ice nucleation in the exhaust plume from an Ariane 5-ECA rocket is presented. Meteorological reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts show significant ice supersaturation at the 100-hectopascal level in the American tropical tropopause region on November 26, 2011. Near 17-kilometer altitudes, the temperatures are below the Schmidt. Appleman thresh old temperature for rocket condensation trail formation on that day. Immediately after the launch from the Ariane 5-ECA at 18: 39 UT (universal time) from Kourou, French Guiana, the formation of a rocket con trail is detected in the high resolution visible channel from the SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) on the METEOSAT-9 satellite. The rocket contrail is transported to the south and its dispersion is followed in SEVIRI data for almost 2 h. The ice crystals predominantly nucleated on aluminum oxide particles emitted by the Ariane 5-ECA solid booster and further grow by uptake of water vapor emitted from the cryogenic main stage and entrained from the ice super-saturated ambient atmosphere. After rocket launches, the formation of rocket contrails can be a frequent phenomenon under ice supersaturated conditions. However, at present launch rates, the global climate impact from rocket contrail cirrus in the tropopause region is small.","[Voigt, Ch.; Schumann, U.; Graf, K.] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Voigt, Ch.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys Atmosphare, 21 Johannes Joachim Becher Weg, D-55099 Mainz, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Voigt, C (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.;Voigt, C (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys Atmosphare, 21 Johannes Joachim Becher Weg, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,2,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",,,978-5-94588-191-4,,,,2016,,,,,183,196,,10.1051/eucass/201608183,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/eucass/201608183,,,14,"Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Mechanics,BG8IO,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,12/21/22,WOS:000392325500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the paper addresses Iceland during the medieval period (with a secondary, comparative focus on Norse Greenland) and discusses episodes where environmental and climatic changes have appeared to cross key thresholds for agricultural productivity. The paper draws upon international, interdisciplinary research in the North Atlantic region led by the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) and the Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES) in the Circumpolar Networks program of the Integrated History and Future of People on Earth (IHOPE). By interlinking analyses of historically grounded literature with archaeological studies and environmental science, valuable new perspectives can emerge on how these past societies may have understood and coped with such impacts. As climate and other environmental changes do not operate in isolation, vulnerabilities created by socioeconomic factors also beg consideration. The paper illustrates the benefits of an integrated environmental-studies approach that draws on data, methodologies and analytical tools of environmental humanities, social sciences, and geosciences to better understand long-term human ecodynamics and changing human-landscape-environment interactions through time. One key goal is to apply previously unused data and concerted expertise to illuminate human responses to past changes; a secondary aim is to consider how lessons derived from these cases may be applicable to environmental threats and socioecological risks in the future, especially as understood in light of the New Human Condition, the concept transposed from Hannah Arendt's influential framing of the human condition that is foregrounded in the present special issue. This conception admits human agency's role in altering the conditions for life on earth, in large measure negatively, while acknowledging the potential of this self-same agency, if effectively harnessed and properly directed, to sustain essential planetary conditions through a salutary transformation of human perception, understanding and remedial action. The paper concludes that more long-term historical analyses of cultures and environments need to be undertaken at various scales. Past cases do not offer perfect analogues for the future, but they can contribute to a better understanding of how resilience and vulnerability occur, as well as how they may be compromised or mitigated.","[Hartman, Steven] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Tourism Studies & Geog, S-83125 Ostersund, Sweden; [Hartman, Steven; Ogilvie, A.

Thus, the present work focuses on the in-fluence of Co-enriched substrate surface zones and their thickness on the microstructure and mechanical prop-erties of state-of-the-art TiN/TiC0.6N0.4/alpha-Al2O3 coatings synthesized using chemical vapor deposition. Complementary cross-sectional energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron back-scatter diffraction maps provided insight into the grain size, preferred orientation and phase composition of coatings and substrates. While the hardness and Young's modulus of the coatings were hardly affected by the Co-enriched surface zone and its thickness, nanoindentation maps performed on the cross-sections of the substrates confirmed a lower hardness and Young's modulus in zones with higher Co content. Furthermore, it was found that the Co-enriched surface zone and its thickness have no effect on the thermal crack networks of the coatings. Rockwell-indentation tests demonstrated a reduction of the coating adhesion with increasing thickness of the Co-enriched surface zone. As determined by X-Ray diffraction, the tensile residual stress in both, the TiC0.6N0.4 and alpha-Al2O3, decreased with increasing thickness of the Co-enriched surface zone. Complementary finite element method simulations have shown that plastic deformation due to creep in the substrate and the Co-enriched surface zone only has a minor influence on the residual stress in the coating. The results obtained within this work contribute to a better un-derstanding of the influence of a Co-enriched surface zone and its thickness on the performance of TiN/ TiC0.6N0.4/alpha-Al2O3 coated cutting tools.","[Konstantiniuk, Fabian; Schalk, Nina] Montanunivers Leoben, Christian Doppler Lab Adv Coated Cutting Tools, Dept Mat Sci, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Krobath, Martin; Ecker, Werner] Leoben Forsch GmbH, Mat Ctr, Roseggerstr 12, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Tkadletz, Michael] Montanunivers Leoben, Dept Mat Sci, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Czettl, Christoph] CERATIZIT Austria GmbH, Metallwerk Plansee Str 71, A-6600 Reutte, Austria",Plansee Holding AG,"Konstantiniuk, F (corresponding author), Montanunivers Leoben, Christian Doppler Lab Adv Coated Cutting Tools, Dept Mat Sci, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",fabian.konstantiniuk@unileoben.ac.at,,,"COMET program within the K2 Center Integrated Computational Material, Process and Product Engineering (IC-MPPE) [886385]; Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); federal state of Styria; federal state of Upper Austria; federal state of Tyrol","COMET program within the K2 Center Integrated Computational Material, Process and Product Engineering (IC-MPPE); Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); federal state of Styria; federal state of Upper Austria; federal state of Tyrol","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support under the scope of the COMET program within the K2 Center Integrated Computational Material, Process and Product Engineering (IC-MPPE) (Project 886385).

The essential causes behind these problems come from the social-ecological system vulnerability (SESV) of villages. This paper aims to propose an evaluation index system for rural SESV that focuses on the rural planning strategies for local decision makers with regard to the vulnerability principal components in the Northeast China Plain. Taking 30 villages as evaluation samples, this paper constructed an SESV index and established a model for measuring the vulnerability degrees. Further, principal component analysis was used to analyze the primary principal components of rural SESV dimensions, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, helping in SESV-type classification and efficient planning strategies and policies correspondingly. Results obtained revealed that 56.7% of the sample villages have high or serious vulnerability, which is mainly affected by the impact of land use changes and population changes. Thirty villages were divided into three SESV types, with a ratio of 11:18:5. This research can provide a decision-making basis to reduce rural SESV and improve the human settlement planning.","[Yu, Tingting; Leng, Hong; Yuan, Qing; Jiang, Cunyan] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, 66 Xidazhi St, Harbin 150006, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tingting; Leng, Hong; Yuan, Qing; Jiang, Cunyan] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, 66 Xidazhi St, Harbin 150006, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Yuan, Q (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, 66 Xidazhi St, Harbin 150006, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.;Yuan, Q (corresponding author), Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, 66 Xidazhi St, Harbin 150006, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",hitytting@hit.edu.cn; hitlaura@hit.edu.cn; hityq@126.com; hit_jcy@163.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0704705]; 66th China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M661284]; Heilongjiang Province Social-science Research Project [20SHC179]; Heilongjiang Province Art Science Planning Project [2020C020],National Key R&D Program of China; 66th China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Heilongjiang Province Social-science Research Project; Heilongjiang Province Art Science Planning Project,"This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (Project No. 2018YFC0704705), the 66th China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Project No. 2019M661284), Heilongjiang Province Social-science Research Project (Project No. 20SHC179), and Heilongjiang Province Art Science Planning Project (Project No. 2020C020).",,60,0,0,20,41,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9488,1943-5444,,J URBAN PLAN DEV,J.

Managing biodiversity data implies dealing with its heterogeneous nature using semantics and tailored ontologies. These are themselves differently conceived, and combining them in semantically enabled applications necessitates an effective alignment between their concepts. This paper describes the ontology matching of biodiversity- and ecology-related ontologies. We illustrate diverse challenges introduced by this kind of ontologies to ontology matching in general. Real use cases requiring pairwise alignments between environment and trait ontologies are introduced. We describe our experience creating a new track at the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative designed for this specific domain and report on the results obtained by state-of-the-art participating systems. The biodiversity and ecology use case turns out to be a strong one for ontology matching, introducing new interesting challenges. Even if most of the matching systems perform relatively well in the proposed matching tasks, there is still room for improvement.

We investigated the individual and spatial patterns in the feeding of two dominant zooplanktivorous clupeids-herring Clupea harengus membras and sprat Sprattus sprattus-in the Baltic Sea in summer, by means of a taxonomic analysis of stomach content. Both species consumed predominantly the small-sized copepods (Temora longicornis, Eurytemora affinis, and Acartia spp.). E. affinis and T. longicornis were generally positively selected by both species. Centropages hamatus was selected only by sprat. With the exception of Pleopis/ Podon spp. in the case of small sprat, the remaining prey, i. e. the zooplankton taxa that were found in fish stomachs, were consumed at similar proportions as they occurred in zooplankton. Stomach fullness of fish increased with the increasing proportions of prey in the zooplankton community. The share of empty stomachs was lower for sprat, and among smaller fish in both species. Pairwise dietary overlap between fish decreased when zooplankton diversity increased. Dietary overlap was also lowest among the individuals of sprat, probably due to the wider diet spectrum and diversity of stomach content compared to herring. Our results point to high interspecific competition, where sprat seems to be more successful than herring in finding and consuming prey, and therefore may have an advantage over herring when the zooplankton community is dominated by small-sized taxa.","[Ojaveer, Henn; Lankov, Ain; Klais, Riina] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia; [Raid, Tiit; Pollumae, Arno] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute,"Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273",BONUS - European Union [Art 185]; Estonian Research Council [2012-60]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0180005s10],"BONUS - European Union; Estonian Research Council; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)","We thank Sally Clink for language editing.

A new arrival in the family of solar cells technologies is the organic-inorganic halide perovskite. The major thrust for endorsing these new solar cells pertains to their potential as an economically and environmentally viable option to traditional silicon-based technology. To verify this assertion, this paper presents a critical review of some existing photovoltaic (PV) technologies in comparison with perovskite-structured solar cells (PSCs), including material and performance parameters, production processes and manufacturing complexity, economics, key technological challenges for further developments and current research efforts. At present, there is limited environmental assessment of PSCs and consequently, a methodologically robust and environmentally expansive lifecycle supply chain assessment of two types of PSC modules A and B is also undertaken within the context of other PV technologies, to assess their potential for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. Module A is based on MAPbX(3) perovskite structure while module B is based on CsFAPbX(3) with improved stability, reproducibility and high performance efficiency. The main outcomes, presented along with sensitivity analysis, show that PSCs offer more environmentally friendly and sustainable option, with the least energy payback period, as compared to other PV technologies. The review and analysis presented provide valuable insight and guidance in identifying pathways and windows of opportunity for future PV designs towards cleaner and sustainable energy production.","[Ibn-Mohammed, T.; Koh, S.

However, investigating the performance of passive techniques from one of the energy, economic and environmental (3E) perspectives is insufficient, as several factors from each aspect have a critical influence on the effectiveness of these techniques. This paper provides an in-depth review on the 3E potential of passive design strategies and recommends suitable ones, individually or in combination, depending on building features and climatic conditions. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated based on key indicators in the 3E points of view, such as energy saving, payback period and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. The results revealed that most passive strategies have proven to be effective in reducing the energy demand and carbon footprint of buildings when they are well designed. Economically, not all strategies are cost-effective, as strategies such as phase change materials, shading, green roofs and green walls have exhibited longer payback periods. Furthermore, the combination of several passive techniques has yielded significant outcomes in the 3E perspective, resulting in energy savings of 6.7-66.2% and life cycle cost reductions of 12-52%, with payback periods of 0.5-84 years. The higher payback periods of some passive strategies are mainly due to the high capital costs required to implement them. Thus, exploring all features affecting the 3E benefits of passive approaches is crucial to improving their efficiency.","[Elaouzy, Y.; El Fadar, A.] Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Natl Sch Appl Sci Tangier, Lab Innovat Technol, Tetouan, Morocco",Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan,"El Fadar, A (corresponding author), Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Natl Sch Appl Sci Tangier, Lab Innovat Technol, Tetouan, Morocco.",aelfadar@uae.ac.ma,,"ELAOUZY, YOUSSEF/0000-0002-4617-8467; El Fadar, Abdellah/0000-0001-8662-4495",,,,,170,0,0,20,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Terrestrial trophic magnification factors derived from lipid normalized concentrations (TMFLs) for D5 and D6 were 0.94 (0.17 SE) and 1.1 (0.23 SE) and not statistically different from 1 (p > 0.05); however, the TMFL of D4 was 0.62 (0.11 SE) and statistically less than 1 (p < 0.001). TMFLs of PCB-153 and p,p'-DDE were 5.6 (2.2 SE) and 6.1 (2.8 SE) and statistically greater than 1 (p < 0.001). TMFLs of cVMS in this terrestrial system were similar to those reported in aquatic systems. However, trophic magnification factors derived on a fugacity basis (TMFFs), which recognize differences in body temperature and lipid composition between organisms, were greater than corresponding TMFLs primarily because a temperature-induced thermodynamic biomagnification of hydrophobic chemicals occurs when endothermic organisms consume poikilothermic organisms. Therefore, we recommend that biomagnification studies of food webs including endothermic and poikilothermic organisms incorporate differences in body temperature and tissue composition to accurately characterize the biomagnification potential of chemicals.","[Elliott, John E.] Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada; [Fremlin, Katharine M.; Elliott, John E.; Gobas, Frank A.

This Holocene record is based primarily on the occurrence of a sea ice biomarker chemical, IP25, isolated from a marine sediment core obtained from Barrow Strait in 2005. A core chronology is based on C-14 AMS dating of mollusc shells obtained from ten horizons within the core. The primary IP25 data are compared with complementary proxy data obtained from analysis of other organic biomarkers, stable isotope composition of bulk organic matter, benthic foraminifera, particle size distributions and ratios of inorganic elements. The combined proxy data show that the palaeo-sea ice record can be grouped according to four intervals, and these can be contextualised further with respect to the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). Spring sea ice occurrence was lowest during the early-mid Holocene (10.0-6.0 cal. kyr BP) and this was followed by a second phase (6.0-4.0 cal. kyr BP) where spring sea ice occurrence showed a small increase. Between 4.0 and 3.0 cal. kyr BP, spring sea ice occurrence increased abruptly to above the median and we associate this interval with the termination of the HTM. Elevated spring sea ice occurrences continued from 3.0 to 0.4 cal. kyr BP, although they were more variable on shorter timescales. Within this fourth interval, we also provide evidence for slightly lower and subsequently higher spring sea ice occurrence during the Mediaeval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age respectively. Comparisons are made between our proxy data with those obtained from other palaeo-climate and sea ice studies for the CAA. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous field experiments generally found that N enrichment increased site-scale plant biomass, although the magnitude of the response and sign varied across experiments. We quantified the response of terrestrial natural vegetation biomass to N enrichment in the Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N) by scaling up data from 773 field observations (142 sites) of the response of biomass to N enrichment using machine-learning algorithms. N enrichment had a significant and nonlinear effect on aboveground biomass (AGB), but a marginal effect on belowground biomass. The most influential variables on the AGB response were the amount of N applied, mean biomass before the experiment, the treatment duration and soil phosphorus availability. From the machine learning models, we found that N enrichment due to increased atmospheric N deposition during 1993-2010 has enhanced total biomass by 1.1 +/- 0.3 Pg C, in absence of losses from harvest and disturbances. The largest effect of N enrichment on plant growth occurred in northeastern Asia, where N deposition markedly increased. These estimates were similar to the range of values provided by state-of-the-art C-N ecosystem process models. This work provides data-driven insights into hemisphere-scale N enrichment effect on plant biomass growth, which allows to constrain the terrestrial ecosystem process model used to predict future terrestrial C storage.","[Liu, Yongwen; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Makowski, David] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, Unit Appl Math & Comp Sci MIA 518, Palaiseau, France; [Ciais, Philippe] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gasser, Thomas] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Song, Jian; Wan, Shiqiang] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] UAB, Global Ecol Unit CREAF, CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Janssens, Ivan A.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Peking University; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Hebei University; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Antwerp","Piao, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Piao, SL (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",slpiao@pku.edu.cn,"Liu, Yongwen/O-7330-2015; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Wan, Shiqiang/L-9166-2019","Liu, Yongwen/0000-0002-9664-303X; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42122005, 41701089]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2019074]; NASA ROSES Grant [NNX10AG01A, NNH10AN681]; Spanish Government [PID2019-110521GB-I00]; Fundacion Ramon Areces (Grant ELEMENTAL-CLIMATE), Catalan Government [SGR 2017-1005]; European Research Council [ERC-SyG-2013-610028]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; NASA ROSES Grant; Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission); Fundacion Ramon Areces (Grant ELEMENTAL-CLIMATE), Catalan Government; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42122005, 41701089), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2019074).

The investigation is undertaken by applying a state-of-the-art cyclone finding and tracking scheme to the 6-hourly reanalyses produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The outcome of this is arguably the most reliable analysis of SH cyclone variability undertaken to date. Across the 40-yr period the annual and seasonal mean cyclone densities have undergone reductions at most locations south of about 40 degrees S (with the greatest reductions near 60 degrees S), and increases to the north. This pattern of change resembles the high-latitude mode identified in many studies of SH circulation features. It is shown that the mean radius of SH extratropical cyclones displays almost everywhere a significant positive trend, and there are also increases in annual mean cyclone depth (i.e.. the pressure difference between the center and the edge of a cyclone). The annual average number of cyclones per SH analysis rose from the start of the period to a maximum of about 39 in 1972. Since then, the numbers have shown an overall decline, the counts in the 1990s being particularly low. Similar behavior was evident when the count was confined to the 30 degrees-50 degrees S and 50 degrees-70 degrees S latitude bands. Least squares best lit to the three lime series exhibit significant slopes of -0.58, -0.26, and -0.58 cyclones per analysis per decade, respectively. Between 30 degrees and 70 degrees S the annual mean number of cyclones found per analysis assumed a maximum about 1970. bur that number has dramatically decreased by about 10% since then. (This analysis suggests that the downward trends in cyclone numbers are associated with a warming Southern Hemisphere.) The overall structure of the time series of annual cyclone per analysis over 30 degrees-50 degrees S and 50 degrees-70 degrees S are similar, but their year-to-year changes are shown to be negatively correlated; hence, there tends to be an interannual compensation of cyclone density between the middle and higher latitudes. The extent to which changes in the semiannual oscillation over the last few decades could be said to have influenced how cyclones are distributed across seasons is briefly examined. The results show. in particular. that the interannual relationship between spring and winter cyclone density cannot be explained in terms of a response to a change in the amplitude of the semiannual oscillation.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Simmonds, I (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",isimmonds@earthsci.unimelb.edu.au,,"Simmonds, Ian/0000-0002-4479-3255",,,,,50,177,182,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Vegetation in southern Africa is among the most affected by drought. Here, we assessed the spatiotemporal characteristics of meteorological drought in southern Africa using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) over a 30-year period (1982-2011). The severity and the effects of droughts on vegetation productiveness were examined at different drought timescales (1- to 24-month timescales). In this study, we characterized vegetation using the leaf area index (LAI) after evaluating its relationship with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Correlating the LAI with the SPEI, we found that the LAI responds strongly (r = 0.6) to drought over the central and southeastern parts of the region, with weaker impacts (r < 0.4) over parts of Madagascar, Angola, and the western parts of South Africa. Furthermore, the latitudinal distribution of LAI responses to drought indicates a similar temporal pattern but different magnitudes across timescales. The results of the study also showed that the seasonal response across different southern African biomes varies in magnitude and occurs mostly at shorter to intermediate timescales. The semi-desert biome strongly correlates (r = 0.95) to drought as characterized by the SPEI at a 6-month timescale in the MAM (March-May; summer) season, while the tropical forest biome shows the weakest response (r = 0.35) at a 6-month timescale in the DJF (December-February; hot and rainy) season. In addition, we found that the spatial pattern of change of LAI and SPEI are mostly similar during extremely dry and wet years, with the highest anomaly observed in the dry year of 1991, and we found different temporal variability in global and regional responses across different biomes. We also examined how well an ensemble of state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) simulate the LAI and its response to drought. The spatial and seasonal response of the LAI to drought is mostly overestimated in the DGVM multimodel ensemble compared to the response calculated for the observation-based data. The correlation coefficient values for the multimodel ensemble are as high as 0.76 (annual) over South Africa and 0.98 in the MAM season over the temperate grassland biome. Furthermore, the DGVM model ensemble shows positive biases (3 months or longer) in the simulation of spatial distribution of drought timescales and overestimates the seasonal distribution timescales. The results of this study highlight the areas to target for further development of DGVMs and can be used to improve the models' capability in simulating the drought-vegetation relationship.","[Lawal, Shakirudeen; Hewitson, Bruce] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England; [Lombardozzi, Danica] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res Climate & Global Dynam, Terr Sci Sect, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Nabel, Julia E.

Nitrate levels and temperature were the most significant factors influencing microalgae numbers in rearing and treatment ponds as determined by Principle Component Analysis. Variance in climate, namely drought conditions that occurred during monitoring period, did not affect microalgae or microbial numbers. Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta were the most dominant algal divisions observed in this recirculating aquaculture system, many of these are recognized as a natural source of beneficial prebiotics for fish. Determining baseline microalgal profiles in rearing water, followed by elucidating physicochemical parameters governing wastewater treatment performance, can inform future intensification and diversification of freshwater aquaculture by exploiting and replicating knowledge of favourable algal-microbial ecosystems.

The thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of a wall are two thermophysical properties that strongly influence the energy performance. Although many case studies have been performed, the results failed to give a big picture of the roles of these properties in the energy performance of an active building. In this work, a traversal study on the energy performance of a standard room with all potential wall materials was performed for the first time. It was revealed that both heat storage materials and insulation materials are suitable for external walls. However, the importances of those materials are distinct in different situations: the heat storage plays a primary role when the thermal conductivity of the material is relatively high, but the effect of the thermal insulation is dominant when the conductivity is relatively low. Regarding internal walls, they are less significant to the energy performance than the external ones, and they need exclusively the heat storage materials with a high thermal conductivity. These requirements for materials are consistent under various climate conditions. This study may provide a roadmap for the material scientists interested in developing high-performance wall materials.","[Long, Linshuang; Ye, Hong] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Thermal Sci & Energy Engn, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Ye, H (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Thermal Sci & Energy Engn, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China.",hye@ustc.edu.cn,"Long, Linshuang/AAF-4292-2019; Long, Linshuang/AAV-9434-2021","Long, Linshuang/0000-0002-5554-158X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51576188],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51576188).,,33,28,28,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,7-Apr,2016,,,,,,,24181,10.1038/srep24181,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep24181,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DI5ZJ,27052186,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000373578700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By combining different types of polymeric materials within multilayer structures, products with a broad range of property profiles can be obtained for advanced applications. Design of co-extrusion dies and feedblock systems requires extensive knowledge of process and material behavior. To accurately describe the shear-thinning behavior of polymer melts in co-extrusion processes and to predict characteristic process quantities, numerical methods are essential. We present a hybrid approach to modeling stratified co-extrusion flows of two power-law fluids through rectangular ducts. By applying the theory of similarity and transforming the problem into dimensionless representation, we identified four independent influencing parameters that fully describe the flow situation: (i) the power-law index of the first fluid, (ii) the power-law index of the second fluid, (iii) the dimensionless position of the interface, and (iv) the ratio of dimensionless pressure gradients. We varied these input parameters within ranges that cover almost all combinations of industrial relevance, creating in the process a set of more than 44,000 design points. By means of the shooting method, numerical solutions were obtained for (i) pressure-throughput behavior, (ii) interfacial shear stress, (iii) interfacial velocity, and (iv) individual volume flow rates. Finally, we used symbolic regression based on genetic programming to model these target quantities as functions of their influencing parameters and obtain algebraic relationships between them. Our mathematical models thus enable accurate prediction of several characteristic process quantities in two-layer co-extrusion flows of shear-thinning fluids through rectangular ducts. The models are not restricted to the field of polymer processing, but can be used in all industrial applications that involve such co-extrusion flows.","[Hammer, Alexander; Roland, Wolfgang; Marschik, Christian; Steinbichler, Georg] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Polymer Extrus & Compounding, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Roland, Wolfgang] ProFuture GmbH, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Hammer, A (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Polymer Extrus & Compounding, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",alexander.hammer@jku.at,"Roland, Wolfgang/C-8061-2019","Roland, Wolfgang/0000-0002-0213-6118","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [871272]; FFG [854184]; Austrian COMET Program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies; Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Federal Province of Upper Austria; Federal Province of Styria","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); FFG; Austrian COMET Program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies; Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Federal Province of Upper Austria; Federal Province of Styria","Financial support by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) within the Bridge 1 program (project number 871272) is gratefully acknowledged.

When the series are examined individually, it is clear that the strongest trends in individual trees and timbers reflect concurrent trends in climate. Nonclimatic trends are very small and represent random noise that can be removed by averaging. If the same data are analyzed using the more conventional approach of aligning the series by ring number and fitting a regression line, so that the magnitude of the age trend is based on the slope of the mean and the statistical significance on the correlation coefficient, the results are very different. We demonstrate that this conventional approach regularly produces spurious age trends with grossly inflated probabilities, because of offsets in the mean values of series of different length. We conclude that there is no need to detrend stable oxygen isotope series from individual trees or timbers of oak from the UK and that to do so would remove important climatic information. Long isotope chronologies can safely be constructed by combining data from multiple individual trees, or by pooling material from trees prior to chemical treatment and isotopic measurement. Age-related trends may occur in other species or in other regions, but where they have been identified using the conventional slope of the mean approach they should be reassessed using the mean of the slope approach.","[Duffy, Josie E.; McCarroll, Danny; Loader, Neil J.; Young, Giles H.

Human pressure impoverished these humus systems, which tend to evolve toward Amphi or Moder systems, losing their natural biostructure and carbon content.","[Zanella, Augusto] Univ Padua, Padua, Italy; [Ponge, Jean-Francois] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Paris, France; [Hager, Herbert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Pignatti, Sandro] Roma La Sapienza Univ, Rome, Italy; [Galbraith, John] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Chertov, Oleg] Univ Appl Sci Bingen, Bingen, Germany; [Andreetta, Anna] Univ Firenze, Florence, Italy; [De Nobili, Maria] Univ Udine, Udine, Italy","University of Padua; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Sapienza University Rome; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Florence; University of Udine","Zanella, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Padua, Italy.",augusto.zanella@unipd.it; ponge@mnhn.fr; herbert.hager@boku.ac.at; sandro.pignatti@gmail.com; john.galbraith@vt.edu; oleg_chertov@hotmail.com; anna.andreetta@unifi.it; maria.denobili@uniud.it,"De Nobili, Maria/N-4073-2019; Ponge, Jean-Francois/D-5089-2009; Zanella, Augusto/O-4610-2016; Andreetta, Anna/AES-3384-2022; Galbraith, John Michael/AAA-3254-2021","Ponge, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-6504-5267; Zanella, Augusto/0000-0001-7066-779X; Galbraith, John Michael/0000-0003-4097-366X; De Nobili, Maria/0000-0002-4633-4394; Andreetta, Anna/0000-0002-2082-0503",,,,,110,5,5,0,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Stolen Voices develops techniques for 'listening in' and eavesdropping to help articulate an epistemology of place through sonic frameworks. A core motivation for the listening is a semi-fictional story we tell ourselves (and anyone else who is listening): an 'event' has taken place along the East Coast of the United Kingdom (UK), and we have been tasked with figuring out what has happened. While the specifics of the event might be difficult to pin down, the urgency of the investigation is fuelled by concrete concerns found in the UK edgelands, at the border/margin of the country: the uncertain future of the UK's relationship with Europe; the effects of climate change on coastal landscapes; the waning of industries like manufacturing and coal extraction; the oil industry in crisis; the rise of global shipping infrastructures. By using a semi-fictional framework, we move away from mapping techniques like data-sonification towards a methodology that embraces gaps and inventive excesses while insisting on the importance of making an account. Through listening, we foster attention to contingencies and indeterminacies and their relationships to prevailing structures and knowledge hierarchies. Stolen Voices asks: what is the relationship between a listener and what is heard? How can listening attune us to the complexities of contemporary political, economic, ecological and social processes? How did we get to where we are now, and how, through listening, can we seek out levers for change? What do the rhythms and atmospheres of specific geographic locations inform or reveal about history? Evolving over several years, in response to what we hear, the investigation necessarily proceeds slowly. In this article, we unfold our methodological processes for the detection of sound, voices, atmosphere and affect. We use creative-critical writing to evidence the construction of a research investigation focused on the act of listening as a spatial practice and necessarily collective endeavour.","[Collins, Rebecca] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Art, Edinburgh EH3 9DF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Linsley, Johanna] Univ Dundee, Sch Humanities, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; University of Dundee,"Collins, R (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Art, Edinburgh EH3 9DF, Midlothian, Scotland.;Linsley, J (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Humanities, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",rebecca.collins@ed.ac.uk; j.linsley001@dundee.ac.uk,,"Collins, Rebecca/0000-0002-3013-9666","Arts Council England (Durham, North) [31424873]","Arts Council England (Durham, North)","Stolen Voices received funding from Arts Council England (Durham, North), grant number: 31424873.",,54,2,2,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0752,,ARTS,Arts,DEC,2019,4,,,,,,140,10.3390/arts8040140,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts8040140,,,18,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,KB6ZI,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000506640300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The revolutions of energy and communications that transfigured sociocultural life and set the world stage for an almost unprecedented spread of mobile bodies - commerce, trade, culture, language, entertainment, travel, leisure activities, etc. - are now in overreach. Our modern state of being mobile marks a peak of accelerating growth toward a global society intricately bound together in a complex embrace. Yet, in going global, we have entered, and entertained, a new myth: infinite growth within a world of finite resources. The situation we now face is that many global systems that have provided us with our convenient lifestyles have entered a phase of heightened criticality. This chapter discusses how we are on the verge of major local and global transformations. Examing several critical thresholds such as global climate, peak oil, food, urban growth, and technology, discussion is given to how such disruptions would have a significant impact upon the prospect of our future mobilities. It outlines three scenarios that could be played out in varying degrees; these being named as Localized Scarcity, Lock-Down, and Digital Draconianism. The chapter concludes by examing whether, despite such grim forecasts, future mobilities are likely to have a future awaiting them.","[Dennis, Kingsley L.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Ctr Mobil Res CeMoRe, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University,"Dennis, KL (corresponding author), Giordano Bruno GlobalShift Univ, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,0,ASHGATE PUBLISHING LTD,ALDERSHOT,"GOWER HOUSE, CROFT ROAD, ALDERSHOT GU11 3HR, ENGLAND",,,978-1-4094-5093-1; 978-1-4094-5092-4,,,,2013,,,,,331,+,,,,,,24,Demography; Geography,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Demography; Geography,BA9XC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000339947400025,View Full Record in Web of Science

This practice may be defined as any approach that aims to measure effectiveness and/or efficiency of an activity or process using PI, supporting the decision-making process and encouraging the continuous improvement of a water utility. Despite the potential benefits, few projects and initiatives of performance assessment based on PI have been undertaken regarding storm water systems. The present article aims to review studies that have been carried out in the area to provide a state of the art on the subject, understand the applicability of the existing methodologies and their limitations, and to point out future directions. The review revealed that most of the research works were of limited scope, focusing on single storm water systems or some specific aspects of their performance, and also gave an inappropriate definition and selection of PI, compromising their further application. The identified gaps emphasise the need for a new methodology to provide a reference framework in the field. Such methodology should be objective, standardised and well-adapted to different contexts, driven by objectives and criteria and based on PI and targets.","[Santos, Liliana Ferreira; Galvao, Ana Fonseca] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Santos, Liliana Ferreira; Cardoso, Maria Adriana] LNEC, Ave Brasil 101, P-1700066 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; National Civil Engineering Laboratory,"Santos, LF (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.;Santos, LF (corresponding author), LNEC, Ave Brasil 101, P-1700066 Lisbon, Portugal.",liliana.santos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Cardoso, Maria Adriana/AAA-3113-2021; Santos, Liliana/Q-2794-2019; Galvao, Ana/M-6997-2013","Cardoso, Maria Adriana/0000-0002-0422-2781; Santos, Liliana/0000-0001-9167-0138; Galvao, Ana/0000-0003-1513-4522",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [PD/BD/114461/2016],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) for the PhD grant PD/BD/114461/2016, under the doctoral programme H2Doc ('Environmental Hydraulics and Hydrology').",,76,10,10,1,22,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1366-7017,,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,FEB,2019,1,,,,221,244,,10.2166/wp.2018.042,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2018.042,,,24,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,HN4MU,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000460158800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

How closely does is this image congruent with the ancient environment as it in reality existed? In particular, how forested was the ancient Mediterranean world, was there deforestation, and if so, what were its effects? The consensus of historians, geographers, and other scholars from the mid-nineteenth century through the first three quarters of the twentieth century was that human activities had depleted the forests to a major extent and caused severe erosion. My research confirmed this general picture. Since then, revisionist historians have questioned these conclusions, maintaining instead that little environmental damage was done to forests and soils in ancient Greco-Roman times. In a reconsideration of the question, this paper looks at recent scientific work providing proxy evidence for the condition of forests at various times in ancient history. I look at three scientific methodologies, namely anthracology, palynology, and computer modeling. Each of these avenues of research offers support for the concept of forest change, both in abundance and species composition, and episodes of deforestation and erosion, and confirms my earlier work.","Univ Denver, Dept Hist, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Hughes, JD (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Hist, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",dhughes@du.edu,,,,,,,28,37,38,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0022-5010,,,J HIST BIOL,J.

The micro-parklands of the Emergency Hospital in Madrid create a natural system of prefabricated elements following the aim of rapid implementation, isolation, and protection taking as reference the simple integrated system of living microorganisms. These micro-enclosures provide circular areas where patients, visitors, or healthcare professionals can meet in secret places surrounded by trees and shrubs or long green islands where they can walk around. The landscape architecture project has a surface of 7,434 sqm and occupies a plot of 69,791 sqm located in the Hortaleza district of Madrid. Belonging to the previous City of Justice project on the north side of the Institute of Legal Medicine, the plot, which is trapezoidal with a drop of 4,5 meters, is destined for a public hospital constructed in four months during the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to dry climatic conditions, adapted species with low water demand have been selected reducing the risk of allergies or respiratory problems. The topography has been modified to conserve rainwater and direct it to green areas that act as sponges that reduce runoff, store water, remove sediment and pollutants and release it into other ecosystems. There is no separation between soft scape (planting) and hard scape (soil) in the intervention, both are soft and porous and have macro and micro living beings. Following the references of these books, creativity and destruction as real phenomena both have attributes such as fitness and unfitness in the evolutionary way or health and disease.

To tackle rising production and species diversity issues, innovations in the field of aquaculture feeds, breeding, disease management and other improvements must be addressed. In this framework, the study of epigenetic mechanisms behind different aquaculture rearing processes presents great opportunities. The transcriptional impact of epigenetic modifications, triggered by environmental stimuli, has been shown to influence the organism's phenotype. Therefore, understanding the environmental-induced epigenetic markers related to disease resistance or other economically important traits will allow the establishment of favourable breeding conditions with increased economical revenue. Several studies have shown epigenetic effects in various species, induced by different rearing conditions, with benefits for the organisms and evidences for heritability of the acquired adaptive phenotypic traits across generations, making these studies even more relevant in a production context. These studies have demonstrated the great potential of epigenetics to positively induce disease resistance, stress tolerance and attain better sex ratios in the aquatic organism. Also, in the field of nutritional epigenetics, the possibility of early nutritional programming to improve the performance of broodstock or even the long-term performance of their progeny has been suggested. In sum, an increased understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in economically important species, and the epigenetic markers leading to the most favourable phenotypic traits, will contribute to the expansion of economically viable commercial aquaculture industries. The major epigenetic mechanisms and respective analysis methods, as well as the state of the art and potential applications in aquaculture, are addressed in this review.","[Granada, Luana; Lemos, Marco F.

With regard to the work plan of the Working Group, the first step is an analysis of the state of the art in the current use of low-to-high enthalpy geothermal resources in Italy. This will be achieved through an inventory of data, applications and case studies, aimed at determining the relationship between the hydrogeological settings resulting from features such as hydro-stratigraphy, hydraulic and hydrodynamic conditions, hydro-geochemistry, and the availability of the resource and the potential of the systems (Cerutti et al. 2013a, b).

This is generally obtained with dynamical downscaling from a low-to-mid resolution atmospheric model. In this context, a new wave forecasting system for the marginal Adriatic Sea is herein presented aimed at proposing an alternative strategy for accurate wind-wave forecasting in (semi-) enclosed basins that does not require an ad-hoc regional atmospheric model. The system is based on the state-of-the-art WAVEWATCH III (R) spectral wave model forced by the global IFS-ECMWF forecast. At first, wind speed is quantile-corrected to account for the systematic underestimation over the Adriatic Sea. Then, the significant wave height in the target region and for regimes associated with marine storms is calibrated following standard procedure. Wind and wave observations from different sources are used for calibration and validation of the wave forecasts, which achieve satisfactory scores. We also compare results with those of other forecasting systems in the area, highlighting the importance of the wind forcing accuracy and the wave model calibration. Doing so, we discuss the challenges that characterise (semi-) enclosed environments in order to propose effective solutions for them and future developments.","[Barbariol, Francesco; Davison, Silvio; Bertotti, Luciana; Cavaleri, Luigi; Benetazzo, Alvise] Italian Natl Res Council CNR ISMAR, Inst Marine Sci, Venice, Italy; [Pezzutto, Paolo] Italian Natl Res Council CNR IRBIM, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Biotechnol, Ancona, Italy; [Papa, Alvise; Favaro, Marco; Sambo, Enrico] Tide Forecast & Early Warning Ctr, Venice, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Risorse Biologiche Biotecnologie Marine (IRBIM-CNR),"Barbariol, F (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council CNR ISMAR, Inst Marine Sci, Venice, Italy.",francesco.barbariol@cnr.it,,"Papa, Alvise/0000-0001-5979-9935",,,,,52,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

In the past 130 years, TC Fani is the first of its kind with the peculiarity of being persistent with the intensity of severe cyclonic storm (SCS) over land for more than 24 h, thus causing substantial casualties in the major cities of Odisha. Two high-resolution mesoscale modeling systems, (1) state-of-the-art advanced research version of weather research and forecasting (WRF-ARW) model with a single fixed domain (9 km horizontal resolution) and (2) TC specific hurricane WRF (HWRF) with three domains (27/9/3 km horizontal resolution) are used for real-time prediction of Fani in quasi-operational setup. Storms surge prediction is also carried out using IIT Delhi dynamical storm surge model. Both the models, WRF and HWRF, were able to predict the system from its genesis stage (5 days in advance of landfall) with reasonable accuracy in position and strength. The tracks from both models are in good agreement with the observed track. The average track errors for WRF and HWRF are 101 km and 85 km, respectively. The landfall time and position are well predicted, with 60 h of lead time. HWRF model performance in predicting landfall time, position, and intensity is significant. Along with the statistical analysis, structural and vertical analysis of wind, enthalpy flux, and thermal distribution are carried out by considering two represented initial conditions from both WRF and HWRF models. Maximum reflectivity and precipitable water diagnostic studies depict that both the models show asymmetricity at the peak intensity of ESCS. The rainfall during the landfall day from both the models is comparable with the gauge-satellite merged observed rainfall datasets. Along with TC track, intensity, and structural forecasts associated with storm surge at different vulnerable coastal cities are attempted to predict with reasonable accuracy.","[Mohanty, Shyama; Nadimpalli, Raghu; Mohanty, U.

In these scenarios, using a linear model such as a Gaussian dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can result in severe forecasting inaccuracies due to the structure and parameters of the model remaining constant without considering either the elapsed time or the state of the system. To approach this problem, we propose a hybrid model that combines a model tree with DBNs. The model first divides the original data set into different scenarios based on the splits made by the tree over the system variables and then performs a piecewise regression in each branch of the tree to obtain nonlinear forecasts. The experimental results on three different datasets show that our model outperforms standard DBN models when dealing with nonlinear processes and is competitive with state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods.","[Quesada, David; Bielza, Concha; Larranaga, Pedro] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Inteligencia Artificial, Madrid, Spain; [Fontan, Pedro] REPSOL Technol Lab, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Quesada, D (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Inteligencia Artificial, Madrid, Spain.",dquesada@fi.upm.es,"Larranaga, Pedro/F-9293-2013; Bielza, Concha/F-9277-2013","Larranaga, Pedro/0000-0003-0652-9872; Bielza, Concha/0000-0001-7109-2668; Quesada Lopez, David/0000-0002-7280-904X","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [PID2019-109247GB-I00]; BBVA Foundation","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); BBVA Foundation(BBVA Foundation)","This study was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the PID2019-109247GB-I00 project and by the BBVA Foundation (2019 Call) through the Score-based nonstationary temporal Bayesian networks.

In Ghana, rice farmers in the Northern Savannah are amongst the most vulnerable to long periods of drought and erratic rainfall conditions. Within the Kumbungu district, farmers engaged in both rain-fed and irrigated rice farming are no exception. Coping with uncertain water availability conditions requires adaptive decision-making for sustained productivity in rice cropping. From an adaptive governance perspective, the extent to which formal and traditional governance arrangements enable adaptive decisions amongst rice farmers remains a key question. Using an exploratory research design, the study investigates three key questions; what water-dependent decisions rice farmers take and how these are adaptive to changing water availability conditions; what formal and informal governance arrangements rice cropping decisions are embedded in; and how existing governance arrangements enable or constrain adaptive decision-making. Rice farmers in twelve communities around the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in the Kumbungu District in the Northern region were engaged through individual interviews and focus group discussions. The study reveals that farmers take six major water-dependent decisions throughout the cropping season; decision to or not to plant rice, land preparation, planting, weed control, fertilizer application and harvesting. Farmer decisions are most adaptive to water availability conditions during planting and fertilizer application. Both formal and traditional governance arrangements influence the extent to which farmers are able to adapt to changes in water availability conditions. The paper also reflects on the potential of hydro-climatic information and the place of Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) in adaptive governance and decision-making.","[Nyamekye, Andy Bonaventure; Dewulf, Art; Van Slobbe, Erik; Termeer, Katrien; Pinto, Cristina] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nyamekye, Andy Bonaventure] Kumasi Inst Technol Energy & Environm, Kumasi, Ghana",Wageningen University & Research,"Nyamekye, AB (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands.",andy.nyamekye@wur.nl,"Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; van Slobbe, Erik/0000-0003-0499-2281",Bontanga Irrigation Scheme,Bontanga Irrigation Scheme,We acknowledge the numerous partners funding the EVOCA programme and research.

The coupled model was firstly applied to the Shiqiao Creek District in Dongguan City, South China, and verified against four major historical floods.

To facilitate the assessment, we have defined the strength of ISV activity by the standard deviation of 20-90 days filtered precipitation during the boreal summer of each year. The observed climatological ISV activity exhibits its largest values over the western North Pacific and Indian monsoon regions. The notable interannual variation of ISV activity is found primarily over the western North Pacific in observation while most models have the largest variability over the central tropical Pacific and exhibit a wide range of variability in spatial patterns that are different from observation. Although the models have large systematic biases in spatial pattern of dominant variability, the leading EOF modes of the ISV activity in the models are closely linked to the models' El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a feature that resembles the observed ISV and ENSO relationship. The ENSO-induced easterly vertical shear anomalies in the western and central tropical Pacific, where the summer mean vertical wind shear is weak, result in ENSO-related changes of ISV activity in both observation and models. It is found that the principal components of the predicted dominant modes of ISV activity fluctuate in a very similar way with observed ones. The model biases in the dominant modes are systematic and related to the external SST forcing. Thus the statistical correction method of this study based on singular value decomposition is capable of removing a large portion of the systematic errors in the predicted spatial patterns. The 21-year-averaged pattern correlation skill increases from 0.25 to 0.65 over the entire Asian monsoon region after applying the bias correction method to the multi-model ensemble mean prediction.","[Kim, Hye-Mi; Kang, In-Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Wang, Bin; Lee, June-Yi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Kang, IS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",kang@climate.snu.ac.kr,"Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012; Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Kim, Hye-Mi/0000-0003-4713-4658",,,,,50,43,46,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Thus, accurate quantification of the biomass of mesopelagic resources, their nutritional and genetic composition, their links to other components of the food web, to other oceanic realms and to biological and chemical oceanographic processes and cycles, are the focus of growing research activity. This information is needed to ensure the sustainable management of these resources. In this introduction, we summarize the contributions included in this theme set and provide some food for thought on the state-of-the-art in research on the mesopelagic, including identifying the knowledge that must be generated to support its sustainable management (e.g. the effect that extracting significant biomass might have on the pelagic ecosystem and the flow of material and energy through it).","[Hidalgo, Manuel] Ecosyst Oceanog Grp GRECO, Ctr Oceanog Baleares, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Muelle Poniente S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain; [Browman, Howard I.] Inst Marine Res, Austevoll Res Stn, Sauganeset 16, N-5392 Storebo, Norway",Spanish Institute of Oceanography; Institute of Marine Research - Norway,"Hidalgo, M (corresponding author), Ecosyst Oceanog Grp GRECO, Ctr Oceanog Baleares, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Muelle Poniente S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain.",jm.hidalgo@ieo.es,"Browman, Howard/CAA-2802-2022","Browman, Howard/0000-0002-6282-7316","EU H2020 PANDORA project [773713, 83741]; Institute of Marine Research, Norway","EU H2020 PANDORA project; Institute of Marine Research, Norway","M.H. acknowledges funding from the EU H2020 PANDORA project (Nr. 773713).

Their influence on aerosol hygroscopicity and cloud forming potential is important but uncertain with ambiguities between results reported in the literature. To address this, we have conducted measurements of the hygroscopic growth and critical supersaturation of dried, size selected nano-particles made from aqueous solution droplets of MgCl(2)and CaCl2, respectively, and compare experimentally derived values with results from state-of-the-art thermodynamic modelling. It is characteristic of both MgCl(2)and CaCl(2)salts that they bind water in the form of hydrates under a range of ambient conditions. We discuss how hydrate formation affects the particles' water uptake and provide an expression for hydrate correction factors needed in calculations of hygroscopic growth factors, critical super-saturations, and derived kappa values of particles containing hydrate forming salts. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for hydrate forming salts when predicting hygroscopic properties of sea spray aerosol.","[Rosati, Bernadette; Paul, Andreas; Iversen, Emil Mark; Bilde, Merete] Aarhus Univ, Dept Chem, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Rosati, Bernadette] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, AT-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Paul, Andreas] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, IEK 8, DE-52425 Julich, Germany; [Massling, Andreas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Aarhus University; University of Vienna; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Aarhus University,"Rosati, B; Bilde, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Chem, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.;Rosati, B (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, AT-1090 Vienna, Austria.",bernadette.rosati@chem.au.dk; bilde@chem.au.dk,"Rosati, Bernadette/AAA-2099-2022","Rosati, Bernadette/0000-0003-4930-3638; Paul, Andreas/0000-0001-6327-4103; Iversen, Emil Mark/0000-0002-6344-3939",Austrian Science Fund [FWF: J 3970-N36]; Aarhus University,Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Aarhus University,This research was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF: J 3970-N36) and Aarhus University.

Robust, warm anomalies over the Pacific and Siberian sectors of the Arctic, as high as 10A degrees C at the surface, are found in October and November. A regime change occurs by December, characterized by weaker temperatures anomalies extending through the troposphere. Geopotential anomalies extend from the surface up to the stratosphere, associated to deeper Aleutian and Icelandic Lows. While the upper-level jet is weakened and shifted southward over the continents, it is intensified over both oceanic sectors, especially over the Pacific Ocean. On the American and Eurasian continents, intensified surface Highs are associated with anomalous advection of cold (warm) polar air on their eastern (western) sides, bringing cooler temperatures along the Pacific coast of Asia and Northeastern North America. Transient eddy activity is reduced over Eurasia, intensified over the entrance and exit regions of the Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks, in broad qualitative agreement with the upper-level wind anomalies. Potential predictability calculations indicate a strong influence of sea ice upon surface temperatures over the Arctic in autumn, but also along the Pacific coast of Asia in December. When the observed sea ice extent from 2007 is prescribed throughout the autumn, a higher correlation of surface temperatures with meteorological re-analyses is found at high latitudes from October until mid-November. This further emphasises the relevance of sea ice for seasonal forecasting in the Arctic region, in the autumn.","[Orsolini, Yvan J.] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Senan, Retish; Benestad, Rasmus E.; Melsom, Arne] Norwegian Meteorol Inst Met No, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Orsolini, YJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",yvan.orsolini@nilu.no,"Benestad, Rasmus E./I-3156-2019; Senan, Retish/AAF-1798-2019; Senan, Retish/F-1701-2014","Benestad, Rasmus E./0000-0002-5969-4508; Senan, Retish/0000-0003-1949-1893; Senan, Retish/0000-0003-1949-1893; Orsolini, Yvan/0000-0001-7454-026X; Melsom, Arne/0000-0002-0734-5947",Norwegian Research Council [178570],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission),"This research was supported by the Norwegian Research Council, through the project #178570 Seasonal Predictability over the Arctic Region-exploring the role of boundary conditions.

Socio-scientific issuesbased teaching is initially concerning. Secondary school students' and teachers' awareness of and behaviors surrounding green chemistry are generally weak; related teaching examples or models remain a rare occurrence. In tertiary education, multiple teaching methods are reported and changes in practical work are more elaborated. Overall, GSCE research literature in mainland China is in its preliminary stage, while the currently used chemistry curriculum standards highlight the importance of GSCE at the high school level, which brings a new chance for developing GSCE in Chinese chemistry education.

In hydrology, the assessment of these parameters is an important step for representing precipitation frequencies and understanding rainfall variability. Because of restrictions related to data acquisition and methods of analysis, the global patterns of higher-order precipitation statistics are still poorly described. The objective of this study is to combine global precipitation datasets and state-of-the-art statistical methods in order to build a spatio-temporal assessment of global precipitation frequency. Gridded precipitation records were obtained from NOAA's Precipitation Reconstruction over Land (PREC/L) product. The L-moments approach was applied to describe the shape of the probability distribution and estimate the function parameters in each point of the global grid. Like conventional statistical moments, the L-moments can be used to describe the shape of a probability distribution, but with the advantage of being less susceptible to the presence of outliers and performing better with small sample sizes. The results of this study provide a new perspective on the spatial and temporal patterns of the parameters defining the shape of the precipitation probability distribution at a global scale.","[Maeda, Eduardo Eiji; Torres, Juan Arevalo; Carmona-Moreno, Cesar] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Water Resources Unit, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; [Maeda, Eduardo Eiji] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Helsinki,"Maeda, EE (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Water Resources Unit, I-21020 Ispra, Italy.",eduardo.maeda@helsinki.fi,"Maeda, Eduardo/E-7327-2011","Maeda, Eduardo/0000-0001-7932-1824",,,,,33,6,6,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,MAR,2013,1,,,,98,108,,10.1111/j.1475-4762.2012.01127.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4762.2012.01127.x,,,11,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,084JZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000314536600017,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is anticipated that this computational advantage of QC will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable problems in several application domains such as drug design, data science, clean energy, finance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and quantum chemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum hardware development and quantum software/algorithm has brought QC much closer to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a significant milestone in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era-the next logical step being the quantum advantage whereby quantum computers solve a real-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing. As the quantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage in the NISQ era. QC is a highly topical and fast-moving field of research with significant ongoing progress in all facets. A systematic review of the existing literature on QC will be invaluable to understand the state-of-the-art of this emerging field and identify open challenges for the QC community to address in the coming years. This article presents a comprehensive review of QC literature and proposes taxonomy of QC. The proposed taxonomy is used to map various related studies to identify the research gaps. A detailed overview of quantum software tools and technologies, post-quantum cryptography, and quantum computer hardware development captures the current state-of-the-art in the respective areas. The article identifies and highlights various open challenges and promising future directions for research and innovation in QC.","[Gill, Sukhpal Singh] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, London, England; [Kumar, Adarsh] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Comp Sci, Dept System, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Harvinder] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Comp Sci, Dept Virtualizat, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Manmeet] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX USA; [Singh, Manmeet] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol IITM, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Kaur, Kamalpreet] Seneca, Seneca Int Acad, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Usman, Muhammad] Univ Melbourne, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Buyya, Rajkumar] Univ Melbourne, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Cloud Comp & Distributed Syst CLOUDS Lab, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Centre for Climate Change Research - India; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Kumar, A (corresponding author), Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Comp Sci, Dept System, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India.",adarsh.kumar@ddn.upes.ac.in,"Singh, Manmeet/AAU-9678-2021; Kumar, Adarsh/AAT-5018-2020; Gill, Sukhpal Singh/J-5930-2014; Usman, Muhammad/C-1557-2012; Buyya, Rajkumar/C-3424-2009","Singh, Manmeet/0000-0002-3374-7149; Kumar, Adarsh/0000-0003-2919-6302; Gill, Sukhpal Singh/0000-0002-3913-0369; Usman, Muhammad/0000-0003-3476-2348; Buyya, Rajkumar/0000-0001-9754-6496",,,,,290,18,18,25,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0644,1097-024X,,SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER,Softw.-Pract.

In this paper, we show how to obtain such data under controlled laboratory conditions at any nonextreme pH. For that, we propose a simple method where we use N-2 and CO2 gas control to set the composition of a gas phase in equilibrium with the feedwater solution. By increasing the CO2 partial pressure, the pH of the solution will decrease and vice versa. We applied this method of CO2 gas control to extend and validate an existing data set on ion retention of multi-ionic brackish water with 10 different ionic species, whereas conditions in the prior data set were slightly uncontrolled; in our new analysis, we performed experiments at precisely controlled pH and temperature. We run experiments at pH 6.73 and pH 7.11 and in a temperature range of T = 15-31 degrees C. Our results show that when pH is decreased, or temperature increased, the ion retention of most ions decreases. We also tested the influence of the Na+ to Ca2+ concentration ratio in this multi-ionic solution on ion retention at pH 6.73 and T similar to 31 degrees C. We noticed that this ratio has a larger effect on ion retention for cations than for anions. We compare our data with the earlier reported data and describe similarities and differences. The improved data set will be an important tool for future development of accurate and validated RO ion transport models. Such RO models that describe desalination performance in detail are important for successful commercial application of the RO technology. We also discuss a relevant preparation method for water slightly oversaturated with barely soluble CaCO3 by solution preparation at high CO2 pressure, after which the solution is brought to the required pH by the N-2 and CO2 gas control method.","[Pranic, Marko; Kimani, Edward M.; Biesheuvel, P.

Furthermore, the CFC-based refrigerants in vapour compression-based traditional HVACs are responsible for the depletion of ozone layer to contribute global warming. Along with the exhaustion of natural energy sources, the use of VCR-based air conditioners also causes the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2. As compared to them desiccant dehumidification and cooling can provide significant energy-saving and environmental advantages. This is because the desiccant cooling is a thermally operated technology mostly makes use of industrial waste heat or freely available renewable solar heat. In the present article, the desiccant cooling systems have been discussed from the prospectus of its progressive developments, working principle, future research and development work needed.","[Bhabhor, K.

Therefore, first measurements of the CMH equipped on the small research UAS of type MASC-3 (multi-purpose airborne sensor carrier) operated by the University of Tubingen are shown. A comparison against a very accurate state of the art capacitive industrial humidity sensor (SHT31) is done. The sensor consists of a TEC (thermoelectric cooler) covered by a gold mirror. The TEC is controlled by a commercially available microprocessor with an on-board PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller. The results of the CMH measurements are in good agreement with the industrial-made capacitive sensor. The absolute accuracy of the measured dew point temperature by the CMH is in the range of +/- 0.2 K. Spectra show evidence that the CMH is capable to measure turbulent humidity fluctuations in the atmosphere with a temporal resolution of up to 10 Hz. Such a fast humidity sensor aboard a small UAS has the potential to study humidity fluxes in the surface layer over complex terrain, behind wind energy converters and humidity variations over land and sea surfaces in general.","[Mauz, Moritz; van Kesteren, Bram; zum Berge, Kjell; Schoen, Martin; Platis, Andreas; Bange, Jens] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Appl Geosci, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Junkermann, Wolfgang] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Mauz, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Ctr Appl Geosci, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",moritz.mauz@uni-tuebingen.de,,,Projekttrager Julich (PtJ) - BMWi (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [0324129D]; Open Access Publishing Fund of University of Tubingen,Projekttrager Julich (PtJ) - BMWi (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy); Open Access Publishing Fund of University of Tubingen,"We acknowledge support by the Projekttrager Julich (PtJ) for the WINSENT test site (project grant number: 0324129D) funded by the BMWi (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy).

Richardson (1922, Weather Prediction by Numerical Process, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 236) wrote his famous book. NWP has primarily been successul in improving day-by-day forecasts starting from an observed detailed Initial Condition (IC) out to about a week. The purpose of this paper is to discuss first the state of the art in long-range NWP by presenting results of a new large numerical experiment (named DERF90; from Dynamical Extended Range Forecasting in 1990 out to 90 days) conducted at the National Meteorological Center (NMC) during the summer and autumn of 1990 (Section 2). One hundred and twenty eight 90-day global forecasts were made from successive daily initial conditions (IC), thus giving us ample opportunity to assess skill of forecasts at lead times beyond 1 week. We then move on to define the notion of a limit of predictability (LOP), and following a procedure by Lorenz (1982), give a numerical estimate of the LOP using the DERF90 data set. We then produce a list of reasons, as to why this estimate (LOP = 18 days) should not be taken too literally. In particular, we argue that the LOP varies as a function of the flow itself, and it would be (much) larger if we had, as we will ultimately, a coupled ocean-atmosphere model for making long-lead forecasts. Last, but not least, we present results of empirical forecasts that point to modest but significant skill well beyond the traditional LOP (a few weeks). A specific recent example of empirical forecasting is discussed. Through Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), experimental forecasts are being made for the United States surface temperatures at lead times of several seasons. While modest, the skill is significant in that it defies the existence or a 3-week LOP, and so demonstrates the potential for model improvements.",,,"VANDENDOOL, HM (corresponding author), NATL METEOROL CTR,CTR CLIMATE ANAL,WASHINGTON,DC 20233, USA.",,,,,,,,46,38,39,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0377-0265,,,DYNAM ATMOS OCEANS,Dyn.

This novel method comprises two stages. The first stage is to detect the impulse noise in the image. In this stage, based on only the intensity values, the pixels are roughly divided into two classes, which are noise-free pixel and noise pixel. Then, the second stage is to eliminate the impulse noise from the image. In this stage, only the noise-pixels are processed. The noise-free pixels are copied directly to the output image. The method adaptively changes the size of the median filter based on the number of the noise-free pixels in the neighborhood. For the filtering, only noise-free pixels are considered for the finding of the median value. The results from 100 test images showed that this proposed method surpasses some of the state-of-art methods, and can remove the noise from highly corrupted images, up to noise percentage of 95%. Average processing time needed to completely v process images of 1600x1200 pixels with 95% noise percentage is less than 2.7 seconds. Because of its simplicity, this proposed method is, suitable to be implemented in consumer electronics products such as digital television, or digital camera.","[Ibrahim, Haidi; Kong, Nicholas Sia Pik; Ng, Theam Foo] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Ibrahim, H (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia.",haidi_ibrahim@ieee.org; pik_kong@ieee.org; tfng@eng.usm.my,"Ibrahim, Haidi/B-3131-2011; Ng, Theam Foo/V-8788-2018","Ibrahim, Haidi/0000-0002-6401-1791; Ng, Theam Foo/0000-0002-9529-4456","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia [305/PELECT/6013105]","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia)","This work was supported by Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia, under Science Fund Grant 305/PELECT/6013105.",,18,97,107,1,19,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0098-3063,1558-4127,,IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR,IEEE Trans.

For Britain, the study of freshwater temperatures has focussed mainly on observations made in England and Wales; similar comprehensive data sets for Scotland are currently unavailable. Here we present a model for the whole of mainland Britain over three recent decades (1982-2011) that incorporates geographical extrapolation to Scotland. The model estimates daily mean freshwater temperature for every river segment and for any day in the studied period, based upon physico-geographical features, daily mean air and sea temperatures, and available freshwater temperature measurements. We also extrapolate the model temporally to predict future warming of Britain's rivers given current observed trends. Our results highlight the spatial and temporal diversity of British freshwater temperatures and warming rates. Over the studied period, Britain's rivers had a mean temperature of 9.84 degrees C and experienced a mean warming of +0.22 degrees C per decade, with lower rates for segments near lakes and in coastal regions. Model results indicate April as the fastest-warming month (+0.63 degrees C per decade on average), and show that most rivers spend on average ever more days of the year at temperatures exceeding 10 degrees C, a critical threshold for several fish pathogens. Our results also identify exceptional warming in parts of the Scottish Highlands (in April and September) and pervasive cooling episodes, in December throughout Britain and in July in the southwest of England (in Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Dorset). This regional heterogeneity in rates of change has ramifications for current and future water quality, aquatic ecosystems, as well as for the spread of waterborne diseases.","[Jonkers, Art R.

To this end, we draw on 12 months of disaggregate trip data from the Citibike public bicycle sharing scheme (PBSP) in New York, currently the largest public bicycle sharing system in the United States, and spatially integrate these data with information on land use, bicycle infrastructure, topography, calendar events and weather. Overall, we find that weather impacts cycling rates more than topography, infrastructure, land use mix, calendar events, and peaks. The policy implication is that, in northern latitudes which experience inclement weather for extended periods, creating state-of-the-art cycling infrastructure - sheltered, promptly cleared from snow, and potentially heated - may be much more important than in warm and sunny places if planners are to succeed in getting people out of their cars.","[An, Ran; Pojani, Dorina; Corcoran, Jonathan] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Zahnow, Renee] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Corcoran, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",jj.corcoran@uq.edu.au,"Corcoran, Jonathan/A-4631-2010","Corcoran, Jonathan/0000-0003-3565-6061",,,,,66,30,30,1,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We review the state of the art, highlight recent advances, identify pitfalls and constraints, and discuss major challenges in four broad fields of pathway research and management: pathway classification, application of pathway information, management response, and management impact. We present approaches to describe and quantify pathway attributes (e.g., spatiotemporal changes, proxies of introduction effort, environmental and socioeconomic contexts) and how they interact with species traits and regional characteristics.

However, previous next POI recommendation studies usually adopt fix-length time windows for user check-in sequence modeling, leading to a limited capacity in capturing fine-grained user temporal preferences that easily change over time. Besides, existing methods often directly leverage multi-modal contexts as auxiliary to alleviate the data sparsity issue, which fails to fully exploit the sequential patterns of contextual information for inferring user interest drift. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel framework named iTourSPOT which extends traditional collaborative filtering methods with a context-aware POI embedding architecture. For enhancing temporal interests modeling capacity, we associate the context feature extraction with varying-length sessions and incorporate check-in frequencies of POIs as prior knowledge to instruct the session representation learning of our model. Moreover, a collaborative sequence transduction model is designed for joint context sequence modeling and session-based POI recommendation. Experimental results on a real-world geo-tagged photo dataset clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, especially in both sparse and cold-start scenarios.","[Wan, Lin; Hong, Yuming] China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Han; Huang, Zhou] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Han; Huang, Zhou] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Spatial Informat Integrat & Its A, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Ran] Hubei Geol Environm Stn, Informat Ctr, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] China Univ Min & Technol, Coll Geosci & Surveying Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; Peking University; Peking University; China University of Mining & Technology,"Huang, Z (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Huang, Z (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Spatial Informat Integrat & Its A, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",huangzhou@pku.edu.cn,"Wang, Han/GXV-5537-2022","chen, wei/0000-0002-2585-9984; Wan, Lin/0000-0001-5020-0164","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830645, 41971331]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41830645, 41971331].",,58,1,1,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-8947,1753-8955,,INT J DIGIT EARTH,Int.

Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a complete simulation of the topography and micro-climate of the area under study. Simulations were performed using ArcGIS and Rhinoceros and urban daylight (UD) and urban modeling interface plugin for a neighborhood in the region of Narmak in Tehran, Iran. Five configurations of a neighborhood were compared using simulations. Findings It was found that the impact of the geometrical form on daylight gain and energy consumption is significant and the terraced model is the most suitable form for obtaining a constant floor area ratio. Furthermore, it is an optimal form of urban blocks to gain the most energy through photovoltaic systems in the neighborhood as it would be able to satisfy about 42 percent of the energy needs. Originality/value Planning to achieve sufficient energy factors in cities is a difficult task, since urban planners often do not have adequate technical knowledge to measure the contribution of solar energy in urban plans and this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive modeling methodology by which the urban energy planning can be used and understood in the urban context to make it completely clear as a strategy of implementation.","[Gholami, Mansoureh; Mofidi Shemirani, Majid] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Fayaz, Rima] Art Univ Tehran, Dept Architecture & Urbanism, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Gholami, M (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Planning, Tehran, Iran.",Man_gholami@alumni.iust.ac.ir; S_m_mofidi@iust.ac.ir; fayaz@art.ac.ir,"shemirani, majid mofidi/S-6243-2018; Fayaz, Rima/ABF-1607-2021; Gholami, Mansoureh/GLU-5738-2022","Gholami, Mansoureh/0000-0003-0695-7324",,,,,27,8,8,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2046-6099,2046-6102,,SMART SUSTAIN BUILT,Smart Sustain.

Recent developments in the field of proteomics offering promising solutions to solving such health problems stimulates the uses of biopeptides as one of the therapeutic agents to alleviate disease-related risk factors. Functional peptides are typically produced from protein via enzymatic hydrolysis under in vitro or in vivo conditions using different kinds of proteolytic enzymes. An array of biological activities, including antioxidative, antihypertensive, antidiabetic and immunomodulating has been ascribed to different types of biopeptides derived from various food sources. In fact, biopeptides are nutritionally and functionally important for regulating some physiological functions in the body; however, these are yet to be extensively addressed with regard to their production through advance strategies, mechanisms of action and multiple biological functionalities. This review mainly focuses on recent biotechnological advances that are being made in the field of production in addition to covering the mode of action and biological activities, medicinal health functions and therapeutic applications of biopeptides. State-of-the-art strategies that can ameliorate the efficacy, bioavailability, and functionality of biopeptides along with their future prospects are likewise discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A popular implementation involves the deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which embed low energy consumption sensory nodes to capture the critical environmental parameters prevailing on the farms. However, to manage the ever-increasing volumes of raw data successfully, new approaches must be explored. Under this scope, current work reports on the design and development of an IoT system, having in mind the case of olive groves, which are considered the dominant sector for agricultural activity in the Mediterranean Basin. The system incorporates the cloud/fog computing paradigm to equip the olive growers with a low-cost solution for accurate, reliable, and almost real-time monitoring of their crops. Its core is based on a three-layered network architecture, capable of dynamically balancing the generated load, by pushing cloud-elastic resources to the underlying fog network. As such, the premise of the approach lies in the conforming character of the system that allows for targeted alterations to its operational functionality to meet stringent latency and traffic load environmental monitoring constraints. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, a demo prototype is developed and deployed in the facilities of the Ionian University. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of the approach in terms of latency, achieving response time reduction across all platforms, a subject of the utmost importance when it comes to precision agriculture of the future. Moreover, it is shown that the system is capable of dynamic functionality adaptation, to meet network traffic load constraints, achieving high throughput (on average 95%) and addressing potential environmental dangers to olive oil production.","[Tsipis, Athanasios; Papamichail, Asterios; Koufoudakis, George; Oikonomou, Konstantinos] Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, Corfu 49100, Greece; [Tsoumanis, Georgios] Univ Ioannina, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Arta 45110, Greece; [Polykalas, Spyros E.] Ionian Univ, Dept Digital Media & Commun, Kefalonia 28100, Greece",Ionian University; University of Ioannina,"Tsipis, A (corresponding author), Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, Corfu 49100, Greece.",atsipis@ionio.gr; aspapa@ionio.gr; gkoufoud@ionio.gr; gtsoum@uoi.gr; s.polykalas@ionio.gr; okon@ionio.gr,"Koufoudakis, George/AIB-7969-2022; Oikonomou, Konstantinos/AAI-6188-2020; Tsipis, Athanasios/AAJ-4517-2021","Koufoudakis, George/0000-0003-4214-5729; Oikonomou, Konstantinos/0000-0001-7279-9710; Tsipis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5069-3376; Tsoumanis, Georgios/0000-0001-9010-3422; Papamichail, Asterios/0000-0002-5729-4017",project A Pilot Wireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves - European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020 [MIS 5007309],project A Pilot Wireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves - European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020,"This work was supported in part by the project A Pilot Wireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves, (MIS 5007309), which is partially funded by the European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020.",,124,5,5,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-7402,,AGRIENGINEERING,AgriEngineering,MAR,2020,1,,,,175,205,,10.3390/agriengineering2010011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering2010011,,,31,Agricultural Engineering,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,SS6TX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000661889400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is achieved by means of a performance-oriented method, making use of single-objective optimisation, based on the minimisation of the total primary energy consumption. The method is applied to the case study of a reference office room with a fixed window-to-wall ratio in three different temperate climates. The results show that, as expected, the energy savings are inversely related to the facade reaction time. The amount of energy savings is a function of the variability of outdoor conditions and their closeness to the comfort range.

BackgroundSustainability presupposes an ethical leadership, a management of the good care and a well-educated staff, but research on NLs as managers of ethically sustainable caring cultures is not available. DesignThe study has a quantitative design with elements of a qualitative research approach. MethodData were collected through a web-based questionnaire sent to staff at eight selected units at a hospital in western Finland during September 2013; the reply rate was 32%. The data material was comprised of opinion questions, the ranking of values and two open-ended questions on lodestars in care and ethical principles in care work. ResultsNLs manage a care culture that rests on a solid foundation, where staff are co-creators of an ethically sustainable caring culture that includes good traditions for the praxis of care. NLs as managers are therefore responsible for realizing and passing on ethically sustainable caring cultures and creating prerequisites for staff's growth and development. ConclusionThe basis of good care, patient safety and sustainability is comprised of ethics with a respectful and dignified care that is evidence-based and economically stable. Through their management NLs have a responsibility to nurture and protect the core of caring and create contextual, professional and cultural prerequisites to maintain the core and art of caring as well as care staff's ethical and professional competence.","[Salmela, Susanne] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Caring Sci, Nursing Dev, Vaasa, Finland; [Koskinen, Camilla; Eriksson, Katie] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Caring Sci, Vaasa, Finland",Abo Akademi University; Abo Akademi University,"Salmela, S (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Dept Caring Sci, Nursing Dev, Vaasa, Finland.",susanne.salmela@vshp.fi,,,Vaasa Central Hospital District,Vaasa Central Hospital District,The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the authorship of this article: Vaasa Central Hospital District has allocated EVO funding for this study.,,39,27,27,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-2402,1365-2648,,J ADV NURS,J.

Oceanic initial conditions are provided by an ocean data assimilation system. Ensembles of seven forecasts of 6-month length are made starting each month in the 1982 to 2002 period. Skill of the coupled model is evaluated from both a deterministic and a probabilistic perspective. The skill metrics are calculated using both the bulk method, which includes all initial condition months together, and as a function of initial condition month. The latter method allows a more objective evaluation of how the model has performed in the context in which forecasts are actually made and applied. The deterministic metrics used are the anomaly correlation and the root-mean-square error. The coupled model deterministic skill metrics are compared with those from persistence and damped persistence reference forecasts. Despite the fact that the coupled model has a large cold bias in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific this coupled model is shown to have forecast skill that is competitive with other state-of-the-art forecasting techniques. Potential skill from probabilistic forecasts made using the coupled model ensemble members are evaluated using the relative operating characteristics method. This analysis indicates that for most initial condition months this coupled model has more skill at forecasting cold events than warm or neutral events in the central Pacific. In common with other forecasting systems, the coupled model forecast skill is found to be lowest for forecasts passing through the Northern Hemisphere (NH) spring. Diagnostics of this so-called spring predictability barrier in the context of this coupled model indicate that two factors likely contribute to this predictability barrier. First, the coupled model shows a too-weak coupling of the surface and subsurface temperature anomalies during NH spring. Second, the coupled-model-simulated signal-to-noise ratio for SST anomalies is much lower during NH spring than at other times of the year, indicating that the model's potential predictability is low at this time.","Int Res Inst Climate Predict, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",,"Dewitt, DG (corresponding author), Int Res Inst Climate Predict, 223 Monell Bldg,61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",daved@iri.columbia.edu,,,,,,,55,56,57,0,4,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Using different partitioning strategies and approaches (i.e., Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony) for phylogeny reconstruction, different topologies and Glade supports were determined. A total of 18 Ilex species was divided into two major groups (group I and II) in both plastid and nuclear phylogenies with some incongruences. Potential hybridization events may account, in part, for those phylogenetic uncertainties. The analyses, together with previously identified sequences, indicated that all 18 species were recovered within Eurasia or Asia/North America groups based on plastid data. Meanwhile, the species in group II in the nuclear phylogeny were placed in the Aquifolium Glade, as inferred from traditional classification, whereas the species in group I belonged to several other clades. The divergence time of most of the 18 Ilex species was estimated to be not more than 10 million years ago. Based on the results of this study, we concluded that paleogeographical events and past climate changes during the same period might have played important roles in these diversifications.","[Yi, Fan; Sun, Le; Peng, Yong; Xiao, Pei-Gen] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Yi, Fan; Sun, Le; Peng, Yong; Xiao, Pei-Gen] Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioact Subst & Resources Utilizat Chinese, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Hao, Da-Cheng] Dalian Jiaotong Univ, Biotechnol Inst, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, Dalian 116028, Peoples R China; [Han, Feng-Ming] Beijing Biomarker Technol Co LTD, Beijing 101300, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Medicinal Plant Development - CAMS; Dalian Jiaotong University,"Peng, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.;Peng, Y (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioact Subst & Resources Utilizat Chinese, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.;Han, FM (corresponding author), Beijing Biomarker Technol Co LTD, Beijing 101300, Peoples R China.",ypeng@implad.ac.cn; fantasyee8991@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of P.

It is a measure of the impact of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission caused by human activities on the environment, and particularly on climate change. Textile and clothing are important necessities of daily life for human beings. China is the largest economy of industrial outputs and exports of textile and clothing. The assessment of industrial carbon footprint (ICF), which means the total amount of GHG produced in the industrial processing periods of textile and clothing, is more meaningful for the reducing of GHG emission in textile industry. This paper reports a study of the ICF of seven kinds of knitting fabrics (black polyester/cotton (40/60) fleece, pink polyester/cotton (35/65) fleece, lawn green cotton fleece, water blue cotton rib, black cotton lycra jersey, gray polyester/cotton (30/70) fleece, white cotton lycra jersey). The results show that the ICF values of lawn green cotton fleece are the highest, and the ICF values of gray polyester/cotton (30/70) fleece are the lowest. The total ICF values of the knitting fabrics are closely related to the amount of processing procedures, and the ICF values of dyeing are the highest. Dyeing, washing, bleaching, (pre-) heat setting and dry are hot-spots of ICF of the selected fabrics.","[Wang, Lai-Li; Ding, Xue-Mei] Donghua Univ, Fash Inst Design, Shanghai 200051, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Wu, XY (corresponding author), Shanghai Entry Exit Inspect & Quarantine Bur, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China.",wuxy@shciq.gov.cn,"Ding, Xuemei/B-6619-2013","Ding, Xuemei/0000-0002-1830-1990",,,,,16,3,3,4,38,TEXTILE BIOENGINEERING & INFORMATICS SOCIETY LTD,HONG KONG SAR,"TBIS 2010 SECRETARIAT MN104, HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV, HONG KONG SAR, 0000, PEOPLES R CHINA",1942-3438,,,TEXT BIOENG INFORM S,,,2011,,,,,602,607,,10.3993/tbis2011104,http://dx.doi.org/10.3993/tbis2011104,,,6,"Materials Science, Textiles",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science,BAQ73,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000305197600103,View Full Record in Web of Science

For these reasons, the research project Design for Vulnerables aims to define which methodologies should be adopted to reduce urban vulnerabilities in the coming decades. A design workshop, set in a vulnerable community in the northern Mexico, was organized, documented, and analyzed.

Since the 1960s, with the problems such as energy drain, climate anomaly and environmental deterioration etc constantly springing up, the cry for Eco-environmental protection has been on the up. Currently, the concept of sustainable development has penetrated into all the aspects in the field of architecture, giving impetus to the overall architectural development trend. Under such circumstances, many types of architecture have begun to adopt low-carbon designing, including the salving architecture for low-income people. As a characteristic architectural type, the salving architecture for low-income people is the site specifically provided for low-income people with protection in life and development. Developing salving architecture for low-income people in the low-carbon concept not only complies with the tendency of architectural development worldwide but also sublimes the protection of the salving architecture for low-income people up to the lofty love in the mortal world.","[Dong Junyan; Cheng Wen] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Dong Junyan; Li Kechao; Xing Yuenan; Tan Tenglong] Changchun Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Design, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Dong Junyan] Banggkok Thonburi Univ, Int Asia Art Acad, Bangkok, Thailand",Harbin Institute of Technology; Changchun Institute Technology,"Dong, JY (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin, Peoples R China.;Dong, JY (corresponding author), Changchun Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Design, Changchun, Peoples R China.;Dong, JY (corresponding author), Banggkok Thonburi Univ, Int Asia Art Acad, Bangkok, Thailand.",djyrob@gmail.com; 93045611@qq.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-249-7,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2016,,,,,336,339,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BG8WE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000392735700060,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the intention of linking the rise of feminism to Trump's presence in office as president of the United States, specifically through examples of his sexism, narcissism and preference for patriarchy, this is approached through the metaphors of Berrio's painting. In retaliation to the upswing of sexism, narcissism and patriarchy coming from the White House, each element examined in the artwork is meant to describe the relationship to Donald Trump's personality cult as well as the corresponding reaction of anti-Trumpian groups, particularly feminists, as well as prescribers to psychoanalytic theory. Examples are cited from Trump's presence in the media, including tweets, personal statements and historical evidence supporting the arguments made. Topics of neo-colonialism, the American Dream and the generalization of the female desire to remove herself from the submissive role of patriarchal assignment are also discussed. With what was being hailed as Third Wave Feminism, beginning with the Woman's March of 2017, these aspects of Trumpian character and behaviour are described through the model of Berrio's stunning mix-media painting and are meant to appeal to readers through both feminist and psychoanalytical analyses.","[Wahlen, Samantha] Azusa Pacific Univ, Azusa, CA 91702 USA",,"Wahlen, S (corresponding author), Azusa Pacific Univ, Azusa, CA 91702 USA.",samanthawahlen@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2045-5879,2045-5887,,VIS INQ,Vis.

This study evaluates the performance of these models for forecasting the West African monsoon (WAM) at the monthly time scale. From simulations started the 1 May of each year and covering the period 1991-2001, the reproducibility and potential predictability (PP) of key parameters of the WAM-rainfall, zonal and meridional wind at four levels from the surface to 200 hPa, and specific humidity, from July to September-are assessed. The Sahelian rainfall mode of variability is not accurately reproduced contrary to the Guinean rainfall one: the correlation between observations (from CMAP) and the multi-model ensemble mean is 0.17 and 0.55, respectively. For the Sahelian mode, the correlation is consistent with a low PP of about similar to 6%. The PP of the Guinean mode is higher, similar to 44% suggesting a stronger forcing of the sea surface temperature on rainfall variability over this region. Parameters relative to the atmospheric dynamics are on average much more skillful and reproducible than rainfall. Among them, the first mode of variability of the zonal wind at 200 hPa that depicts the Tropical Easterly Jet, is correlated at 0.79 with its observed counterpart (from the NCEP/DOE2 reanalyses) and has a PP of 39%. Moreover, models reproduce the correlations between all the atmospheric dynamics parameters and the Sahelian rainfall in a satisfactory way. In that context, a statistical adaptation of the atmospheric dynamic forecasts, using a linear regression model with the leading principal components of the atmospheric dynamical parameters studied, leads to moderate receiver operating characteristic area under the curve and correlation skill scores for the Sahelian rainfall. These scores are however much higher than those obtained using the modelled rainfall.","[Philippon, N.] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR5210, Ctr Rech Climatol, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Doblas-Reyes, F.

These products are at different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the evaluation is performed at their native resolutions. Comparisons indicate that, in this region of great variation in elevation, using hourly, spatially homogeneous, and high resolution satellite data (UMD-SRB) compares more favorably with surface measurements than products that use three hourly, sparse subsamples at coarse resolutions (ISCCP-FD and GEWEX-SRB). Discrepancies among the satellite products are usually larger in highly variable terrain (such as in the Himalayas region) and smaller for nonvariable terrain (such as in the central Plateau). This suggests that errors of satellite products are spatially dependent over the Tibet. Therefore caution needs to be exercised when extending comparison results based on limited in situ data from accessible sites to the entire Plateau.

This study makes use of a state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model in a realistic configuration to conduct perpetual experiments aimed at providing new insights into the role of land-atmosphere processes in modulating the annual cycle of precipitation over India. The simulations are carried out at three important stages of the monsoon cycle: March, May, and July. Insolation and SSTs are held fixed at their respective monthly mean values, thus eliminating any external seasonal forcing. In the perpetual May experiment both precipitation and circulation are able to considerably evolve only by regional internal land-atmosphere processes and the mediation of soil hydrology. A large-scale equilibrium state is reached after approximately 270 days, closely resembling mid-summer climatological conditions. As a result, despite the absence of external forcing, intense and widespread rains over India are able to develop in the May-like state. The interaction between soil moisture and circulation, modulated by surface heating over the northwestern semi-arid areas, determines a slow northwestward migration of the monsoon, a crucial feature for the existence of desert regions to the west. This also implies that the land-atmosphere system in May is far from being in equilibrium with the external forcing. The inland migration of the precipitation front comprises a succession of large-scale 35-50 day coupled oscillations between soil moisture, precipitation, and circulation.

To assess the effectiveness of agricultural practices, researchers often turn to randomized field experiments, which are reliable for identifying causal effects but are often limited in scope and therefore lack external validity. Recently, researchers have also leveraged large observational datasets from satellites and other sources, which can lead to conclusions biased by confounding variables or systematic measurement errors. Because experimental and observational datasets have complementary strengths, in this paper we propose a method that uses a combination of experimental and observational data in the same analysis. As a case study, we focus on the causal effect of crop rotation on corn (maize) and soybean yields in the Midwestern United States. We find that, in terms of root mean squared error, our hybrid method performs 13% better than using experimental data alone and 26% better than using the observational data alone in the task of predicting the effect of rotation on corn yield at held-out experimental sites. Further, the causal estimates based on our method suggest that benefits of crop rotations on corn yield are lower in years and locations with high temperatures whereas the benefits of crop rotations on soybean yield are higher in years and locations with high temperatures. In particular, we estimated that the benefit of rotation on corn yields (and soybean yields) was 0.85 t ha(-1) (0.24 t ha(-1)) on average for the top quintile of temperatures, 1.03 t ha(-1) (0.21 t ha(-1)) on average for the whole dataset, and 1.19 t ha(-1) (0.16 t ha(-1)) on average for the bottom quintile of temperatures. This association between temperatures and rotation benefits is consistent with the hypothesis that the benefit of the corn-soybean rotation on soybean yield is largely driven by pest pressure reductions while the benefit of the corn-soybean rotation on corn yields is largely driven by nitrogen availability.","[Kluger, Dan M.; Owen, Art B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Kluger, DM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kluger@stanford.edu,,"Kluger, Dan M./0000-0002-7865-259X; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476","James and Nancy Kelso Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; NSF [IIS-1837931]; NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied Sciences) [80NSSC17K0652, 54308-Z6059203]",James and Nancy Kelso Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; Stanford Graduate Fellowship(Stanford University); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied Sciences),"D M K was supported by the James and Nancy Kelso Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship and by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

Understanding how fire ignition and propagation are correlated with temperature, orography, humidity, wind, and the mixture and age of individual plants must be considered when designing prevention strategies. While wildfire prevention focuses on fire ignition avoidance, firefighting success depends on early ignition detection, meaning that, in either case, ignition plays a major role. The current case study considered three Portuguese municipalities that annually observe frequent fire ignitions (Tomar, Ourem, and Ferreira do Zezere) as the testing ground for the Modernized Dynamic Ignition Risk (MDIR) strategy, thus evaluating the efficiency of MDIR and the efficacy of the variables used. This methodology uses geographic information systems technology sustained by open-source satellite imagery, along with the Habitat Risk Assessment model from the InVEST software package, as drivers for the MDIR application. The MDIR approach grants frequent update capabilities and fully open-sourced high ignition risk area identification, producing monthly ignition risk maps. The advantage of using this method is the ease of adaptation to any current monitoring strategy, awarding further efficiency and efficacy in reducing ignitions. The approach delivered adequate results in estimating ignitions for the three Portuguese municipalities, achieving, for several months, prediction accuracy percentages of over 70%. For the studied area, MDIR clearly identifies areas of high ignition risk and delivers an average of 62% success in predicting ignitions, thus showing potential for analyzing the impact of policy implementation and monitoring through the strategy design.","[Santos, Luis; Lopes, Vasco; Baptista, Cecilia] Polytech Inst Tomar, Sch Technol, P-2300313 Tomar, Portugal; [Santos, Luis] Coimbra Univ, Geosci Res Ctr, P-3030790 Coimbra, Portugal; [Santos, Luis; Baptista, Cecilia] Ctr Technol Restorat & Art Enhancement Techn & Ar, P-2300313 Tomar, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Tomar; Universidade de Coimbra,"Santos, L (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Tomar, Sch Technol, P-2300313 Tomar, Portugal.;Santos, L (corresponding author), Coimbra Univ, Geosci Res Ctr, P-3030790 Coimbra, Portugal.;Santos, L (corresponding author), Ctr Technol Restorat & Art Enhancement Techn & Ar, P-2300313 Tomar, Portugal.",lsantos@ipt.pt; estt11828@ipt.pt; cecilia@ipt.pt,,"Santos, Luis/0000-0003-1006-4131",,,,,55,1,1,5,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,MAR,2022,3,,,,,,408,10.3390/f13030408,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13030408,,,18,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,0D1GF,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000775749800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, the concept of Canonical Correlation Analysis is used for making MME (referred as Multi Model Canonical Correlation Analysis or MMCCA) for the prediction of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) during June-July-August-September (JJAS). This method has been employed on the rainfall outputs of six different GCMs for the period 1982 to 2008. The prediction skill of ISMR by MMCCA is compared with the simple composite method (SCM) (i.e. arithmetic mean of all GCMs), which is taken as a benchmark. After a rigorous analysis through different skill metrics such as correlation coefficient and index of agreement, the superiority of MMCCA over SCM is illustrated. Performance of both models is also evaluated during six typical monsoon years and the results indicate the potential of MMCCA over SCM in capturing the spatial pattern during extreme years.

Here, we examine Holocene stand-scale vegetation dynamics and its drivers at the western boundary of the Russian taiga forest in NW Russia. Fossil pollen and conifer stomata records from four small hollow sites and two lake sites are used to reconstruct local vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. Variation partitioning is used to assess the relative importance of the potential drivers (temperature, forest fires and growing site wetness) to the long-term stand-scale dynamics in taiga forest. All the main tree taxa, including the boreal keystone species Picea abies (Norway spruce) and Larix sibirica (Siberian larch), have been locally present since 10,000 cal yr bp. The constant Holocene presence of L. sibirica at three small hollow sites suggests a fast postglacial immigration of the species in northern Europe. Picea was present but not dominant at all study sites until its expansion between 8,000 and 7,000 cal yr bp markedly changed the forest structure through the suppression of Betula (birch), Pinus (pine) and Larix. Our results demonstrate that in general, the Holocene forest dynamics in our study region have been driven by temperature, but during short intervals the role of local factors, especially forest fires, has been prominent. The comparison between sites reveals the importance of local factors in stand-scale dynamics in taiga forests. Therefore, the future responses of taiga forest to climate change will be predominantly modulated by the local characteristics at the site.","[Kuosmanen, Niina; Seppa, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Div Biogeosci, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Reitalu, Triin] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Geol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Alenius, Teija] Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies Archae, POB 59, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Bradshaw, Richard H.

Internal tides can be generated by topographic horizontal scales ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers. State of the art topographic products barely resolve scales smaller than approximate to 10 km in the deep ocean. On these scales abyssal hills dominate ocean floor roughness. The impact of abyssal hill roughness on internal-tide generation is evaluated in this study. The conversion of M-2 barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy is calculated based on linear wave theory both in real and spectral space using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM30_PLUS bathymetric product at 1/120 degrees resolution with and without the addition of synthetic abyssal hill roughness. Internal tide generation by abyssal hills integrates to 0.1 TW globally or 0.03 TW when the energy flux is empirically corrected for supercritical slope (i.e., approximate to 10% of the energy flux due to larger topographic scales resolved in standard products in both cases). The abyssal hill driven energy conversion is dominated by mid-ocean ridges, where abyssal hill roughness is large. Focusing on two regions located over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise, it is shown that regionally linear theory predicts an increase of the energy flux due to abyssal hills of up to 100% or 60% when an empirical correction for supercritical slopes is attempted. Therefore, abyssal hills, unresolved in state of the art topographic products, can have a strong impact on internal tide generation, especially over mid-ocean ridges.","[Melet, Angelique] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nikurashin, Maxim] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Muller, Caroline] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Lab Hydrodynam, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Falahat, S.; Nycander, Jonas] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Timko, Patrick G.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales; [Arbic, Brian K.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales; [Goff, John A.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; University of Tasmania; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Stockholm University; Bangor University; Bangor University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Melet, A (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton Univ Forrestal Campus,201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",amelet@princeton.edu,"Melet, Angelique/ABE-5148-2020; Nikurashin, Maxim/P-4018-2019; Nycander, Jonas/E-1334-2011; Nikurashin, Maxim/J-3506-2013","Melet, Angelique/0000-0003-3888-8159; Nycander, Jonas/0000-0002-4414-6859; Nikurashin, Maxim/0000-0002-5714-8343; Arbic, Brian K/0000-0002-7969-2294; Timko, Patrick/0000-0003-2869-561X","National Science Foundation [OCE-0968721, OCE-096878, OCE-0924481]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA08OAR4320752]; University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences Development grant; Naval Research Laboratory [N000173-06-2-C003]; Office of Naval Research grants [N00014-07-1-0392, N00014-09-1-1003, N00014-11-1-0487]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences Development grant; Naval Research Laboratory(United States Department of Defense); Office of Naval Research grants(Office of Naval Research)","The authors would like to thank three anonymous reviewers as well as Sonya Legg for helpful comments leading to improvements in the manuscript.

For this purpose this paper introduces Recognyze, a named entity linking component that uses background knowledge obtained from linked data repositories, and outlines the process of transforming heterogeneous data silos within an organization into a linked enterprise data repository which draws upon popular linked open data vocabularies to foster interoperability with public data sets. The presented examples use comprehensive real-world data sets from Orell Fussli Business Information, Switzerland's largest business information provider. The linked data repository created from these data sets comprises more than nine million triples on companies, the companies' contact information, key people, products and brands. We identify the major challenges of tapping into such sources for named entity linking, and describe required data pre-processing techniques to use and integrate such data sets, with a special focus on disambiguation and ranking algorithms. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation based on business news from the New Journal of Zurich and AWP Financial News to illustrate how these techniques improve the performance of the Recognyze named entity linking component.","[Weichselbraun, Albert; Streiff, Daniel] Univ Appl Sci, Swiss Inst Informat Res, CH-7004 Chur, Switzerland; [Scharl, Arno] MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept New Media Technol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria",,"Weichselbraun, A (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci, Swiss Inst Informat Res, Pulvermuhlestr 57, CH-7004 Chur, Switzerland.",albert.weichselbraun@htwchur.ch; daniel.streiff@htwchur.ch; scharl@modul.ac.at,"Weichselbraun, Albert/C-3832-2014; Scharl, Arno/N-3411-2013","Weichselbraun, Albert/0000-0001-6399-045X; Scharl, Arno/0000-0001-5346-9521","Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); DecarboNet project (decarbonet.eu) - European Union's 7th Framework Programme for research, technology development and demonstration [610829]","Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); DecarboNet project (decarbonet.eu) - European Union's 7th Framework Programme for research, technology development and demonstration","The research presented in this paper has been conducted as part of the COMET Project (www.htwchur.ch/comet), funded by the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), and the DecarboNet project (decarbonet.eu), funded by the European Union's 7th Framework Programme for research, technology development and demonstration under the Grant Agreement No. 610829.

The questions were validated by the 27/73 quantile method, and the survey results were analyzed through one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). The results showed that the college students could evaluate the sense of equity rather accurately and generally had a higher sense of equity, but failed to sense the social outcome equity well; their sense of social equity was lower than the sense of educational equity; the sense of equity varied between college students in different majors: the science majors had a lower sense of equity than those majoring in liberal arts; some college students had a misunderstanding of equity.","[Wang, Xiaolei] Northeastern Univ Qinhuangdao, Sch Control Engn, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junchen] Northeastern Univ Qinhuangdao, Sch Management, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Li, Zengxin] Qinhuangdao Vocat & Tech Coll, Dept Econ, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China,"Li, ZX (corresponding author), Qinhuangdao Vocat & Tech Coll, Dept Econ, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China.",leezengxin@126.com,,,Social Science Research Foundation in Higher Education of Hebei Province of China [SZ19065],Social Science Research Foundation in Higher Education of Hebei Province of China,The research is supported by the Social Science Research Foundation in Higher Education of Hebei Province of China in 2019 (Grant number: SZ19065).,,22,2,2,4,15,KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH,KASSEL,"DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY",1863-0383,,,INT J EMERG TECHNOL,Int.

A total of 69 locations, most with data covering the period 1900-96 were used. Data availability in much of the Canadian Arctic was restricted to 1948-96 By using daily data, improved corrections to precipitation data, not practical with monthly data, could be implemented. For each of three rain gauge types, corrections to account for wind undercatch and evaporation were implemented Gauge specific wetting loss corrections were applied for each rainfall event. For snowfall, ruler measurements were used throughout the time series, to minimize potential discontinuities introduced by the adoption of Nipher shielded snow gauge measurements in the mid-1960s. Density corrections based upon coincident ruler and Nipher measurements were applied to all oiler measurements. Where necessary, records from neighbouring stations were joined employing a technique based on a simple ratio of observations. The adjustment procedures used remove systematic biases due to changes in the measurement program but do not account for inhomogeneities related to local site changes etc. It is assumed that such local changes introduce random inhomogeneities which are smoothed by combining the results from numerous stations. Work to adjust data from about 500 stations and generate monthly grids or maps is well underway but preliminary trend results were examined for this project by grouping stations by region. Regional time series of normalized anomalies are computed as the arithmetic mean of stations within the region. Annual and seasonal graphs of national and regional time series are presented. The national time series shows art increase in precipitation of 1.7% of mean/decade over 1948-95 The greatest increase is in the autumn. For the same period, Canada north of 55 degrees N showed an increase of 2.3% of mean/decade, more than the south, but much less than the 4-5% of mean/decade suggested by Groisman and Easterling (1994). The ratio of liquid to solid precipitation for Canada has declined slightly over the 1948-95 period.","Atmospher Environm Serv, Climate Res Branch, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada,"Mekis, E (corresponding author), Atmospher Environm Serv, Climate Res Branch, 4905 Dufferin St, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",,,"Mekis, Eva/0000-0002-2011-2400",,,,,30,266,268,0,17,CANADIAN METEOROLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHIC SOC,OTTAWA,"150 LOUIS PASTEUR PVT., STE 112, MCDONALD BUILDING, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1N 6N5, CANADA",0705-5900,,,ATMOS OCEAN,Atmos.-Ocean,MAR,1999,1,,,,53,85,,10.1080/07055900.1999.9649621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.1999.9649621,,,33,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,200TL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000080556100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Once released to air, land and water, the addition of carbon atoms to mercury by bacteria results in the production of methylmercury, the toxic form that bioaccumulates in aquatic and terrestrial food chains resulting in elevated exposure to humans and wildlife. Global recognition of the mercury contamination problem has resulted in the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which came into force in 2017. The treaty aims to protect human health and the environment from human-generated releases of mercury curtailing its movement and transformations in the biosphere. Coincident with the treaty's coming into force, the 13th International Conference of Mercury as a Global Pollutant (ICMGP-13) was held in Providence, Rhode Island USA. At ICMGP-13, cutting edge research was summarized and presented to address questions relating to global and regional sources and cycling of mercury, how that mercury is methylated, the effects of mercury exposure on humans and wildlife, and the science needed for successful implementation of the Minamata Convention. Human activities have the potential to enhance mercury methylation by remobilizing previously released mercury, and increasing methylation efficiency. This synthesis concluded that many of the most important factors influencing the fate and effects of mercury and its more toxic form, methylmercury, stem from environmental changes that are much broader in scope than mercury releases alone. Alterations of mercury cycling, methylmercury bioavailability and trophic transfer due to climate and land use changes remain critical uncertainties in effective implementation of the Minamata Convention. In the face of these uncertainties, important policy and management actions are needed over the short-term to support the control of mercury releases to land, water and air. These include adequate monitoring and communication on risk from exposure to various forms of inorganic mercury as well as methylmercury from fish and rice consumption. Successful management of global and local mercury pollution will require integration of mercury research and policy in a changing world.","[Chen, Celia Y.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Driscoll, Charles T.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Eagles-Smith, Collin A.] US Geol Survey, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Eckley, Chris S.] US EPA, Reg 10, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Gay, David A.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hsu-Kim, Heileen] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Keane, Susan E.] Nat Resources Def Council, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Kirk, Jane L.] Environm & Climate Change, Burlington, ON L7P 2X3, Canada; [Mason, Robert P.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Obrist, Daniel] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lowell, MA 01854 USA; [Selin, Henrik] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Sch Global Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Selin, Noelle E.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Boston, MA 02139 USA; [Thompson, Marcella R.] Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Nursing, Providence, RI 02903 USA",Dartmouth College; Syracuse University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Duke University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Connecticut; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell; Boston University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Rhode Island,"Chen, CY (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,"Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017; Selin, Noelle E/A-4158-2008; Eagles-Smith, Collin/T-8580-2019; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Hsu-Kim, Heileen/A-5409-2008; Eagles-Smith, Collin/AAH-3811-2019","Selin, Noelle E/0000-0002-6396-5622; Driscoll, Charles/0000-0003-2692-2890; Hsu-Kim, Heileen/0000-0003-0675-4308; Eagles-Smith, Collin/0000-0003-1329-5285; Eckley, Chris/0000-0002-6986-4451; Chen, Celia/0000-0002-1289-8861","13th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant, National Institute of Environment Health Sciences [R13 ES028077-01, P42ES007373]; New York Energy Research and Development Authority; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES [P42ES007373, R13ES028077] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [U54GM115677] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Directorate For Geosciences [1739567] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","13th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant, National Institute of Environment Health Sciences; New York Energy Research and Development Authority; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","The production of this paper was supported by the 13th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant, National Institute of Environment Health Sciences Grant R13 ES028077-01 to C.C. and award number P42ES007373, and the New York Energy Research and Development Authority to C.D. and C.C.

Often, Gaussian processes are trained on datasets and are subsequently embedded as surrogate models in optimization problems. These optimization problems are nonconvex and global optimization is desired. However, previous literature observed computational burdens limiting deterministic global optimization to Gaussian processes trained on few data points. We propose a reduced-space formulation for deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes embedded. For optimization, the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the free variables and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian process models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and computationally cheaper subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further accelerate convergence, we derive envelopes of common covariance functions for GPs and tight relaxations of acquisition functions used in Bayesian optimization including expected improvement, probability of improvement, and lower confidence bound. In total, we reduce computational time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, thus overcoming previous computational burdens. We demonstrate the performance and scaling of the proposed method and apply it to Bayesian optimization with global optimization of the acquisition function and chance-constrained programming. The Gaussian process models, acquisition functions, and training scripts are available open-source within the MeLOn-MachineLearning Models for Optimization toolbox (https://git.rwth-aachen.de/avt.svt/public/MeLOn).","[Schweidtmann, Artur M.; Bongartz, Dominik; Grothe, Daniel; Kerkenhoff, Tim; Lin, Xiaopeng; Najman, Jaromil; Mitsos, Alexander] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Proc Syst Engn AVT SVT, Aachen, Germany; [Mitsos, Alexander] JARA CSD, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Mitsos, Alexander] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, D-52425 Julich, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Mitsos, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Proc Syst Engn AVT SVT, Aachen, Germany.;Mitsos, A (corresponding author), JARA CSD, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.;Mitsos, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",amitsos@alum.mit.edu,"Schweidtmann, Artur M./W-7428-2019; Mitsos, Alexander/D-5873-2011","Schweidtmann, Artur M./0000-0001-8885-6847; Mitsos, Alexander/0000-0003-0335-6566; Bongartz, Dominik/0000-0003-1790-0235","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy-Cluster of Excellence 2186 The Fuel Science Center; project Improved McCormick Relaxations for the efficient Global Optimization in the Space of Degrees of Freedom [MI 1851/4-1]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy-Cluster of Excellence 2186 The Fuel Science Center(German Research Foundation (DFG)); project Improved McCormick Relaxations for the efficient Global Optimization in the Space of Degrees of Freedom","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy-Cluster of Excellence 2186 The Fuel Science Center and the project Improved McCormick Relaxations for the efficient Global Optimization in the Space of Degrees of Freedom MI 1851/4-1.",,88,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2949,1867-2957,,MATH PROGRAM COMPUT,Math.

In particular, the hypothesized replacement of ancient rainforest-dwelling extinct lineages by antecedents of xeric-tolerant extant taxa during the late Miocene (-10 Ma) has been advocated as a broader pattern evident amongst other marsupial clades. Problematically, however, this is in persistent conflict with DNA phylogenies. We therefore determine the pattern and timing of bandicoot evolution using the first combined morphological + DNA sequence dataset of Peramelemorphia. In addition, we document a remarkably archaic new fossil peramelemorphian taxon that inhabited a latest Quaternary mosaic savannah-riparian forest ecosystem on the Aru Islands of Eastern Indonesia. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that unsuspected dental homoplasy and the detrimental effects of missing data collectively obscure stem bandicoot relationships. Nevertheless, recalibrated molecular clocks and multiple ancestral area optimizations unanimously infer an early diversification of modern xeric-adapted forms. These probably originated during the late Palaeogene (30-40 Ma) alongside progenitors of other desert marsupials, and thus occupied seasonally dry heterogenous habitats long before the onset of late Neogene aridity.","[Kear, Benjamin P.] Uppsala Univ, Museum Evolut, Norbyvagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Kear, Benjamin P.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Aplin, Ken P.] Smithsonian Inst, Div Mammals, Natl Museum Nat Hist, POB 37012, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Westerman, Michael] La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia",Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; La Trobe University,"Kear, BP (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Museum Evolut, Norbyvagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.;Kear, BP (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",benjamin.kear@em.uu.se,,,Swedish Research Council; Uppsala University; La Trobe University,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Uppsala University; La Trobe University,"The authors thank Sandy Ingleby and Yong Yi Zhen (Australian Museum), Gavin Dally (Museum & Art Gallery of the Northern Territory), Wayne Longmore, Rory O'Brien and David Pickering (Museum Victoria), Robert Meredith and Mark Springer (University of California), Kenny Travouillon (Western Australian Museum), Michael Archer (University of New South Wales), and David Stemmer (South Australian Museum) for access to specimens, sequence data, and information.

Based on previous work, four correlations have been selected for this study. Using a matlab-based Nelder-Mead simplex direct search method, each correlation's adjustable parameters are optimized such that their mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is minimized. In addition to the literature correlations, a new empirical correlation is developed using the same search method to define constants and powers in the expression. Two sets of optimized parameters are proposed to account for atmospheric and elevated (0.2-3.0MPa) pressure flames. Each correlation is tested further, examining their ability to match ST trends for varying equivalence ratio (phi) and turbulent velocity ratio (u ' /SL). It was found that a minimum of two correlations and two sets of adjustable parameters are required to accurately account for the entire range of data, thus showing that there is currently no turbulent flame speed correlation that is applicable across all engine-relevant conditions.","[Yousefian, Sajjad; Burke, Eoin M.; Monaghan, Rory F.

J,"Park, S",,,,"Park, Soyang",,,"Silence, Subaltern Speech and the Intellectual in South Korea: The Politics of Emergent Speech in the Case of Former Sexual Slaves",JOURNAL FOR CULTURAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper explores how the long repressed and silenced subaltern groups in Korean postcolonial history, especially the women who were once sexual slaves, have gradually come into historical light by providing their testimonies in the emergent cultural and political milieu of the 1990s. An estimated 200,000 Asian women, about 80 percent of whom were Korean, were coerced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army during World War Two. I trace the determining factors behind the silencing structure which forced the women into silence in East Asian society; that is, the combination of a persistent patriarchal culture, and the geo-political and economic climate that emerged in post-war East Asia under the US and Japanese hegemony that suppressed the voices of these dehumanized women for many decades. Through a close reading of the testimonies of Kim Haksun, Kim Yunsim, two former sexual slavery victims, amongst others, I investigate the modes of emergence of the womens' testimonies and suggest a pragmatic and relational model for viewing them. Reappraising Gayatri Spivak's insights into silence and speech of the subaltern in her influential essay, Can The Subaltern Speak? (1988), I emphasize the indispensable role of intellectuals like Yun Jeongok and other feminists in dismantling this silencing structure which then enabled the women's speech process to begin. But more significantly, I discuss the fact that the subaltern and intellectual women are in an interdependent relationship in creating the emerging space of speech and new histories; the subaltern women's desire for redemption and the intellectual women's needs to retrieve their truth in order to rewrite this history are mutually oriented and converge.","[Park, Soyang] Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford, England; [Park, Soyang] Goldsmiths Coll, Twentieth century art & theory, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Park, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford, England.",,,,Korean Culture and Arts Foundation,Korean Culture and Arts Foundation,"I would like to thank The Korean Culture and Arts Foundation who kindly extended funding to prepare the manuscript for the publication of this article.

In order to combine these two models, three additional modules (Drift Interpolation module, Vector-to-Scalar module and Orientation Updating module) need to be developed, so that the two models which are based on different assumptions, coordinate systems and set-ups can be linked seamlessly. The existing two models and the three new modules are able to work together as a whole composition (i.e. the combined model) based on the OpenMI standard. This combined model aims to improve the one-line model in terms of alongshore sediment transport and beach morphological response predictability. It adopts both the modified Coastal Engineering Research Centre, USA (CERC) formula and the Energetics approach to calculate the alongshore sediment transport. Tests at a real curved coast demonstrate that the model is numerically stable, effective in computing and able to give reasonable predictions of shoreline change. It demonstrates that further research on linking existing models is promising.","[Zhou, Zeng; Nicholls, Robert] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [de San Roman, Belen Lopez] HR Wallingford Ltd, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Nicholls, Robert] Univ Southampton, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton; HR Wallingford Limited; University of Southampton,"Zhou, Z (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, IH Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",,"Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Zhou, Zeng/N-4536-2013; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010","Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Zhou, Zeng/0000-0002-4745-1621; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109",HR Wallingford Ltd (CEM-Stage3 Research Project); Erasmus Mundus-CoMEM Master programme (Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management),HR Wallingford Ltd (CEM-Stage3 Research Project); Erasmus Mundus-CoMEM Master programme (Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management),"This work is financially supported by HR Wallingford Ltd (CEM-Stage3 Research Project) and the Erasmus Mundus-CoMEM Master programme (Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management).

This paper aims to discover the most frequent objetos of study related to disinformation published in Spanish journals, in the period 2016-2021. It is also intended to elaborate a general cartography of these topics. A systematic literature review was conducted through a Mixed Method Research Design integrating qualitative analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics. Although a significant thematic dispersion is observed, there is a tendency towards the study of the solutions to address this problem, especially from the journalistic field, taking fact-checking as a relevant actor. Likewise, this study detects a high interest in the discursive dimension of the phenomenon and the analysis of its possible causes; as opposed to other fundamental topics to understand the problem, such as the spread of false content online and the biases operating in its reception.","[Garcia-Marin, David; Salvat Martinrey, Guiomar] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Garcia-Marin, D (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain.",david.garciam@urjc.es; guiomar.salvat@urjc.es,"salvat-martinrey, guiomar/ABF-7134-2020","salvat-martinrey, guiomar/0000-0001-6402-259X",,,,,81,3,3,6,11,EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA,SALAMANCA,"APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN",2172-9077,,,FONSECA,Fonseca,,2021,23,,,,199,225,,10.14201/fjc202123199225,http://dx.doi.org/10.14201/fjc202123199225,,,27,Communication,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Communication,XJ2NC,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000726630500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However both systems are heterogeneous and continually evolving, varying from total confinement to total pasture with many hybrid intermediaries. To compare the welfare of dairy cows in these various systems, we use the three spheres framework, comprising biological functioning, natural behaviour and affective states. Considering biological functioning, pasture-based cows are less at risk of subclinical and clinical mastitis, claw lesions, lameness, metritis, early embryonic mortality, culling and mortality, but at more risk of internal parasitism, malnutrition and delayed onset of oestrous activity postpartum than confined cows. Regarding natural behaviours, pasture-based cows exhibit less agonistic behaviour, better lying behaviour, more normal oestrous behaviours and better synchronicity of behaviours than confined cows. They also have the opportunity to graze, which is one of the main features of the behavioural repertoire of dairy cows, but, they may also experience long periods away from pasture in larger herds, and severe climatic stresses which will become increasingly important as the climate changes. Our current ability to assess the affective state of dairy cows is poor. For example, hunger is an important subjective state that cannot be measured directly. The growing focus on ensuring that animals have lives worth living, means that dairy cows should garner some positive emotions from their lives, and it seems clear that pasture access is essential for this. Clearly measurement of affective state is an important challenge for future dairy cow welfare research. At the extremes of management systems, there can be major differences in animal welfare but in hybrid systems, dairy cows experience elements of both confinement and pasture which may ameliorate the negative effects of each on cow welfare. Ultimately, the optimal system gives cows an element of choice between both environments. Moreover management of the system, whether it is confinement or pastured-based, may be as important as the system of management in ensuring good dairy cow welfare and addressing societal concerns.","[Mee, J.

High resolution palaeoclimate archives suggest that monsoon variability was a key driver of change, but these records obscure environmental heterogeneity at finer spatial scales. Recent decades have seen the production of new, chronometrically controlled records from a range of new sites, with a greater spatial coverage. However, records often appear contradictory vis a vis the hydro-climatic state of the environment and so synthesising them can be challenging. To enhance collation and interpretation of records we have compiled a new database of terrestrial and coastal environmental chronologies for the Arabian Peninsula over the last 20 ka, a key period of marked hydrological change. The SCAPE (Synthesising Chronologies for Arabian PalaeoEnvironments) database contains records that include >700 luminescence and radiocarbon ages. Robustness criteria are applied to identify the utility of each data source in regional hydroclimate reconstruction. The most robust data provide a unique synthesis of 20 ka of palaeoenvironmental change at sub-regional scales. We find that Arabian environmental change does not necessarily follow broad narratives of 'wet' or 'dry' states but rather the climatic signal is a mosaic of substantial landscape heterogeneity. SCAPE also highlights regions in which more high-quality geochronological investigation is warranted to refine both temporal and spatial records, signifying important avenues for future research.","[Woor, Sam; Buckland, Catherine; Thomas, David S.

The weaknesses detected in the state-of-the-art, such as the misalignment of empirical testing and the theoretical drivers of synergy, as well as inconsistencies in the selection of variables and biases imposed by classifications in discrete timings, lead us to define an improved methodological framework. We apply the continuous observation of Ward's hierarchical clustering in squared Euclidean distances under Thorndike's criterium to twenty-three European countries between 2008 and 2016 and reject synergy after detecting that Social-democratic regimes display the best social conditions but the worst environmental performances and that society and the environment are not linked.

The performance of these systems heavily relies on the careful analysis of different facial attributes (gender, race, etc.) since these attributes can tolerate some degrees of geometrical distortion, expressions, and occlusions. However, solely employing facial scores fail to add scalability. Besides, owing to the discriminative power of CNN (convolutional neural network) features, recent works have employed a complete set of deep transferred CNN features with a large dimensionality to obtain enhancement; yet these systems require high computational power and are very resource-demanding. This study aims to exploit the distinctive capability of semantic facial attributes while their retrieval results are refined by a proposed subset feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the deep transferred descriptors. The constructed compact deeply transferred descriptors (CDTD) not only have a largely reduced dimension but also more discriminative power. Lastly, we have proposed a new performance metric which is tailored for the case of face retrieval called ImAP (Individual Mean Average Precision) and is used to evaluate retrieval results. Multiple experiments on two scalable face datasets demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed CDTD model outperforming state-of-the-art face retrieval results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

They address the integration of the meteorological, hydrologic and biophysical variables critical for understanding the processes governing agricultural production and the agricultural interaction with the environment. Agroclimate measurement techniques also consider the temporal and spatial scales relevant to agriculture. Soil moisture is a key variable for crop productivity, crop management practices, flood and excess moisture risk, and can control greenhouse gas emissions from farming operations. Crop condition and drought monitoring practices have been used as early warning for production and food security issues. Greenhouse gas flux is a critical indicator of the degree to which agriculture is either a source or a sink for greenhouse gases. Within each of these areas are multiple state of the art operational or near-operational techniques for measurement of indices and elements that pertain to spatial and temporal scales that are important for agriculture. In an era of rapidly increasing availability of data, there are opportunities to better describe and measure the complexities of interactions influencing agricultural productivity and the agrienvironmental footprint. Measurement techniques are increasingly relying on sophisticated modeling and analysis techniques that integrate data from several sources to derive new information at the temporal and spatial scales required to support the agriculture sector's needs for science-based early warning and decision support.","[Howard, Allan; Chipanshi, Aston] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Regina, SK, Canada; [Davidson, Andrew; Desjardins, Raymond; McNairn, Heather] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Kolotii, Andrii; Shelestov, Andrii] Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine; [Kolotii, Andrii; Kussul, Nataliia; Skakun, Sergii; Shelestov, Andrii] Natl Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, Kiev, Ukraine; [Kolotii, Andrii; Kussul, Nataliia; Skakun, Sergii; Shelestov, Andrii] State Space Agcy Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine; [Kolotii, Andrii; Kussul, Nataliia; Shelestov, Andrii] Natl Tech Univ Ukraine, Kyiv Polytech Inst, Kiev, Ukraine",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; National University of Life & Environmental Sciences of Ukraine; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; State Space Agency of Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute,"Howard, A (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Regina, SK, Canada.",allan.howard@agr.gc.ca,"Kolotii, Andrii/D-8635-2015","Kolotii, Andrii/0000-0002-6972-4483",,,,,154,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC AGRONOMY,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE RD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",2156-3276,,978-0-89118-357-0; 978-0-89118-358-7,AGRON MONOGR,,,2019,,,,,489,517,,10.2134/agronmonogr60.2014.0056.5,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronmonogr60.2014.0056.5,10.2134/agronmonogr60,,29,Agronomy; Environmental Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BR7IX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000667934200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Models support designers in choosing between different technical solutions. This study analyses the cooling effect of two plants suitable for the Mediterranean area. A regression model simulating the difference of the wall external surface temperature between the wall covered with vegetation and an uncovered wall was developed. In order to overcome the gaps in literature, the model was fitted and validated on long period experimental data. It was based only on the use of climatic conditions as input variables, without making assumptions about the plants. Climatic data were grouped in solar radiation slots; the most significant predictors were selected for each slot. The adoption of this method allowed to obtain, during validation, coefficients of determination (R-2) higher than 0.95 and low values of the root mean square error (0.4-0.6 degrees C). It was found that the vegetated walls recorded surface temperatures lower than the uncovered wall up to 7.7 degrees C in summertime. The results showed that the model developed with a statistical approach can efficiently be used for simulating the thermal effects of a green facade in a similar Mediterranean climate.","[Blanco, Ileana; Schettini, Evelia; Vox, Giuliano] Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DISAAT, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Schettini, E (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DISAAT, Bari, Italy.",ileana.blanco@uniba.it; evelia.schettini@uniba.it; giuliano.vox@uniba.it,"BLANCO, ILEANA/ADD-4669-2022","BLANCO, ILEANA/0000-0003-2927-3427",Italian Ministry of Economic Development,"Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development [Piano triennale della Ricerca 2015-2017 nell'ambito del Sistema Elettrico Nazionale, Progetto D.1 'Tecnologie per costruire gli edifici del futuro', Research activity: Analisi di tecniche di raffrescamento sostenibili applicabili in edifici civil e in edifici serra, Piano Annuale di Realizzazione (PAR) 2017, Accordo di Programma Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico - ENEA].",,63,9,9,0,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1359-4311,,,APPL THERM ENG,Appl.

Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out AEC prediction research using state-of-art neural network (NN) methods. The attention mechanism (AM) has become an indispensable part of NNs that focuses on input weight assignment. Traditional AM is used in time steps to help generate the outputs. To select important features of meteorological parameters (MP) that are helpful for forecasting, in this study, we apply AM to features instead of time steps. Then we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) NN based on AM to predict the AEC. The proposed method can remember information twice (i.e., forward and backward), which can provide more context for AEC forecasting. Finally, an in situ measured MP dataset is applied in the proposed model, which presents Maoming coastal area's atmospheric conditions in November 2020. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper has higher accuracy compared with traditional NN, providing a novel solution to the AEC prediction problem for the current studies of marine aerosol.","[Ye, Zhou; Cui, Shengcheng; Qiao, Zhi; Zhang, Zihan; Zhu, Wenyue; Li, Xuebin; Qian, Xianmei] Chinese Acad Sci, Anhui Inst Opt & Fine Mech, Key Lab Atmospher Opt, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhou; Cui, Shengcheng; Qiao, Zhi; Zhang, Zihan; Zhu, Wenyue; Li, Xuebin; Qian, Xianmei] Adv Laser Technol Lab Anhui Prov, Hefei 230037, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhou; Qiao, Zhi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sci Isl Branch Grad Sch, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Institute of Optics & Fine Mechanics (AIOFM), CAS; Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Cui, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Anhui Inst Opt & Fine Mech, Key Lab Atmospher Opt, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China.;Cui, SC (corresponding author), Adv Laser Technol Lab Anhui Prov, Hefei 230037, Peoples R China.",yezhou19@mail.ustc.edu.cn; csc@aiofm.ac.cn; qzibb@mail.ustc.edu.cn; zzh@aiofm.ac.cn; uohzey@gmail.com; xbli@aiofm.ac.cn; qianxianmei@aiofm.ac.cn,,"Cui, Shengcheng/0000-0002-7949-6170","Foundation of Key Laboratory of Science and Technology Innovation of Chinese Academy of Sciences [CXJJ-21S028]; Thirteenth Five-Year Equipment Pre-Research Sharing Technology Project [41416030204]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA17010104]; Youth spark project of Hefei Institute of material sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences [29YZJJ2020QN2]","Foundation of Key Laboratory of Science and Technology Innovation of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Thirteenth Five-Year Equipment Pre-Research Sharing Technology Project; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth spark project of Hefei Institute of material sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This research was funded by the [Foundation of Key Laboratory of Science and Technology Innovation of Chinese Academy of Sciences] grant number [CXJJ-21S028], the [Thirteenth Five-Year Equipment Pre-Research Sharing Technology Project] grant number [41416030204], the [Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences] grant number [XDA17010104], and the [Youth spark project of Hefei Institute of material sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences] grant number [29YZJJ2020QN2].",,37,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

These fragile urban areas perished many centuries ago, and thus a century and a half of scholarly research has focussed on the more durable components of Khmer culture, in particular the famous temples and the texts and works of art that are normally found within them. In recent years however there has been a considerable effort to broaden the perspective beyond conventional approaches to Khmer history and archaeology. Remarkable advances have been made in the domain of remote sensing and archaeological mapping, including the application of advanced geospatial techniques such as airborne laser scanning within studies of heritage landscapes at Angkor and beyond. This article describes the most recent applications of the technology in Cambodia, including the results of a newly completed campaign of airborne laser scanning in 2015 the most extensive acquisition ever undertaken by an archaeological project and underscores the importance of using these methods as part of a problem-oriented research program that speaks to broader issues within history and archaeology.

Resilience, when discussed in the context of planning and design, however, embodies a strong human-centric element. Ecocentric vs. anthropocentric perspectives provoke further discussion around an evolving relationship between ecological function and aesthetic forms that have been heavily informed by cultural and societal contexts.

In this paper, we focus on the intrabasin variability in sediment yield within the Blue Nile and Atbara basins as biophysical and anthropogenic factors are presumably acting together to accelerate soil erosion. The Blue Nile and Atbara River systems are characterized by an important spatial variability in sediment fluxes, with area-specific sediment yield (SSY) values ranging between 4 and 4935 t/km(2)/y. Statistical analyses show that 41% of the observed variation in SSY can be explained by remote sensing proxy data of surface vegetation cover, rainfall intensity, mean annual temperature, and human impact. The comparison of a locally adapted regression model with global predictive sediment flux models indicates that global flux models such as the ART and BQART models are less suited to capture the spatial variability in area-specific sediment yields (SSY), but they are very efficient to predict absolute sediment yields (SY). We developed a modified version of the BQART model that estimates the human influence on sediment yield based on a high resolution composite measure of local human impact (human footprint index) instead of countrywide estimates of GNP/capita.

Understanding the impacts of multiple uncertainties associated with design, construction, and operational control on its thermal performances is critical to the development of this burgeoning active insulation technology. Aiming at this goal, an in-depth uncertainty analysis (UA) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) study was numerically conducted to investigate the influence mechanism of 12 different variables on 5 performance indicators in winter conditions. The UA results indicated that a dual-effect, i.e., better indoor thermal comfort and zero or even negative thermal load of the exterior walls, could be achieved only when relevant variables were properly selected. Due to the increase in the quantities and types of input variables, as well as the internal heat transfer process became more complicated, the importance rankings of variables obtained by two different GSA methods became different. Therefore, the treed Gaussian process method was proven to be more effective in identifying the uncertain variables. The GSA results stated that heat-source temperature, indoor set-point, charging duration, and thermal conductivity of pipe-embedded layer were the four most significant variables. For heat-source temperature and indoor set-point, there always existed an obvious mutual restriction relationship between them among all indicators except exterior surface heating loss. Meanwhile, the suggested value of the charging duration was no less than 6 h, and the optimal range of the thermal conductivity of pipe-embedded layer given by GSA was 0.5-2.75 W/m.celcius. Under the blocking effect of the thermal barrier, the uncertainty of the climate zone on interior surface heating load was greatly reduced, and the climate zone was no longer a key variable affecting the cumulative subcooling duration. Besides, it was proved that the pipe spacing had a great influence on the heat accumulation inside the pipe-embedded layer, pipe location had a slight influence on interior surface heating load and exterior surface heating loss, and the pipe diameter did not influence thermal performances. From the perspective of energy density, the optimal range of the pipe spacing was 100-250 mm. Overall, this study highlighted the positive effect of the pipe-embedded system on the development of new-built and existing buildings towards zero-carbon targets, and also provided useful guidance for its further applications and investigations.","[Yang, Yang] Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sarula; Chang, Tianxin] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Ma, Junrong; Sun, Yong] Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yong] Natl Energy Adm NEA China, Asia Pacific Econ Cooperat APEC, APEC Sustainable Energy Ctr, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Anhui Jianzhu University; Tianjin University,"Chen, S (corresponding author), Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China.",sarul@tju.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Devel-opment Program of China [2019YFD1100904]; Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Anhui Province [2020-YF36]; Anhui Natural Science Research Projects of Universities [KJ2020A0462]; Doctoral Scientific Research fund of Anhui Jianzhu University [2019QDZ54],National Key Research and Devel-opment Program of China; Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Anhui Province; Anhui Natural Science Research Projects of Universities; Doctoral Scientific Research fund of Anhui Jianzhu University,"This work is co-sponsored by the National Key Research and Devel-opment Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFD1100904) , Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Anhui Province (Grant No. 2020-YF36) , Anhui Natural Science Research Projects of Universities (Grant No. KJ2020A0462) and Doctoral Scientific Research fund of Anhui Jianzhu University (Grant No. 2019QDZ54) .",,57,7,7,7,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

The procedure is to use multiple realizations of the atmospheric GCM coupled to a single realization of the ocean GCM. The ensemble mean state of the atmospheric GCM fluxes are coupled to the ocean model thereby affecting the evolution of the coupled system. The traditional approach for generating a coupled ensemble is to apply the ensemble averaging to a collection of individual realizations a posteriori. This interactive ensemble technique is distinct from the traditional procedure because here the ensemble mean of the atmospheric models continuously interacts with the ocean model as the coupled system evolves. Simulation experiments with and without the interactive ensemble are described. The interactive ensemble coupled model produces realistic ENSO events that are irregular. This technique also dramatically improves the simulation of the global teleconnection associated with ENSO, and the ENSO-monsoon relationship.","Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD 20705 USA",,"Kirtman, BP (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",,,,,,,,15,99,100,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The area is highly influenced by anthropogenic activities and is affected by eutrophication, climate change, habitat modifications, fishing and stocking. Effective genetic management of species in the Baltic Sea is highly warranted in order to maximize their potential for survival, but shortcomings in this respect have been documented. Lack of knowledge is one reason managers give for why they do not regard genetic diversity in management. Here, the current knowledge of population genetic patterns of species in the Baltic Sea is reviewed and summarized with special focus on how the information can be used in management. The extent to which marine protected areas (MPAs) protect genetic diversity is also investigated in a case study of four key species. Sixty-one species have been studied genetically in the Baltic Sea, but comprehensive genetic information exists for only seven of them. Genetic monitoring shows genetic stability in some species but fluctuations and genetic changes in others. About half of the scientific studies published during the last 6years provide conservation advice, indicating a high interest in the scientific community for relating results to practical management. Populations in MPAs do not differ genetically from populations outside MPAs, indicating that MPAs in the Baltic Sea do not protect genetic diversity specifically, but that populations in MPAs are a representative subset of populations in the Baltic Sea. Recommendations are provided for cases where genetic information is available but not used in management, particularly for non-commercial species with important ecosystem function. Improved channels for effective communication between academia and practical management on Baltic Sea genetic biodiversity are needed.

One group of key actors is still poorly analyzed in agricultural studies: the young farmers. Yet they are potential innovators, they insure the generational renewal and thus maintain family agriculture. This paper studies the settling process of young farmers in two communities in Costa Rica resulting from land reforms. We show an important social change with the development of part-time farming activity. Three types of settling are identified: the taking over, the resumption and the creation of a new farm. Whereas resumption and creation trigger changes in the farm and in agriculture, taking over, the most common case, does not give rise to change. Territory characteristics, different capital endowment and the relationship to the former farm owner, who is often the father, can explain these different types of settlings. Our analysis highlights the necessity to consider the diversity of settling processes to promote adapted policy aiming at facilitating the generational renewal in family agriculture.","[Parquet, Mathilde] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, 15 Parvis Rene Descartes,BP 7000, F-69342 Lyon 07, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Cirad, UMR Art Dev, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] CIAT, Dept Anal Polit DAPA, Cali, Colombia",Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Parquet, M (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super Lyon, 15 Parvis Rene Descartes,BP 7000, F-69342 Lyon 07, France.",mathilde.parquet@ens-lyon.fr,,,,,,,42,0,0,1,18,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1777-5949,,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

This chapter frames the challenge of a sustainable built environment, highlights the role of SHCC materials in meeting that challenge, and details specific design approaches for the incorporation of green SHCC materials in sustainable infrastructure. Specifically, the use of SHCC bridge elements to replace failing expansion joints in the USA results in a one third reduction in bridge life-cycle energy consumption when compared to a traditional bridge. Total economic costs are reduced by 15% as a result of less maintenance, lower construction traffic congestion, and fewer environmental impacts. Similarly, using SHCC rigid pavement overlays (rather than concrete or asphalt) to rehabilitate existing rigid pavements can reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one third. The incorporation of life cycle assessment with design to measure sustainability can greatly improve the sustainability of built environments. Accordingly, SHCC materials can play a significant role in improving the sustainability of these environments and systems.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lepech, MD (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",2213-204X,2213-203,978-94-007-0337-7,RILEM STATE ART REP,,,2011,,,,,113,131,,10.1007/978-94-007-0338-4_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-0338-4_8,10.1007/978-94-007-0338-4,,19,"Materials Science, Composites",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Materials Science,BSV81,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000285940600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our analysis clarifies that users are able to successfully modify, improve and redesign next to all subsystems in these technologies. It appears that supplier models do not cater sufficiently for the variation in users' homes, which leaves unexplored design space for users to focus on. The inventive users can speed up the development and proliferation of distributed renewable energy technologies both through their alternative designs as well as through the advanced peer support they provide in popular user run Internet forums related to the purchase, use and maintenance of these technologies.

The annual river runoff ill Iceland is 3.9 times the world average, the average chemical denudation rate of rock-derived elements ill Iceland is 1.3 times the world average, and the average mechanical denudation rate including major floods is 5.9 times the world average. Excluding the major floods, the rate of mechanical denudation is 2.9 times the world average. Surface runoff dominates ill the Quaternary and Tertiary formations of Iceland, whereas a large part of the precipitation falling oil ice-free land it? the younger volcanic zones, covered by post-glacial lavas, infiltrates and may discharge directly as groundwater into the ocean or emerge as springs to form spring-fed streams and rivers. Temperature, discharge and chemical composition of spring-fed rivers ill Iceland are stable throughout most of the year, and the concentration of suspended particle matter is low Glacier-fed rivers are loaded with suspended matter ill the summer (aid eat-IN? autumn when their discharge is highest. Discharge and concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter of direct runoff and glacier-fed rivers respond rapidly to precipitation. Most dissolved concentrations decrease but suspended concentrations increase with increased discharge ill both direct runoff and glacier-fed rivers. The relative mobility of rock-derived major elements during chemical weathering of basalt ill Iceland varies by four orders of magnitude. The most mobile major constituents, that is, those that dissolve ill surface waters, art, F S, Na, K, Ca and Mg, whereas the least mobile major elements ill the rocks arc, Fe, Ti, Al, and Mn. The least mobile constituents arc, consumed by oxyhydroxides and Al silicates that dominate weathering minerals ill Icelandic soils. The main weathering products of basaltic glass with limited contact with soil or atmospheric CO2 are Si-, Ca-, and Mg-rich particles with smectite structure and amorphous Fe-, Ti- and Al-rich material. The most unstable primary basaltic minerals ill the surface waters of Iceland are Mg-rich olivine and Ca-rich plagioclase: ill contrast the Fe-T-oxides are, the most stable primary minerals. The rate of chemical denudation in Iceland increases with runoff but decreases with increased age of the catchment rocks. The difference in the chemical denudation rate between river catchments in Iceland call not be explained by variation in temperature alone. At the fixed age of the rocks, vegetation cover, etc., the effect of runoff and temperature dominate. High runoff lowers the pH of surface waters where the concentration of organic acids is low and it decreases the concentration of total dissolved Al and Mg, affecting the dissolution rate of plagioclase and basaltic glass, and olivine and pyroxene at all undersaturation levels. Furthermore, high runoff results in larger undersaturation of primary minerals, decreases oversaturation of secondary weathering minerals, and increases the reactive surface area between rock and water. The higher the temperature, the higher the dissolution rate of all minerals and glasses. Where the variation in runoff and age of rocks is small, the chemical denudation rate is enhanced by vegetation and increases for most mobile elements with the rise ill glass content of catchment rocks. The mechanical denudation rates are at a maximum inthe young, glassy, glaciated catchment rocks of south-eastern Iceland but at a minimum ill the old, non-glaciated, crystalline Tertiary catchment rocks. Denudation increases with runoff, temperature, glacial cover and decreasing age of the catchment rocks. The mechanical denudation rate is less runoff-dependent ill the old catchments than ill the younger ones since the ratio of coarse to fine river-suspended matter decreases with age. The mechanical denudation rate is therefore most climate dependent ill the young glaciated catchments of Iceland. Climate warming over the last 40 Years has resulted ill increased chemical and mechanical denudation rates and therefore CO2 sequestration ill north-eastern Iceland. The maximum increase in CO2 fixation by chemical denudation was 40% over the last 40 Years. Runoff mechanical and chemical denudation rates ill these river catchments rose from 6 to 16%, 8 to 30%, and 4 to 14%. respectively, depending oil the catchment, for each degree of temperature increase. These observations demonstrate the importance of the negative feedback between climate and chemical and mechanical denudation.","Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Gislason, SR (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",sigrg@raunvis.hi.is,,,,,,,119,25,25,1,47,ICELAND GLACIOLOGICAL SOC,REYKJAVIK,"PO BOX 5128, REYKJAVIK, IS-125, ICELAND",0449-0576,,,JOKULL,Jokull,,2008,,,,,387,408,,,,,,22,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,380MY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000261471000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the regional-scale model framework COSMO-ART is applied to southern West Africa (SWA) for a summer monsoon process study on 2-3 and 6-7 July 2016. The high moisture and aerosol burden in the monsoon layer makes SWA favorable to quantify properties that determine the aerosol liquid water content and its impact on radiative transfer. Given the marked diurnal cycle in SWA, the analysis is separated into three characteristic phases: (a) the Atlantic inflow progression phase (15:00-02:00 UTC), when winds from the Gulf of Guinea accelerate in the less turbulent evening and nighttime boundary layer, (b) the moist morning phase (03:00-08:00 UTC), when the passage of the Atlantic inflow front leads to overall cool and moist conditions over land, and (c) the daytime drying phase (09:00-15:00 UTC), in which the Atlantic inflow front reestablishes with the inland heating initiated after sunrise. This diurnal cycle also impacts, via relative humidity, the aerosol liquid water content. We analyzed the impact of relative humidity and clouds on the aerosol liquid water content. As shown by other studies, accumulation-mode particles are the dominant contributor of aerosol liquid water. We find aerosol growth factors of 2 (4) for submicron (coarse-mode) particles, leading to a substantial increase in mean aerosol optical depth from 0.2 to 0.7. Considering the aerosol liquid water content leads to a decrease in shortwave radiation of about 20 W m(-2), while longwave effects appear to be insignificant, especially during nighttime. The estimated relationships between total column aerosol liquid water and radiation are -305 +/- 39 W g(-1 ) (shortwave in-cloud), -114 +/- 42 W g(-1 )(shortwave off-cloud) and about -10 W g(-1) (longwave). The results highlight the need to consider the relative humidity dependency of aerosol optical depth in atmospheric models, particularly in moist tropical environments where their effect on radiation can be very large.","[Deetz, Konrad; Vogel, Heike; Knippertz, Peter; Vogel, Bernhard] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Haslett, Sophie; Coe, Hugh] Univ Manchester, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Haslett, Sophie; Coe, Hugh] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Deetz, K (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",konrad.deetz@kit.edu,"Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Haslett, Sophie/ABB-9845-2020; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013","Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Coe, Hugh/0000-0002-3264-1713",European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [603502]; NERC [NE/L013584/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 603502 (EU project DACCIWA: Dynamics-aerosol-chemistry-cloud interactions in West Africa).

Large-scale simulations of environmental systems require huge amounts of resources. Managing these in an operational way becomes increasingly complex and difficult to handle for individual scientists. State-of-the-art simulation infrastructures usually provide the necessary re-sources in a centralised setup, which often results in an all-or-nothing choice for the user. Here, we outline an alternative approach to handling this complexity, while rendering the use of high-performance hardware and large datasets still possible. It retains a number of desirable properties: (i) a decentralised structure, (ii) easy sharing of resources to promote collaboration and (iii) secure access to everything, including natural delegation of authority across levels and system boundaries. We show that the object capability paradigm will cover these issues, and present the first steps towards developing a simulation infrastructure based on these principles.","[Berg-Mohnicke, Michael; Nendel, Claas] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Nendel, Claas] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Golm, Germany; [Nendel, Claas] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Potsdam; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Berg-Mohnicke, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",michael.berg-mohnicke@zalf.de,,"Berg-Mohnicke, Michael/0000-0001-6687-8295",,,,,75,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-8152,1873-6726,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

With the metaheuristics involving more control variables, the attempt to search global results in a restricted solution space is not actually practical. Although metaheuristics provide reasonable results compared with many derivative methods, they cannot guarantee the same global solution when they run under different initial conditions. In this study, one of the most practical of metaheuristics, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, was chosen, and the aim was to develop its local search capability. In this context, the hybrid use of the PSO with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm was considered. It was detected that the hybrid PSO-LM gave stable global solutions as a result of each random experiment in the application for four different flood data. The PSO-LM, which stands out with its stable aspect, also achieved rapid convergence compared with the PSO and another hybrid variant called mutated PSO.","[Okkan, Umut; Kirdemir, Umut] Balikesir Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Balikesir, Turkey",Balikesir University,"Okkan, U (corresponding author), Balikesir Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Balikesir, Turkey.",umutokkan@balikesir.edu.tr,,"Kirdemir, Umut/0000-0001-5336-4842",Scientific Research Projects Unit of Balikesir University/Turkey;  [2017/134],Scientific Research Projects Unit of Balikesir University/Turkey; ,"The modeling strategy applied in this study was developed in the scientific research project titled 'Evaluation of global optimization algorithms in conceptual hydrological model calibration (Grant No. 2017/134)' managed by the first author.

Current state-of the-art models can reproduce the observed chemical composition in the springtime polar stratosphere, especially regarding the quantification of halogen-catalysed ozone loss. However, we report here on a discrepancy between simulations and observations during the less-well-studied period of the onset of chlorine activation. During this period, which in the Antarctic is between May and July, model simulations significantly overestimate HCl, one of the key chemical species, inside the polar vortex during polar night. This HCl discrepancy is also observed in the Arctic. The discrepancy exists in different models to varying extents; here, we discuss three independent ones, the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) as well as the Eulerian models SD-WACCM (the specified dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) and TOMCAT/SLIMCAT. The HCl discrepancy points to some unknown process in the formulation of stratospheric chemistry that is currently not represented in the models. We characterise the HCl discrepancy in space and time for the Lagrangian chemistry-transport model CLaMS, in which HCl in the polar vortex core stays about constant from June to August in the Antarctic, while the observations indicate a continuous HCl decrease over this period. The somewhat smaller discrepancies in the Eulerian models SD-WACCM and TOMCAT/SLIMCAT are also presented. Numerical diffusion in the transport scheme of the Eulerian models is identified to be a likely cause for the inter-model differences. Although the missing process has not yet been identified, we investigate different hypotheses on the basis of the characteristics of the discrepancy. An underestimated HCl uptake into the polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles that consist mainly of H2O and HNO3 cannot explain it due to the temperature correlation of the discrepancy. Also, a direct photolysis of particulate HNO3 does not resolve the discrepancy since it would also cause changes in chlorine chemistry in late winter which are not observed. The ionisation caused by galactic cosmic rays provides an additional NOx and HOx source that can explain only about 20% of the discrepancy. However, the model simulations show that a hypothetical decomposition of particulate HNO3 by some other process not dependent on the solar elevation, e.g. involving galactic cosmic rays, may be a possible mechanism to resolve the HCl discrepancy. Since the discrepancy reported here occurs during the beginning of the chlorine activation period, where the ozone loss rates are small, there is only a minor impact of about 2% on the overall ozone column loss over the course of Antarctic winter and spring.","[Grooss, Jens-Uwe; Mueller, Rolf; Spang, Reinhold; Tritscher, Ines; Wegner, Tobias] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch Stratosphare IEK 7, Julich, Germany; [Chipperfield, Martyn P.; Feng, Wuhu] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Feng, Wuhu] Univ Leeds, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Kinnison, Douglas E.; Madronich, Sasha] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Wegner, Tobias] KfW Bankengrp, Frankfurt, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Leeds; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Grooss, JU (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch Stratosphare IEK 7, Julich, Germany.",j.-u.grooss@fz-juelich.de,"Spang, Reinhold/A-2738-2013; FENG, WUHU/B-8327-2008; Tritscher, Ines/O-2271-2014; Grooß, Jens-Uwe/N-3305-2019; Müller, Rolf/A-6669-2013; Madronich, Sasha/D-3284-2015; Müller, Rolf/ABA-8213-2021; Chipperfield, Martyn/H-6359-2013","Spang, Reinhold/0000-0002-2483-5761; FENG, WUHU/0000-0002-9907-9120; Tritscher, Ines/0000-0001-5285-7952; Grooß, Jens-Uwe/0000-0002-9485-866X; Müller, Rolf/0000-0002-5024-9977; Madronich, Sasha/0000-0003-0983-1313; Müller, Rolf/0000-0002-5024-9977; Chipperfield, Martyn/0000-0002-6803-4149",NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy; International Space Science Institute (ISSI); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [310479827]; NERC [ncas10003] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); International Space Science Institute (ISSI); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors acknowledge the thorough reviews of Ingo Wohltmann and an anonymous reviewer, as well as the comment of Alexander James that helped to clarify and improve this paper.

While 'fast' strategies allow for rapid increase in population size and limit vulnerability to stochastic events, 'slow' strategies and bet-hedging may reduce variance in vital rates in response to stochasticity. We test these predictions using biological invasions since founder alien populations start small, compiling the largest dataset yet of global herpetological introductions and life history traits. Using state-of-the-art phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that successful invaders have fast traits, such as large and frequent clutches, at both establishment and spread stages. These results, together with recent findings in mammals and plants, support 'fast advantage' models and the importance of high potential population growth rate. Conversely, successful alien birds are bet-hedgers. We propose that transient population dynamics and differences in longevity and behavioural flexibility can help reconcile apparently contrasting results across terrestrial vertebrate classes.","[Allen, William L.; Street, Sally E.; Capellini, Isabella] Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Allen, William L.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",University of Hull; Swansea University,"Allen, WL; Capellini, I (corresponding author), Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.;Allen, WL (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",w.l.allen@swansea.ac.uk; i.capellini@hull.ac.uk,"Allen, Will/T-9816-2019; Capellini, Isabella/H-4813-2013","Allen, Will/0000-0003-2654-0438; Street, Sally/0000-0001-8939-8016; Capellini, Isabella/0000-0001-8065-2436",NERC [NE/K013777/1]; University of Hull; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K013777/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); University of Hull; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank David Iles, Roberto Salguero-Gomez and three anonymous referees for valuable comments on the manuscript.

We use an interdisciplinary approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data (spatial and hydrological analysis, interviews) to tie together land use changes in the Corrente basin, the streamflow and precipitation time series in the Pratudao River sub-basin (part of the Corrente basin), and the perceptions of soybean farmers and smallholder communities about the transformations of the hydrological cycle over the last few years. We observed an almost 10-fold increase in agricultural surface area in the Corrente River basin over the last three decades (1986-2018), going on from 57,090 ha to 565,084 ha, while center-pivot irrigated areas increased from 240 ha to 43,631 ha. Over this period, the streamflow has reduced by 38% in the Pratudao River. Our hydrological analyses, based on the Mann-Kendall test, of seven fluviometric stations and 14 pluviometry stations showed a statistically significant streamflow trend in the Pratudao River sub-basin for both minimum and mean streamflow series (p <= 0.05). Surface runoff coefficient, which relates streamflow and precipitation annual data coefficient, decreased from around 0.4 in the late 1990s to less than 0.2 in 2015. In addition, most precipitation time series analysis (number of annual rainy days) showed no statistically significant trend (p > 0.05). Our results indicate that agricultural changes rather than climate change may be the main driver of downward streamflow trends in the Pratudao River sub-basin that is part of Corrente River basin.","[da Silva, Andrea Leme; Passos, Carlos Jose Sousa] Univ Brasilia, Grad Program Environm & Rural Dev, Fac UnB Planaltina, Vila Nossa Sra de Fatima, BR-73345010 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Souza, Saulo Aires; Coelho Filho, Osmar] Univ Brasilia, Grad Program Environm Technol & Water Resources, Anexo SG-12,Terreo,Campus Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Souza, Saulo Aires] Brazilian Natl Water Agcy ANA, Setor Policial, Area 5,Quadra 3,Blocos BLMeT,S-N, BR-70610200 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Eloy, Ludivine] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, CNRS, CIRAD, ART Dev,Univ Montpellier, Univ Perpignan Via Domitia, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Salmona, Yuri Botelho] Univ Brasilia, Grad Program Forest Sci, BR-70297400 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade de Brasilia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Universite Paul-Valery; Universidade de Brasilia,"da Silva, AL (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Grad Program Environm & Rural Dev, Fac UnB Planaltina, Vila Nossa Sra de Fatima, BR-73345010 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",leme.andrea@gmail.com; sauloaires@gmail.com; mc2sustentavel@gmail.com; ludivine.eloy@univ-montp3.fr; yuri@cerrados.org; cjpassos@unb.br,"Passos, Carlos José Sousa/H-3152-2012","Passos, Carlos José Sousa/0000-0002-0553-9342; Silva, Andrea Leme da/0000-0001-9944-3052; Coelho Filho, Osmar/0000-0002-9223-5290",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); Agropolis Foundation [0340/2015]; CNRS through its International Emerging Actions Project,Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Agropolis Foundation; CNRS through its International Emerging Actions Project,"This research was supported by Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) and Agropolis Foundation, through Project Sociotechnical and institutional innovations for the conservation and enhancement of the Cerrado biome (Sociobiocerrado), implemented from 2015 to 2017 (#0340/2015), and CNRS through its International Emerging Actions Project.",,83,3,3,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2021,8,,,,,,1054,10.3390/w13081054,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13081054,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,RU1CS,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000644889700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The observed high ambient temperatures intensify the energy problem of cities, deteriorates comfort conditions, put in danger the vulnerable population and amplify the pollution problems. To counterbalance the phenomenon, important mitigation technologies have been developed and proposed. Among them, technologies aiming to increase the albedo of cities and the use of vegetative green roofs appear to be very promising, presenting a relatively high heat island mitigation potential. This paper aims to present the state of the art on both the above technologies, when applied in the city scale. Tenths of published studies have been analysed. Most of the available data are based on simulation studies using mesoscale modeling techniques while important data are available from the existing experimental studies. When a global increase of the city's albedo is considered, the expected mean decrease of the average ambient temperature is close to 0.3 K per 0.1 rise of the albedo, while the corresponding average decrease of the peak ambient temperature is close to 0.9 K. When only cool roofs are considered, the analysis of the existing data shows that the expected depression rate of the average urban ambient temperature varies between 0.1 and 0.33 K per 0.1 increase of the roofs albedo with a mean value close to 0.2 K. As it concerns green roofs, existing simulation studies show that when applied on a city scale, they may reduce the average ambient temperature between 0.3 and 3 K. Detailed analysis of many studies reporting a comparison of the mitigation potential of both technologies has permitted the definition of the limits, the boundaries and the conditions under which the considered technologies reach their better performance, in a synthetic way.

Despite the importance of these records, establishing a robust chronology and quantifying its precision and accuracy (estimations of error) remains an essential but challenging component of their development. We outline an approach for building reliable independent chronologies, testing the accuracy of layer counts and integrating all chronological uncertainties to provide quantitative age and error estimates for varved lake sequences. The approach incorporates (1) layer counts and estimates of counting precision; (2) radiometric and biostratigrapic dating techniques to derive independent chronology; and (3) the application of Bayesian age modelling to produce an integrated age model. This approach is applied to a case study of an annually resolved sediment record from Lake Ohau, New Zealand. The most robust age model provides an average error of 72 years across the whole depth range. This represents a fractional uncertainty of similar to 5%, higher than the <3% quoted for most published varve records. However, the age model and reported uncertainty represent the best fit between layer counts and independent chronology and the uncertainties account for both layer counting precision and the chronological accuracy of the layer counts. This integrated approach provides a more representative estimate of age uncertainty and therefore represents a statistically more robust chronology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Many of these datasets and models, however, are susceptible to variations in monitoring infrastructure and data dissemination protocols when watershed, political, and jurisdictional boundaries do not align. Reconciling hydrometeorological monitoring gaps and inconsistencies across the international Laurentian Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin is particularly challenging because of its size and because the basin's dominant hydrologic feature is the vast surface waters of the Great Lakes. For tens of millions of Canadian and U.S. residents that live within the Great Lakes basin, seamless binational datasets are needed to better understand and predict coastal water-level fluctuations and other conditions that could potentially threaten human and environmental health. Binational products addressing this need have historically been developed and maintained by the Coordinating Committee on Great Lakes Basic Hydraulic and Hydrologic Data (Coordinating Committee). The Coordinating Committee recently held its one-hundredth semiannual meeting and reflected on a range of historical accomplishments while setting goals for future work. This article provides a synthesis of those achievements and goals. Particularly significant legacy and recently developed datasets of the Coordinating Committee include historical Great Lakes surface water elevations, basin-scale tributary inflow to the Great Lakes, and basin-scale estimates of both over-lake and over-land precipitation. Moving forward, members of the Coordinating Committee will work toward customizing state-of-the-art hydrologic and meteorological forecasting systems across the entire Great Lakes basin and toward promoting their products and protocols as templates for successful binational coordination across other large binational freshwater basins.","[Gronewold, Andrew D.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Gronewold, Andrew D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fortin, Vincent] Canadian Meteorol Ctr, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Caldwell, Robert] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Great Lakes St Lawrence Regulat Off, Cornwall, ON, Canada; [Noel, James] NOAA, Natl Weather Serv Ohio River Forecast Ctr, Wilmington, OH USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; Canadian Meteorological Centre; Environment & Climate Change Canada; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Gronewold, AD (corresponding author), NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.;Gronewold, AD (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",drew.gronewold@noaa.gov,,,NOAA,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors thank Tim Hunter, Craig Stow, Brent, Lofgren, Jacob Bruxer, David Fay, Aaron Thompson, John Allis, and Anne Clites for providing comments on the style and technical content of this manuscript.

More than an expression to individual success, Islamic architecture is the product of a keen understanding of the human condition and its association to higher powers. It will use Iran as its site of exploration. Among other themes, the chapter will look at the relationship between the inside and the outside and how that may help define the spirit of the Muslim's character and search in life. It discusses the role that architectural details and geometry play in helping people gain spatial orientation and a sense of discovery in the city.

Here, we report a metal-organic framework (MOF)/polypyrrole (PPy) hybrid, in which conductive PPy nanotubes that are running through each MOF particle have the potential to increase the overall bulk electrical conductivity, thus promoting such a system as a good CDI electrode material. Consequently, the MOF/PPy hybrid shows a high desalination capacity of 11.34 mg g(-1), which is amongst those of state-of-the-art CDI electrodes. Moreover, the MOF/PPy hybrid also shows a superior desalination performance for brackish water and good cycling stability, far exceeding typical carbon-based benchmarks. This is the first example of CDI electrodes derived from direct MOF-based materials, highlighting the potential of these hybrid systems as promising materials beyond traditional carbon electrodes.","[Wang, Ziming; Xu, Xingtao; Mo, Ran; Li, Chenglong; Lin, Yuzhu; Yang, Tao] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, 1 N Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jeonghun; Yamauchi, Yusuke] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Ecochem Engn, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Qingdao 266042, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jeonghun; Tang, Jing; Bando, Yoshio; Yamauchi, Yusuke] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Kim, Jeonghun; Tang, Jing; Bando, Yoshio; Yamauchi, Yusuke] Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol AIBN, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Malgras, Victor; Tan, Haibo; Bando, Yoshio] NIMS, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton WPI MANA, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Malgras, Victor; Tan, Haibo; Bando, Yoshio] NIMS, ICYS, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Pan, Likun] East China Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Mat Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Magnet Resonance, 3663 N Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Bando, Yoshio] Tianjin Univ, Inst Mol Plus, 11 Bldg,92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Bando, Yoshio] Univ Wollongong, Australian Inst Innovat Mat, Squires Way, North Wollongong, NSW 2500, Australia; [Yamauchi, Yusuke] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Plant & Environm New Resources, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hohai University; Qingdao University of Science & Technology; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; National Institute for Materials Science; National Institute for Materials Science; East China Normal University; Tianjin University; University of Wollongong; Kyung Hee University,"Xu, XT; Yang, T (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, 1 N Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yamauchi, Y (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Ecochem Engn, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Qingdao 266042, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Yamauchi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;Yamauchi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol AIBN, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;Yamauchi, Y (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Plant & Environm New Resources, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",xingtao.xu@hhu.edu.cn; tao.yang@hhu.edu.cn; y.yamauchi@uq.edu.au,"Kim, Jeonghun/I-7164-2015; Yamauchi, Yusuke/D-2780-2015; Malgras, Victor/A-8221-2015; Pan, Likun/F-7232-2012; Xu, Xingtao/S-5624-2018; tang, jing/HHR-9815-2022; BANDO, Yoshio/H-2875-2011; JING, TANG/ABA-9746-2020; JING, TANG/M-3919-2013","Kim, Jeonghun/0000-0001-6325-0507; Yamauchi, Yusuke/0000-0001-7854-927X; Malgras, Victor/0000-0002-5667-9118; Pan, Likun/0000-0001-9294-1972; Xu, Xingtao/0000-0002-2286-4307; BANDO, Yoshio/0000-0002-6543-5529; JING, TANG/0000-0002-7580-9459; JING, TANG/0000-0002-7580-9459","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B18020057]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51879068, 41561134016]; National Key Research and Development Program [2018YFC0407900]; Australian Research Council (ARC) [FT150100479, DE190101410]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program; Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),"The work was jointly supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (B18020057), and the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51879068, 41561134016), and the National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFC0407900).

In forage and turf improvement programmes, in particular, where breeding populations and cultivars are characterized by high genetic diversity and substantial genotype environment interactions, precise and efficient phenotyping is essential to meet future challenges imposed by climate change, growing demand and declining resources. This review highlights recent achievements in the establishment of phenotyping tools and platforms. Some of these tools have originally been established in remote sensing, some in precision agriculture, while others are laboratory-based imaging procedures. They quantify plant colour, spectral reflection, chlorophyll-fluorescence, temperature and other properties, from which traits such as biomass, architecture, photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal aperture or stress resistance can be derived. Applications of these methods in the context of forage and turf breeding are discussed. Progress in cutting-edge molecular breeding tools is beginning to be matched by progress in automated non-destructive imaging methods. Joint application of precise phenotyping machinery and molecular tools in optimized breeding schemes will improve forage and turf breeding in the near future and will thereby contribute to amended performance of managed grassland agroecosystems.","[Walter, Achim] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Studer, Bruno] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-4200 Slagelse, Denmark; [Koelliker, Roland] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Aarhus University; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Walter, A (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",achim.walter@agrl.ethz.ch,"Kölliker, Roland/D-9635-2018; Walter, Achim/N-8392-2013; Studer, Bruno/O-2237-2017","Kölliker, Roland/0000-0003-1959-0402; Walter, Achim/0000-0001-7753-9643; Studer, Bruno/0000-0001-8795-0719",,,,,85,85,87,2,116,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Although many studies have shown the positive influence of liberalization on trade and production, the environmental questions remain unanswered in most studies. Here we present a combination of an economic (Global Trade Analysis Project, GTAP) and a biophysical (IMAGE) model. The methodology is innovative as it combines state of the art knowledge from both the economic and biophysical worlds. First. the treatment of agriculture and land use is improved in the economic model. For example, information from the OECD Policy Evaluation Model (PEM) was incorporated to improve the agricultural production structure and a new land allocation methodology was introduced using regional land supply curves to facilitate the conversion of idle land to productive land while giving consideration to the level of intensification. Secondly, the adapted economic model is linked to the biophysical modeling framework IMAGE allowing feedbacks of detailed heterogeneous information on land productivity to the economic framework. While often a rather pessimistic picture is portrayed for future developments of the agricultural sector in the EU (especially in liberalizing scenarios), our results show that no drastic decrease in land for agricultural purposes is expected for the EU25 the coining 30 years, since the global food market will experience an increase in demand because of expected growth in GDP and population in many developing countries. Moreover, the negative impact of liberalization of agricultural policies on European agricultural land use is small because on the one hand loss in EU's competitiveness leads partly to extensification instead of land abandonment, and secondly, the recent agricultural reforms of the EU changed the protection from market to income support which has less production effects. Changes in land use will be more outspoken in developing countries like Africa. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, some women often express a desire to lighten skin tone by achieving improved visible tone, reduction in yellowness (or sallow tone), and reduction in the appearance of hyperpigmented spots (age or sun spots). Traditional depigmenting agents, such as hydroquinone, corticosteroids, and kojic acid, although highly effective, can raise several safety concerns (for example, ochronosis, atrophy, carcinogenesis, and other local or systemic side effects) with long-term exposure. An understanding of the benefits of natural and botanical extracts provides opportunities to develop new products to address pigmentation problems. Active compounds isolated from plants, such as arbutin, aloesin, gentisic acid, flavonoids, hesperidin, licorice, niacinamide, yeast derivatives, and polyphenols, inhibit melanogenesis without melanocytotoxicity by different mechanisms. This review presents an overview of trends in the application of plant extracts as topical treatments for hyperpigmentation disorders.

A number of authors have recently shown that, following the US withdrawal and the Bonn and Marrakesh agreements, these abatement costs will be very low and the price of the permits could reach zero. However, these analyses usually take only the first commitment period (2008-2012) into account and do not explicitly consider the possibility of banking permits from one commitment period to the other (Art. 3.13 of the Protocol). The simple dynamic model that we develop here introduces this possibility. It allows one to analyze the impact of alternative future commitments for the US and the non-Annex B countries on world emissions, abatement costs, and the permit price. We find that, provided ambituous post-Kyoto commitments are negotiated: (1) in 2008-2012, the number of banked permits will largely exceed the amount of hot air and permit prices will be much higher than predicted by most other studies, (2) the banking provision significantly reduces world total costs but increases total costs for all permit-importing Annex B countries (i.e., all Annex B countries except those of eastern Europe) via a rise in the permit price in 2008-2017, and (3) the issue of market power on hot air is not likely to be relevant.","[van Steenberghe, Vincent] Catholic Univ Louvain, Belgian Fed Publ Serv Hlth Food Chain Safety & En, DG Environm, Climate Change Sect, Pl Victor Horta,40 Bte 10, B-1060 Brussels, Belgium; [van Steenberghe, Vincent] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1060 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"van Steenberghe, V (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Belgian Fed Publ Serv Hlth Food Chain Safety & En, DG Environm, Climate Change Sect, Pl Victor Horta,40 Bte 10, B-1060 Brussels, Belgium.",,,,"Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) at the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE); SSTC (Services Federaux des Affaires Scientifiques, Techniques et Culturelles, Brussels, Belgium); MEDD (Ministere de l'Ecologie et du D6veloppement Durable, Paris, France)","Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) at the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); SSTC (Services Federaux des Affaires Scientifiques, Techniques et Culturelles, Brussels, Belgium); MEDD (Ministere de l'Ecologie et du D6veloppement Durable, Paris, France)","This article was written while I was a post-doctoral fellow of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) at the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE), Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

However, most state-of-the-art Land Surface Models (LSMs) assessed in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison project (CMIP5) simulated crops as unmanaged C-3 or C-4 grasses. This study evaluated the crop-enabled version of one of the most widely used LSMs, the Community Land Model (CLM4-Crop), for simulating corn and soybean agro-ecosystems at relatively long-time scales (up to 11 years) using 54 site-years of data. We found that CLM4-Crop had a biased phenology during the early growing season and that carbon emissions from corn and soybean were underestimated. The model adopts universal physiological parameters for all crop types neglecting the fact that different crops have different specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content and vcmax25, etc. As a result, model performance varied considerably according to crop type. Overall, the energy and carbon exchange of corn systems were better simulated than soybean systems. Long-term simulations at multiple sites showed that gross primary production (GPP) was consistently over-estimated at soybean sites leading to very large short and long-term biases. A modified model, CLM4-CropM', with optimized phenology and calibrated crop physiological parameters yielded significantly better simulations of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and leaf area index (LAI) at both short (hourly) and long-term (annual to decadal) timescales for both soybean and corn.","[Chen, Ming; Griffis, Tim J.; Baker, John M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Chen, Ming] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Baker, John M.] USDA ARS, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Wood, Jeffrey D.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA; [Meyers, Tilden] NOAA, ARL, Atmospher Turbulence & Diffus Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Suyker, Andrew] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Chen, M; Griffis, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",chen1718@umn.edu; tgriffis@umn.edu,"Meyers, Tilden/C-6633-2016; Suyker, Andy E./ABC-8910-2021","Meyers, Tilden/0000-0002-0726-4258; Griffis, Timothy/0000-0002-2111-5144; Chen, Ming/0000-0002-4574-632X","National Science Foundation [ATM-0546476]; Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy [DE-FG02-06ER64316]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Program, through Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) Science Focus Area (SFA); U.S. DOE [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Program, through Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) Science Focus Area (SFA)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","Funding for this research has been provided by the National Science Foundation, ATM-0546476 (TG) and by the Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy, DE-FG02-06ER64316 (TG and JB).

However, the mechanisms underlying an unusual characteristic of Lycoris radiata, flowering without leaves, remain unclear. In this study, climatic influences, biomass composition, and yearly variations in bulb contents across eight developmental stages of L. radiata were analyzed. Thus, L. radiata summer dormancy was investigated in three dimensions: climate-associated phenology, biomass distribution characteristics, and physiologic bulb changes. The results showed that dormancy was most strongly affected by high ambient temperature, followed by scape development, flowering, leafing out, vigorous leaf growth, flower bud differentiation, flower bud predifferentiation, and leaf maturation. Biomass allocation, bulb contents, oxidoreductase activity, and root activity fluctuated significantly in L. radiata among developmental stages. Relative bulb dry weight was greatest during the dormant period (95.95% of total dry weight) and lowest during vigorous leaf growth (November-December). Root biomass was also significantly greater during dormancy than during flowering, leaf maturation, and flower bud differentiation. Only root biomass during vigorous leaf growth was greater than root biomass during dormancy. However, in dormant bulbs, soluble sugar content, soluble protein content, root activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and peroxidase (POD) activity decreased. Thus, summer dormancy in L. radiata only constitutes a morphologic dormancy of the aboveground plant; the bulb and root remain physiologically active. The results suggest that L. radiata is sensitive to both ambient temperature and light, and that summer dormancy is triggered by the synergistic stimulation of these two factors. Although temperature controls dormancy, it plays only a limited regulatory role during the L. radiata flowering period. Thus, it is difficult to induce flowering or regulate annual flowering in this species through temperature control alone.","[Cai, Junhuo; Zhang, Lu] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Landscape & Art, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Fan, Junjun] Jinling Inst Technol, Coll Hort, Nanjing 210038, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xuying] Jiangxi Finance & Econ Univ, Coll Art, Nanchang 330032, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Jiangxi Typ Trees Cultivat, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University; Jinling Institute of Technology; Jiangxi Agricultural University,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Landscape & Art, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Zhang, L (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Jiangxi Typ Trees Cultivat, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",zhlu856@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31560226]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution (PAPD),National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution (PAPD),This project was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31560226) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution (PAPD).,,32,4,5,5,12,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,SEP,2019,9,,,,1459,1464,,10.21273/HORTSCI14080-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI14080-19,,,6,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,JE9NH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000491014200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gypsum caves are now known from almost all Italian regions, but are mainly localised along the northern border of the Apennine chain (Emilia Romagna and Marche), Calabria, and Sicily, where the major outcrops occur. Recently, important caves have also been discovered in the underground gypsum mines in Piedmont. During the late 80s and 90s several multidisciplinary studies were carried out in many gypsum areas, resulting in a comprehensive overview, promoting further research in these special karst regions. More recent and detailed studies focused on the gypsum areas of Emilia-Romagna and Sicily. Sinkholes related to Permian-Triassic gypsum have been studied in Friuli Venezia Giulia.

Many of the contaminants may cause adverse effects on works of art and human health, but in the past, pollution research in museums has focused on the protection of artifacts, while the risk assessment for humans has been neglected. Especially, the application of biocides leads to a conflict of interest: on the one hand cultural assets have to be protected against microorganisms, insects and rodents while on the other hand it is essential to provide healthy conditions for museum staff and visitors. It has recently been shown that the release of organic indoor pollutants from building products is one of the main reasons for deterioration of artifacts. In this work, we present the results of screening measurements on biocides in different locations of German museums. The major components that could be identified were DDT, PCP, lindane, methoxychlor, naphthalene, chlorinated naphthalenes, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, PCBs and arsenic. It is demonstrated that the application of chlorinated organic compounds and arsenic for preventive conservation is one of the prime reasons for indoor pollution in museums and provides a potential for exposure. However, the concentrations in air, dust and material are widely different and a health risk for humans has to be evaluated case by case. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As the first step towards maximising students' benefits reaped from intercultural interaction, this article reports on the quantitative findings of intra- and intercultural relations as well as perceptions among both mainstream and minority tertiary-level students (n = 155) in Hong Kong. From the survey results, various within- and between-group comparisons were made. Significant findings include the substantial differences in how mainstream students relate and view themselves vis-a-vis the minority group, and the general greater open-mindedness and acceptance of the minority group compared with the mainstream group.

First, we use this dataset to quantify the meteorological factors that best predict frog calling. Second, we investigate the strength of interactions among predictor variables. Third, we assess whether frog species cluster into distinct groups based on shared drivers of calling. Location Australia. Method To assess the relationship between calling and meteorological traits, we used spatio-temporal subsampling (daily data fitted to 10 km(2) grid cells) of call and meteorological data as inputs to a boosted regression tree. We scaled the model outputs, which created a descriptive ranking of predictor importance. For strongly day-driven species, we conducted further analyses to examine the influences of meteorological factors within the breeding season. Results We found a strong seasonal signal, with day of year the strongest relationship to calling in 67 out of our 100 species, moderate relationships between temperature and calling, and weak relationships between rainfall and calling. Despite the common narratives, we found that frogs did not group into distinct categories based upon the influence of meteorological factors. For strongly day-driven species, we found similar patterns within the breeding season. Main conclusions We demonstrate the importance of day of year and temperature thresholds in predicting frog calling behaviour in Australia. Understanding how meteorological conditions influence phenological events, such as breeding, will be increasingly important considering the rapid changes in environmental conditions and stability throughout most of the world, and how important breeding is to species survival.","[Thompson, Maureen M.; Rowley, Jodi J.

Among REEs, special consideration should be given to Gadolinium (Gd), whose wide exploitation as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent is enhancing the risk of its occurrence in aquatic environments and impacts on aquatic organisms. A promising approach for water decontamination from REEs is sorption, namely through the use of macroalgae and in particular Ulva lactuca that already proved to be an efficient biosorbent for several chemical elements. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of Gd, comparing the biochemical effects induced by this element in the presence or absence of algae. Using the bivalve species Mytilus galloprovincialis, Gd toxicity was evaluated by assessing changes on mussels? metabolic capacity and oxidative status. Results clearly showed the toxicity of Gd but further revealed the capacity of U. lactuca to prevent injuries to M. galloprovincialis, mainly reducing the levels of Gd in water and thus the bioaccumulation and toxicity of this element by the mussels. The results will advance the state of the art not only regarding the effects of REEs but also with regard to the role of algae in accumulation of metals and protection of aquatic organisms, generating new insights on water safety towards aquatic wildlife and highlighting the possibility for resources recovery.","[Trapasso, Giacomo; Coppola, Francesca; Queiros, Vanessa; Soares, Amadeu M.

The flux product was developed by using a variational objective analysis approach to obtain best estimates of the flux-related basic surface meteorological variables (e.g., wind speed, air humidity, air temperature, and sea surface temperature) through synthesizing satellite data and outputs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The state-of-the-art bulk flux algorithm 2.6a, developed from the field experiments of the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE), was applied to compute the flux fields. The study focused on analyzing the mean field properties of the WHOI daily latent and sensible heat fluxes and their comparisons with the ship-based climatology from the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC) and NWP outputs. It is found that the WHOI yearly mean fluxes are consistent with the SOC climatology in both structure and amplitude, but the WHOI yearly mean basic variables are not always consistent with SOC; the better agreement in the fluxes is due to the effects of error compensation during variable combinations. Both ECMWF and NCEP-Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) Reanalysis-2 (NCEP2) model data have larger turbulent heat loss (similar to20 W m(-2)) than the WHOI product. Nevertheless, the WHOI fluxes agree well with the NCEP-2 Reanalysis fluxes in structure and the trend of year-to-year variations, but not with the ECMWF operational outputs; the latter have a few abrupt changes coinciding with the modifications in the model forecast-analysis system. The degree of impact of the model changes on the basic variables is not as dramatic, a factor that justifies the inclusion of the basic variables, not the fluxes, from the ECMWF operational model in the synthesis. The flux algorithms of the two NWP models give a larger latent and sensible heat loss. Recalculating the NWP fluxes using the COARE algorithm considerably reduces the strength but does not replicate the WHOI results. The present analysis could not quantify the degree of improvement in the mean aspect of the WHOI daily flux fields as accurate basinwide verification data are lacking. This study is the first to demonstrate that the synthesis approach is a useful tool for combining the NWP and satellite data sources and improving the mean representativeness of daily basic variable fields and, hence, the daily flux fields. It is anticipated that such an approach may become increasingly relied upon in the preparation of future high-quality flux products.","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"Yu, LS (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, MS 21, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",lyu@whoi.edu,"Sun, Bomin/P-8742-2014","Sun, Bomin/0000-0002-4872-9349",,,,,60,92,110,0,10,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Early detection and appropriate onset treatment and support can reduce the consequences of depression. Automatic detection of depression in social media has recently become an important area of investigation. However, because of the lack of extensive annotated data, we propose a method for using a model that learns to answer a depression questionnaire and apply it to make populationlevel predictions. We used the eRisk 2021 Task 3 training dataset to build an automated model to fill the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire. We selected the best performing model for each group of questions based on predefined metrics and consolidated those models into one model (called the BDI _Multi_Model). The BDI _Multi_Model achieved better performance than the state-of-the-art for this challenging task. Then, we used this model for inference on a Canadian population dataset and compared its predictions with the statistics of the most recent mental health survey conducted by Statistics Canada. The correlation between the inference of the answered questionnaire based on our BDI _Multi_Model and the official statistics showed a strong Pearson correlation of 0:90.","[Skaik, Ruba S.] Qual Assurance Environm & Climate Change Canada, Gatineau, PQ J8Y 3Z5, Canada; [Inkpen, Diana] Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Inkpen, D (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",diana.inkpen@uottawa.ca,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This work was supported in part by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,37,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,,,,,102033,102047,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208470,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208470,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,5C6GM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000864355900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The multifrequency, multipolarization framework employs an SVM to predict brightness temperature spectral difference (i.e., Delta Tb) between 10.65 GHz, 18.7 GHz and 36.5 GHz as a function of land surface model state information. The EnKF then merges the predictions with observations obtained from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sensor onboard the Aqua satellite. Case studies are presented for Quebec and Newfoundland, Canada, and several pixels in North America covered with evergreen needle-leaved forest colocated with taiga snow cover type. Model results with and without assimilation were compared against in-situ snow observations as well as state-of-the-art snow products. It is shown that using an atmospheric-forest-decoupling procedure prior to SVM training and prediction activities is useful in enhancing snow characterization. However, without adequate ground-based snow observations, it is still relatively difficult to draw a full conclusion as to the feasibility of the proposed assimilation framework employing the two-step decoupling procedure.","[Xue, Yuan; Forman, Barton A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Xue, Y (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",yxue12@umd.edu; baforman@umd.edu,"Forman, Barton A/I-2227-2012","Forman, Barton A./0000-0001-6410-9978; Xue, Yuan/0000-0003-0749-6435",NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program [NNX14AN23H]; NASA New Investigator Program [NNX14AI49G],NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA New Investigator Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The authors acknowledge the University of Maryland supercomputing resources (http://www.it.umd.edu/hpcc) made available for this research.

The proposed FLPSO-QIW consists of four steps. Firstly, the inertia weight is calculated by a designed quadratic function instead of conventional linearly decreasing function. Secondly, acceleration coefficients are determined not only by the generation number but also by the search environment described by each particle's history best fitness information. Thirdly, the feedback fitness information of each particle is used to automatically design the learning probabilities. Fourthly, an elite stochastic learning (ELS) method is used to refine the solution. The FLPSO-QIW has been comprehensively evaluated on 18 unimodal, multimodal and composite benchmark functions with or without rotation. Compared with various state-of-the-art PSO algorithms, the performance of FLPSO-QIW is promising and competitive.

Besides the main goal of supporting the community-friendly and socially acceptable development of renewable energies, the hope is also that a pro-environmental influence on sustainability behavior will be triggered when joining a community energy project. An analysis of a survey among 16 community energy projects in Germany, with 565 completed questionnaires, shows that a certain part of the members pays more attention to their energy behavior and develop a more positive attitude towards a decentralized energy transition and citizen participation after joining the community energy project. Therefore, we can empirically support that climate protection projects, such as community energy, influence pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, but this does not apply equally to all population groups. Members with higher income and stronger interest in returns are less likely to change their behavior. Based on these findings, we recommend the development of community energy policies that are more responsive to differences in social structure and address both privileged and underprivileged groups in a sophisticated way using specific offers and modes of involvement within the associations.","[Radtke, Joerg] Univ Siegen, Dept Social Sci, Fac Arts & Humanites, Adolf Reichwein Str 2, D-57068 Siegen, Germany; [Yildiz, Oezguer] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Environm Econ & Econ Policy, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Yildiz, Oezguer] Ifok GmbH, Reinhardtstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Roth, Lucas] European Univ Viadrina, KelsoProfessorship Comparat Law, East European Econ Law & European Legal Policy, Grosse Scharrnstr 59, D-15230 Frankfurt, Germany",Universitat Siegen; Technical University of Berlin; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Radtke, J (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Dept Social Sci, Fac Arts & Humanites, Adolf Reichwein Str 2, D-57068 Siegen, Germany.",radtke@politikwissenschaft.uni-siegen.de; oezguer.yildiz@campus.tu-berlin.de; roth@europa-uni.de,"Yildiz, Ozgur/I-7580-2016","Yildiz, Ozgur/0000-0002-7398-1933; Radtke, Jorg/0000-0002-6540-8096",,,,,125,1,1,4,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,822,10.3390/en15030822,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15030822,,,17,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,ZE9CD,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000759173600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas major and minor elements are often routinely analyzed using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning, analysis of trace metals with the same method is not yet established as a routine procedure. Here, we used a recently developed state-of-the-art XRF detector with a core scanner (Avaatech) to examine the optimal settings for analyzing a suite of trace metals (V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and U). Settings were optimized for fast analyses of sediment cores by extensive testing of primary energy settings, filters, and exposure times on two eastern Mediterranean Sea sapropel layers that archive episodes of past sea-floor anoxia. We reveal the following most advantageous (i.e., optimized for analytical accuracy and time efficiency) settings: (1) V, Cr, Ni at 20 kV with aluminum primary beam filter, (2) Cu, Zn, and U at 30 kV with 'thick' (125 mu m) palladium primary beam filter, and (3) Mo at 50 kV with copper primary beam filter. For these trace elements, generally, >= 30 s of measurement are required for obtaining reliable data. Synthetic mixtures show that matrix effects, which are inherent to XRF analyses, are of particular importance for V. A correction for these matrix effects on V (e.g., using Compton scattering) may be necessary for samples with a large variability in carbonate content. XRF core-scanning measurements on synthetically, laminated sediments show that trace metals with contrasting atomic weights and related XRF penetration depths (V and Mo) can be determined at sub-mm resolution. We show that intensity results from the new XRF detector can be converted into concentrations using multivariate log-ratio calibration, allowing a fast quantitative prediction of sedimentary trace metal content using XRF core scanning.","[Hennekam, Rick; Sweere, Tim; Reichart, Gert-Jan] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Ocean Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Hennekam, Rick; Sweere, Tim; Reichart, Gert-Jan] Univ Utrecht, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Sweere, Tim; de lange, Gert J.; Reichart, Gert-Jan] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, POB 80-121, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Tjallingii, Rik] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Climate Dynam & Landscape Evolut 5 2, Potsdam, Germany",Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ); Utrecht University; Utrecht University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Hennekam, R (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Ocean Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.;Hennekam, R (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",rickhennekam@gmail.com,"De Lange, Gert J/B-9639-2014; Reichart, Gert-Jan/N-6308-2018","De Lange, Gert J/0000-0002-9420-3022; Hennekam, Rick/0000-0002-8823-4519; Reichart, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-7256-2243","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [855.01.031, 820.01.005, ALWOP. 2015.113]; Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)","We acknowledge the constructive comments by two anonymous reviewers, which were helpful to improve the original manuscript.

A hybrid local-global scheme is introduced, so as to capture both local and global information, by extracting features in superpixel-generated spatiotemporal volumes, which are then merged into regions with dynamically varying boundaries. The resulting regions' shapes vary according to the underlying motion in the scene, as captured by the superpixels. Representative descriptors are then calculated in these regions, and multiple local Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) models are deployed in them, one for each region, for the unsupervised characterization of normal and abnormal events. The extraction of meaningful descriptors in these regions, instead of the whole frame, increases the resolution of the algorithm, while avoiding noise induced artifacts, and thus resulting in the successful detection of a wide range of anomalies, both in the local and global scales. Experiments on benchmark datasets containing various scenarios in traffic scenes prove our method's efficacy and generality, leading to higher accuracy than the current State of the Art (SoA), and at a lower computational cost.

Results: Understanding that incorrect alignments around short tandem repeats are an important source of genotyping errors, we implemented in NGSEP new algorithms for realignment and haplotype clustering of reads spanning indels and short tandem repeats.

Like other extensively growing industries, China's film and drama industry and inbound tourism are also responsible for contributing effectively toward a sustainable environment. Despite its significant importance, there is a dearth of empirical evidence that analyses these industry's environmental performance. Thus, this study fills the gap by applying the novel bootstrap ARDL approach and found that Inbound Tourism and Film and Drama industry increased environmental performance (reducing ecological footprint) in China. These results imply that entertainment industries and inbound tourism increased social awareness and encouraged environmental protection in societies and industries. Manifestly, the coefficient's magnitude of the Film and Drama industry is relatively lower due to a smaller share of the overall economy. However, it shows significant potential for sustainability by creating awareness about sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility, leading to higher environmental performance. Moreover, a feedback effect (two-way causality) exists between Film and Drama industry, Inbound Tourism, and environmental performance. These results offer valuable policy recommendations.","[Shao, Lu] Xian Polytech Univ, Sch New Media Art, Xian, Peoples R China; [Xi, Wang] Yunnan Univ, Dept Marxism, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Saleem, Faiza] Univ Wah, Dept Management Sci, Wah, Pakistan; [Bajaber, Nadia] King Abdulaziz Univ, Econ Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Abdul-Samad, Zulkiflee] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Dept Quant Surveying, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Xi'an Polytechnic University; Yunnan University; King Abdulaziz University; Universiti Malaya,"Abdul-Samad, Z (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Dept Quant Surveying, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",zulkiflee1969@um.edu.my,"Abdul-Samad, Zulkiflee/AAG-2596-2021","Abdul-Samad, Zulkiflee/0000-0001-6718-2185",,,,,66,3,3,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

These remotely sensed estimates are a preliminary product of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), which is charged with the development of a global rainfall dataset during the period 1986-95, using all available in situ data supplemented with satellite-derived estimates of precipitation. Four-year means (1986-89) of monthly satellite-derived rainfall estimates were compared to the climatological rainfall datasets compiled by Jaeger and Legates and Willmott in the tropics, to assess the performance of the satellite estimates in the context of existing state-of-the-art global precipitation datasets. It is shown that the satellite estimates and the climatologies are in reasonable agreement both in temporal and spatial variation, although some large regional differences were found. A more quantitative assessment of these estimates is also presented by comparing them with ground-based observations from a high-density radar-raingage network over Japan. Short-range forecasts of precipitation from the National Meteorological Center (NMC) Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) models are also compared with the satellite estimates in the tropics. The motivation for this comparison is to assess the utility of the model precipitation forecasts as a first guess of the global tropical precipitation field for use in an objective analysis scheme to integrate the satellite-derived estimates and in situ data for the GPCP. The results show that the distribution and magnitude of mean tropical rainfall agree reasonably well among the estimates and model forecasts during the 9-month study period (March-November 1989). However, temporal correlations between the satellite estimates and the model precipitation predictions reveal that the models currently do not represent the time variations of rainfall in much of the tropics, particularly 30-60-day oscillations, that are apparent in the satellite estimates.",,,"JANOWIAK, JE (corresponding author), NOAA,NWS,NATL METEOROL CTR,CTR CLIMATE ANAL,WASHINGTON,DC 20233, USA.",,,,,,,,29,58,60,0,0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Among these initiatives, biorefinery processes for converting biomass derived carbohydrates into transportation fuels and chemicals are now gaining more and more attention from both academia and industry. Process synthesis, which has played a vital role for the development, design and operation of (petro) chemical processes, can be predicted to play a significant role in the design and commercialization of sustainable and cost-effective biorefinery processes. The main objective of this perspective paper is to elucidate the potential opportunities that biorenewables processing offers to optimal synthesis; challenges and future directions in this field are also concisely discussed. An attempt is made with this perspective to stimulate more and more efforts to optimally synthesize and design biorenewable conversion process to accelerate the commercialization of the biorefinery technology and further reduce the heavily reliance on petroleum-derive fuels.

Compounding the problems with these categorizations is the fact that skin disease and skin health are affected not just by inherent risk factors but also by habits and environment. Thus, a fundamental question remains as we evaluate the effects of cultural and environmental factors: do genetic factors account for most of the difference that we see in skin types? Is the primary influence the way the skin mediates the environmental insult of UV radiation or how inflammation is handled? Is melanization the primary characteristic that we should measure and consider? This article will provide an introduction to current knowledge and future directions researchers are taking in differentiating both the biological differences of skin and the clinical manifestations of skin disease among the groups described above. This discussion will be followed by a brief overview of cultural practices and environmental factors that are known to have significant impact on skin disease and a summary of the most common conditions that are encountered worldwide.","[Kimball, Alexa B.] Harvard Univ, CURTIS, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kimball, Alexa B.] Harvard Univ, CURTIS, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Kimball, AB (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, CURTIS, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 50 Staniford St,246, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",akimball@partners.org,"Kimball, Alexandra B./M-6347-2019","Kimball, Alexandra B./0000-0001-9405-0479",,,,,50,10,13,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1087-0024,1529-1774,,J INVEST DERM SYMP P,J.

This has been compiled by applying a state-of-the-art cyclone tracking scheme to the 6-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) global reanalyses spanning the period 1958-97. The results show there to be, on average, between 35 and 38 cyclonic systems per analysis (depending on season), with the greatest density [exceeding 6 X 10(-3) cyclones (deg lat)(-2)] found south of 60 degrees S in all seasons and in the Indian and west Pacific Oceans in autumn and winter. For the most part, there is a net creation of cyclones (i.e., cyclogenesis exceeds cyclolysis) north of about 50 degrees S, and a net destruction to the south of this latitude. Having said this, the most active cyclogenesis takes place south of 45 degrees S. The NCEP-NCAR reanalyses indicate that most SH cyclogenesis occurs at very high latitudes, and the axis of the maximum lies on, or to the south of, 60 degrees S. This is in agreement with the deductions of many modern studies of SH cyclone behavior. The region is also host to even greater levels of cyclolytic activity. The authors consider measures of the importance and influence (e.g., for eddy fluxes) of cyclonic systems. It is suggested that the depth of a system (the pressure difference between the center and the edge of a cyclone) is relatively bias-free and useful measure of a cyclone's status and effect on the circulation. The greatest climatological depths are seen to lie at about 60 degrees S, well to the north of the circumpolar trough and of the region of greatest cyclone density. The mean lifetime of cyclones that last at least 1 day is just over 3 days. Those that are located between 50 degrees and 70 degrees S (at their half-lifetime) endure, on average, almost one day longer than all other systems. The mean track length of winter systems is 2315 km, which reduces to 1946 km in summer. The significance of the work presented here lies in a number of factors. First, the climatology has been derived from 40 yr of analysis, a period longer than any considered heretofore. Further, the (re)analyses used can be regarded as one of the best representations of the global atmosphere. The availability of these analyses at 6-hourly intervals means that the uncertainties with tracking of cyclones are greatly diminished. Finally, it has been compiled using one of the most sophisticated and reliable automatic cyclone finding and tracking schemes. This climatology of SH extratropical cyclones is arguably the most accurate and representative set yet assembled.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Simmonds, I (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",,,"Simmonds, Ian/0000-0002-4479-3255",,,,,44,285,302,0,23,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

However, improvements in biogas production efficiency are needed in dealing with lignocellulosic biomass. The state-of-the-art of AD technology is discussed, with emphasis on feedstock digestibility and operational difficulty. Solutions to these challenges including for pre-treatment and bioaugmentation are reviewed. This article proposes an innovative integrated system combining alkali pre-treatment, temperature-phased AD and bioaugmentation techniques. The integrated system as modelled has a targeted potential to achieve a biodegradability index of 90% while increasing methane production by 47% compared to conventional AD. The methane productivity may also be improved by a target reduction in retention time from 30 to 20 days. This, if realized has the potential to lower energy production cost and the levelized cost of abatement to facilitate an increased resource of sustainable commercially viable biomethane.","[Donkor, Kwame O.; Lin, Richen; Murphy, Jerry D.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Donkor, Kwame O.; Lin, Richen; Murphy, Jerry D.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn & Architecture, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Donkor, Kwame O.; Gottumukkala, Lalitha D.] Celignis Ltd, Mill Court,Upper William St, Limerick V94 N6D2, Ireland; [Lin, Richen] Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, Key Lab Energy Thermal Convers, Control Minist Educ, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China",University College Cork; University College Cork; Southeast University - China,"Lin, RC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland.;Lin, RC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn & Architecture, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland.;Lin, RC (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, Key Lab Energy Thermal Convers, Control Minist Educ, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",richen.lin@ucc.ie,"Murphy, Jerry D/ABH-3038-2020","Murphy, Jerry D/0000-0003-2120-1357","Irish Research Council (IRC) [EBPPG/2019/202]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the MaREI centre for energy [12/RC/2302_P2, 16/SP/3829]; Environmental Protection Agency - Ireland [2018-RE-MS-13]; Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland [RDD/00454]","Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the MaREI centre for energy(Science Foundation Ireland); Environmental Protection Agency - Ireland(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland","Acknowledgement This study was funded by: the Irish Research Council (IRC) which funded an industrial PhD student at Celignis Analytical Limited under IRC project EBPPG/2019/202; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the MaREI centre for energy, climate and marine under Grant No. 12/RC/2302_P2 and 16/SP/3829; the Environmental Protection Agency - Ireland (2018-RE-MS-13) ; and the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (RDD/00454) .",,150,3,3,22,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-8524,1873-2976,,BIORESOURCE TECHNOL,Bioresour.

This holistic study of a surviving temperate zone example (Culm, UK) uses geomorphological mapping, C-14, direct sediment dating (OSL, fallout radionuclides), and palaeoecology. This reveals the evolution of a channel-floodplain system from an initial braided state in the Late Pleistocene to its late Holocene anastomosing state. After the Pleistocene-Holocene transition the reduced channel system incised into its braid-plain, only able to rework gravels locally due to reduced competence in relation to inherited bounding sediment calibre. This resulted in the creation of terrace islands, palaeochannels, and a stable anastomosing pattern dominated by channel junctions, bifurcations and palaeochannel intersections. Survey, coring and excavation reveal a persistence of mid-channel bars and riffles at channel junctions, and where channels crossed palaeochannel fills. In common with most other European lowland rivers this system evolves in the later Holocene due to both climate and catchment changes with a major hydrological critical transition in the mid-Holocene (c. 5300 BP). However, in the case of the Culm, the increase in fine sediment supply often seen in lowland catchments in the Middle-Late Holocene, occurred later, and was insufficient to convert the system to a single medium-low sinuosity channel-floodplain. This allowed the persistence of high heterogeneity and biodiversity (including the persistence of riffle beetles) as part of multiple-scales of non-uniformity. Indeed the pool-riffle persistence is an example of this system's non-uniformity, being due, at least in part, to the effects of previous channel history. This paper reveals why this river survived in a multichannel state, and by implication, why others did not. These results are being used in the bespoke eco-heritage management of the Culm, but could also inform the restoration of other former multi-channel lowland temperate river systems worldwide.

The required energy system is among others characterised by intensive utilisation of renewable energy sources (RES). RES technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, for the strategic planning there is a great demand for the comparison of RES technologies. Furthermore, there are additional functions of RES utilisation expected beyond climate change mitigation, e.g. increment of employment, economic growth and rural development. The aim of the study was to reveal the most beneficial RES technologies with special respect to sustainability. Ten technologies of power generation and seven technologies of heat supply were examined in a multi-criteria sustainability assessment frame of seven attributes which were evaluated based on a choice experiment (CE) survey. According to experts the most important characteristics of RES utilisation technologies are land demand and social impacts i.e. increase in employment and local income generation. Concentrated solar power (CSP), hydropower and geothermal power plants are favourable technologies for power generation, while geothermal district heating, pellet-based non-grid heating and solar thermal heating can offer significant advantages in case of heat supply.

The model incorporates parameters for energy density, power density, safety, lifetime, costs and raw materials. Combinations of carbon anodes, Li4Ti5O12 or TiO2 with LiFePO4 cathodes comprise interesting combinations for application in hybrid power trains. Higher cost and raw material prioritization of stationary applications hinders the breakthrough of Li4Ti5O12, while a combination of TiO2 and LiFePO4 is suggested. The favored combinations resemble state-of-the-art materials, whereas novel cell chemistries must be optimized for cells in battery electric vehicles. In contrast to actual research efforts, sulfur as a cathode material is excluded due to its low volumetric energy density and its known lifetime and safety issues. Lithium as anode materials is discarded due to safety issues linked to electrode melting and dendrite formation. A high capacity composite Li2MnO3 center dot LiNi0.5Co0.5O2 and high voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode with silicon as anode material promise high energy densities with sufficient lifetime and safety properties if electrochemical and thermal stabilization of the electrolyte/electrode interfaces and bulk materials is achieved.

Because the estimated advective temporal scale is usually longer than the Aquarius/SAC-D revisit time, the possibility of producing freshwater flux estimates from temporal salinity changes is first examined by using a correlation analysis. For the mean seasonal cycle, the patterns of the correlations between the freshwater fluxes and surface salinity temporal tendencies are mainly zonally oriented, and are highest where the local precipitation is also relatively high. Nonseasonal (deviations from the monthly mean) correlations are highest along mid-latitude storm tracks and are relatively small in the tropics. The complex correlation patterns presented here suggest that a global retrieval of the difference between evaporation and precipitation (E-P) from salinity changes requires more complex techniques than a simple consideration of a local balance with surface forcing.","[Li, Zhen] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Beltsville, MD USA; [Adamec, David] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Ocean Sci Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD USA.",Zhen.Li-1@nasa.gov,,,NASA's Science Mission Directorate under its Physical Oceanography Program,NASA's Science Mission Directorate under its Physical Oceanography Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This research was sponsored by NASA's Science Mission Directorate under its Physical Oceanography Program.

(1992a, 1992b) and Kleinig and Middelberg (1996), on cell disruption of yeast through HPH (high pressure homogenizer), the underlying factors in improving energy yield from biomass source has to be considered. This has become a global issue for scientists, researchers and policy makers as the energy demand has grown over the years due to the growing population. As cleaner energy has become highly needed for save environment and protection of the climate hence shifting away from the utilization of fossil fuels will be of higher priority. In this paper, these factors will be highlighted and discussed herein as well as other parameters that influence the energy production efficiency from the high-pressure homogenizer (HPH) through using yeast as a biomass source. The HPH for consideration in this study is the GYB40-10S; this has a pressure of up to 100 MPa with two stage homogenizing valves pressure. This is adjustable so as to produce superfine, homogeneous, stable liquid liquid or solid liquid under multiple actions of cavitation effect and high speed impact. And also shear through the adjustable homogenizing pressure valve in the conditions of high pressure and thereby making the material compatible after homogenization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The efflorescences at subaerial fumaroles are explained as follows: Sulphur crystallizes on oxidation of H S emanating from depth. Weathering produces sulphuric acid enhancing groundwater alteration of volcanic rocks. The high geothermal gradient and arid climate stimulate efflorescences. Salts are recycled during wet and dry weather leading to Al-enrichment on loss of Fe(II,III) and other cations. delta(34)Sparts per thousand V-CDT values for sulphur in fumarole sublimates, solfatara soils and 'veins' range from -0.3 to 6.4parts per thousand, mean 3.8parts per thousand (n = 8) while Al, Ca arid Mg-sulphates in diverse settings range from -4.1 to 6.8parts per thousand (n = 16). The values for sulphur indicate that the initial H2S had an igneous source and the signature is largely inherited by the sulphates. This study aims to underpin research into the exploitation of industrial minerals in the Roman period. When searching for early alumen workings, areas with evidence of acid sulphate alteration (white rocks) and sulphurous fumarole activity should be investigated.","Univ Glasgow, Dept Archaeol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, E Kilbride, Lanark, Scotland; Inst Geol & Min Explorat, Athens, Greece; Scottish Analyt Serv Art & Archaeol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; Scottish Universities Research & Reactor Center,"Hall, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Archaeol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",a.hall@archaeology.arts.gla.ac.uk,,"Fallick, Anthony/0000-0002-7649-6167",,,,,37,12,13,2,4,MINERALOGICAL SOC,TWICKENHAM,"12 BAYLIS MEWS, AMYAND PARK ROAD,, TWICKENHAM TW1 3HQ, MIDDLESEX, ENGLAND",0026-461X,1471-8022,,MINERAL MAG,Mineral.

In bioinformatics, where datasets are categorised as having complex features, the need for pre-processing is unavoidable. In this paper, we propose a framework for selecting the discriminatory features from protein sequences prior to classification by integrating the filter and wrapper approaches. Several state-of-the-art multivariate filters were explored in the first phase to remove the unwanted features that contributed to noise, while particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with support vector machine (SVM) was adopted in the wrapper phase to produce the most optimal features. Several PSO variants were investigated in the wrapper phase to compare the most suitable PSO variants for the problem domain. The results of both phases were analysed based on classification accuracy, number of selected features, modelling time and area under the curve on the main dataset and, five benchmark machine learning datasets of similar complexity. The higher classification accuracy of the proposed framework was highly reliable with an improvement over the filter phase and the use of full features despite using smaller features.","[Abdul-Rahman, Shuzlina; Abu Bakar, Azuraliza] Natl Univ Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Syst Management, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mohamed-Hussein, Zeti-Azura] Natl Univ Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Abu Bakar, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Syst Management, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",aab@ftsm.ukm.my,"Mohamed-Hussein, Zeti-Azura/R-9631-2018; Abdul-Rahman, Shuzlina/W-4295-2019; ABU BAKAR, AZURALIZA/AAT-3393-2020","Mohamed-Hussein, Zeti-Azura/0000-0002-5386-7260; Abdul-Rahman, Shuzlina/0000-0002-5498-9606; ","Ministry of Science and Technology Innovation, Malaysia [UKM-MGI-NDB0005-2007]; Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia","Ministry of Science and Technology Innovation, Malaysia(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia); Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia","Shuzlina Abdul-Rahman was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology Innovation, Malaysia (UKM-MGI-NDB0005-2007) and Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",,63,10,10,2,13,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1088-467X,1571-4128,,INTELL DATA ANAL,Intell.

Given the multi-faceted importance of the soil ecosystem, and considering the increasing pressures exerted upon it due to climate change, degradation and urbanization, the advantages of soil spectroscopy are significant. Large soil spectral libraries have been developed to this end throughout the world. The soil matrix is however complex, posing a challenge in the determination of key soil properties from the spectra. To tackle this challenge, two methodologies are generally used: a) the use of spectral pre-processing techniques to transfer the spectra into a new space in which the association between spectrum and soil property is supposed to be more clear, and b) the use of more sophisticated machine learning models (e.g. deep learning). In this paper, we propose a novel methodology using stacked autoencoders to transform the initially recorded spectra in a new compressed (i.e. latent) space which can help the chemometric models enhance the accuracy of prediction. This is an unsupervised learning approach which only depends on the input data (i.e. the spectra). Following the significant results obtained in the literature using combinations of different spectra pre-processing techniques and the simultaneous prediction of multiple soil properties, the proposed methodology is extended to facilitate these approaches. We demonstrate this capacity by applying it in the mineral samples of the LUCAS 2009 topsoil database, and simultaneously predicting eight properties (the particle size distribution, pH, CEC, organic carbon, calcium carbonate, and total nitrogen) using an artificial neural network. Compared to standard pre-processing techniques and other transformations such as the principal components space, the proposed methodology using only one spectral source as input decreases the RMSE on average by 8.4% and by 3.5%, respectively. With respect to the current state-of-the-art and in particular a multi-input convolutional neural network which was recently proposed and outperformed the compared methodologies, the results of our multi-input methodology exhibit an average RMSE decrease of 9.9%. The interpretability aspect of the transformed feature space and the compressed spectra was also examined to identify how the compressed information encodes the input data and enables better associations between input and output.","[Tsimpouris, Evangelos; Tsakiridis, Nikolaos L.; Theocharis, John B.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Tsakiridis, NL (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",tsimpour@ece.auth.gr; tsakirin@ece.auth.gr; theochar@eng.auth.gr,"Tsakiridis, Nikolaos/AAT-7879-2021","Tsakiridis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-1904-9029",,,,,59,6,6,10,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,1-Jul,2021,,,,,,,114967,10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.114967,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.114967,,21-Mar,13,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,RN2LP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000640183800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the basis of genomic and proteomic understanding of the melanocyte and melanogenesis, there are potentially hundreds of proteins and other effectors involved in pigmentation. This knowledge, although complex, should prove most useful in identifying specific abnormalities that lead to the hyperpigmentary problems. Also available are new laboratory screening methods and skin color measurement tools that are increasing the pace at which materials can be screened and evaluated clinically for their effectiveness. Combined with a clear consumer need for effective pigmentation control agents, advanced pigmentary system understanding and new research capabilities are setting the stage for future technological advancements.","[Ortonne, Jean-Paul] Univ Nice, Dept Dermatol, Serv Dermatol, Hosp Archet, F-06202 Nice 3, France; [Bissett, Donald L.] Procter & Gamble Co, Cincinnati, OH USA",CHU Nice; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Cote d'Azur; Procter & Gamble,"Ortonne, JP (corresponding author), Univ Nice, Dept Dermatol, Serv Dermatol, Hosp Archet, BP 3079, F-06202 Nice 3, France.",ortonne@unice.fr,,,,,,,30,80,88,3,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1087-0024,1529-1774,,J INVEST DERM SYMP P,J.

Possible reasons for the high frequency of thunderstorms and the associated event chain across compartments were investigated in detail during the hydro-meteorological field campaign Swabian MOSES carried out between May and September 2021. Researchers from various disciplines established more than 25 temporary ground-based stations equipped with state-of-the-art in situ and remote sensing observation systems, such as lidars, dual-polarization X- and C-band Doppler weather radars, radiosondes including stratospheric balloons, an aerosol cloud chamber, masts to measure vertical fluxes, autosamplers for water probes in rivers, and networks of disdrometers, soil moisture, and hail sensors. These fixed-site observations were supplemented by mobile observation systems, such as a research aircraft with scanning Doppler lidar, a cosmic ray neutron sensing rover, and a storm chasing team launching swarmsondes in the vicinity of hailstorms. Seven Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) were conducted on a total of 21 operating days. An exceptionally high number of convective events, including both unorganized and organized thunderstorms such as multicells or supercells, occurred during the study period. This paper gives an overview of the Swabian MOSES (Modular Observation Solutions for Earth Systems) field campaign, briefly describes the observation strategy, and presents observational highlights for two IOPs.","[Kunz, Michael; Boehmlaender, Alexander; Gasch, Philipp; Gross, Jochen; Handwerker, Jan; Hase, Frank; Knippertz, Peter; Kohler, Martin; Latt, Melissa; Martin, Lioba; Mauder, Matthias; Moehler, Ottmar; Mohr, Susanna; Saathoff, Harald; Vogel, Franziska; Voelksch, Ingo; Wieser, Andreas; Wilhelm, Jannik; Zhang, Hengheng] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Abbas, Syed S.; Lange, Diego; Spaeth, Florian] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Phys & Meteorol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Bauckholt, Matteo; Schroen, Martin; Schuetze, Claudia; Weber, Ute; Dietrich, Peter] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res GmbH UFZ, Leipzig, Germany; [Feuerle, Thomas] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Flight Guidance, Braunschweig, Germany; [Glaser, Clarissa; Spahr, Stephanie; Dietrich, Peter] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Hajnsek, Irena] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hajnsek, Irena] German Aerosp Ctr, Microwaves & Radar Inst, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Khordakova, Dina; Laube, Johannes; Rolf, Christian] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 7, Julich, Germany; [Mauder, Matthias] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, Dresden, Germany; [Reitter, Rene W.] Deutsch Wetterdienst DWD, Offenbach, Germany; [Rettenmeier, Andreas] Ctr Solar Energy & Hydrogen Res Baden Wurttemberg, Stuttgart, Germany; [Spahr, Stephanie] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Berlin, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University Hohenheim; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Braunschweig University of Technology; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Technische Universitat Dresden; Deutscher Wetterdienst; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB),"Kunz, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",michael.kunz@kit.edu,"Möhler, Ottmar/J-9426-2012","Möhler, Ottmar/0000-0002-7551-9814; Saathoff, Harald/0000-0002-1301-8010",Helmholtz Association; DFG (German Research Foundation) Collaborative Research Center CAMPOS at the University of Tuebingen [CRC-1253]; ERC project EXC3ITE [EXC3ITE-678904-ERC-2015-STG],Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); DFG (German Research Foundation) Collaborative Research Center CAMPOS at the University of Tuebingen(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ERC project EXC3ITE,This work was supported by funding from the Helmholtz Association within the framework of MOSES.

The development of reference datasets to determine the date and provenance of shipwreck timbers is therefore a paramount undertaking. Here we compile and present recent advances in the development of tree-ring chronologies, stable strontium isotope ratios and chemical biomarkers aimed to determine the date and provenance of Iberian shipwreck timbers. A set of oak and pine tree-ring chronologies have been developed from living trees covering the past 500 and 800 years, respectively, and have served to confirm the provenance of the wood used in an 18th-century Spanish ship of the Royal Navy. Stable strontium isotopic signatures have been obtained from soil and living trees at 26 sites throughout the Iberian Peninsula, providing a climate-independent geochemical network to source the origin of historic timbers. However, retrieving the original isotopic signature from waterlogged samples remains unsuccessful, stressing the need to develop effective protocols to separate the seawater signal from the original strontium isotope ratios in the wood. Analyses of organic compounds in wood of living trees have proven suitable to discriminate species and provenances, but results on shipwreck timbers are inconclusive and should be further explored. Our regional approach has the potential to be expanded to other areas and archaeological timbers from different periods throughout the Anthropocene. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques presented when applied to waterlogged wood, propose GIS tools to interpret and visualize combined results, and stress the need to expand these type of reference datasets to allow for multiproxy dendroprovenancing approaches.","[Dominguez-Delmas, Marta; Garcia-Gonzalez, Ignacio; Groenendijk, Peter] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Bot, Lugo, Spain; [Dominguez-Delmas, Marta] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Art Hist, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rich, Sara] Maritime Archaeol Ltd, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Rich, Sara] Coastal Carolina Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies, Conway, SC USA; [Traor, Mohamed] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Edafol & Quim Agr, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Traor, Mohamed] Ecole Natl Ingenieurs Abderharnane Baba Toure, Unite Eau & Environm, Bamako, Mali; [Hajj, Fadi; Poszwa, Anne] Univ Lorraine, Lab Interdisciplinaire Environm Continentaux, Nancy, France; [Akhmetzyanov, Linar] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Groenendijk, Peter] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Biol, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; University of Amsterdam; NERC National Oceanography Centre; Coastal Carolina University; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universite de Lorraine; Wageningen University & Research; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dominguez-Delmas, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Fac Humanities, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.dominguezdelmas@uva.nl; srich@coastal.edu; traore.mohamed19@gmail.com; anne.poszwa@univ-lorraine.fr; linar.akhmetzyanov@wur.nl; ignacio.garcia@usc.es; peterg@unicamp.br,"García-González, Ignacio/C-1439-2009; Groenendijk, Peter/P-1572-2014; Domínguez-Delmás, Marta/ABE-1824-2021; Akhmetzyanov, Linar/AAB-8598-2021","García-González, Ignacio/0000-0001-8460-2401; Groenendijk, Peter/0000-0003-2752-6195; Domínguez-Delmás, Marta/0000-0001-8716-0258; Akhmetzyanov, Linar/0000-0002-8130-6137; Traore, Mohamed/0000-0001-7171-1537",European Union [PITN-GA 2013-607545]; Dutch Research Council [Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek] [016.

NaOCl oxidized around 75% of the OC, which corresponded well to a mean loss in heat of reaction of 80%. Peak temperatures and 50% burnoff temperatures did not change systematically after oxidation showing that the thermal stability of NaOCl residues was similar to that of untreated samples.

Unfortunately, these students will be assuming major decision-making responsibilities regarding catastrophes that will be complicated by climate change, nuclear threats, global terrorism, and pandemics. Meanwhile, Sort, Assess, Life-Saving Interventions, Treatment, and/or Transport (SALT) triage is being advocated over the globally popular Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm for multiple reasons: (1) it's an all-hazard approach; (2) it has four medical interventions; and (3) it has an additional triage color for victims with non-survivable injuries. Hypothesis/Problem: As present-day threats become more ominous and health care education emphasizes the needs of vulnerable populations and palliative care, the authors hypothesize that, when given a choice, health care students will prefer SALT triage. Methods: A convenience sample of 218 interprofessional, disaster-naive health care students received just-in-time, unbiased education on both START and SALT triage systems. Students then completed a survey asking them to decide which triage system they believe would be most effective in their community. Results: A total of 123 health care students (56.4%) preferred SALT while 95 (43.6%) preferred START; however, only the physician assistant students showed a statistically significantly preference (28 versus six, respectively; P=.042). Interestingly, there was also a statistically significant difference in preference by gender (Chi-square=5.02; P=.025) of the observed distribution versus expected distribution in SALT and START. The females preferred SALT (61.0%) while the males preferred START (55.9%). Among those who preferred START, START being easier to learn was the most important reason cited. Among those who preferred SALT, the most important reason cited was that the number of patient triage categories seemed more logical, comprehensible, and consistent with traditional medical care. Conclusion: While SALT's preference among females and physician assistant students was based on the addition of medical interventions and the provision of palliative care, START's preference was related to expediency. Based on this research, incorporating disaster concepts into US health care students' curricula encourages thoughtful consideration among the future health care leaders about the most effective approach to triage care. It is critical that further research be completed to determine, without reservation, which triage system will not only save the most lives but provide the most humane care to victims","[Fink, Brian N.; Rega, Paul P.; Sexton, Martha E.; Wishner, Carolina] Univ Toledo, 3000 Arlington Ave,MS 1027, Toledo, OH 43614 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Fink, BN (corresponding author), Univ Toledo, 3000 Arlington Ave,MS 1027, Toledo, OH 43614 USA.",brian.fink2@utoledo.edu,,"Rega, Paul/0000-0002-6236-4470",,,,,33,4,4,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1049-023X,1945-1938,,PREHOSP DISASTER MED,Prehospital Disaster Med.,AUG,2018,4,,,,381,386,,10.1017/S1049023X18000547,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X18000547,,,6,Emergency Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Emergency Medicine,GR2BQ,30001759,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000442364500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current observations during 2002-2011 at seven moorings along the major Atlantic Water (AW) pathway, complemented by an extensive collection of measured temperatures and salinities as well as results of state-of-the-art numerical modeling, have been used to examine the spatial structure and temporal variability of the ACBC within the Eurasian Basin (EB). These observations and modeling results suggest a gradual, six-fold decrease of boundary current speed (from 24 to 4 cm/s) on the route between Fram Strait and the Lomonosov Ridge, accompanied by a transformation of the vertical flow structure from mainly barotropic in Fram Strait to baroclinic between the area north of Spitsbergen and the central Laptev Sea continental slope. The relative role of density-driven currents in maintaining AW circulation increases with the progression of the ACBC eastward from Fram Strait, so that baroclinic ACBC forcing dominates over the barotropic in the eastern EB. Mooring records have revealed that waters within the AW and the cold halocline layers circulate in roughly the same direction in the eastern EB. The seasonal signal, meanwhile, is the most powerful mode of variability in the EB, contributing up to similar to 70% of the total variability in currents (resolved by moorings records) within the eastern EB. Seasonal signal amplitudes for current speed and AW temperature both decrease with the eastward progression of AW flow from source regions, and demonstrate strong interannual modulation. In the 2000s, the state of the EB (e.g., circulation pattern, thermohaline conditions, and freshwater balance) experienced remarkable changes. Results showing anomalous circulation patterns for an extended period of 30 months in 2008-2010 for the eastern EB, and a two-core AW temperature structure that emerged in this region of the Arctic Ocean in the most recent decade, suggest a shift of the EB toward a new, more dynamic state. This also likely suggests that the EB interior will become more susceptible to future climate change. Evaluating properties of the ACBC, its temporal variability at time scales from a season to several years, and possible governing mechanisms, this study contributes to a better understanding of Arctic Ocean circulation.

Management strategies are necessary to overcome these potential problems, particularly in abandoned solar saltworks wetlands which are particularly prone to degradation by desiccation. This paper reports the soil-vegetation relationships in one of these wetlands (Agua Amarga salt marsh, SE Spain), in which a pioneer programme of irrigation with seawater is applied to correct the environmental impacts of two desalination plants. Depth of water level and soil Eh, bulk density, moisture and salinity were determined in December 2011 and June and October 2012, in 63 plots from 12 different environments/types of vegetation. Multivariate analyses were used to identify gradients, and a model of soil-vegetation relationships was elaborated to contribute to the management of the marsh. Two different situations were identified: the periphery (drier and less saline soils) and the abandoned saline ponds (wetter and more saline soils). The three environments/types of vegetation of the periphery (Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp. stands) were separated according to the seasonal behaviour of soil salinity and moisture, regardless of the irrigation programme. Hence, modifications in the vegetation distribution should be mainly attributable to environmental factors, including possible consequences of climate change. The nine environments/types of vegetation of the abandoned saline ponds (Sarcocorniafruticosa, Art hrocnemum macrostachyum growing in patches with and without the presence of seedlings, bare soils among A. macrostachyum patches, mixed stands with S. fruticosa and A. macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, flooded ponds with Ruppia maritima, Phragmites australis and a burned zone) were separated mainly according to soil moisture, water level in the soil profile, Eh and salinity. In this zone, vegetation can be used as a bioindicator to detect the consequences of the irrigation programme, which should be carefully managed if biodiversity and habitat variety have to be preserved. Our results indicate that the amount of seawater pumped is a critical issue and must be planned taking into account not only the vegetation but also the current soil properties such as bulk density (that influences water infiltration and retention) and salinity (mainly determined by the salts that remain in the soils due to the former use of the ponds as solar saltworks).

These provide protocols to estimate extreme WDR exposure, such as the worst spell likely to occur in any given three-year period. This study characterises the amount of annual WDR exposure and the frequency and duration of directional WDR spells for eight sites in the UK from 1986 to 2015. To assess the utility of these standards for evaluating extreme WDR exposure at those sites, the worst spell likely to occur in any given three-year period is determined using a 'return period' approach from extreme value analysis (EVA). It is shown that in the context of the prevailing wind patterns in the UK wall orientation is an important factor in determining the frequency and duration of WDR spell properties. EVA is applied for eight sites in the UK from 1959 to 1991 to evaluate the methods and climatic data used in BS 8104:1992 and their relevance to current climate. Both standards underestimate the volumetric exposure of the `once every three years' spell compared to EVA for methodological reasons but are useful tools to assess annual exposure and compare between sites.","[Orr, Scott Allan; Viles, Heather] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Orr, SA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",scott.orr@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Orr, Scott/L-6770-2019","Orr, Scott/0000-0002-2549-9173; Orr, Scott Allan/0000-0002-1137-5946",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L016036/1]; Historic Environment Scotland; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada [PGSD3-471105-2015],UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Historic Environment Scotland; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council grant for the Centre for Doctoral Training Science and Engineering in Art, Heritage and Archaeology (EP/L016036/1).

In this study, we compared the local use of upgraded biogas for producing electricity and heat with its energetic conversion at a distance away from the biogas plant under the conditions present in Germany. A total of seven systems were compared theoretically with the direct feeding of upgraded biogas into the grid. These systems involved either a BHPP or one of three types of fuel cell (molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC, proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)] or a hybrid system consisting of a SOFC and a gas turbine. The degree of efficiency in direct gas feeding was essentially better (71.3% secondary energy out of primary energy) than the decentralized forms of energetic conversion [45.7 (BHPP) -57.8% (hybrid system)]. The reason for this is that in Germany, natural gas, which is substituted through direct gas feeding, is primarily used for heating purposes. In comparison, however, the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction potential of local cogeneration (254-360 g CO(2)/kWhb(iogas)) was much higher than that of direct gas feeding (187- to 228-g CO(2)/kWh(biogas)). This was found to be trite even when no useful heat could be used on the site of the biogas plant. The best results were achieved with the hybrid system. By considering the effects of a reduction in the CO(2) production of the German power supply mix oil the potential emissions reduction of all eight systems investigated, it could also be shown that the hybrid system again had the greatest GHG emissions reducing potential. These results indicate that the direct feeding of upgraded biogas is not the best option for the utilization of this commodity with regards to climate protection in the German situation. Indeed, the results indicate that the application of innovative and efficient technologies, such. as the hybrid system consisting of SOFC and a gas turbine, call generate essential improvements in emissions reductions in biogas plants ill comparison to the presently used BHPPs. For this reason, the use of fuel cells in German biogas plants should be promoted.","[Wegener, J.

Cluster formation mechanisms at the molecular level are resolved, and theoretical results on cluster stability are confirmed with mass spectrometer measurements. New-particle formation from guanidine and sulfuric acid molecules occurs without thermodynamic barriers under studied conditions, and clusters are growing close to a 1:1 composition of acid and base. Evaporation rates of the most stable clusters are extremely low, which can be explained by the proton transfers and symmetrical cluster structures. We compare the ability of guanidine and dimethylamine to enhance sulfuric acid-driven particle formation and show that more than 2000-fold concentration of dimethylamine is needed to yield as efficient particle formation as in the case of guanidine. At similar conditions, guanidine yields 8 orders of magnitude higher particle formation rates compared to dimethylamine. Highly basic compounds such as guanidine may explain experimentally observed particle formation events at low precursor vapor concentrations, whereas less basic and more abundant bases such as ammonia and amines are likely to explain measurements at high concentrations.","[Myllys, Nanna; Ponkkonen, Tuomo; Passananti, Monica; Vehkamaki, Hanna] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Elm, Jonas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Chem & iClimate, Langelandsgade 140, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Olenius, Tinja] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem, Svante Arrhenius Vag 8, SE-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Olenius, Tinja] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Svante Arrhenius Vag 8, SE-11418 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Helsinki; Aarhus University; Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Myllys, N (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Olenius, T (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem, Svante Arrhenius Vag 8, SE-11418 Stockholm, Sweden.;Olenius, T (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Svante Arrhenius Vag 8, SE-11418 Stockholm, Sweden.",nanna.myllys@helsinki.fi; tinja.olenius@alumni.helsinki.fi,"Vehkamäki, Hanna/A-8262-2008; Passananti, Monica/AAY-1479-2020; Olenius, Tinja/GNP-2324-2022; Passananti, Monica/N-7013-2016; Myllys, Nanna/M-7894-2017; Elm, Jonas/J-1717-2016","Vehkamäki, Hanna/0000-0002-5018-1255; Passananti, Monica/0000-0003-4053-1191; Passananti, Monica/0000-0003-4053-1191; Myllys, Nanna/0000-0003-0384-7277; Elm, Jonas/0000-0003-3736-4329",Academy of Finland; ERC [692891-DAMOCLES]; ATMATH Project; Swedish Research Council [2015-749]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (Academy Fellowship AtmoRemove); Villum Foundation,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); ATMATH Project; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (Academy Fellowship AtmoRemove); Villum Foundation(Villum Fonden),"We thank the Academy of Finland, ERC Project 692891-DAMOCLES, ATMATH Project, Swedish Research Council Formas Project 2015-749, and Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (Academy Fellowship AtmoRemove) for funding, and the CSC-IT Center for Science in Espoo, Finland, for computational resources.

Patients' assessments of the benefits and shortcomings of the service provided to them are expressed as satisfied or dissatisfied. The objective of this study was to determine the magnitude of women's satisfaction on quality of safe abortion and factors associated with it in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional study design was done to collect data from 618 women in the selected health facilities in Northwest Ethiopia. Women having the gestational trophoblastic disease (partial mole) and those who cannot hear or are seriously ill during the data collection period were excluded. The study subjects were chosen using a randomization process, and each participant was questioned after receiving all necessary abortion treatment and giving verbal consent. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine covariates significantly associated with women's satisfaction on quality of abortion. Results The highest proportion of women who were reasoned out to terminate the fetus in the current pregnancy was due to financial problems (29.36%) and partner coercion (23.85%). Client satisfaction with safe abortion services in the study region was 25.10% (95% CI; 21.81-28.70). Women were 53.2% satisfied with the art of treatment/interpersonal abilities, 59.2% satisfied with the professional quality of care professionals, 54.5% satisfied with the physical environment, and 49.8% satisfied with the structure of the health care system, respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, women's living solely 0.47(0.26-0.87) & living with 2 to 4 people 0.11(0.04-0.29), college and above level of education 1.78(1.01-3.15), wanted the status of pregnancy 0.44(0.23-0.85) and post-abortion contraceptive users 1.70(1.01-2.89) were factors significantly associated with women's satisfaction level. Conclusion In this study, one-fourth of the women were satisfied with the quality of safe abortion services. Family size, women's educational status, maternity status, and post-abortion contraception use were predictors of women's satisfaction with the quality of abortion. Ethiopia's government should concentrate on addressing contraception needs in order to prevent women from having multiple abortions.","[Gashaye, Kiros Terefe] Univ Gondar, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Taddese, Asefa Adimasu; Birhan, Tilahun Yemanu] Univ Gondar, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Gondar, Ethiopia",University of Gondar; University of Gondar,"Birhan, TY (corresponding author), Univ Gondar, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Gondar, Ethiopia.",yemanu.tilahun@gmail.com,,"Yemanu, Tilahun/0000-0002-1614-8814",,,,,30,1,1,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0778-7367,2049-3258,,ARCH PUBLIC HEALTH,Arch.

The intrinsically high dimensionality of the space of realizable materials makes traditional approaches ineffective for large-scale explorations. Modern data science and machine learning tools developed for increasingly complicated problems are an attractive alternative. An imminent climate catastrophe calls for a clean energy transformation by overhauling current technologies within only several years of possible action available. Tackling this crisis requires the development of new materials at an unprecedented pace and scale. For example, organic photovoltaics have the potential to replace existing silicon-based materials to a large extent and open up new fields of application. In recent years, organic light-emitting diodes have emerged as state-of-the-art technology for digital screens and portable devices and are enabling new applications with flexible displays. Reticular frameworks allow the atom-precise synthesis of nanomaterials and promise to revolutionize the field by the potential to realize multifunctional nanopartides with applications from gas storage, gas separation, and electrochemical energy storage to nanomedicine. In the recent decade, significant advances in all these fields have been facilitated by the comprehensive application of simulation and machine learning for property prediction, property optimization, and chemical space exploration enabled by considerable advances in computing power and algorithmic efficiency. In this Account, we review the most recent contributions of our group in this thriving field of machine learning for material science. We start with a summary of the most important material classes our group has been involved in, focusing on small molecules as organic electronic materials and crystalline materials. Specifically, we highlight the data-driven approaches we employed to speed up discovery and derive material design strategies. Subsequently, our focus lies on the data-driven methodologies our group has developed and employed, elaborating on high-throughput virtual screening, inverse molecular design, Bayesian optimization, and supervised learning. We discuss the general ideas, their working principles, and their use cases with examples of successful implementations in data-driven material discovery and design efforts. Furthermore, we elaborate on potential pitfalls and remaining challenges of these methods. Finally, we provide a brief outlook for the field as we foresee increasing adaptation and implementation of large scale data-driven approaches in material discovery and design campaigns.","[Pollice, Robert; Gomes, Gabriel dos Passos; Aldeghi, Matteo; Hickman, Riley J.; Krenn, Mario; Lavigne, Cyrille; Lindner-D'Addario, Michael; Nigam, AkshatKumar; Ser, Cher Tian; Yao, Zhenpeng; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Chem Phys Theory Grp, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada; [Pollice, Robert; Gomes, Gabriel dos Passos; Aldeghi, Matteo; Hickman, Riley J.; Krenn, Mario; Lavigne, Cyrille; Lindner-D'Addario, Michael; Nigam, AkshatKumar; Ser, Cher Tian; Yao, Zhenpeng; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada; [Aldeghi, Matteo; Krenn, Mario; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Vector Inst Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada; [Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON M5G, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Chem Phys Theory Grp, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada.;Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada.;Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Vector Inst Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada.;Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON M5G, Canada.",aspuru@utoronto.ca,"Pollice, Robert/W-1747-2019","Pollice, Robert/0000-0001-8836-6266; dos Passos Gomes, Gabriel/0000-0002-8235-5969; Yao, Zhenpeng/0000-0001-8286-8257; Aldeghi, Matteo/0000-0003-0019-8806","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [191127]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC [PGSD3-534584-2019]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Erwin Schrodinger fellowship [J4309]; Fonds de Recherche Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology (QEII-GSST); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-FG0217ER16362]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science-Chicago [DESC0019300]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the Accelerated Molecular Discovery Program [HR00111920027]; Natural Resources Canada; Canada 150 Research Chairs program; Department of Navy award [N00014-191-2134]; Office of Naval Research; United States Government","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Erwin Schrodinger fellowship(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Fonds de Recherche Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology (QEII-GSST); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science-Chicago(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the Accelerated Molecular Discovery Program(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); Canada 150 Research Chairs program; Department of Navy award; Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); United States Government","We thank all our co-workers and collaborators who contributed to the projects highlighted in this account.

With new global projects and technological advances, the collaborative efforts of the Ocean Decade (2021-2030) are well on the way to revolutionizing our knowledge of ocean sciences and sustainability. Yet even today, over three-quarters of the seafloor is still unmapped, more than 90% of marine life still awaits discovery and classification, and the number of ocean sensors required to study global phenomena at sufficient tem-poral and spatial resolutions is seemingly intractable. To address this challenge, new approaches such as bio-inspired robotics can expand our existing toolbox and bridge this knowledge gap. The concept of biology-inspired engineering has emerged as a powerful tool to complement traditional engineering approaches to technology development. For example, specific swimming features of jellyfish and fish have been applied to a variety of fields, from vehicular propulsion to wind energy to medical diagnostics. In particular, jellyfish are advantageous model organisms because of their energy efficiency, with the lowest known cost of transport compared to other animals, as well as their ubiquity and survivability in various ocean environments. In this article we highlight the evolution of research into jellyfish-inspired robotic constructs and their potential applications in ocean exploration. After initial projects using entirely engineered materials (i.e., jellyfish -inspired submarine propellers) and tissue engineering methods (i.e., rat cardiac cells seeded on flexible films), recent work to integrate microelectronic systems onto live jelly-fish demonstrates that their swimming speeds can be increased (up to three times com-pared to their baselines) and their energy efficiency can be improved (up to four times compared to their baselines). This shows promise for the robotic control of jellyfish in real-world oceanic environments, where the animals are already distributed globally. Future work can improve the maneuverability of these bio-hybrid jellyfish robots, incor-porate miniaturized sensors to profile regions of interest, and ultimately deploy swarms of these low-power, low-cost robots to obtain high-resolution data and improve ocean climate models. The synergy of bio-inspired technologies with existing ocean measure-ment tools holds promise to push the frontiers of ocean exploration and stewardship.","[Xu, Nicole W.] US Naval Res Lab, Natl Res Council Postdoctoral Scholar, Labs Computat Phys & Fluid Dynam, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Xu, Nicole W.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dabiri, John O.] CALTECH, Grad Aerosp Labs & Mech Engn, Pasadena, CA USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research Laboratory; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; California Institute of Technology,"Xu, NW (corresponding author), US Naval Res Lab, Natl Res Council Postdoctoral Scholar, Labs Computat Phys & Fluid Dynam, Washington, DC 20375 USA.;Xu, NW (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",nicole.xu@colorado.edu; jodabiri@caltech.edu,,"Xu, Nicole/0000-0002-1649-8718",,,,,67,0,0,5,5,OCEANOGRAPHY SOC,ROCKVILLE,"P.O.

The role of urban vegetation in the carbon cycle of urban developments in these types of cities is now being studied. We focus on identifying which urban plant community types have a greater influence on CO2 flux in cities, thus providing a scientific basis for low-carbon urban greening. Based on the eddy covariance (EC) observation system, ART Footprint Tool, plant inventory, and ecological community classification, we show that the CO2 flux characteristics of different plant communities vary temporally. The carbon sink duration during summer was the longest (up to 10 h) and the carbon sink duration was the shortest during winter (7.5 h). In addition, we discovered that the CO2 flux contribution rates of different plant community types are distinct. The annual average CO2 contribution rates of the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei community and the Metasequoia glyptostroboides+Sabina chinensis community are 11.88% and 0.93%, respectively. The CO2 flux contribution rate of the same plant community differs according to season. The CO2 contribution rate of the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei community exhibits local maxima during winter and summer, with a maximum difference of 11.16%. In contrast, the Metasequoia glyptostroboides+Sabina chinensis community has a CO2 contribution rate of 0.35% during the same period. In general, summer is the season with the lowest CO2 flux contribution rate of plant communities, and winter is the season with the highest CO2 flux contribution rate. However, the Cinnamomum camphora+Salix babylonica community and the Cinnamomum camphora+Sabina chinensis community present the opposite pattern. Finally, the diurnal variation characteristics of CO2 flux in different communities have the same trend, but the peak values differ significantly. Overall, daily CO2 flux peak value of the Metasequoia glyptostroboides community and the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei community indicate that these two plant communities exhibit a strong capacity for CO2 absorption in the study area. According to these research results, urban greening efforts in subtropical climates can increase the green space covered by the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei and the Metasequoia glyptostroboides community types when urban greening, so as to appropriately reduce the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.","[Zhang, Kaidi; Fa, Hao] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Kaidi; Fa, Hao; Zhao, Min] Shanghai Normal Univ, Res Ctr Urban Ecol & Environm, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yuan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Dept Environm Sci, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yuan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry South, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Normal University; Nanjing Forestry University; Nanjing Forestry University,"Zhao, M (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Res Ctr Urban Ecol & Environm, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",zhaomin@shnu.edu.cn,,"gong, yuan/0000-0002-1338-2939",National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 31100354 and the APC was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,42,3,3,6,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2019,18,,,,,,4879,10.3390/su11184879,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11184879,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JC2KA,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000489104700065,View Full Record in Web of Science

The SPF experiences a 9 month weakening period from January to September, which shifts to a strengthening period in October. Our analysis shows that horizontal advection consistently contributes to the intensification of the SPF. After September, as the weakening effect of surface heat flux diminishes, horizontal advection becomes the dominant factor that contributes to changes in the SPF strength. Thus, the SPF enters a 3 month strengthening period. The geostrophic component of horizontal advection provides the most important contribution to strengthening the SPF, acting to intensify the SPF year-round. Ekman advection also promotes SPF strengthening with a smaller but still important contribution. During the weakening period, SPF strength is largely controlled by heat flux. The heat flux, especially the shortwave radiation component, is the primary cause of the surface front disappearance in the summer.","[Zhao, Ning; Han, Zhen] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Key Lab Sustainable Exploitat Ocean Fisheries Res, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Manda, Atsuyoshi] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci & Environm Studies, Nagasaki 852, Japan; [Han, Zhen] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Ocean University; Nagasaki University; Shanghai Ocean University,"Han, Z (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Key Lab Sustainable Exploitat Ocean Fisheries Res, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",343599711@qq.com; zhhan@shou.edu.cn,"Zhao, Ning/AAR-1486-2020; Manda, Atsuyoshi/AAH-1228-2021","Zhao, Ning/0000-0002-1878-2974; Manda, Atsuyoshi/0000-0001-7065-7751","Japan Society for Promotion for Science (JSPS) [22244057]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) [22106003]; Foundation of Key Laboratory of Integrated Monitoring and Applied Technology for Marine Harmful Algal Blooms (MATHAB) [201401]","Japan Society for Promotion for Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Foundation of Key Laboratory of Integrated Monitoring and Applied Technology for Marine Harmful Algal Blooms (MATHAB)","The authors would like to thank Y.

The objective of the mobility was twofold: on one hand, it included the strengthening of the existing scientific cooperation between the University of Cadiz (home institution) and the University of Algarve (host institution) in the field of the Gulf of Cadiz Physical Oceanography; on the other hand, it pretended to improve the teaching quality, focusing on both the lecturers and the students. Both institutions have long ties of cooperation that have recently been intensified under the umbrella of the International Campus of Marine Excellence (CeiMar). Specific objectives oriented towards the lecturers included the exchange of teaching experiences among them as well as the comparison of teaching strategies and methodologies between the host and home institutions at the Master level in order to evaluate and enhance the best teaching practices with the aim of improving the students learning process. Specific objectives oriented towards the students included: (1) to provide local students that cannot afford studying a Master degree abroad with a foreign teacher in the discipline that will offer them different added expectations; (2) to teach students different subjects from those taught at the host institution, thus benefitting from new scientific knowledge and experiences. It must be pointed out that the subject taught by the home institution lecturer represents a competence lacking at the host institution, hence complementing the program of the discipline and providing an added value to the Master degree. Informal questionnaires carried out among students by the host institution revealed that they evaluated having a foreign teacher as a very positive experience. In terms of research, collaboration among both institutions is of great importance because they are both located within the same geographic region and hence, they share common interests. The mobility promoted finishing on-going collaborative publications as well as sharing new research experiences, data and knowledge, hence leading to an improvement of the Physical Oceanography state-of-the-art in the Gulf of Cadiz. In fact, two scientific papers on the Gulf of Cadiz circulation system and two on the storm climate along the Gulf of Cadiz and its relation with coastal hazards have been recently published as a direct result of the mobility program.","[Laiz, Irene] Univ Cadiz, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Dept Appl Phys, Cadiz, Spain; [Relvas, Paulo; Garel, Erwan] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Faro, Portugal; [Plomaritis, Theocharis A.] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIMA, Faro, Portugal; [Plomaritis, Theocharis A.] Univ Cadiz, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Dept Earth Sci, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve; Universidad de Cadiz,"Laiz, I (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Dept Appl Phys, Cadiz, Spain.",,"Garel, Erwan/N-9811-2014; Plomaritis, Theocharis/C-1309-2012; Relvas, Paulo/B-1257-2008","Garel, Erwan/0000-0002-4584-9759; Relvas, Paulo/0000-0002-6404-5895",European Union; University of Cadiz,European Union(European Commission); University of Cadiz,"Both visits to the Algarve University (Faro, Portugal) were carried out under the ERASMUS+ Staff Teaching Mobility Program and were co-funded by the European Union and the University of Cadiz.",,6,2,2,0,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-608-8860-4,EDULEARN PROC,,,2016,,,,,4649,4653,,,,,,5,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BH7TE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000402955904107,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fifteen kilometres of pristine water front property needs to be protected in the most environmentally friendly way possible against the erosive forces of fluctuating tide levels and associated wave action to ensure that the islands will be developed in harmony with the Knysna Estuary environment. After thorough site trials and investigations, hexagon-at woven mesh products: Reno mattresses; gabions and Terramesh? were found to be the only alternative in achieving the onerous standards and criteria as set out in the project specifications, i.e. environmental compliance, durability under aggressive marine environments, ease of installation and vegetation establishment, and cost effectiveness. The chosen solution is able to protect each idyllic island against scour arising from inter tidal action and can also ensure the stability of the bank especially under rapid draw down conditions. As a result, the tidal flow around the islands is completely natural with excellent circulation, water quality and minimal silting. A state of the art modelling system developed by The Danish Hydraulic Institute was used to assist with the design and layout of the waterways. Hydraulic and hydrological modelling, which even accounts for climate change, should ensure that the Islands are completely safe from flooding. A bioengineering approach is being taken to the construction. Indigenous salt marsh plants are being used in conjunction with the inert materials in the inter - tidal zone. Small fish and marine life find food and shelter in the plants and natural rock along the edges of the waterways, which in turn, attract a diversity of birds and larger fish resulting in habitat improvement. The rock filled gabions provide surfaces for growth of algal - microbial films, which may contribute to nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from the tidal flow, thus reducing phytoplankton growth potential in the canals. The Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Minister Ms. R. T. Mabudahfhasi has commended the developers for the most responsible manner in which they conducted, supported and financed the environmental research, which probably represents the most comprehensive, professional and detailed Environmental Impact Assessment ever undertaken in South Africa.","[Giuliano, Laura; Wang, James] Off Maccaferri SPA, I-40123 Bologna, Italy",,"Giuliano, L (corresponding author), Off Maccaferri SPA, I-40123 Bologna, Italy.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,YELLOW RIVER CONSERVANCY PRESS,ZHENGZHOU,"CHENGDONG LU, ZHENGZHOU, HENAN 450004, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-80734-296-0,,,,2007,,,,,278,+,,,,,,2,"Ecology; Engineering, Environmental; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Engineering; Water Resources,BIO61,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000261366100038,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), use of detrital zircon U-Pb age data as source tracers for the dust has seen a huge growth and lead to breakthroughs in understanding dust provenance. However, significant ambiguities remain especially regarding the provenance of the aeolian Neogene Red Clay (RC). To address this, here we review the state of the art of understanding of Neogene RC provenance, with a focus on single-grain analyses, and introduce detrital rutile geochemistry as a tool to complement zircon U-Pb dating. Furthermore, to better utilise the link between the detrital minerals and their primary origin, we compile primary source region geologic background and single-grain data relevant for use of geochronological and metamorphic provenance proxy minerals. We discuss four major tectonic divisions in northern China and southern Mongolia: North China Craton (NCC), Tarim Craton (TC), Central China Orogen (CCO), parts of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and briefly summarize the Tibetan-Himalayan orogen. Many of these regions have been tectonically active during the same time periods in the Earth's history, and our analysis demonstrates how use of zircon age data alone has limitations in differentiating between a number of key potential dust sources to the CLP. Addition of a metamorphic source tracer such as rutile allows some of these possible source areas to be distinguished. For example, the proximal northern NCC regions that show high-/ ultrahigh-temperature metamorphic conditions can potentially be diagnostic of a northerly source component to CLP dust. Our combined zircon-rutile data analysis of ca. 4 Ma Nihewan RC in northern CLP verifies the utility of the novel rutile provenance proxy in sourcing CLP sediments. The zircon and rutile data suggest similar dust provenance: the dominant sources are proximal areas on the NCC, while contributions from the dry areas in parts of the CAOB, central deserts, and the Yellow River are also likely. Our results also hint at a minor source component deriving from distal western source regions in the TC, and/or in the central parts of the CCO, but rutile data from potential secondary source areas are needed to verify this possibility. We also conclude that multi-proxy single-grain provenance analyses are needed for more reliable provenance analyses.","[Bohm, Katja; Kaakinen, Anu] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 64, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Bohm, Katja; Stevens, Thomas] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Lahaye, Yann; O'Brien, Hugh] Geol Survey Finland, POB 96, Espoo 02151, Finland; [Zhang, Zhaoqun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origin, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhaoqun] CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhaoqun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of Helsinki; Uppsala University; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology & Paleoanthropology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bohm, K (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 64, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",katja.bohm@helsinki.fi,,"Bohm, Katja/0000-0002-0122-1927",Academy of Finland [316799]; Swedish Research Council [2017-03888]; STINT-NSFC mobility grant [CH2020-8688]; Ministry of Science and Technology grant [2014FY110300]; Nordenskiold-foundation; GeoDoc,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); STINT-NSFC mobility grant; Ministry of Science and Technology grant; Nordenskiold-foundation; GeoDoc,"We thank Editor Asfawossen Asrat and three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments, which significantly improved this paper.

Its presence may cause stress and discomfort to people inhabiting or working the infested areas. In addition, it may cause damage to organic materials, contaminate food and carry microbes. This paper summarizes the available data on its spreading and current distribution of species in Europe and displayed the species is present throughout the continent including Scandinavia. This northward shift of C. longicaudatum might be explained by use of the insulation and central heating to provide optimal climate for the species to establish. The paper also contains updates on the current status of C. longicaudatum in Czechia, United Kingdom, and Ireland, where its first populations were recently detected. Based on the collected data, the spread in the monitored countries continues rapidly, when the domestic settings were the main habitat. Furthermore, the species is often present in accommodation facilities, warehouses, factories, public institutions, shopping malls, archives, museums, and art galleries. Therefore, the study indicates the species may occur everywhere indoors. The paper also highlights an urgent need for establishment of effective pest management strategy and preventive measures. Synanthropic invasive silverfish, Ctenolepisma longicaudatum, has been recently reported to cause nuisance in the indoor environment in many European countries. To get more details on the species distribution, the species occurrence was monitored by the authors in the countries where establishment of C. longicaudatum has been revealed in the last years. In Czechia, 20 findings from 14 municipalities in eight regions were recorded within the last three years. In the United Kingdom, 49 cases, including the first occurrence in Scotland, were recorded. Five cases were recorded for the Republic of Ireland. Domestic settings were the main habitat in the study countries (50.0% for the Czechia and Ireland and 36.8% for the United Kingdom). Regarding C. longicaudatum control, the standard silverfish strategy fails, and the use of insecticidal baits complemented by dust insecticides was suggested as the most promising approach. To reveal presence of C. longicaudatum in Europe, the search of literature, social platforms and databases on invasive species was conducted. According to these sources, the species is known from majority of European countries, when the high increase of records in recent decade was detected.","[Kulma, Martin; Bubova, Terezie] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Natl Reference Lab Vector Control, Srobarova 49-48, Prague 10000, Czech Republic; [Kulma, Martin; Patoka, Jiri] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Zool & Fisheries, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Davies, Matthew Paul] Killgerm Chem Ltd, Wakefield Rd, Ossett WF5 9AJ, England; [Boiocchi, Federica] Univ Milan, Dept Food Environm & Nutrit Sci DeFENS, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy",National Institute of Public Health (SZU) - Czech Republic; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of Milan,"Kulma, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Natl Reference Lab Vector Control, Srobarova 49-48, Prague 10000, Czech Republic.;Kulma, M (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Zool & Fisheries, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",martin.kulma@szu.cz; terezie.bubova@szu.cz; matthew.davies@killgerm.com; federica.boiocchi@unimi.it; patoka@af.czu.cz,"Kulma, Martin/M-1307-2018; Patoka, Jiri/D-5086-2015","Kulma, Martin/0000-0002-3430-1392; Patoka, Jiri/0000-0002-2797-0563","Ministry of Health CZ-DRO (National Institute of Public Health, NIPH) [75010330]; Technology Agency of the Czech Republic within the project DivLand [SS02030018]","Ministry of Health CZ-DRO (National Institute of Public Health, NIPH); Technology Agency of the Czech Republic within the project DivLand","MK and TB were supported by the Ministry of Health CZ-DRO (National Institute of Public Health, NIPH, 75010330) for its financial support.

Sulfate is a major component of fine haze particles. Record sulfate concentrations of up to similar to 300 mu g m(-3) were observed during the January 2013 winter haze event in Beijing. State-of-the-art air quality models that rely on sulfate production mechanisms requiring photochemical oxidants cannot predict these high levels because of the weak photochemistry activity during haze events. We find that the missing source of sulfate and particulate matter can be explained by reactive nitrogen chemistry in aerosol water. The aerosol water serves as a reactor, where the alkaline aerosol components trap SO2, which is oxidized by NO2 to form sulfate, whereby high reaction rates are sustained by the high neutralizing capacity of the atmosphere in northern China. This mechanism is self-amplifying because higher aerosol mass concentration corresponds to higher aerosol water content, leading to faster sulfate production and more severe haze pollution.","[Cheng, Yafang; Zheng, Guangjie; Wei, Chao; Mu, Qing; Wang, Zhibin; Poschl, Ulrich; Su, Hang] Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Zheng, Guangjie; Zheng, Bo; He, Kebin] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Gao, Meng; Carmichael, Gregory] Univ Iowa, Coll Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Gao, Meng; Carmichael, Gregory] Univ Iowa, Ctr Global & Reg Environm Res, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Zhang, Qiang] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Su, Hang] Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou 511443, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Max Planck Society; Tsinghua University; University of Iowa; University of Iowa; Tsinghua University; Jinan University,"Cheng, YF; Poschl, U; Su, H (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.;He, KB (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Su, H (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou 511443, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yafang.cheng@mpic.de; hekb@tsinghua.edu.cn; u.poschl@mpic.de; h.su@mpic.de,"wei, chao/D-3794-2014; Zhang, Qiang/D-9034-2012; Zheng, Bo/X-1616-2018; Pöschl, Ulrich/A-6263-2010; He, Kebin/ABF-5224-2020; GAO, Meng/AAL-6653-2021; ZHENG, GUANGJIE/AAY-3894-2020; wei, chao/E-4379-2011; Su, Hang/A-6226-2010; Cheng, Yafang/F-9362-2010; Wang, Zhibin/K-7365-2013","Zheng, Bo/0000-0001-8344-3445; Pöschl, Ulrich/0000-0003-1412-3557; ZHENG, GUANGJIE/0000-0002-8103-2594; Su, Hang/0000-0003-4889-1669; Cheng, Yafang/0000-0003-4912-9879; ","Max Planck Society (MPG); National Natural Science Foundation of China [21107061, 21190054]; EU [603445, 265148]; Chinese Scholarship Council",Max Planck Society (MPG)(Max Planck Society); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); EU(European Commission); Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by the Max Planck Society (MPG), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21107061, 21190054) and the EU project BACCHUS (603445) and PEGASOS (265148).

We further quantified the influence of explanatory variables on the spatiotemporal dynamics of continental forest cover. Deep learning greatly outperformed a state-of-the-art spatial-econometric model at continental, state, and grid-cell scales. For example, at the continental scale, compared to the spatial-econometric model, the deep learning model improved projection performance by 44% (root-mean-square error) and 12% (pseudo R-squared). The results illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the LSTM model.

The results from a series of paleobathymetry sensitivity experiments indicate that, despite paleogeographic and paleobathymetric uncertainty, appropriate use of global paleotidal models complements and enhances stratigraphic and sedimentological methods. Before being applied to global paleotidal modeling, the Imperial College Ocean Model (ICOM) is validated for the computation of modern global tides. The ICOM results only deviate slightly from a state-of-the-art published model and were achieved with considerably less computational expense and without data assimilation. The results from global paleotidal modeling of the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) were assessed by comparison with the published geological record. ICOM predicts high mesotidal to macrotidal ranges on the Arabian Platform, around India (especially to the north and west), along the Pacific coast between North and South America, northeast of Australia, and around Southeast Asia. The model predicts low microtidal ranges in the proto-South Atlantic Ocean and Weddell Sea. A further validation test assessed the ability of the model to predict the dominant tidal constituents (diurnal or semidiurnal) in the Aptian Lower Greensand Seaway of southeastern England and Northern France. During the Aptian this region was connected to the Boreal, Proto-Atlantic, and Neotethys oceans and now preserves superbly documented tidal deposits. The model predicts low microtidal ranges in the proto-Central Atlantic Ocean and Boreal Ocean, suggesting that they had little impact on tides in the Lower Greensand Seaway. Higher tidal amplitudes, especially of diurnal (once-daily) tides, are predicted in the northwestern Neotethys Ocean, suggesting that this ocean was an important source of tidal energy to the Lower Greensand Seaway. Sensitivity tests to paleogeographic and paleobathymetric uncertainty indicate that the model predictions are robust. The prediction of predominantly diurnal tides is supported by published analyses of large dune-scale deposits in the Lower Greensand of southeast England.","[Wells, Martin R.; Allison, Peter A.; Piggott, Matthew D.; Hampson, Gary J.; Pain, Christopher C.; Gorman, Gerard J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Wells, MR (corresponding author), BP Explorat & Prod, Chertsey Rd, Sunbury On Thames TW16 7LN, Middx, England.",martin.r.wells@googlemail.com,"Gorman, Gerard J/I-6702-2013; Hampson, Gary/C-1488-2009; Allison, Peter/D-1916-2009","Gorman, Gerard J/0000-0003-0563-3678; Hampson, Gary/0000-0003-2047-8469; Allison, Peter/0000-0002-4997-5314; Pain, Christopher/0000-0003-4194-2590","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NER/S/A/2004/12140, NE/C52101X/1]; Imperial College's Grantham Institute for Climate Change; Leverhulme Trust [F107 058/AB]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C52101X/1, NE/C521036/1, NE/C521028/2] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/C521028/2] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Imperial College's Grantham Institute for Climate Change; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We would like to thank Howard Johnson for inspiration and Paul Markwick for paleogeographic maps.

The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of using this update instead of the previous version: ReCiPe 2008. Do the absolute outcomes change significantly and if so, does this lead to different conclusions and result-based recommendations? Methods Life cycle assessments (LCAs) were conducted for 152 foods for which cradle-to-plate inventories were available and that together are estimated to account for 80% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, land use and fossil resource depletion of food consumption in the Netherlands. The LCIA was performed on midpoint and endpoint level, with both ReCiPe 2008 and 2016, and using the three perspectives provided by ReCiPe. Both the uses of the global-average characterisation factors (CFs) and the Dutch-specific CFs were explored. Results and discussion Results showed a strong correlation between LCAs performed with ReCiPe 2008 and with 2016 on midpoint and endpoint level, with Spearman's rank correlation between 0.85 and 0.99. Ranking of foods related to their overall environmental impact did not differ significantly between methods when using the default hierarchist perspective. Differences on endpoint level were largest when using the individualist perspective. The predicted average absolute impact of the foods studied did change significantly when using the new ReCiPe, regardless of which perspective was used: a larger impact was found for climate change, freshwater eutrophication and water consumption and a lower impact for acidification and land use. The use of Dutch CFs in ReCiPe 2016 leads to significant differences in LCA results compared with the use of the global-average CFs. When looking at the average Dutch diet, ReCiPe 2016 predicted a larger impact from greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater eutrophication, and a lower impact from acidification and land use than ReCiPe 2008. Conclusions The update of ReCiPe leads to other LCIA results but to comparable conclusions on hotspots and ranking of food product consumption in the Netherlands. Looking at the changes per product due to the update, we recommend updating endpoint-level LCAs conducted with ReCiPe 2008, especially for products that emit large amounts of PM2.5 or consume large amounts of water within their life cycle. As new and updated methods reflect the scientific state of art better and therefore include less model uncertainty, we recommend to always use the most recent and up-to-date methodology in new LCAs.","[Dekker, Erik; van Zelm, Rosalie] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Environm Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Dekker, Erik; Zijp, Michiel C.; van de Kamp, Mirjam E.; Temme, Elisabeth H.

The thermo-hydro-mechanical processes are strongly coupled and complex to describe in those intrinsic multi-phase systems. So far, thermal models often utilize the local thermal equilibrium approach, assuming that all three phases (solid rock or soil, liquid water and ice) are in thermal equilibrium. While this approach is very tempting due to its easy implementation, there are situations especially during thawing in which temperature gradients exist between the involved phases. In such cases, the local thermal equilibrium approach has to be replaced by the more complex local thermal non-equilibrium approach in which the thermodynamic state of each phase is described by its own temperature. In those models, the heat transfer between the phases is described explicitly in dependence of the heat transfer coefficient and the contact area. Parameterization of the heat transfer coefficient is a challenging task and mostly relies on empirical values and relationships. Most models using the local thermal non-equilibrium approach utilize a constant heat transfer coefficient. However, experiments under geothermal temperature conditions prove that the heat transfer coefficient depends, among others, on flow velocity. This is of special interest as strong dynamics are characteristic for thawing system which impose a unique challenge to heat transfer models. For example, the volume fraction of the liquid domain increases significantly during thawing of rock-ice systems due to the melting of the ice phase. This again, directly influences flow velocity. In this work, the possible effect of a velocity dependent heat transfer coefficient on thawing rock-water-ice systems is investigated. With higher flow velocity, advection effects of the intruding fluid become more significant but also heat transfer is increased. When the intruding liquid water is colder than the surrounding rock, the melting rate is maximum for a specific flow velocity, as advection of cold water and heating from the rock counteract. While this is a purely synthetic study and no experimental data yet exists for validation of the proposed scheme, this study indicates the existence of a way more complex interaction between liquid fluid flow and melting processes as previously expected and way beyond state-of-the-art modeling.","[Heinze, Thomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic; [Heinze, Thomas] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geol Mineral & Geophys, Hydrogeol Dept, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Ruhr University Bochum,"Heinze, T (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geol Mineral & Geophys, Hydrogeol Dept, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",thomas.heinze@rub.de,"Heinze, Thomas/AAF-4844-2019","Heinze, Thomas/0000-0002-2139-2520",European Union [CZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/16_027/0008366]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [HE 8194/2-1],European Union(European Commission); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The research project was financially supported by the European Union, managing authority the Czech Operational Program Research, Development and Education, project no.

Many of the important challenges of the next decade lie at the intersection of the natural environment, human decision making and the design of space technology to inform decision making. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations through 2030. Several of these Sustainable Development Goals can be addressed by asking: 1) What is happening in the natural environment? 2) How will humans be impacted by what is happening in the natural environment? 3) What decisions are humans making in response to environmental factors and why? and 4) What technology system can be designed to provide high quality information that supports human decision making') The answers to these questions are often interrelated in complex ways; thus it is helpful to use a framework from complex systems to integrate these questions. Within the list of Sustainable Development Goals, several fit the three questions above, including #2 Zero Hunger, #6 Clean Water and Sanitation, #13 Climate Action, #14 Life Below Water, and #15 Life on Land. This paper presents a research agenda to apply environmental modeling, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering to inform the design of space systems in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. This work builds on previous research in the following areas: 1) physics-based environmental modeling; 2) complex systems modeling to simulate human decision making using agent-based models; and 3) model based systems engineering to inform the architecture of satellites or space-enabled data systems. This paper presents a review of the state of the art, shows examples of how these methods have been combined to inform space system design and presents a future research agenda. As an example, the paper discusses a project related to Sustainable Development Goal #15 to design an earth observation system using space-based and ground-based data collection regarding an invasive plant species in Benin, West Africa. In this example, insights are needed regarding natural variables (i.e. salinity, temperature and turbidity of local waterways), social variables (i.e. economic impact of the invasive plant on local communities), and design variables (i.e. the technical performance of existing imagery satellites and in-situ sensor networks).","[Reid, Jack; Zeng, Cynthia; Wood, Danielle] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Reid, J (corresponding author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jackreid@mit.edu; cynthia.zeng@outlook.com; drwood@media.mit.edu,,,,,,,70,1,1,0,14,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1095-323X,,978-1-5386-6854-2,AEROSP CONF PROC,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,13,"Engineering, Aerospace",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BN4AI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000481648200059,View Full Record in Web of Science

With ever-increasing human pressure on ecosystems, it is critically important to predict how ecosystem functions will respond to such human-induced perturbations. We define perturbations as either changes to abiotic environment (e.g. eutrophication, climate change) that indirectly affects biota, or direct changes to biota (e.g. species introductions). While two lines of research in ecology, biodiversity-ecosystem function (BDEF) and ecological resilience (ER) research, have addressed this issue, both fields of research have nontrivial shortcomings in their abilities to address a wide range of realistic scenarios. 2. We outline how an integrated research framework may foster a deeper understanding of the functional consequences of perturbations via simultaneous application of (i) process-based mechanistic predictions using trait-based approaches and (ii) detection of empirical patterns of functional changes along real perturbation gradients. In this context, the complexities of ecological interactions and evolutionary perspectives should be integrated into future research. 3. Synthesis and applications. Management of human-impacted ecosystems can be guided most directly by understanding the response of ecosystem functions to controllable perturbations. In particular, we need to characterize the form of a wide range of perturbation-function relationships and to draw connections between those patterns and the underlying ecological processes. We anticipate that the integrated perspectives will also be helpful for managers to derive practical implications for management from academic literature.","[Tomimatsu, Hiroshi; Sasaki, Takehiro; Kurokawa, Hiroko; Kawata, Masakado; Nakashizuka, Tohru; Urabe, Jotaro] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Bridle, Jon R.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UD, Avon, England; [Fontaine, Colin] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CERSP UMR 7204, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kitano, Jun] Natl Inst Genet, Ecol Genet Lab, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Stouffer, Daniel B.] CSIC, EBD, Integrat Ecol Grp, Seville 41092, Spain; [Stouffer, Daniel B.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Vellend, Mark] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Bezemer, T.

Iron is a key driver of plankton dynamics and, therefore, of global biogeochemical cycles and climate. To assess the impact of iron availability on plankton communities, we explored the comprehensive bio-oceanographic and bio-omics data sets from Tara Oceans in the context of the iron products from two state-of-the-art global scale biogeochemical models. We obtained novel information about adaptation and acclimation toward iron in a range of phytoplankton, including picocyanobacteria and diatoms, and identified whole subcommunities covarying with iron. Many of the observed global patterns were recapitulated in the Marquesas archipelago, where frequent plankton blooms are believed to be caused by natural iron fertilization, although they are not captured in large-scale biogeochemical models. This work provides a proof of concept that integrative analyses, spanning from genes to ecosystems and viruses to zooplankton, can disentangle the complexity of plankton communities and can lead to more accurate formulations of resource bioavailability in biogeochemical models, thus improving our understanding of plankton resilience in a changing environment. Plain Language Summary Marine phytoplankton require iron for their growth and proliferation. According to John Martin's iron hypothesis, fertilizing the ocean with iron could dramatically increase photosynthetic activity, thus representing a biological means to counteract global warming. However, while there is a constantly growing knowledge of how iron is distributed in the ocean and about its role in cellular processes in marine photosynthetic groups such as diatoms and cyanobacteria, less is known about how iron availability shapes plankton communities and how they respond to it. In the present work, we exploited recently published Tara Oceans data sets to address these questions. We first defined specific subcommunities of co-occurring organisms that co-vary with iron availability in the oceans. We then identified specific patterns of adaptation and acclimation to iron in different groups of phytoplankton. Finally, we validated our global results at local scale, specifically in the Marquesas archipelago, where recurrent phytoplankton blooms arc believed to be a result of iron fertilization. By integrating global data with a localized response, we provide a framework for understanding the resilience of plankton ecosystems in a changing environment.","[Caputi, Luigi; Scalco, Eleonora; Brunet, Christophe; Busseni, Greta; D'Aniello, Salvatore; Kokoszka, Florian; Lejeusne, Christophe; Maillet, Nicolas; Mazzocchi, Maria Grazia; Sanges, Remo; Sordino, Paolo; Zingone, Adriana; d'Alcala, Maurizio Ribera; Iudicone, Daniele] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy; [Carradec, Quentin; Pelletier, Eric; Alberti, Adriana; Aury, Jean-Marc; Bertrand, Alexis; Madoui, Mohammed-Amin; Neou, Mario B.; Poulain, Julie; Wincker, Patrick; Jaillon, Olivier; Weissenbach, Jean] CEA, Genoscope, Inst Francois Jacob, Evry, France; [Carradec, Quentin; Pelletier, Eric; Da Silva, Corinne; Madoui, Mohammed-Amin; Neou, Mario B.; Wincker, Patrick; Jaillon, Olivier; Weissenbach, Jean] CNRS UMR, Evry, France; [Carradec, Quentin; Pelletier, Eric; Madoui, Mohammed-Amin; Neou, Mario B.; Wincker, Patrick; Weissenbach, Jean] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Evry, France; [Carradec, Quentin; Eveillard, Damien; Pelletier, Eric; Karlusich, Juan J.

In this study, the influence of the offshore current regime on surface gravity waves on the southwest Western Australian (SWWA) continental shelf was examined. This was achieved by coupling the three dimensional, free surface, terrain-following hydrodynamic Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) and the third generation wave model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) using the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-WaveSediment Transport (COAWST) model. Different representative states of the Leeuwin Current (LC), a strong pole-ward flowing boundary current with a persistent eddy field along the SWWA shelf edge were simulated and used to investigate their influence on different large wave events. The coupled wave-current simulations were compared to wave only simulations, which represented scenarios in the absence of a background current field. Results showed that the LC and the eddy field significantly impact SWWA waves. Significant wave heights increased (decreased) when currents were opposing (aligning with) the incoming wave directions. During a fully developed LC system significant wave heights were altered by up to 25% and wave directions by up to 20 degrees. The change in wave direction indicates that the LC may modify nearshore wave dynamics and consequently alter sediment patterns. Operational regional wave forecasts and hindcasts may give flawed predictions if wave-current interaction is not properly accounted for. Plain language Summary The knowledge of regional wave climates is critical for coastal zone planning, protection, and management. Large-scale currents are known to alter wave conditions, however, minimal consideration has been given to the effect of offshore currents on the southwest Western Australian wave regime. The Western Australian offshore circulation is dominated by the Leeuwin Current (LC). The LC is a strong eastern boundary current that carries warm, low salinity water and features a large mesoscale eddy field. The LC is unique as it is the only pole-ward flowing eastern boundary current in the world. Using state-of-the-art numerical models, for the first time, the influence of the LC on Western Australian waves was studied and quantified. Wave heights increased (decreased) by 25% when currents were opposing (aligning with) incoming waves and wave directions changed by up to 20 degrees. Changes in offshore wave height and direction may modify nearshore dynamics and consequently alter sediment patterns along the Western Australian coast. Operational wave simulations may give flawed predictions if wave-current interaction is not properly accounted for.","[Wandres, Moritz; Wijeratne, E. M.

The OFNP creatively combines state-of-the-art Light Water Reactors (LWRs) with floating platforms such as those used in offshore oil/gas operations, both of which are well-established technologies which can allow implementation on a time scale consistent with combating climate change in the near future. OFNP is a plant that can be entirely built within a floating platform in a shipyard, transferred to the site. OFNP eliminates earthquakes and tsunamis as accident precursors; its ocean-based passive safety systems eliminate the loss of ultimate heat sink accident by design. The defense of an OFNP poses new security opportunities and challenges compared to land-based plants. Such a plant can be more easily defended by virtue of the clear 360 degree lines of sight and the relative ease of identifying surface threats. Conversely the offshore plant is potentially vulnerable to underwater approaches by mini-submarines and divers. We investigate security considerations of the OFNP applicable to two potential plant options, an OFNP-300 with a 300 MWe reactor, and an OFNP-1100 with an 1100 MWe reactor. Three innovative security system approaches could be combined for the offshore plant. The first is a comprehensive detection system which integrates radar, sonar and unmanned vehicles for a long distance overview of the vicinity of the plant. The second approach is the use of passive physical barriers about 100 meters from the plant, which will force a fast-moving power boat to lose speed or stop at the barrier allowing the plant security force more time to respond. The third approach takes advantage of the offshore plant siting and the monthly or biweekly rotation of crew to reduce the total on-plant and onshore security force by using the off-duty security force on the plant as a reserve force. Through the use of these approaches, the OFNP-300 should be able to achieve a similar security cost (on a per Megawatt basis) as land-based plants of similar or somewhat larger power rating. Due to non-linear scaling of cost, the security cost of the OFNP-1100 has the potential to be reduced significantly compared to its land-based equivalents.","[Kindfuller, Vincent; Todreas, Neil; Buongiorno, Jacopo; Golay, Michael] MIT, Dept Nucl Sci & Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Birch, Arthur; Isdanovich, Thomas; Thomas, Ron] ECSI Int Inc, Clifton, NY 07012 USA; [Stevens, Harvey] Stevens Associates Inc, Red Bank, NJ 07701 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Kindfuller, V (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Nucl Sci & Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vjk@mit.edu,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,6,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-5005-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,UNSP V005T15A076,,,,,16,"Engineering, Mechanical; Nuclear Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Nuclear Science & Technology,BG2AZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000387191000076,View Full Record in Web of Science

One approach has to been to outline a set of high-leverage practices, defined as teaching moves that are research-based, have the potential to improve student achievement, and support students in learning central academic concepts. But which practices qualify as  high leverage, and based on what criteria? This article raises several issues involved in identifying high-leverage teaching practices based on their relationships with different types of student outcome measures. Purpose: The study addresses the following research questions: What practices are associated with student achievement gains on high-and low-stakes assessments? How do teachers use these teaching practices in their classrooms? Population: Participants in this study were 103 fourth grade teachers from a single district who volunteered to have their classroom instruction recorded as part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) project. Research Design: The research involved analysis of multiple data sources: video records of practice, qualitative observation notes, quantitative measures of math teaching, and student outcomes on two math assessments, one high stakes comprised entirely of multiple-choice questions and the other low stakes and focused on open-ended problem solving. Data Analysis: A standardized observation tool designed to code language arts instruction, PLATO, was modified for reliable scoring of math teaching. More than 300 math lessons were scored using four PLATO scales. Logistic regressions were used to look at relationships between PLATO scores and teacher value-added measures computed from high-and low-stakes student assessments. A stratified, purposive sample of lessons was analyzed qualitatively. Findings/Results: Scores on two practices, modeling and procedural strategy instruction, predicted value-added based on the high-stakes state test, but had no relationship with value-added on the low-stakes test. Qualitative analyses demonstrate instruction was explicitly oriented toward success on the state test. Teachers taught test-taking strategies and modeled how to eliminate silly answers listed in multiple-choice format. Two other practices, orchestrating classroom discourse and conceptual strategy instruction, had no relationship with value-added on either test. Scores on these two scales were positively skewed, with very few instances of high-scoring instruction. Conclusions/Recommendations: Discussion focuses on potential limitations of labeling teaching practices as high leverage based on their relationship with high-stakes standardized assessments and the importance of sampling teachers with a full range of enactment of high-leverage practices.","Univ Virginia, Curriculum Instruct & Special Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Cohen, J (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Curriculum Instruct & Special Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,,National Academy of Education; Spencer Foundation; Stanford University,National Academy of Education; Spencer Foundation; Stanford University(Stanford University),"Thanks to Pam Grossman, Hilda Borko, Rich Shavelson, Susanna Loeb, Matt Kloser, and Judy Hicks for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this article, as well as Lyn Corno and two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful feedback.

This trend will decrease the ecosystems' capacity to supply ecosystem services (ES) and threaten human wellbeing. Therefore, it is key to establish greening policies in urbanising areas, which are essential to improve the liveability of cities. Restoring and developing green and blue infrastructures using nature-based solutions is vital to improving urban biodiversity and urban ecosystems. Healthy urban ecosystems have a high capacity to supply regulating (e.g., air, noise, climate and water regulation), provisioning (e.g., food, medicinal plants, biomass) and cultural (e.g., recreation, landscape aesthetics, social cohesion) ES. This multifunctionality can provide diverse environmental, social and economic benefits to urban residents, hence contributing to the sustainability of urban areas. However, urban green and blue areas are also associated with ecosystem disservices (e.g., plant allergies or poisoning, emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, unpleasant smells), tradeoffs (e.g., increased water consumption, wildfire risk, associated management costs) and implementation barriers (e.g., political motivation, lack of knowledge, time and workload).

But yet, people learn new facts and task from only a few exemplars, often falling back on their previous experience and things they know about the world. This world knowledge is common sense: rarely-stated basic facts that provide the glue holding linguistic models together. Crowdsourcing common sense training data was born twenty years ago. It began with the idea to harness the power of bored people on the Internet to collect what everyone knows but no one writes down. This was an era when we were all just starting to learn how to search the web, before people learned the dismal art of keywords, when we tried simply typing our wants and needs. Search engineswerewoefully unequipped for these kinds of queries, and it was in that climate that we started ConceptNet, which we originally called OpenMind CommonSense (OMCS)[14]. We believe that structured knowledge like ConceptNet can enrich modern models such as transformers to provide better performance, decrease the amount of data needed to train these models, and help make these models more explainable. There has been work in this area since we began working with embeddings[7], but the effort matured with techniques like retrofitting[5, 13], which merge structured knowledge base with non-contextual embeddings. These techniques advanced many downstream tasks important to NLP[10]. They also provided a backbone for better domain specialization and fine-tuning and helped bring these techniques into the the commercial world [15]. We have seen very recent advances allowing for the addition of common sense to contextual transformers [4, 16]. It seems likely that these models are learning and encapsulating structured data[9] including semantic data. We also explore new efforts to extract common sense information[6] as a way of coevolving structured knowledge bases with transformers. But common sense sense is not just the semantic and emotional knowledge [12, 17] we have been collecting in ConceptNet. It has implications for cross-lingual reasoning[1] (notably in low-resourced languages), explainability, computational creativity [8] and advancing work in AI model bias[2]. How does common sense need to evolve as we tackle larger and more complex and cross-domain problems?","[Havasi, Catherine] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Havasi, C (corresponding author), MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",havasi@media.mit.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-7008-0,,,,2019,,,,,3,4,,10.1145/3360901.3364450,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3360901.3364450,,,2,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BO8US,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000529404300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

CCU is experiencing the same retention issues in math and science that have been documented nationally in STEM disciplines in the United States. The First-year Experience (FYE) course in The College of Natural and Applied Science introduces technology in the classroom in FYE (a 3-credit course focusing on creative and critical thinking). Through the building and deployment of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) students are introduced to STEM disciplines. The curriculum is designed to engage freshmen in an applied and investigative project guided by the scientific method to identify an interdisciplinary problem: connecting the touchstone of experiential learning; a hands-on experience actively engages students in experimental design, application and problem solving. Student initiated applications in the past have included: incorporation of data logging sensors, marine archeology exploration, navigating an obstacle course, spatially relevant physical sampling and analysis, and innovation through aesthetics developing pride of ownership. The program provides a foundation for the earlier exploration of the scope and breadth of STEM disciplines targeting increased student engagement and retention in the sciences. Creating a climate and culture in the College of Natural and Applied Sciences that supports student success through enlisting technology and interdisciplinary teams is one of the primary goals of the program. By working with faculty, peer leaders (upperclassmen), and technicians in the Center for Marine and Wetland Studies teams of four students engage in a semester long project focused on a technical mission through experiential learning. The National Society for Experiential Education (NSEE) has eight core principles for best practices in experiential education that are incorporated to the ROV experience at Coastal Carolina University. The ROV program seeks to integrate all eight of these principles into the first-year students' learning experience as it relates to science and the study of science through post secondary education. Being incorporated into the University's First Year Experience Course the initiative is a large-scale effort to engage large numbers students at the earliest possible stage of the university career to explore, pursue, connect with and succeed in critical STEM disciplines. This is accomplished through both individual development and experience and facilitating connection and engagement with University resources and diverse and active professionals.","[O'Brien-Gayes, Agatha A.; Scribner, Lorna C.; Burroughs, Ben; Gayes, Paul T.] Coastal Carolina Univ, Conway, SC USA",Coastal Carolina University,,aobrieng@coastal.edu; lcscribn@g.coastal.edu; ben@coastal.edu; ptgayes@coastal.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-615-5563-5,INTED PROC,,,2012,,,,,6172,6176,,,,,,5,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BHQ76,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000326396406018,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this review, we explore the fundamental aspects underpinning solid CO2 sorbents based on alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides operating at medium to high temperature: how their structure, chemical composition, and morphology impact their performance and long-term use. Various optimization strategies are outlined to improve upon the most promising materials, and we combine recent advances across disparate scientific disciplines, including materials discovery, synthesis, and in situ characterization, to present a coherent understanding of the mechanisms of CO2 absorption both at surfaces and within solid materials.","[Dunstan, Matthew T.; Grey, Clare P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Donat, Felix; Bork, Alexander H.; Mueller, Christoph R.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Energy Sci & Engn, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Cambridge; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Muller, CR (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Energy Sci & Engn, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",muelchri@ethz.ch,"Donat, Felix/R-8528-2017; Müller, Christoph R/J-6025-2016; Grey, Clare/Q-8860-2017","Donat, Felix/0000-0002-3940-9183; Müller, Christoph R/0000-0003-2234-6902; Dunstan, Matthew/0000-0002-6319-4231; Bork, Alexander Hansen/0000-0003-4513-9682; Grey, Clare/0000-0001-5572-192X","Clare College, Cambridge; Royal Society [RP \R1\180147]; Swiss Federal Office of Energy [SI/501550-01]; European Commission [691712]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [819573]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200020_156015]; Swiss National Science Foundation","Clare College, Cambridge; Royal Society(Royal Society of London); Swiss Federal Office of Energy; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission)","M.T.D acknowledges support from Clare College, Cambridge via a Junior Research Fellowship.

Since wind power is not fully dispatchable, the accuracy of wind forecasts is a key element for the electric system operators, as it strongly affects the decision-making processes. The planning horizon can be short term (1 -3 months) and long-term (6-12 months) depending on the process. The objective of this paper is to conduct a performance comparison of five deep learning models each combined with three types of data pre-processing and used for short term and long-term multi-variate predictions. The input data are time series of the wind power capacity factor and the temperature. In addition, this paper sets out to demonstrate and review the state-of-the-art deep learning models for prediction with a secondary objective to present the reader a reference point to better understand which model to choose and what factors are significant. The first contribution of this paper is to apply, assess and compare a selection of the novel and cutting-edge deep learning models for multi-variate prediction. Multi-variate predication is achieved through a proposed multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) architecture. Compared to traditional prediction models, machine learning techniques have the advantage of generalization. Among various techniques deep learning is particularly getting more attention due to the applicability to various dataset such as numerical and character. This investigation focuses on five models - Deep Feed Forward (DFF), Deep Convolutional Network (DCN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Attention mechanism (Attention) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). The second contribution is to propose a novel approach to transform the time series dataset to signal for input and reconstruct the model predictions through inverse transformation, by means of the so-called discrete wavelet transformation and fast Fourier transformation. The different models are assessed also by comparing their performance with and without the input dataset manipulation through wavelet and FFT transformation. Beyond that, the model performances are outlined in detail, to give the reader an overview of the models to choose from for short-term or long-term prediction. The results demonstrate that the Attention and DCN perform best with Wavelet or FFT signal, whereas some other models perform better with no data preprocessing.

J,"Eufrasia, M",,,,"Eufrasia, Miguel",,,At the Crossroads of Sustainability: The Natural Recompositioning of Architecture,ARCHITECTURE_MPS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It is widely acknowledged that the mantra of sustainability has triggered a fundamental reversal in the core of design practice: If the original purpose of architecture was to protect humans from the destructive actions of nature, today it should protect nature from the damaging actions of humans. But sustainable design is far from being a coherent body of fully totalized ideas: it has a broad spectrum of disputing interpretations that oscillate between the deterministic models of energy control and technological efficiencies, and the moralistic and romantic approaches that attempt to see in nature and natural processes a fundamental way to dc-escalate the global urban footprint and its associated patterns of consumption. However, mainstream green design has been evolving by progressively absorbing the narrative of deep ecology. Nature has been being integrated into architecture literally, by inserting vegetation onto buildings; digitally, by bringing environmental data into the design process (climate records, wind streams, sun rotation and air flows are computed, modelled and effectually shape architectures), and transcendentally, by claiming that sustainable architecture nurtures the existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness. The acknowledgement of the inexorable affiliation between architecture and the environment is, of course, not exactly new. What is distinctive today is the reification of the role of nature in architecture as an ideological stance, now totally intertwined with state-of-art data processing and the market-driven tools brought by Natural Capitalism. This paper will examine emblematic green buildings produced by leading architects such as Pelli Clarke Pelli, William McDonough, Stefano Boeri, Norman Foster and BIG in the light of Tim Morton's, Slavoj Zizek and Bruno Latour's critique of nature. It will illustrate how, despite being able to successfully forge new creative freedoms by exploring hybridizations between the domains of design and science, sustainability's self-righteous naturalistic narrative is enabling a vision of the architect as an expert manager focused on producing projects of ecologic beautification while assumed to be saving the world, effectively depoliticizing the architectural practice. Nevertheless, these examples attest that there is a vast and fertile field of ideas to be explored and in this regard it is important to underline that we are still in the embryonic outset of the engagement of architecture with sustainability.","[Eufrasia, Miguel] Univ Coimbra, DARQ, Dept Arquitecutura, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Eufrasia, M (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, DARQ, Dept Arquitecutura, Coimbra, Portugal.",meufrasia@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,0,0,4,6,UCL PRESS,LONDON,"UNIV COLLEGE LONDON, GOWER ST, LONDON, WC1E 6 BT, ENGLAND",,2050-9006,,AMPS,Architecture_MPS,OCT,2018,2,,,,,,,10.14324/111.444.amps.2018v14i2.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.14324/111.444.amps.2018v14i2.001,,,23,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,VJ7KW,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000620858600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, even renewable energy production has some environmental impacts, some of which are not (yet) covered in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). We aim to identify the most important cause-effect pathways related to hydropower production on biodiversity, as one of the most common renewable energy sources, and to provide recommendations for future characterization factor (CF) development. We start with a comprehensive review of cause-effect chains related to hydropower production for both aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. Next, we explore contemporary coverage of impacts on biodiversity from hydropower production in LCA. Further, we select cause-effect pathways displaying some degree of consistency with existing LCA frameworks for method development recommendations. For this, we compare and contrast different hydrologic models and discuss how existing LCIA methodologies might be modified or combined to improve the assessment of biodiversity impacts from hydropower production. Hydropower impacts were categorized into three overarching impact pathways: (1) freshwater habitat alteration, (2) water quality degradation, and (3) land use change. Impacts included within these pathways are flow alteration, geomorphological alteration to habitats, changes in water quality, habitat fragmentation, and land use transformation. For the majority of these impacts, no operational methodology exists currently. Furthermore, the seasonal nature of river dynamics requires a level of temporal resolution currently beyond LCIA modeling capabilities. State-of-the-art LCIA methods covering biodiversity impacts exist for land use and impacts from consumptive water use that can potentially be adapted to cases involving hydropower production, while other impact pathways need novel development. In the short term, coverage of biodiversity impacts from hydropower could be significantly improved by adding a time step representing seasonal ecological water demands to existing LCIA methods. In the long term, LCIA should focus on ecological response curves based on multiple hydrologic indices to capture the spatiotemporal aspects of river flow, by using models based on the ecological limits to hydrologic alteration (ELOHA) approach. This approach is based on hydrologic alteration-ecological response curves, including site-specific environmental impact data. Though data-intensive, ELOHA represents the potential to build a global impact assessment framework covering multiple ecological indicators from local impacts. Further, we recommend LCIA methods based on degree of regulation for geomorphologic alteration and a fragmentation index based on dam density for freshwater habitat alteration, which our review identified as significant unquantified threats to aquatic biodiversity.","[Gracey, Erik Olav; Verones, Francesca] NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Verones, F (corresponding author), NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",francesca.verones@ntnu.no,,"Verones, Francesca/0000-0002-2908-328X; Gracey, Erik/0000-0001-7209-3785","Research Council of Norway [215934, 244109]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This work was funded by the Research Council of Norway through the EcoManage project (project number 215934) and the SURE project (project number 244109).

Two cases were considered: i) straight biochar use and ii) biochar in combination with compost (COMBI: 20% biochar and 80% compost mass fraction), at application rates of 5 and 10 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Based on realistic estimations of achievable crop-yield performances by biochar and COMBI addition to dry soils, the effect of current policies on the economic viability of biochar deployment and farmers' income has been investigated. Using a cost-model we identified the required levels of support, in the form of (i) area subsidies for crop cultivation, (ii) tradable carbon certificates (credits), and (iii) REDII-compliant biofuel support for Aviation and Maritime, so to make biochar and sunflower cultivation in EU MED dry marginal lands competitive for sustainable crop-based biofuels. Results show that, by employing existing policy instruments, sufficient income can be generated for famers to recover marginal land, sequester large amount of carbon by BECCS at costs (similar to 82 (sic) Mg-1 of CO2) falling at or below the typical range of CCS measures, as well as offer additional environmental and socio-economic positive benefits. The combination of currently operational economic mechanisms from the Common Agricultural Policy, the Climate Policy, and the Renewable Energy Directive II can: i) maintain domestic farming activities, ii) support the implementation of biochar projects at local level, iii) contribute to achieve EU and national biofuel targets without generating ILUC impacts and iv) achieve unprecedent potential for carbon sequestration. However, prior to large-scale deployment, targeted on-site R&D actions aimed at validating biochar effects under local conditions (soil, climate, crops) are recommended, together with training and capacity building activities for local farmers.","[Chiaramonti, David] Univ Florence, RE CORD, Viale Morgagni 40, I-50134 Florence, Italy; [Chiaramonti, David] Univ Florence, CREAR, Ind Engn Dept, Viale Morgagni 40, I-50134 Florence, Italy; [Panoutsou, Calliope] Imperial Coll, Fac Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Policy, 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England",University of Florence; University of Florence; Imperial College London,"Chiaramonti, D (corresponding author), Univ Florence, RE CORD, Viale Morgagni 40, I-50134 Florence, Italy.;Chiaramonti, D (corresponding author), Univ Florence, CREAR, Ind Engn Dept, Viale Morgagni 40, I-50134 Florence, Italy.",david.chiaramonti@unifi.it,"Chiaramonti, David/N-8585-2017","Chiaramonti, David/0000-0002-1720-7820; Panoutsou, Calliope/0000-0002-9992-5331",EU Commission DG Energy; DG RTD; INEA; EU MED through the European Union's H2020 BIO4A project [789562]; development of integrated policy frameworks for biomass through project Biomass Policies [SI2.64592]; development of integrated policy frameworks for biomass through project S2Biom [608622],EU Commission DG Energy; DG RTD; INEA; EU MED through the European Union's H2020 BIO4A project; development of integrated policy frameworks for biomass through project Biomass Policies; development of integrated policy frameworks for biomass through project S2Biom,"Authors wish to acknowledge the EU Commission DG Energy for the support to the ART Fuel Forum, which addresses Market and Policies for Alternative and Renewable Transport Fuels, as well as DG RTD and INEA, supporting i) on-field investigation of biochar and COMBI in dry areas of EU MED through the European Union's H2020 BIO4A project (agreement No 789562) and ii) the development of integrated policy frameworks for biomass through projects Biomass Policies (agreement No SI2.64592) and S2Biom (agreement No 608622).

The Mediterranean Sea is prone to such an invasion, which is further enhanced by water temperature rising. Moreover, species from the Atlantic further expand their distribution in the Mediterranean, called neonative species, entering through the Gibraltar. Here, we examined the biological traits (e.g., preferred habitat and temperature, length, feeding habits) of fishes present in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as those from the neighboring Atlantic and Red Sea areas, and those that are neonative and non-indigenous in the Mediterranean. We applied state-of-the-art statistical analyses, aiming to describe their biological traits and spot those that could serve as predictors of species that could become neonative and non-indigenous for the Mediterranean. Overall, the results presented here could serve as a baseline for future research, and provide us with a useful tool to plan in advance measures for the protection of native Mediterranean fishes from such invasions. The Mediterranean Sea (MED) is prone to species' introductions, induced by human activities and/or climate change. Recent studies focus on the biological traits that result in such introductions, yet on a single-area-type approach. Here, we used, analyzed, and compared biological traits derived from FishBase for MED, non-indigenous (NIS) and neonative (NEO) in the Mediterranean, and adjacent Atlantic (ATL) and Red Sea (RS) species. A quantitative trait-based analysis was performed using random forest to determine the importance of traits in the successful establishment in the Mediterranean. MED fishes were mainly demersal, slow growing and small-medium sized, preferring intermediate temperatures. Conversely, ATL were mainly deep-dwelling species, preferring low temperatures. RS and NIS were predominantly reef-associated, thermophilus, and stenothermic. NEO species were stenothermic with preference to intermediate-high temperatures. Omnivores with preference to animals was the most common trophic group among regions. MED species exhibited higher phylogenetic uniqueness (PD50) compared to RS and NIS, indicating that they have long ancestral branches and few descendants. Preferred temperature, habitat type preference and maximum reported length (L-max) and infinite length (L-inf) were the most important predictors in the establishment process. Overall, the results presented here could serve as a baseline for future research, especially by using more refined and/or additional biological trail estimates.","[Karachle, Paraskevi K.; Oikonomou, Anthi; Pantazi, Maria; Zenetos, Argyro] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Attika 19013, Greece; [Stergiou, Konstantinos, I] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, UPB 134, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Hellenic Centre for Marine Research; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Karachle, PK (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Attika 19013, Greece.",pkarachle@hcmr.gr,,"Karachle, Paraskevi/0000-0002-6934-1773; Oikonomou, Anthi/0000-0003-2537-8846",NRSF 2017-2020 [MIS: 5049511],NRSF 2017-2020,"This research was conducted within the frame of the project 4ALIEN: Biology and the potential economic exploitation of four alien species in the Hellenic Seas, funded by NRSF 2017-2020, grant number MIS: 5049511.",,74,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-7737,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,NOV,2022,11,,,,,,1625,10.3390/biology11111625,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11111625,,,17,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,6A9LJ,36358326,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000880967800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is a timely study as OH observations are predominantly from spatially sparse field and infrequent aircraft campaigns, so there is a requirement for further approaches to infer spatial and temporal information on OH and its interactions with important climate (e.g. methane, CH4) and air quality (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, NO2) trace gases. Due to the short lifetime of OH (similar to 1 s), SSAs of varying complexities can be used to model its concentration and offer a tool to examine the OH budget in different regions of the atmosphere. Here, we use the well-evaluated TOMCAT three-dimensional chemistry transport model to identify atmospheric regions where different complexities of the SSAs are representative of OH. In the case of a simplified SSA (S-SSA), where we have observations of ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), CH4 and water vapour (H2O) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on board ESA's MetOp-A satellite, it is most representative of OH between 600 and 700 hPa (though suitable between 400-800 hPa) within similar to 20 %-30 % of TOMCAT modelled OH. The same S-SSA is applied to aircraft measurements from the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) and compares well with the observed OH concentrations within similar to 26 %, yielding a correlation of 0.78. We apply the S-SSA to IASI data spanning 2008-2017 to explore the global long-term inter-annual variability of OH. Relative to the 10-year mean, we find that global annual mean OH anomalies ranged from -3.1 % to +4.7 %, with the largest spread in the tropics between -6.9 % and +7.7 %. Investigation of the individual terms in the S-SSA over this time period suggests that O-3 and CO were the key drivers of variability in the production and loss of OH. For example, large enhancement in the OH sink during the positive 2015/2016 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event was due to large-scale CO emissions from drought-induced wildfires in South East Asia. The methodology described here could be further developed as a constraint on the tropospheric OH distribution as additional satellite data become available in the future.","[Pimlott, Matilda A.; Pope, Richard J.; Feng, Wuhu; Chipperfield, Martyn P.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Pope, Richard J.; Chipperfield, Martyn P.] Univ Leeds, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Kerridge, Brian J.; Latter, Barry G.; Knappett, Diane S.; Ventress, Lucy J.; Siddans, Richard] STFC Rutherford Appleton Lab, Remote Sensing Grp, Chilton OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; [Kerridge, Brian J.; Latter, Barry G.; Knappett, Diane S.; Ventress, Lucy J.; Siddans, Richard] STFC Rutherford Appleton Lab, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Chilton OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; [Heard, Dwayne E.] Univ Leeds, Sch Chem, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Feng, Wuhu] Univ Leeds, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9PH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC); STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC); STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Leeds,"Pimlott, MA (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",eemap@leeds.ac.uk,"Chipperfield, Martyn/H-6359-2013; Heard, Dwayne/M-3624-2017","Chipperfield, Martyn/0000-0002-6803-4149; Heard, Dwayne/0000-0002-0357-6238","UK Research and Innovation [NE/S007458/1, NE/N015657/1, NE/R001782/1]",UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This research has been supported by the UK Research and Innovation (grant nos.

It makes it possible to deepen the knowledge of animal behavior and improve animal welfare and health, which has positive implications for the sustainability of animal production. In recent years, successful technological developments have been applied in intensive farming systems; however, due to challenging conditions that extensive pasture-based systems show, technology has been more limited. Nevertheless, awareness of the available technological solutions for extensive conditions can increase the implementation of their adoption among farmers and researchers. In this context, this review addresses the role of different technologies applied to sheep and goat production in extensive systems. Examples related to precision livestock farming, omics, thermal stress, colostrum intake, passive immunity, and newborn survival are presented; biomarkers of metabolic diseases and parasite resistance breeding are discussed. Sheep and goat extensive production systems are very important in the context of global food security and the use of rangelands that have no alternative agricultural use. In such systems, there are enormous challenges to address. These include, for instance, classical production issues, such as nutrition or reproduction, as well as carbon-efficient systems within the climate-change context. An adequate response to these issues is determinant to economic and environmental sustainability. The answers to such problems need to combine efficiently not only the classical production aspects, but also the increasingly important health, welfare, and environmental aspects in an integrated fashion. The purpose of the study was to review the application of technological developments, in addition to remote-sensing in tandem with other state-of-the-art techniques that could be used within the framework of extensive production systems of sheep and goats and their impact on nutrition, production, and ultimately, the welfare of these species. In addition to precision livestock farming (PLF), these include other relevant technologies, namely omics and other areas of relevance in small-ruminant extensive production: heat stress, colostrum intake, passive immunity, newborn survival, biomarkers of metabolic disease diagnosis, and parasite resistance breeding. This work shows the substantial, dynamic nature of the scientific community to contribute to solutions that make extensive production systems of sheep and goats more sustainable, efficient, and aligned with current concerns with the environment and welfare.","[Silva, Severiano R.; Almeida, Mariana; Guedes, Cristina] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Vet & Anim Res Ctr CECAV, Associate Lab Anim & Vet Sci AL4Anim, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Sacarrao-Birrento, Laura; Ribeiro, David M.; de Almeida, Andre M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, LEAF Linking Landscape Environm Agr & Food, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gonzalez Montana, Jose Ramiro; Alonso-Diez, Angel J.] Univ Leon, Vet Fac, Med Surg & Anat Vet Dept, Leon 24071, Spain; [Pereira, Alfredo F.; Geraldo, Ana] Univ Evora, Mediterranean Inst Agr Environm & Dev, Apartado 94, P-7006554 Evora, Portugal; [Zaralis, Konstantinos] Univ Western Macedonia, Sch Agr Sci, Dept Agr, Florina 53100, Greece; [Tzamaloukas, Ouranios] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Agr Sci Biotechnol & Food Sci, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus; [Gonzalez Cabrera, Marta; Castro, Noemi; Arguello, Anastasio; Hernandez-Castellano, Lorenzo E.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Anim Hlth & Food Safety, Anim Prod & Biotechnol Grp, Arucas 35413, Spain; [Martin, Maria J.] Univ Lleida, Dept Anim Sci, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Cal-Pereyra, Luis G.] Univ La Republ, Vet Fac, Pathol Dept, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay; [Stilwell, George] Univ Lisbon, Fac Vet Med, CIISA Anim Behav & Welf Lab, Associate Lab Anim & Vet Sci AL4Anim, P-1300477 Lisbon, Portugal","University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidad de Leon; University of Evora; University of Western Macedonia; Cyprus University of Technology; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universitat de Lleida; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidade de Lisboa","Almeida, M (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Vet & Anim Res Ctr CECAV, Associate Lab Anim & Vet Sci AL4Anim, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal.",ssilva@utad.pt; laurasvbirrento@hotmail.com; mdantas@utad.pt; davidribeiro@isa.ulisboa.pt; cguedes@utad.pt; jrgonm@unileon.es; apereira@uevora.pt; kzaralis@uowm.gr; ageraldo@uevora.pt; ouranios.tzamaloukas@cut.ac.cy; marta.gonzalez133@alu.ulpgc.es; noemi.castro@ulpgc.es; tacho@ulpgc.es; lorenzo.hernandez@ulpgc.es; ajalod@unileon.es; mariajose.martin@udl.cat; luiscalper@gmail.com; stilwell@fmv.ulisboa.pt; aalmeida@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Gonzalez-Montaña, Jose-Ramiro/F-3430-2016; Silva, Severiano/K-2965-2013; Arguello, Anastasio/B-4493-2010; Almeida, Andre/I-4369-2013; Castro, Noemi/F-9621-2016; Pereira, Alfredo/J-5457-2014; Guedes, Cristina/K-2986-2013; Tzamaloukas, Ouranios/D-9514-2016","Gonzalez-Montaña, Jose-Ramiro/0000-0002-8976-3332; Silva, Severiano/0000-0002-7045-2075; Arguello, Anastasio/0000-0002-4426-0678; Almeida, Andre/0000-0002-7810-3988; Stilwell, George/0000-0003-3733-3223; Zaralis, Konstantinos/0000-0003-1959-3689; Hernandez-Castellano, Lorenzo Enrique/0000-0003-2729-0434; Castro, Noemi/0000-0002-3026-2031; Gonzalez Cabrera, Marta/0000-0002-9735-2162; Ribeiro Vieira Santos, David Miguel/0000-0002-0990-7739; Pereira, Alfredo/0000-0001-9430-9399; Luis, Cal Pereyra/0000-0002-0533-0530; Birrento, Laura/0000-0001-6416-9268; Guedes, Cristina/0000-0002-8390-4907; MARTIN-ALONSO, MARIA JOSE/0000-0003-2888-0778; Tzamaloukas, Ouranios/0000-0001-7675-6718; Almeida, Mariana/0000-0003-0482-5459","FCT, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UIDB/CVT/00772/2020]; FCT (FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Lisboa, Portugal) [UID/AGR/04129, SFRH/BD/143992/2019, 2021.07638.BD]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (Spain) [RYC2019-027064-I/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]","FCT, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT); FCT (FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Lisboa, Portugal)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (Spain)(Spanish Government)","The CECAV authors acknowledge financial support of the research unit, which was financed by the National Funds from FCT, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), project number UIDB/CVT/00772/2020.

This paper addresses the lack of inventory models and characterization factors suited for the quantification of emissions and ecotoxicological impacts of pesticides applied to viticulture. The paper presents (i) a tailored version of PestLCI 2.0, (ii) corresponding characterization factors for freshwater ecotoxicity characterization and (iii) result comparison with other inventory approaches. The purpose of this paper is hence to present a viticulture customized version of PestLCI 2.0 and illustrate the application of this customized version on a viticulture case study. The customization of the PestLCI 2.0 model for viticulture includes (i) addition of 29 pesticide active ingredients commonly used in vineyards, (ii) addition of 9 viticulture type specific spraying equipment and accounting the number of rows treated in one pass, and (iii) accounting for mixed canopy (vine/cover crop) pesticide interception. Applying USEtox (TM), the PestLCI 2.0 customization is further supported by the calculation of freshwater ecotoxicity characterization factors for active ingredients relevant for viticulture. Case studies on three different vineyard technical management routes illustrate the application of the inventory model. The inventory and freshwater ecotoxicity results are compared to two existing simplified emission modelling approaches. The assessment results show considerably different emission fractions, quantities emitted and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts between the different active ingredient applications. Three out of 21 active ingredients dominate the overall freshwater ecotoxicity: Aclonifen, Fluopicolide and Cymoxanil. The comparison with two simplified emission modelling approaches, considering field soil and air as part of the ecosphere, shows that PestLCI 2.0 yields considerable lower emissions and, consequently, lower freshwater ecotoxicity. The sensitivity analyses reveal the importance of soil and climate characteristics, canopies (vine and cover crop) development and sprayer type on the emission results. These parameters should therefore be obtained with site-specific data, while literature or generic data that are acceptable inputs for parameters whose uncertainties have less influence on the result. Important specificities of viticulture have been added to the state-of-the-art inventory model PestLCI 2.0. They cover vertically trained vineyards, the most common vineyard training form; they are relevant for other perennial or bush crops provided equipment, shape of the canopy and pesticide active ingredients stay in the range of available options. A similar and compatible model is needed for inorganic pesticide active ingredients emission quantification, especially for organic viticulture impacts accounting.","[Renaud-Gentie, Christel] UPSP GRAPPE, ESA, UMT Vinitera, SFR QUASAV, F-49007 Angers 01, France; [Dijkman, Teunis J.; Bjorn, Anders; Birkved, Morten] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Renaud-Gentie, C (corresponding author), UPSP GRAPPE, ESA, UMT Vinitera, SFR QUASAV, 55 Rue Rabelais,BP 30748, F-49007 Angers 01, France.",c.renaud@groupe-esa.com,"Birkved, Morten/AAA-4736-2020; Dijkman, Teunis/C-6231-2016; Birkved, Morten/O-8585-2018","Dijkman, Teunis/0000-0002-1171-5453; Birkved, Morten/0000-0001-6989-1647; Renaud-Gentie, Christel/0000-0001-6728-697X; Bjorn, Anders/0000-0001-9332-5346",Interloire; Region pays de la Loire,Interloire; Region pays de la Loire(Region Pays de la Loire),"The authors thank Interloire and Region pays de la Loire for funding, the winegrowers for their time and data, MM.

PestLCI is a model capable of estimating pesticide emissions to air, surface water and groundwater for use in life cycle inventory (LCI) modelling of field applications. After calculating the primary distribution of pesticides between crop and soil, specific modules calculate the pesticide's fate, thus determining the pesticide emission pattern for the application. PestLCI 2.0 was developed to overcome the limitations of the first model version, replacement of fate calculation equations and introducing new modules for macropore flow and effects of tillage. The accompanying pesticide database was expanded, the meteorological and soil databases were extended to include a range of European climatic zones and soil profiles. Environmental emissions calculated by PestLCI 2.0 were compared to results from the risk assessment models SWASH (surface water emissions), FOCUSPEARL (groundwater via matrix leaching) and MACRO (groundwater including macropore flow, only one scenario available) to partially validate the updated model. A case study was carried out to demonstrate the spatial variation of pesticide emission patterns due to dependency on meteorological and soil conditions. Compared to PestLCI 1.0, PestLCI 2.0 calculated lower emissions to surface water and higher emissions to groundwater. Both changes were expected due to new pesticide fate calculation approaches and the inclusion of macropore flow. Differences between the SWASH and FOCUSPEARL and PestLCI 2.0 emission estimates were generally lower than 2 orders of magnitude, with PestLCI generally calculating lower emissions. This is attributed to the LCA approach to quantify average cases, contrasting with the worst-case risk assessment approach inherent to risk assessment. Compared to MACRO, the PestLCI 2.0 estimates for emissions to groundwater were higher, suggesting that PestLCI 2.0 estimates of fractions leached to groundwater may be slightly conservative as a consequence of the chosen macropore modelling approach. The case study showed that the distribution of pesticide emissions between environmental compartments strongly depends on local climate and soil characteristics. PestLCI 2.0 is partly validated in this paper. Judging from the validation data and case study, PestLCI 2.0 is a pesticide emission model in acceptable accordance with both state-of-the-art pesticide risk assessment models. The case study underlines that the common pesticide emission estimation practice in LCI may lead to misestimating the toxicity impacts of pesticide use in LCA.","[Dijkman, T.

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo-skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current sun protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.","[Bennett, Mary F.; Baron, Elma D.; Cooper, Kevin D.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Dermatol, Univ Hosp Case Med Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Bennett, Mary F.; Baron, Elma D.; Cooper, Kevin D.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Skin Dis Res Ctr, Univ Hosp Case Med Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Robinson, Michael K.] Procter & Gamble Co, Cincinnati, OH USA",Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University Hospital; Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University Hospital; Procter & Gamble,"Cooper, KD (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Dermatol, Univ Hosp Case Med Ctr, 11100 Euclid Ave,Lakeside 3516, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",Kevin.Cooper@uhhospitals.org,"Robinson, Michael/AAG-7560-2021; Robinson, Michael K/Q-3263-2017","Robinson, Michael/0000-0002-6914-8543; Robinson, Michael K/0000-0002-6914-8543; Cooper, Kevin/0000-0002-1986-3602",,,,,51,46,61,3,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1087-0024,1529-1774,,J INVEST DERM SYMP P,J.

Biogeochemical models, statistical time series, and literature data are used together to describe grassland, forest, and arable land specific GHG fluxes. The estimates are aggregated to the country level to approximate the net biospheric greenhouse gas balance for the first time. The results suggest that the overall biospheric GHG balance of Hungary is negative (-13.8 Mt CO2-equivalent year(-1)), which means net GHG release to the atmosphere. According to this finding, the biosphere does not mitigate anthropogenic GHG emission in the country. More research is needed to constrain the estimates, and to provide reliable uncertainty estimates to the fluxes and stocks. We try to point out important research priorities that can help us to better understand the biogeochemical processes of the biosphere in Hungary, and to provide mitigation opportunities for biospheric GHG emission.","[Barcza, Zoltan; Gelybo, Gyorgyi] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Bondeau, Alberte] PIK, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Churkina, Galina] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Ciais, Philippe] CEA, CNRS, UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Czobel, Szilard] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Bot & Ecophysiol, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary; [Grosz, Balazs] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Gen & Inorgan Chem, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Haszpra, Laszlo; Hidy, Dora; Horvath, Laszlo; Machon, Attila] Hungarian Meteorol Serv, H-1675 Budapest, Hungary; [Machon, Attila] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Machon, Attila] Szent Istvan Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Physiol, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary; [Pasztor, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Somogyi, Zoltan] Hungarian Forest Res Inst, H-1142 Budapest, Hungary; [Van Oost, Kristof] Catholic Univ Louvain, ELI, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Eotvos Lorand University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Agricultural Research; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Barcza, Z (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, Pazmany Ps 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",bzoli@elte.hu,"Pásztor, László/B-3270-2014; Grosz, Balazs/AFT-1500-2022; Van Oost, Kristof/B-6941-2008; Bondeau, Alberte/E-9909-2012; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Barcza, Zoltán/G-3880-2014","Pásztor, László/0000-0002-1605-4412; Bondeau, Alberte/0000-0002-8729-5061; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Barcza, Zoltán/0000-0002-1278-0636; Haszpra, Laszlo/0000-0002-7747-6475; Churkina, Galina/0000-0002-5895-7425",,,,,44,10,10,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-90-481-9949-5,,,,2011,,,,,295,330,,10.1007/978-90-481-9950-1_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9950-1_13,10.1007/978-90-481-9950-1,,36,Environmental Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BSE79,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000284291300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

For heat storage, the salt is dehydrated with the available heat, and for heat recovery, the salt is rehydrated. There are many salt hydration transitions and for selecting the most suited ones with respect to the envisaged use cases, temperatures of dehydration and rehydration are needed, as well as the heat storage density. Estimation of these properties requires entropy and enthalpy changes of the transitions. Collections of hydration entropies and enthalpies have been published, but not all data seems reliable for various reasons, and it is often hard to access original sources and experimental conditions. For the necessary data validation, we propose the use of Trouton's rule, known to hold for the evaporation of classes of fluids. Besides data validation, Trouton's rule is useful for predicting heat storage densities and vapor pressures when only the transition enthalpy is known. We discuss the validity of Trouton's rule for salt hydration and ammoniation transitions by theoretical and experimental evidence on the available extensive data collections.","[de Jong, Ard-Jan] TNO, Leeghwaterstr 46, NL-2628 CA Delft, Netherlands; [Fischer, Hartmut] TNO, High Tech Campus 5, NL-5656 AE Eindhoven, Netherlands",Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research,"de Jong, AJ (corresponding author), TNO, Leeghwaterstr 46, NL-2628 CA Delft, Netherlands.",ardjan.dejong@tno.nl; hartmut.fischer@tno.nl,,,Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate under the Early Research Program Energy Storage and Conversion of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research.,Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate under the Early Research Program Energy Storage and Conversion of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research.,The research was funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate under the Early Research Program Energy Storage and Conversion of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research.,,26,2,2,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-3417,,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The CONUS region is characterized by a great diversity of precipitation-producing systems, mechanisms, and large-scale meteorological patterns (LSMPs), which can provide favorable environment for local precipitation extremes. This diversity is unlikely to be adequately captured in methodologies that rely on grossly reducing the dimensionality of the data-by representing it in terms of a few patterns evolving in time-and thus requires data thinning techniques based on high-dimensional dynamical or statistical data modeling. We have built a novel high-dimensional empirical model of temperature and precipitation capable of producing statistically accurate surrogate realizations of the observed 1979-99 (training period) evolution of these fields. This model also provides skillful hindcasts of precipitation over the 2000-20 (validation) period. We devised a subsampling strategy based on the relative entropy of the empirical model's precipitation (ensemble) forecasts over CONUS and demonstrated that it generates a set of dates that captures a majority of high-impact precipitation events, while substantially reducing a heavy-precipitation bias inherent in an alternative methodology based on the direct identification of large precipitation events in the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), version 12 reforecasts. The impacts of data thinning on the accuracy of precipitation statistical postprocessing, as well as on the calibration and validation of the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) reforecasts are yet to be established. Significance StatementHigh-impact weather events are usually associated with extreme precipitation, which is notoriously difficult to predict even using highly resolved state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models based on first physical principles. The same is true for statistical models that use past data to anticipate the future behavior likely to stem from an observed initial state. Here we use both types of models to identify the occurrences of the states, over the historical climate record, which are likely to lead to extreme precipitation events. We show that the overall statistics of precipitation over the contiguous United States is encapsulated in a greatly reduced set of such states, which could substantially alleviate the computational burden associated with testing of hydrological forecast models used for decision support.","[Kravtsov, Sergey; Roebber, Paul] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Hamill, Thomas M.] NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Brown, James] Hydrol Solut Ltd, Southgate Chambers, Winchester, England",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Kravtsov, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",kravtsov@uwm.edu,,,"Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), University of Michigan [SUBK00011312]; NOAA Grant [NWS OSTI U8MWFST-PLK]","Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), University of Michigan; NOAA Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This study was funded through Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), University of Michigan, Grant SUBK00011312 (PR, SK) and, overall, by the NOAA Grant NWS OSTI U8MWFST-PLK.

The prime mechanism for the transfer of tidal energy to turbulent mixing results from the interaction between topography and stratified tidal flow, leading to the generation of freely propagating internal waves at the period of the forcing tide. However, poleward of the critical latitude (where the period of the principal tidal constituent exceeds the local inertial period), the action of the Coriolis force precludes the development of freely propagating linear internal tides. Here we focus on a region of sloping topography, poleward of the critical latitude, where there is significant conversion of tidal energy and the flow is supercritical (Froude number, Fr > 1). A high-resolution nonlinear modeling study demonstrates the key role of tidally generated lee waves and supercritical flow in the transfer of energy from the barotropic tide to internal waves in these high-latitude regions. Time series of flow and water column structure from the region of interest show internal waves with characteristics consistent with those predicted by the model, and concurrent microstructure dissipation measurements show significant levels of mixing associated with these internal waves. The results suggest that tidally generated lee waves are a key mechanism for the transfer of energy from the tide to turbulence poleward of the critical latitude. Plain Language Summary The decline in aerial extent of sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean in the recent years is perhaps one of the leading indications of climate change. Warm water enters the Arctic Ocean at depths of 100-200m; however, it is isolated from melting the ice by the lack of mixing in the Arctic Ocean. This lack of mixing has been attributed to the ocean being isolated from the wind by ice, and the fact that much of the Arctic Ocean is north of the critical latitude, beyond which the type of internal tide that is believed to drive mixing across other major oceans on the planet cannot occur. However, new evidence has been found that suggests that the tide might be important in driving mixing in certain areas of the Arctic Ocean. Here we combine state-of-the-art numerical modeling with new turbulence measurements to identify the mechanism by which the tide can drive mixing at these high latitudes.","[Rippeth, Tom P.; Scannell, Brian D.; Green, J.

J,"North, J",,,,"North, Julian",,,"PORTRAYING PRESENCE: THOMAS CARLYLE, PORTRAITURE, AND BIOGRAPHY",VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This essay looks at Carlyle's interest in visual and literary portraiture, as the basis for a reassessment of his practice as a biographer in relation to the wider biographical culture of Victorian Britain. Carlyle's fascination with portraits manifested itself in a number of ways. Despite his professed reluctance as a sitter, his face was one of the most visible of his day - painted, sketched, sculpted, photographed, and reproduced for public circulation in engravings and cartes de visite. He collected portraits of his family, friends, and heroes, and was a public champion of the art, most famously through his influential role in the founding of the English National Portrait Gallery. He was also valued by his contemporaries as a portraitist in words, a writer whose graphic style included a striking ability to picture people. Yet only partial answers have been offered to the question of how these activities related to each other and what their significance might be in terms of his career. Paul Barlow has explored Carlyle's concept of the authentic, historical portrait in relation to his proposals for a National Portrait Gallery (Facing the Past and The Imagined Hero), and John Rosenberg has discussed his pictorial style as a means by which he sought to make history into a secular scripture by endowing the past with extraordinary presence' (24). Richard Salmon has given some consideration to Carlyle's engagement with contemporary portrait gallery publications as part of his discussion of his ambivalent response to idolatry and literary lionism (Salmon 2002). I am indebted to these discussions but I differ from them in arguing that we need to see Carlyle's interest in portraiture, both visual and verbal, as integral to his conception and practice of biography. The fact that he, famously, enmeshes history and biography, in theory and practice, does not invalidate this point. It is with biography and the biographical basis of historical narrative, that he associates the portrait and portraiture. This distinction matters because it shifts us away from the emphasis on Carlyle as an historian that has sometimes occluded his links with his contemporary biographical culture. By restoring these links we can understand more fully the significance both of the portrait within his work, and of his innovative contribution to a broader climate of experimentation with the conjunction of visual and verbal portraiture in life writing at the period.",,,,,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1060-1503,1470-1553,,VICTORIAN LIT CULT,Vic.

The circuit consists of six different individual tracks with a 3.66 km outer track (involving 10 turns) and a 2.55 km inner track (having six turns). The complex has been designed to host a variety of other sporting activities. Fifty thousand spectators, including 10,500 in the main grandstand, can be accommodated simultaneously. State-of-the art on-site media and broadcast facilities are available. The noise level emitted from vehicles on the circuit during the Formula-1 event, on April 4th 2004, was acceptable and caused no physical disturbance to the fans in the VIP lounges or to scholars studying at the University of Bahrain's Shakeir Campus, which is only 1.5 km away from the circuit. The sound-intensity level (SIL) recorded on the balcony of the VIP lounge was 128 dB(A) and was 80 dB(A) inside the lounge. The calculated SIL immediately outside the lecture halls of the University of Bahrain was 70 dB(A) and 65 dB(A) within them. Thus racing at BIC can proceed without significantly disturbing the academic-learning process. The purchased electricity demand by the BIC complex peaked (at 4.5 MW) during the first Formula-1 event on April 4th 2004. The reverse-osmosis (RO) plant at the BIC provides 1000 m(3) of desalinated water per day for landscape irrigation. Renewable-energy inputs, (i.e., via solar and wind power), at the BIC could be harnessed to generate electricity for water desalination, air conditioning, lighting as well as for irrigation. If the covering of the BIC complex was covered by adhesively fixed modern photovoltaic cells, then similar to 1.2 MW of solar electricity could be generated. If two horizontal-axis, at 150 m height above the ground, three 75m bladed, wind turbines were to be installed at the BIC, then the output could reach 4 MW. Furthermore, if 10,000 Jojoba trees (a species renowned for having a low demand for water, needing only five irrigations per year in Bahrain and which remain green throughout the year) are planted near the circuit, then the local micro-climate would be improved with respect to human comfort as well as the local environment becoming cleaner.

The classic use of the FWI is associated with the daily fire danger mapping, based on meteorological measurements, while in recent research papers this indicator has been used with forecasted climatic data for studying the changes in the occurrence and intensity of natural disasters. (Climate change Impacts Study Committee, 2011. The purpose of this work is the calculation of the Canadian FWI system indices combined with a state-of-the-art seasonal meteorological forecasting model, for predictive high resolution fire danger mapping, as a tool to design medium-term prevention planning. More specifically, the current paper presents a methodology for the calculation of a series of seasonal forecasted maps of meteorological fire danger, for the fire season (May-October) 2018, for Greece, using the Fire Weather Index (FWI) of the Canadian System CFFDRS. To this end, five components that account for the effects of fuel moisture and wind on fire behaviour have been calculated and investigated, namely, the Drought Code (DC), the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), the Built Up Index (BUI), the Initial Spread Index (ISI) and FWI for the referenced period. The meteorological data needed for the calculation of FWI are produced from high resolution simulations with the WRF model (v3.5.1), for a period of six (6) months, using a grid spacing of 5x5 km covering the whole country. The above referenced indices are calculated for every day of the fire season. Subsequently, from the mean value of the maps of seven (7) days, a weekly map is calculated, which constitutes the representative, final map for each index. The maps can be calculated at the beginning of the fire season and for its entirety. Hence, the FWI system values can be provided at three time levels as weekly, monthly and seasonal forecasts. Appropriate classification of FWI values yields estimation of the Forest Fire Danger. The calculated FWI system components and Forest Fire Danger are important to support decisions, about the prevention and management of forest fires, made by the local and central authorities of the country.

Researchers' increased interest in sounding rockets during the two-year period is especially noteworthy. The use of the high altitude research stations, in contrast, has a long tradition in Switzerland and is, thus, frequently occupied by scientists. An advantage of these stations is the ideal set-up for researchers interested in the long-term measurement of the upper atmosphere, for example. Therefore, numerous experiments in this particular research field were conducted and published in scientific journals. After a pause, several Swiss scientists became engaged in sounding rocket experiments. RUAG Space in Nyon, for instance, in collaboration with the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) and University of Freiburg, is focusing on the effect of gravity on plant roots. In order to investigate a gravity-dependent influence, two experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are being planned for execution during the upcoming MASTER 13 campaign. A team of students from HES-SO Geneva were chosen to participate in the REXUS program with their experiment called CAESAR. A new concept of a propellant management device for space vehicles was introduced and tested on the REXUS 14 rocket by the team from Geneva in the spring of 2013. Last year, another student team, now from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, was selected to fly their experiment on another REXUS rocket. Their proposed biological study is called CEMIOS and pertains to biochemical properties of the cell membrane. Once more the high altitude research stations of Jungfraujoch and Gornergrat welcomed many national as well as international scientists in the past two years. The hours that the researchers spent in either station reached a record high despite the poor weather conditions, particularly in 2014. In order to keep the stations attractive to researchers from all over the world, investment in infrastructure is necessary. New instruments were recently installed at the Jungfrau East Ridge, for example, that now allow for the recording of additional climate and environmental data. A short summary of a few Swiss projects within the framework of sounding rocket and balloon activities and related research perfouned between 2013 and 2015 is provided in the following paragraphs.","[Egli, Marcel] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, CC Aerosp Biomed Sci & Technol, Space Biol Grp, CH-6052 Hergiswil, Switzerland",,"Egli, M (corresponding author), Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, CC Aerosp Biomed Sci & Technol, Space Biol Grp, CH-6052 Hergiswil, Switzerland.",marcel.egli@hslu.ch,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,ESA PUBLICATIONS DIVISION C/O ESTEC,2200 AG NOORDWIJK,"PO BOX 299, 2200 AG NOORDWIJK, NETHERLANDS",0379-6566,,978-92-9221-294-0,ESA SPEC PUBL,,,2015,,,,,57,61,,,,,,5,"Engineering, Aerospace; Astronomy & Astrophysics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Astronomy & Astrophysics,BE5YC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000373647300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The algorithm is powered by a rigorous solution to the plane parallel radiative transfer equation for the atmosphere with thermodynamically consistent vertical profiles of humidity, temperature and cloud structures, together with measured vertical profiles of the rain structure derived from a radar. Design/methodology/approach - The raining atmosphere is considered to be a plane parallel, radiatively participating medium. The atmospheric thermodynamic profiles such as pressure, temperature and relative humidity along with wind speed at sea surface and cloud parameters corresponding to Nargis, a category 4 tropical cyclone that made its landfall on May 2, 2008 at the Republic of Myanmar, are obtained by solving the flux form of Euler's equations in three-dimensional form. The state-of-the-art community software Weather Research and Forecasting has been used for solving the set of equations. The three-dimensional rain profiles for the same cyclone at the same instant of time are obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space borne Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's precipitation radar over collocated pixels. An in-house Micro-Tropiques code is used to perform radiative transfer simulations for frequencies corresponding to a typical space borne radiometer, and hence to generate the database which is later used for training the neural network. The back propagation-based neural network is optimized with reduced number of parameters using principal component analysis (PCA). Findings - The results show that neural network is capable of retrieving the vertical rainfall structure with a correlation coefficient of over 0.99. Further, reducing the ill-posedness in retrieving 56 parameters from just nine measurements using PCA has improved the root mean square error in the retrievals at reduced computational time. Originality/value - The paper shows that combining numerically generated atmospheric profiles together with radar measurements to serve as input to a radiative transfer model brings in the much-required synergy between numerical weather prediction, radar measurements and radiative transfer. This strategy can be gainfully used in satellite meteorology. Using principal components to reduce the ill-posedness, thereby increasing the robustness in retrieving vertical rain structure, has been attempted for the first time. A well-trained network can be used as one possible option for an operational algorithm for the proposed Indian climate research satellite Megha-Tropiques, due to be launched in early 2011.","[Ramanujam, Srinivasa; Chandrasekar, R.; Chakravarthy, Balaji] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Chakravarthy, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",balaji@iitm.ac.in,"Radhakrishnan, Chandrasekar/AAN-6066-2021; Balaji, Chakravarthy/G-6710-2012; Kannan, Srinivasa Ramanujam/AAV-8014-2021","Kannan, Srinivasa Ramanujam/0000-0002-0466-2752; RADHAKRISHNAN, CHANDRASEKAR/0000-0001-6867-9767; Chakravarthy, Balaji/0000-0003-3010-8701",,,,,25,10,10,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0961-5539,1758-6585,,INT J NUMER METHOD H,Int.

The combination of the two is supposed to yield better energy efficiency. However, after the building is designed, several other factors will significantly affect the actual energy balance of the building. If not operated according to the design, passive design strategies could reverse energy savings to energy consumptions. In this investigated case the quality of reinstallation and maintenance, the occupants' unawareness of the passive design strategy and the need for a smart control system are the key factors. This paper aims to discuss and quantify how these behavioral factors affect building energy efficiency based on comprehensive data collected in a relocated 2009 US DOE Solar Decathlon house over a 2-year period. The Solar Decathlon house which already achieved net-zero during the competition is now located in an extreme climate with cold winter and hot summer. The building is utilized as a community lab to study energy efficiency potential while integrating passive design and active HVAC systems. It is now operated with a conventional cooling system, radiant floor heating and solar hot water system. The expected energy load is simulated based on this setup and the altered program of office space instead of residential also has significant effect. Reliable data is provided by a state of the art data acquisition system. By comparing the simulated performance and measurements, it is found that inappropriate installation resulted in difficulties with the operation of passive cooling strategies; underperformance of the solar hot water tank due to low tank temperature settings, which caused the backup electrical heater to consume up to 90% of all energy in winter. The occupants' unawareness of passive design strategy sometimes activates the passive heating still in the summer without need. Operating the cooling system without utilizing the proposed natural ventilation strategy creates more than 20% extra cooling load. In the past two years, the improper operations of the building were intervened a few times through email communication and onsite demonstrations. All of these factors call for further education for technicians and users. Smart control design for mechanical system should also be considered. Energy efficiency does not stop with the design phase, but has to be implemented in the operation and maintenance phase of a building.","[He, Shan; Passe, Ulrike] Iowa State Univ, Dept Architecture, Ames, IA 51637 USA",Iowa State University,"He, S (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Architecture, Ames, IA 51637 USA.",,"Passe, Ulrike/AAS-9917-2020","Passe, Ulrike/0000-0003-2242-3082",,,,,4,0,0,0,1,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",0001-2505,,978-1-936504-82-4,ASHRAE TRAN,,,2014,,2,,,,,,,,,,8,Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,BB8GU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000346573500062,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proprietary system achieves these results through a closed-loop, high-pressure, low-pressure-ratio recuperated Brayton cycle that uses supercritical CO2 as the working fluid. The cycle exploits the special thermodynamic properties of carbon dioxide as a working fluid by eliminating the energy losses that steam-based cycles encounter due to the heat of vaporization and condensation. The compelling economics of the system are driven by high target efficiencies - 59% net LHV for natural gas and 51% net LHV for coal - and low projected capital and O&M costs, which are the result of utilizing only a single turbine, having a smaller plant footprint, and requiring fewer, smaller components than comparable fossil-fuel systems. NET Power, Toshiba Corporation, Exelon Corporation, and the Shaw Power Group are partnering to commercialize this system by developing a 50MWt facility that is scheduled to begin testing in 2014. This facility will generate electricity from natural gas and capture 100% of emissions, including all CO2. The initial design for a commercial system with an electrical output in the range of 200MWt to 500MWt is also under development. The turbine for the 50MWt plant is being designed at the 500MWt level and then scaled down for the demonstration plant to facilitate rapid development of the large-scale turbine in the future. The demonstration plant will test all components and control systems and the operability of the cycle, including 100% capture of carbon dioxide and other impurities, using a range of fuel gas compositions. The NET Power cycle will have an important impact on the power industry's ability to control and limit greenhouse gas emissions. Driven by its competitive cost when compared to state-of-the-art technologies without CO2 capture, the authors believe the NET Power cycle will remove economic barriers to the deployment of 100%-carbon-capture, fossil-fuel-based electricity generation technology. This will enable both the developed and developing world to produce cheap electricity that does not contribute to CO2-based climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The sharp decrease in costs of especially wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) have created opportunities to move from dependency on conventional fossil fuel-based electricity production towards renewable energy sources. Renewables experience around 7% (in 2018) annual growth rate in the electricity production globally and the pace is expected to further increase in the near future. Cuba is no exception in this regard, the government has set an ambitious renewable energy target of 24% RES of electricity production by the year 2030. The article analyses renewable energy trajectories in Isla de la Juventud, Cuba, through different future energy scenarios utilizing EnergyPLAN tool. The goal is to identify the best fit and least cost options in transitioning towards 100% electric power systemin Isla de la Juventud, Cuba. The work is divided into analysis of (1) technical possibilities for five scenarios in the electricity production with a 40% increase of electricity consumption by 2030: Business As Usual (BAU 2030, with the current electric power system (EPS) setup), VISION 2030 (according to the Cuban government plan with 24% RES), Advanced Renewables (ARES, with 50% RES), High Renewables (HiRES, with 70% RES), and Fully Renewables (FullRES, with 100% RES based electricity system) scenarios and (2) defining least cost options for the five scenarios in Isla de la Juventud, Cuba. The results show that high penetration of renewables is technically possible even up to 100% RES although the best technological fit versus least cost options may not favor the 100% RES based systems with the current electric power system (EPS) setup. This is due to realities in access to resources, especially importation of state of the art technological equipment and biofuels, financial and investment resources, as well as the high costs of storage systems. The analysis shows the Cuban government vision of reaching 24% of RES in the electricity production by 2030 can be exceeded even up to 70% RES based systems with similar or even lower costs in the near future in Isla de la Juventud. However, overcoming critical challenges in the economic, political, and legal conditions are crucially important; how will the implementation of huge national capital investments and significant involvement of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) actualize to support achievement of the Cuban government's 2030 vision?","[Korkeakoski, Mika] Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Turku Sch Econ, Turku 20014, Finland",University of Turku,"Korkeakoski, M (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Turku Sch Econ, Turku 20014, Finland.",mika.korkeakoski@utu.fi,,,Academy of Finland; IRIS project (Integration of renewable intermittent sources in the power system) [320229],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); IRIS project (Integration of renewable intermittent sources in the power system),The author wishes to thank the Academy of Finland for funding the IRIS project (Integration of renewable intermittent sources in the power system (research project number 320229).,,59,6,6,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY,2021,10,,,,,,2862,10.3390/en14102862,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14102862,,,22,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,ST5FE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000662468300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Until 2014, the Manus station has been operated within the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) and has provided high quality radiosonde observations for temperature and water vapour. Because of its longitude and close to Equator position, the radiosonde regular launches at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC naturally coincide with Metop/IASI overpasses. Thus, IASI soundings and radiosonde observations can be co-located within a time slot of 30 min and a spatial distance of less than 50 km. Considering that radiosonde observations are limited to the troposphere and lower stratosphere, the usual analysis of spectral residuals (Observations-Calculations) yields the possibility to directly validate the spectroscopy of CO2 channels, which are sensitive to the troposphere. Furthermore, the combined use of radiosonde and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasts) analysis, to extend the radiosonde profiles in the upper atmosphere, has allowed us to check the CO2 spectroscopic consistency in spectral channels that are sensitive to the stratosphere. Our analysis shows that state-of-art CO2 spectroscopy and forward modelling have errors that are comparable or better than the IASI radiometric noise. This level of accuracy has proved to be enough for providing good CO2 retrievals. The fidelity of CO2 retrieval has been assessed by using in situ observations from the HIAPER (High-performance Instrument Airborne Platform for Environmental Research) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) flights and the Mauna Loa (Hawaii) validation station. An analysis of a four-year record of IASI soundings (2014-2017) over Mauna Loa shows that the correlation between IASI retrieved CO2 column amounts and in situ observations is 0.95. The IASI derived CO2 also shows trend and seasonality, which are consistent with those derived from in situ observations. The retrieval analysis has also been extended to N2O, which plays an important role in assessing the consistency of the forward model in the N2O/CO2 v(3) band. We have found that N2O estimated from IASI radiances is accurate enough to derive a satellite growth rate consistent with in situ observations of less than 1 ppbv per year (but with some interannual variations).

The energy consumption and relative problem need attention to search renewable energy. Energy consumption and demand are high for air conditioning mainly in hot and humid climates. Many previous studies have confirmed that technical and economical deficits associated with conventional air conditioning systems can be eliminated using liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) technologies. This paper reviews studies on liquid desiccant air conditioning. The objective of this paper is to use liquid desiccant based air conditioning regenerated by renewable energy. Thermo-physical properties liquid desiccants are first realized to use as air conditioning. Regeneration temperature of saline salt and newly organic compound viz. Glycol-water solution desiccants is in a decreasing order of LiBr, LiCl, CaCl2, LiCl-CaCl2 mixture and glycol water solution, while the dehumidification is in an increasing order of CaCl2, LiCl-CaCl2 mixture, LiCl, LiBr and Glycol-water solution respectively. Main problems using liquid desiccant saline salt solutions are corrosiveness and crystallization and these can be resolved by using glycol water solutions and ionic liquids (ILs) which are attracting attention due to low regenerative temperature, non-corrosiveness, and higher dehumidification but these are volatile, viscous, and costly than the saline salt solutions.","[Fekadu, Geleta; Subudhi, Sudhakar] IIT Roorkee, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Subudhi, S (corresponding author), IIT Roorkee, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",subudfme@iitr.ac.in,"Subudhi, Sudhakar/R-7935-2019","Fekadu, Geleta/0000-0002-7376-7734",,,,,73,54,54,2,68,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Under clear sky conditions, DSSF is particularly sensitive to the variability both in time and space of the aerosol load and chemical composition. Hitherto, this dependence has not been properly addressed by the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF), which operationally disseminates instantaneous DSSF products over the continents since 2005 considering constant aerosol conditions. In the present study, an efficient method is proposed for DSSF retrieval that will overcome the limitations of the current LSA-SAF product. This method referred to as SIRAMix (Surface Incident Radiation estimation using Aerosol Mixtures) is based upon an accurate physical parameterization coupled with a radiative transfer-based look up table of aerosol properties. SIRAMix considers a tropospheric layer composed of several major aerosol species that are conveniently mixed to reproduce real aerosol conditions as best as possible. This feature of SIRAMix allows it to provide not only accurate estimates of global DSSF but also the direct and diffuse DSSF components, which are crucial radiative terms in many climatological applications. The implementation of SIRAMix is tested in the present article using atmospheric analyses from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). DSSF estimates provided by SIRAMix are compared against instantaneous DSSF measurements taken at several ground stations belonging to several radiation measurement networks. Results show an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.6, 59.1, and 44.9 W m(-2) for global, direct, and diffuse DSSF, respectively. These scores decrease the average RMSE obtained for the current LSA-SAF product by 18.6 %, which only provides global DSSF for the time being, and, to a lesser extent, for the state of the art in the matter of DSSF retrieval (RMSE decrease of 10.9, 6.5, and 19.1% for global, direct, and diffuse DSSF with regard to the McClear algorithm). The main limitation of the proposed approach is its high sensitivity to the quality of the ECMWF aerosol inputs, which is proved to be sufficiently accurate for reanalyses but not for forecast data. Given the proximity of DSSF retrieval to the modeling of the atmospheric direct effect, SIRAMix is also able to quantify the direct radiative forcing at the surface due to a given atmospheric component (e.g., gases or aerosols).","[Ceamanos, X.; Carrer, D.; Roujean, J. -L.] Meteo France, CNRS, UMR3589, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Meteo France,"Ceamanos, X (corresponding author), Meteo France, CNRS, UMR3589, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France.",xavier.ceamanos@meteo.fr,,,EUMETSAT in the framework of the LSA-SAF project,EUMETSAT in the framework of the LSA-SAF project,"First of all, the authors feel indebted to S.

We calculate the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by applying a statistical model that uses spatial data on climate and soil. For the land use that is assumed to be replaced by energy crop production (the 'reference land-use system'), we explore a variety of options, the most important of which are cropland for food production, grassland, and natural vegetation. Calculations are also done in the case that emissions due to energy crop production are fully additional and thus no reference is considered. The results are combined with data on other emissions due to biofuels production that are derived from existing studies, resulting in total GHG emission reduction potentials for major biofuels compared with conventional fuels. The results show that N2O emissions can have an important impact on the overall GHG balance of biofuels, though there are large uncertainties. The most important ones are those in the statistical model and the GHG emissions not related to land use. Ethanol produced from sugar cane and sugar beet are relatively robust GHG savers: these biofuels change the GHG emissions by -103% to -60% (sugar cane) and -58% to -17% (sugar beet), compared with conventional transportation fuels and depending on the reference land-use system that is considered. The use of diesel from palm fruit also results in a relatively constant and substantial change of the GHG emissions by -75% to -39%. For corn and wheat ethanol, the figures are -38% to 11% and -107% to 53%, respectively. Rapeseed diesel changes the GHG emissions by -81% to 72% and soybean diesel by -111% to 44%. Optimized crop management, which involves the use of state-of-the-art agricultural technologies combined with an optimized fertilization regime and the use of nitrification inhibitors, can reduce N2O emissions substantially and change the GHG emissions by up to -135 percent points (pp) compared with conventional management. However, the uncertainties in the statistical N2O emission model and in the data on non-land-use GHG emissions due to biofuels production are large; they can change the GHG emission reduction by between -152 and 87 pp.","[Smeets, Edward M.

At a storage site, the main objectives of carbon dioxide sequestration are to maximize the volume of scCO(2) injected and minimize the leakage risk, while effectively managing formation fluid pressure buildup and the brine displaced by scCO(2). An integrated characterization-to optimization study is carried out for potential commercial-scale deep saline aquifer carbon dioxide storage proposed in western Wyoming. A three-dimensional heterogeneous reservoir model is built for which petrophysical and fluid flow parameters are populated using field characterization data and state-of-the-art laboratory measurements. The measured scCO(2) relative permeability end point is low compared to previous measurements on similar sandstones, which poses a challenge for CO2 flow, formation pressure control, and storage efficiency. By carefully selecting a set of optimal well locations, perforation intervals, and bottomhole pressure constraints that lead to maximum CO2-in-place and minimal CO2 breakthrough at the producers, an injection rate ranging from 10.8 to 15.1 Mt/year is achieved for a duration of 50 years. After scCO(2) injection ceases, up to 62% of the total injected scCO(2) can be immobilized as residual scCO(2) in 1000 years. Because of the low scCO(2) relative permeability end point, post-scCO(2)-injection chase brine operation is not found to be an effective means of enhancing residual trapping. Instead, by modulating reservoir fluid pressure, boundary conditions of the reservoir exert a more significant impact on flow. Given the same well configuration and bottomhole pressure constraints, an open reservoir with lateral background flow allows 40% additional scCO(2) injection compared to a compartmentalized system without background flow. However, background flow leads to a lower trapping efficiency - after 1000 years post-scCO(2)-injection, only 54% of the total injected scCO(2) is immobilized as residual scCO(2). This research suggests that a careful engineering design can contribute to significant CO2 storage at commercial scales while enhancing storage security. Site-specific multi-phase flow data should be measured for such a design, since for the study site, chase-brine operation is not effective when scCO(2) relative permeability is low.

Literature and empirical experience suggest this unstructured cell phone usage may have adverse impacts on student achievement and create a contagious climate of distraction and off-task behaviors. Thus, while the need for action is clear, yet, just what to do about this unstructured usage is less understood. This action research project seeks to understand student unstructured cell phone usage as well as faculty response to this potentially problematic behavior and finally move toward concrete interventions to minimize offtask behaviors and capitalize on potential benefits of cell phones as educational tools. Our research surveyed professors (lecturers) and undergraduate students at two local, private universities in the United States. Our survey confirmed that almost all students engage in off-tasks cell phone usage, that is, using cell phones for social and/or entertainment purposes. In the US context, cell phone policies that reduce student grades for off-task behaviors are the norm, yet such policies seem ineffective: our survey showed such policies are not enforced by faculty and often unperceived by students. For instance, while almost all of the faculty have an off-task cell phone policy, less than half of students even knew of the existence of such policies. Moreover, even though off-task cell phone usage is ubiquitous, only twelve percent of students reported that such punitive policies had ever resulted in a grade reduction. Clearly, the development of effective ways to discourage off-tasks behaviors and encourage on-task behaviors is needed. Our center is currently engaging in the development of friendly, multimedia ads and videos to raise student awareness of cell phone policies. We are also experimenting with offering students non-technical, unplugged ways to occupy their hands: we are implementing a program called We Heart Fiber Art (knitting and crocheting during class to create items for charitable causes) and/or offering students fidget toys. As our research shows that less than half of professors leverage cell phones for educational purposes, we are also conducting faculty workshops to familiarize faculty with educational mobile applications. Our presentation will feature the survey results as well as the results of this multi-pronged intervention in off-task cellphone usage; finally, we will elaborate on plans for future projects.","[Batch, B.; Nakonechnyi, A.; Roberts, J.] Mt St Joseph Univ, Cincinnati, OH 45233 USA; [Allen, R.] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",Mount St. Joseph University; University of Cincinnati,"Batch, B (corresponding author), Mt St Joseph Univ, Cincinnati, OH 45233 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,6,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-09-17939-8,INTED PROC,,,2020,,,,,3171,3171,,,,,,1,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BP5RO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000558088803036,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, rising concerns on energy security and climate change in recent years have focused attention on using alternative sources of energy such as bio-fuels. Biofuels are produced from renewable resources, particularly plant-derived materials, and its production provides an alternative nonfossil fuel without the need to redesign current engine technology. This study presents an experimental investigation into the effects of using bio-diesel blends on diesel engine performance and its emissions. The bio-diesel fuels were produced from sunflower oil using the transesterification process with low molecular weight alcohols and sodium hydroxide then tested on a steady state engine test rig using a four cylinder Compression Ignition (CI) engine. The paper also shows how by blending bio-diesel with diesel fuel harmful gas emissions can be reduced while maintaining similar performance output and efficiency. Production optimization was achieved by changing the variables which included methanol/oil molar ratio, NaOH catalyst concentration, reaction time, reaction temperature, and rate of mixing to maximize bio-diesel yield. In addition, a second-order model was developed to predict the bio-diesel yield if the production criteria is known. It was determined that the catalyst concentration and molar ratio of methanol to sunflower oil were the most influential variables affecting percentage conversion to fuel.","[Ali, J.

We study a new instrument design, using a constant magnetic field generated by two permanent magnets, to analyze solar wind protons and alpha-particles with high time resolution. We determine the optimal configuration of the instrument in terms of aperture size, sensor position, pixel size and magnetic field strength. We conduct this analysis based on analytical calculations and SIMION simulations of the particle trajectories in our instrument. We evaluate the velocity resolution of the instrument as well as Poisson errors associated with finite counting statistics. Our instrument is able to resolve Maxwellian and kappa-distributions for both protons and alpha-particles. This method retrieves measurements of the moments (density, bulk speed and temperature) with a relative error below 1%. Our instrument design achieves these results with an acquisition time of only 5 ms, significantly faster than state-of-the-art electrostatic analyzers. Although the instrument only acquires one-dimensional cuts of the distribution function in velocity space, the simplicity and reliability of the presented instrument concept are two key advantages of our new design.","[Criton, Benjamin; Nicolaou, Georgios; Verscharen, Daniel] Univ Coll London, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; [Nicolaou, Georgios] Southwest Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78238 USA; [Verscharen, Daniel] Univ New Hampshire, Space Sci Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Criton, Benjamin] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, IRFU, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",University of London; University College London; Southwest Research Institute; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Criton, B (corresponding author), Univ Coll London, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England.;Criton, B (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, IRFU, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",benjamin.criton.19@ucl.ac.uk; g.nicolaou@ucl.ac.uk; d.verscharen@ucl.ac.uk,,"Verscharen, Daniel/0000-0002-0497-1096; Criton, Benjamin/0000-0001-9417-2978; Nicolaou, Georgios/0000-0003-3623-4928","STFC Consolidated Grant [ST/S000240/1]; STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowship [ST/P003826/1]; STFC [ST/P003826/1, ST/S000240/1] Funding Source: UKRI",STFC Consolidated Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),This research was partly funded by STFC Consolidated Grant ST/S000240/1 and STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowship ST/P003826/1.,,32,3,3,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Markus",,,The influence of increasing water turbidity on the sea surface temperature in the Baltic Sea: A model sensitivity study,JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Baltic Sea; Ocean modeling; Water turbidity; SST trends; Secchi depth,OCEAN CIRCULATION; COASTAL WATERS; SATELLITE DATA; CLIMATE; PHYTOPLANKTON; PERFORMANCE; DEPTH; TRENDS; SECCHI,"The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of enhanced absorption of sunlight at the sea surface due to increasing water turbidity and its effect on the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Baltic Sea. The major question behind our investigations is, whether this effect needs to be included in Baltic Sea circulation models or can be neglected. Our investigations cover both, mean state and SST trends during the recent decades. To quantify the impact of water turbidity on the mean state different sensitivity ocean hind-cast experiments are performed. The state-of-the art ocean model RCO (Rossby Centre Ocean model) is used to simulate the period from 1962 to 2007. In the first simulation, a spatially and temporally constant value for the attenuation depth is used, while in the second experiment a climatological monthly mean, spatially varying attenuation coefficient is derived from satellite observations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. The inclusion of a spatially varying light attenuation leads to significant SST changes during summer. Maximum values of + 0.5 K are reached in the Gulf of Finland and close to the eastern coasts, when compared to a fixed attenuation of visible light of 0.2 m(-1). The temperature anomalies basically match the pattern of increased light attenuation with strongest effects in shallow waters. Secondary effects due to changes in the current system are of minor importance. Similar results are obtained when considering trends. In the absence of long-term basin wide observations of attenuation coefficients, some idealizations have to be applied when investigating the possible influence of long-term changes in water turbidity on the SST. Two additional sensitivity experiments are based on a combination of long-term Secchi depth station observations and the present day pattern of water turbidity, as observed by satellite. We show the potential of increased water turbidity to affect the summer SST trends in the Baltic Sea significantly, while the estimated effect is apparently too small to explain the overall extreme summer trends observed in the Baltic Sea.

Photovoltaic (PV) collector is commonly used for renewable energy, but the efficiency is constrained by the PV module temperature. The combination of GSHP and photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) is promising to improve the performance of both individual technologies. A comprehensive review has been conducted to present the state-of-the-art of the hybrid PVT-GSHP, in terms of the principles, configurations, and functions. The basic PVT-GSHP systems are classified into four categories: the hybrid PVT-GSHP with PVT for direct heating, the hybrid PVT-GSHP with PVT for temperature increasing, the hybrid PVT-GSHP with multiple energy sources, and the hybrid-GSHP with energy storage/borehole recharge. These hybrid systems can be further combined to achieve advanced hybrid PVT-GSHP systems with more functions and improved performance. For the hybrid PVT-GSHP with PVT for direct heating, preheating and full heating have been used; the preheating yields a higher PV efficiency while the full heating recovers more heat. The hybrid PVT-GSHP with PVT for temperature increasing is more widely adopted, with both PVT electrical efficiency and GSHP heating efficiency significantly improved. For the hybrid PVT-GSHP with multiple energy sources, the current systems were limited to the integration of an air source heat pump as an additional heat source or a cooling tower as an additional heat sink. The hybrid PVT-GSHP with energy storage/ground recharge received the most intensive investigations owing to the reduced thermal imbalance and thus enhanced long-term performance. While most studies used normal flat-plate PVT, advanced collectors including concentrating PVT, building-integrated PVT, and solar-road PVT have also been studied. To facilitate performance improvement and application promotion, some perspectives on future development are presented: (1) advanced ground heat exchangers, i.e., energy geo-structures including the energy pile, energy wall, and energy tunnel; (2) advanced PVT types, i.e., more involvements in the high-temperature PVT and building-integrated PVT; (3) advanced hybrid systems, including driving sorption chillers, regenerating desiccant dehumidifiers, charging thermal batteries; and (4) optimal design and operation, considering local soil properties (e.g. seepage) and climate conditions through transient modeling. This study can facilitate future research, development, and promotion of the hybrid PVT-GSHP technology towards low-carbon buildings.","[You, Tian; Liu, Jiankun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [You, Tian; Liu, Jiankun] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wei] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hongxing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xianting] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Architecture, Dept Bldg Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Tsinghua University,"You, T (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",youtian@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Wu, Wei/0000-0002-9657-6682","Sun Yat-Sen University [76140-18841230, 2021qntd15]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2021A1515011739, 2020A1515110391, 2020B1515120083]; City University of Hong Kong [9610408]",Sun Yat-Sen University; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding support from Sun Yat-Sen University (76140-18841230 and 2021qntd15) , Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515011739, 2020A1515110391 and 2020B1515120083) and City University of Hong Kong (9610408) .",,125,12,12,29,83,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

The project is therefore focused to speed up the implementation of European Directive on Energy Performance in Buildings, EPBD (2002/91/EC), in Member States at local government level and to ensure its operability, within the various national legislations of reference. Educa-RUE lasted 30 months, from January 2008 to June 2010, and involved the following eight partners: for Italy, Provinces of Potenza (project leader), Perugia, Rieti and Palermo; for other Countries, Climate Energy Ltd. Essex and Energy Solutions North West London (UK), Associacion Aragonesa de Entidades Locales ASAEL (Spain), Municipality of Prenzlau (Germany). A number of closely interconnected actions were carried on in eight Work Packages (WPs) to face the energy efficiency aspects identified as primary problems by the partners. The project developed a model process, known as Educa-RUE method, to assess possible policies of intervention on educational buildings, owned or managed by each Partner. In particular the Province of Perugia, leader of WP 2 and 5, provided guide lines and tools in order to: identify the state of the art of EPBD implementation and the main non-technological barriers, which are preventing its application at local level; select, within the Province/area patrimony, the most suitable educational building, to be used as a shining example to develop the following testing phases of the project; carry on an energy check, or audit, of selected buildings, by involving the educational community as user and active participant in the whole process; elaborate an executive project, concerning the description of all the building elements (structure, roof, heating/cooling plants, etc.) which need to be replaced/improved and the application of an energy/environmental assessment; plan refurbishing interventions for the rest of the school buildings directly managed by each Partner, according to specific priority selection criteria, which represents a guiding and coordinating act for those Administrations directly or indirectly interested in the Project. This paper presents the results obtained by testing and proving Educa-RUE method in different regional areas. Its findings can be extended to other building typologies in order to create a reference model for local planners and responsible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is expected that with climate changes the wildland fire and WUI fire problem will only intensify. The spot fire ignition of a wildland fire by hot (solid, molten or burning) metal fragments/sparks and firebrands (flaming or glowing embers) is an important fire ignition pathway by which wildfires, WUI fires, and fires in industrial settings are started and may propagate. There are numerous cases reported of wildfires started by hot metal particles from clashing power-lines, or generated by machines, grinding and welding. Once the wildfire or structural fire has been ignited and grows, it can spread rapidly through ember spotting, where pieces of burning material (e.g. branches, bark, building materials, etc.) are lofted by the plume of the fire and then transported forward by the wind landing where they can start spot fires downwind. The spot fire problem can be separated in several individual processes: the generation of the particles (metal or firebrand) and their thermochemical state; their flight by plume lofting and wind drag and the particle thermo-chemical change during the flight; the onset of ignition (smoldering or flaming) of the fuel after the particle lands on the fuel; and finally, the sustained ignition and burning of the combustible material. Here an attempt has been made to summarize the state of the art of the wildfire spotting problem by describing the distinct individual processes involved in the problem and by discussing their know-how status. Emphasis is given to those areas that the author is more familiar with, due to his work on the subject. By characterizing these distinct individual processes, it is possible to attain the required information to develop predictive, physics-base wildfire spotting models. Such spotting models, together with topographical maps and wind models, could be added to existing flame spread models to improve the predictive capabilities of landscape-scale wildland fire spread models. These enhanced wildland fire spread models would provide land managers and government agencies with better tools to prescribe preventive measures and fuels treatments before a fire, and allocate suppression resources and issue evacuation orders during a fire.","[Fernandez-Pello, A.

MFCs are bioreactors that can convert the chemical energy present in organic compounds into electrical energy. Presently, the literature shows that current and power yields are relatively low, but improvements in the technology can enhance these parameters as well as the efficiency of these cells. Sediment MFCs in powering low-powered electronic monitoring devices is one of the practical uses of MFCs. Additionally, MFCs can be used in implantable medical devices and wastewater treatment plants.

However, tropical forests are only weakly seasonal compared with temperate and boreal regions. For species with limited ability to control core body temperature, even mild climatic variation can determine major behavioural outcomes, such as foraging and predator avoidance. In tropical forests, sloths are the arboreal vertebrate attaining the greatest biomass density, but their capacity to regulate body temperature is limited, relying on behavioural adaptations to thermoregulate. Sloths are largely or strictly nocturnal, and depend on crypsis to avoid predation. The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a sloth-specialist and exerts strong top-down control over its prey species. Yet the role of environmental variables on the regulation of predator-prey interactions between sloths and harpy eagles are unknown. The harpy eagle is considered Near Threatened. This motivated a comprehensive effort to reintroduce this species into parts of Mesoamerica. This effort incidentally enabled us to understand the prey profile of harpy eagles over multiple seasons. Methods: Our study was conducted between 2003 and 2009 at SoberanIa National Park, Panama. Telemetered harpy eagles were seen hunting and feeding on individual prey species. For each predation event, field assistants systematically recorded the species killed. We analysed the effects of climatic conditions and vegetation phenology on the prey species profile of harpy eagles using generalised linear mixed models. Results: Here we show that sloth predation by harpy eagles was negatively affected by nocturnal ambient light (i.e. bright moonshine) and positively affected by seasonally cool temperatures. We suggest that the first ensured low detectability conditions for sloths foraging at night and the second posed a thermally unsuitable climate that forced sloths to forage under riskier daylight. We showed that even moderate seasonal variation in temperature can influence the relationship between a keystone tropical forest predator and a dominant prey item. Therefore, predator-prey ecology in the tropics can be modulated by subtle changes in environmental conditions. The seasonal effects shown here suggest important demographic consequences for sloths, which are under top-down regulation from harpy eagle predation, perhaps limiting their geographic distribution at higher latitudes.","[de Miranda, Everton B.

The main function of a sprayed membrane from a waterproofing perspective is to provide crack bridging and hence prevent flow of liquid water into the tunnel through cracks and imperfections in the concrete material. However, moisture can migrate through the concrete and EVA-based membrane materials by capillary and vapor diffusion mechanisms. These moisture transport mechanisms can have an influence on the degree of saturation, and may influence the pore pressures in the concrete material as well as risk of freeze-thaw damage of the concrete and membrane. The paper describes a detailed study of moisture transport material parameters, moisture condition in tunnel linings and climatic conditions tunnels in hard rock in Norway. These data have been included in a hygrothermal simulation model in the software WUFI for moisture transport to substantiate moisture transport and long-term effects on saturation of the concrete and membrane material. The findings suggest that EVA-based membranes exhibit significant water absorption and vapor transport properties although they are impermeable to liquid water flow. State-of-the-art sprayed concrete material applied with the wet mix method exhibits very low hydraulic conductivities, lower than 10(-14) m/s, thus saturated conductive water flow is a very unlikely dominant transport mechanism. Moisture transport through the lining structure by capillary flow and vapor diffusion are calculated to approximately 3 cm(3)/m(2) per day for lining thicknesses in the range of 25-35 cm and seasonal Nordic climate variations. The calculated moisture contents in the tunnel linings from the hygrothermal simulations are largely in agreement with the measured moisture contents in the tunnel linings. The findings also indicate that the concrete material exhibits a reduction of saturation on the immediate inside of the membrane. Near the location of the waterproofing membrane on either side, the concrete material exhibits degrees of capillary saturation between 85 and 95 %. Moisture content in the membrane is found to be consistently in the range of 12-17 % by weight, corresponding to a degree of saturation of 30-35 %. Possible effects of such moisture contents are lower risk of freezing degradation, higher tensile bonding strengths at the membrane interfaces, and a reduced risk of pore pressure in the concrete material.","[Holter, Karl Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geol & Mineral Resources Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Geving, Stig] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Holter, KG (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geol & Mineral Resources Engn, SemSaelandsvei 1, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",karl-gunnar.holter@ntnu.no; stig.geving@ntnu.no,,"Geving, Stig/0000-0002-0956-2937",Norwegian National Rail Administration; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; BASF Construction Chemicals Europe AG; Orica International Ltd,Norwegian National Rail Administration; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; BASF Construction Chemicals Europe AG(BASF); Orica International Ltd,"Professor Sverre Smeplass of NTNU is acknowledged for having contributed substantially with points of view during the testing and analysis of the sprayed concrete material as well as critically reviewing the manuscript.

Predicting the rainfall not just at the national level, but at the regional level is an important task. In this article, we used a deep neural network, namely, the stacked autoencoder to automatically identify climatic factors that are capable of predicting the rainfall over the homogeneous regions of India. An ensemble regression tree model is used for monsoon prediction using the identified climatic predictors. The proposed model provides forecast of the monsoon at a long lead time which supports the government to implement appropriate policies for the economic growth of the country. The monsoon of the central, north-east, north-west, and south-peninsular India regions are predicted with errors of 4.1%, 5.1%, 5.5%, and 6.4%, respectively. The identified predictors show high skill in predicting the regional monsoon having high variability. The proposed model is observed to be competitive with the state-of-the-art prediction models.","[Saha, Moumita; Mitra, Pabitra] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Nanjundiah, Ravi S.] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Nanjundiah, Ravi S.] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Saha, Moumita; Nanjundiah, Ravi S.] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Saha, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.;Saha, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",moumita.saha2012@gmail.com,,"Saha, Moumita/0000-0001-7396-8600",department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur; Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore,department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur; Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore,"We gratefully acknowledge department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, for providing all the supports for carrying out the work.

Forecasting daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual data for different locations with varying observation/data samples remains challenging with a single forecasting algorithm. We presented the ensemble-based k-nearest neighbor algorithm for wind and solar power forecasting in this study to respond to the challenges mentioned above. The included k-NNC deep architecture provides nonlinear modeling complexity in solar and wind energy, enabling a more precise estimate of spatial solar and wind energy patterns. Makowski metric analysis was employed to train and optimize the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The chi-square distance was used to theoretically assess the goodness of fit of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm between expected and observed values. The 5-fold crossvalidation method was utilized to estimate the accurate lasso-penalty strength for high-dimensional solar/ wind data. The ensemble forecasts were combined using 5-fold cross-validation to improve generalization performance, minimizing over-fitting induced by base model correlation. For daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual solar and wind power forecasting, two different climate areas and four distinct experimental setups are presented. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed k-nearest neighbor technique is validated using three performance assessment indices and four existing forecasting models. The mean absolute error of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm generalized linear regression model, one-step-secant backpropagation neural network, decision tree, and BFGS Quasi-Newton backpropagation neural network for solar and wind power forecasting was measured at 1.16, 5.59, 4.22, 1.70, 3.23, and 8.60, 15.81, 40.64, 0.56, and 15.04, respectively. Utilities can anticipate down- and up-ramps in variable renewable energy generation by introducing the k-nearest neighbor algorithm into power system operations, allowing them to cost-effectively balance renewable energy production and load on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual basis. This will improve power system dependability, reduce fuel costs, and limit the use of solar and wind resources.","[Ahmad, Tanveer] Jinan Univ, Int Energy Coll, Energy & Elect Res Ctr, Zhuhai 519070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Manzoor, Sohaib] Mirpur Univ Sci & Technol MUST, Dept Elect Engn, New Mirpur 10250, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan; [Zhang, Dongdong] Guangxi Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Guangxi University,"Ahmad, T (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Int Energy Coll, Energy & Elect Res Ctr, Zhuhai 519070, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",tanveer.ahmad.pk11@gmail.com,"Zhang, Dongdong/J-2354-2019; Ahmad, Tanveer/AAD-7228-2020","Zhang, Dongdong/0000-0002-7889-2577; Ahmad, Tanveer/0000-0001-7307-7947","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51977077]; Key Laboratory of Special Machine and High Voltage Apparatus Shenyang University of Technology, Ministry of Education, China [KFKT202006]; Guangxi Young and Middle-aged Scientific Research Basic Ability Promotion Project, China [2020KY01009]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Special Machine and High Voltage Apparatus Shenyang University of Technology, Ministry of Education, China; Guangxi Young and Middle-aged Scientific Research Basic Ability Promotion Project, China","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51977077) ; Key Laboratory of Special Machine and High Voltage Apparatus Shenyang University of Technology, Ministry of Education, China (NO.

Model simulations span a duration of 15 years applying tidal boundary forcing only and two bed sediment compositions; single (d(50)=0.2 mm)- and multiple (mud, fine-sand (0.25 mm) and coarse-sand (0.60 mm))-fractions. Finally, the effect of the initial distribution of sediment fractions is investigated. Application of the multiple sediment fractions resulted in strong sediment import into the Ley Bay in contrast with the case for a single sediment fraction. Temporal and spatial evolution of larger-scale basin elements (e.g. channels, tidal flats) indicate that the impact of the peninsula is better predicted using the multiple sediment approach. Agreement between the predicted morphology and the data is fair in deep water areas (> 3 m) compared to the shallow water areas (< 2 m) in the bay. These predictions are further improved after application of an initially distributed bed sediment composition. Therefore, the optimal prediction of the anthropogenic effect is obtained under the latter case implying the requirement of applying a stable bed sediment composition in line with the imposed boundary forcings. On-going work focuses on more detailed bed configuration around the peninsula (e.g. including possible dredging and dumping effects) and the wave boundary forcing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Charged atmospheric clusters can be measured with air ion spectrometers, but typical state-of-the-art condensation particle counters, which detect both neutral and charged clusters, only see particles larger than 2.5 nm in diameter. In this study we present a modified pulse-height condensation particle counter (PH-CPC) and confirm by laboratory verification that it is capable of detecting charged clusters with electrical mobility equivalent diameter down to similar to 1 nm. We show how the detection efficiency and the pulse heights depend on the calibration particle size, polarity and composition. The effect of butanol supersaturation on the PH-CPC counting efficiency is also discussed.

However, modeling of adsorption chillers is challenging due to the intrinsic process dynamics. Currently, adsorption chillers are most often represented by 1-d, lumped-parameter models that use lumped models for all components but resolve the heat exchangers in one spatial dimension. Still, accurate simulations require fine discretization leading to poor computational efficiency. To increase computational efficiency, here, an alternative modeling approach is proposed that avoids discretization by applying operator splitting. The benefits of the proposed modeling approach are demonstrated in two real-world case studies. First, the resulting adsorption chiller model is calibrated and validated with experimental data of a lab-scale one-bed adsorption chiller: The proposed model retains the accuracy of a state-of-the-art model while increasing computational efficiency by up to 70%. Second, the proposed model is applied to a commercial two-bed adsorption chiller with excellent accuracy. Finally, the validity of model is tested by varying the ratio between the overall heat transfer coefficient and the heat capacity rate of the fluid in the heat exchangers.

CO2 sequestration using calcium-rich wastes has been extensively studied since calcium carbonate (CaCO3) can be produced for various. In this review, the gaps between carbon capture technologies and carbonation are thoroughly discussed. Direct carbonation which involves the carbonation of calcium rich particles using CO2 should be integrated with adsorption, membrane gas separation and cryogenic separation. Wet carbonation should be integrated with absorption and further adjusted to control the particle size and polymorphs. Among the polymorphs, amorphous CaCO3 nanoparticles have drawn great attention due to their large surface area. The modification of CaCO3 was then reviewed for increasing demand of hydrophobic CaCO3. There are technical gaps exist in CCUS using CaCO3, but the current scientific studies proposed some practical strategies for its implementation at large scale with economic feasibility. Membrane technology and alternative absorbent can enhance gas absorption to meet the requirement of wet carbonation for process integration. The economy potential of CaCO3 should be elevated through particle size reduction, surface area enlargement and chemical functionalisation.","[Tan, Why-Ling; Ahmad, A. L.; Leo, C.

Whereas its main field of application is into biofuels and bioenergy products, recent developments have shown the potential of microalgae biomass for product manufacturing, including Metal Working Fluids (MWF). The environmental impact of such products, as compared to fossil-based alternatives, remains however questionable as there is a knowledge gap in published literature on the topic. This paper presents a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of microalgae-based MWF, the first of its kind to our best knowledge. Primary life cycle inventories data were collected related to the production of microalgae oil from two distinct algae species, Nannochloropsis gaditana and Acutodesmus obliquus. The inventory considered the cultivation over four seasons into open raceway photobioreactor and into close vertical photobioreactor. The LCA results were then compared with the LCA of rapeseed oil-based MWF and conventional mineral oil-based MWF, to identify optimization levers.The study demonstrates that major improvements are needed to make the microalgae-based MWF process better from an environmental standpoint than its vegetable and mineral alternatives. Depending on algae species impacts from vegetable and mineral alternatives are 55-95% lower on Climate Change, 20-95% lower on Water use, and 85-95% lower on Fossil resource use. Electricity consumption during the cultivation and harvest stages, fertiliser and nutrient consumptions are the most significant contributors to environmental impacts. LCA results were found to be highly sensitive to the scenarios assessed, the background electricity mix and the allocation choices on co-products from the production of microalgae oil.","[Guiton, Melanie; Baustert, Paul; Soukoulis, Christos; Serchi, Tommaso; Cambier, Sebastien; Benetto, Enrico] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Suarez-Montes, David] Neoalgae Micro Seaweed Prod, Calle Carmen Leal Mata 191, Gijon 33211, Asturias, Spain; [Sanchez, Ruben] SVMAC, Calle Pedro Puig Adam, Asturias 33203, Spain; [Okan, Burcu Saner] Sabanci Univ, Integrated Mfg Technol Res & Applicat Ctr, Teknopk Istanbul, TR-34906 Pendik Istanbul, Turkey; [Okan, Burcu Saner] Sabanci Univ, Composite Technol Ctr Excellence, Teknopk Istanbul, TR-34906 Pendik Istanbul, Turkey; [Okan, Burcu Saner] Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology; Sabanci University; Sabanci University; Sabanci University,"Guiton, M (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",melanie.guiton@list.lu,"Benetto, Enrico/H-3234-2012; Soukoulis, Christos/G-7715-2011","Benetto, Enrico/0000-0003-1159-9162; Soukoulis, Christos/0000-0003-2288-0910; Cambier, Sebastien/0000-0001-7761-5212; Guiton, Melanie/0000-0003-0605-6163; Serchi, Tommaso/0000-0003-2386-3514",M-ERA.NET project ENVALGRA Development of a new generation of environmentally friendly microalgal oil-based functional fluids modified with graphene family nanomaterials - Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) [11760590],M-ERA.NET project ENVALGRA Development of a new generation of environmentally friendly microalgal oil-based functional fluids modified with graphene family nanomaterials - Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR),This research was funded by the M-ERA.NET project ENVALGRA Development of a new generation of environmentally friendly microalgal oil-based functional fluids modified with graphene family nanomaterials -supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) (Project code11760590).,,59,3,3,6,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Since the solar activity commonly displays very interesting non-stationary and multiscale dynamics, the magnetospheric response also exhibits a high degree of dynamical complexity associated with fundamentally different characteristics during periods of quiescence and magnetic storms. The resulting temporal complexity profile has been explored using several approaches from applied statistics, dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics. Here, we propose an alternative way of looking at time-varying dynamical complexity of nonlinear geophysical time series utilising subtle but significant changes in the linear autocorrelation structure of the recorded data. Our approach is demonstrated to sensitively trace the dynamic signatures associated with intense magnetic storms, and to display reasonable skills in distinguishing between quiescence and storm periods. The potentials and methodological limitations of this new viewpoint are discussed in some detail.","[Donner, R.

We propose a rooftop farm system called BIG GRO where air enriched with carbon dioxide (CO2) produced through respiration from indoor spaces is applied through existing ventilation systems to produce a fertilization effect and increased plant growth. CO2 measurements were taken inside 20 classrooms and at two exhaust vents on a rooftop at Boston University in Boston, MA. Exhausted air was directed toward spinach and corn and plant biomass and leaf number were analyzed. High concentrations of CO2 persisted inside classrooms and at rooftop exhaust vents in correlation with expected human occupancy. CO2 levels averaged 1,070 and 830 parts per million (ppm), reaching a maximum of 4,470 and 1,300 ppm CO2 indoors and at exhaust vents, respectively. The biomass of spinach grown next to exhaust air increased fourfold compared to plants grown next to a control fan applying atmospheric air. High wind speed from fans decreased growth by approximately twofold. The biomass of corn, a C4 plant, experienced a two to threefold increase, indicating that alternative environmental factors, such as temperature, likely contribute to growth enhancement. Enhancing growth in rooftop farms using indoor air would help increase yield and help crops survive harsh conditions, which would make their installation in cities more feasible.","[Buckley, Sarabeth; Sparks, Rebecca; Cowdery, Elizabeth; Phillips, Nathan] Boston Univ, Earth & Environm Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stirling, Finn] Harvard Univ, Syst Biol Dept, Boston, MA USA; [Marsching, Jane] Massachusetts Coll Art & Design, Sustainabil Studio, Boston, MA USA",Boston University; Harvard University; Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Massachusetts College Art & Design,"Buckley, S (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Earth & Environm Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",sb2481@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,111,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

One promising approach is to exploit the climatic conditions to reduce the thermal load of buildings by using selective measures. Previous studies only qualitatively analyzed the potential of using selective measures. In this paper, four meteorological variables (i.e., dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, sky temperature, and solar irradiance) that determine the energy-saving potential of selective measures were identified and a methodology was proposed to evaluate the energy-saving potential associated with these variables through building energy simulation. This methodology was then applied to a three-story medium-sized office building in 16 climate zones across the U.S. as a demonstration. It was found that the potential of utilizing the dry-bulb temperature gradually increases (14.4%-95.9%) from south to north. The potential of utilizing the wet-bulb temperature (35.0%-100.0%) and sky temperature (25.5%-98.6%) increases from south to north and from the east side to the west side of the Rocky Mountains.

Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach for tracking drought changes with high resolution and an instantaneous response. However, the application of remote sensing drought indices derived from optical and infrared bands has been constrained due to cloud contamination. Here the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), a multi-sensor microwave remote sensing drought index integrating state-of-the-art multiple satellite microwave-derived precipitation, soil moisture and land surface temperature information, was processed to improve the meteorological drought monitoring capability of satellite remote sensing. The index was evaluated against the 1 to 12 month field-based drought indicators Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapo-transpiration Index (SPEI) and anomalies in the satellite-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 1998 to 2014. MIDI with an optimal ensemble of multiple satellite precipitation products showed a better improvement in meteorological drought monitoring capability than MIDI based on an individual satellite precipitation dataset, and had statistically strong correlation in particular with 1 month SPI/SPEI over a wide range of bio-climatic zones spanning from arid to humid. Moreover it showed significantly higher correlations with EVI anomalies than SPI/SPEI. The results demonstrated the reliability and superiority of MIDI in monitoring meteorological drought with the ability to work in all weather conditions. Therefore, MIDI provides a gateway to employing satellite microwave remote sensing for reliable meteorological drought monitoring, with the potential for long-term drought assessments as well as near-real-time drought monitoring using operational satellites.","[Zhang, Anzhi; Jia, Gensuo] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East A, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hesong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Beijing Forestry University","Jia, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East A, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",jiong@tea.ac.cn,"Jia, Gensuo/AAL-2681-2020; Zhang, Anzhi/D-1080-2014","Jia, Gensuo/0000-0001-5950-9555; Zhang, Anzhi/0000-0002-1676-2240","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0600303]; National Science Foundation of China [41590853, 41305106]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was jointly supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFA0600303) and the National Science Foundation of China (41590853 and 41305106).

Particularly, RoadVecNet contains two UNet networks. The first network with powerful representation capability can obtain more coherent and satisfactory road segmentation maps even under a complex urban set-up. The second network is linked to the first network to vectorize road networks by utilizing all of the previously generated feature maps. We utilize a loss function called focal loss weighted by median frequency balancing (MFB_FL) to focus on the hard samples, fix the training data imbalance problem, and improve the road extraction and vectorization performance. A new module named dense dilated spatial pyramid pooling, which combines the benefit of cascaded modules with atrous convolution and atrous spatial pyramid pooling, is designed to produce more scale features over a broader range. Two types of high-resolution remote sensing datasets, namely, aerial and Google Earth imagery, were used for road segmentation and road vectorization tasks. Classification results indicate that the RoadVecNet outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based networks with 92.51% and 93.40% F1 score for road surface segmentation and 89.24% and 92.41% F1 score for road vectorization from the aerial and Google Earth road datasets, respectively. In addition, the proposed method outperforms the other comparative methods in terms of qualitative results and produces high-resolution road segmentation and vectorization maps. As a conclusion, the presented method demonstrates that considering topological quality may result in improvement of the final road network, which is essential in various applications, such as GIS database updating.","[Abdollahi, Abolfazl; Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol Sydney UTS, CAMGIS, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Earth Observat Ctr, Inst Climate Change, Bangi, Sekangor, Malaysia; [Alamri, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geol & Geophys, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Technology Sydney; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; King Saud University,"Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney UTS, CAMGIS, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Earth Observat Ctr, Inst Climate Change, Bangi, Sekangor, Malaysia.",biswajeet24@gmail.com,"Abdollahi, Abolfazl/U-4187-2019; Pradhan, Biswajeet/E-8226-2010","Abdollahi, Abolfazl/0000-0002-1704-4670; Pradhan, Biswajeet/0000-0001-9863-2054","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2021/14]; Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University); Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney","The Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney funded this research.

It is highly reactive in the air, and its degradation favours the generation of ozone (in the presence of NOx) and secondary organic aerosols. A critical aspect of BVOC emission modelling is the representation of land use and land cover (LULC). The current emission inventories are usually based on land cover maps that are either modelled and dynamic or satellite-based and static. In this study, we use the state-of-the-art Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) model coupled with the canopy model MOHYCAN (Model for Hydrocarbon emissions by the CANopy) to generate and evaluate emission inventories relying on satellite-based LULC maps at annual time steps. To this purpose, we first intercompare the distribution and evolution (2001-2016) of tree coverage from three global satellite-based datasets, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), ESA Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI-LC), and the Global Forest Watch (GFW), and from national inventories. Substantial differences are found between the datasets; e.g. the global areal coverage of trees ranges from 30 to 50 x 10(6) km(2), with trends spanning from -0.26 to +0.03 % yr(-1) between 2001 and 2016. At the national level, the increasing trends in forest cover reported by some national inventories (in particular for the US) are contradicted by all remotely sensed datasets. To a great extent, these discrepancies stem from the plurality of definitions of forest used. According to some local censuses, clear cut areas and seedling or young trees are classified as forest, while satellite-based mappings of trees rely on a minimum height. Three inventories of isoprene emissions are generated, differing only in their LULC datasets used as input: (i) the static distribution of the stand-alone version of MEGAN, (ii) the time-dependent MODIS land cover dataset, and (iii) the MODIS dataset modified to match the tree cover distribution from the GFW database. The mean annual isoprene emissions (350-520 Tg yr(-1)) span a wide range due to differences in tree distributions, especially in isoprene-rich regions. The impact of LULC changes is a mitigating effect ranging from 0.04 to 0.33 % yr(-1) on the positive trends (0.94 % yr(-1)) mainly driven by temperature and solar radiation. This study highlights the uncertainty in spatial distributions of and temporal variability in isoprene associated with remotely sensed LULC datasets. The interannual variability in the emissions is evaluated against spaceborne observations of formaldehyde (HCHO), a major isoprene oxidation product, through simulations using the global chemistry transport model (CTM) IMAGESv2. A high correlation (R > 0.8) is found between the observed and simulated interannual variability in HCHO columns in most forested regions. The implementation of LULC change has little impact on this correlation due to the dominance of meteorology as a driver of short-term interannual variability. Nevertheless, the simulation accounting for the large tree cover declines of the GFW database over several regions, notably Indonesia and Mato Grosso in Brazil, provides the best agreement with the HCHO column trends observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Overall, our study indicates that the continuous tree cover fields at fine resolution provided by the GFW database are our preferred choice for constraining LULC (in combination with discrete LULC maps such as those of MODIS) in biogenic isoprene emission models.","[Opacka, Beata; Muller, Jean-Francois; Stavrakou, Trissevgeni; Bauwens, Maite] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron BIRA IASB, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Sindelarova, Katerina; Markova, Jana] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Atmospher Phys, Prague, Czech Republic; [Markova, Jana] Czech Hydrometeorol Inst CHMI, Sabatce 17, Prague 14306 4, Czech Republic; [Guenther, Alex B.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Charles University Prague; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Opacka, B; Muller, JF (corresponding author), Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron BIRA IASB, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.",beata.opacka@aeronomie.be; jfm@aeronomie.be,"; Sindelarova, Katerina/F-8364-2019","Markova, Jana/0000-0002-1231-1135; Sindelarova, Katerina/0000-0003-0774-6078; Guenther, Alex/0000-0001-6283-8288",Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) through the STEREO III programme [SR/00/373]; PRODEX TROVA (2019-2020) project - European Space Agency via the Belgian Science Policy Office,Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) through the STEREO III programme; PRODEX TROVA (2019-2020) project - European Space Agency via the Belgian Science Policy Office,"This research was supported by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) through the STEREO III programme (ALBERI - Assessing Links between Biogenic Emissions and Remotely-sensed photosynthesis Indicators, contract no.

Thus human comfort is measured according to three categories of energy, climate, and artificial environment (building and city). The everyday life environment of human in which s/he is immobile and or in move is a space that can be favorable and or intolerable. On the other hand, creating sense of peace and comfort in individual at high levels is related to sense of security in individuals since sense of security may automatically overshadow other human's requirements and in the case of sense of insecurity, most of senses in human will be reduced and or eliminated. Therefore, it is tried in this article to concern with security as one of the foremost environmental effects on human's health. To this end, primarily it has been dealt with definition of urban space on the one hand and security on the other hand. Then, after classification of security, the role of urban spaces in sense of insecurity will be explored and finally a case example is proposed that covers security in world comprehensively.","[Moosavi, Seyed Mohammad Reza] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Khomein Branch, Khomein, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Moosavi, SMR (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Khomein Branch, Khomein, Iran.",m_moosavi_architect@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,ISTANBUL KULTUR UNIV,ISTANBUL,"ATAKOY CAMPUS, BAKIRKOY, ISTANBUL, 34156, TURKEY",2146-5193,,,TURK ONLINE J DES AR,Turk.

This idea has in fact been applied in a few studies in order to provide quantitative estimates of the aerosol optical depth after some of the major volcanic eruptions that occurred during the past 500 years. In this study we critically review this approach and come to the conclusion that the uncertainties in the estimated aerosol optical depths are so large that the values have to be considered questionable. We show that several auxiliary parameters - which are typically poorly known for historic eruptions - can have a similar effect on the red-green colour ratio as a change in optical depth typically associated with eruptions such as, for example, Tambora in 1815 or Krakatoa in 1883. Among the effects considered here, uncertainties in the aerosol particle size distribution have the largest impact on the colour ratios and hence the aerosol optical depth estimate. For solar zenith angles exceeding 80 degrees, uncertainties in the stratospheric ozone amount can also have a significant impact on the colour ratios. In addition, for solar zenith angles exceeding 90 degrees the colour ratios exhibit a dramatic dependence on solar zenith angle, rendering the estimation of aerosol optical depth highly challenging. A quantitative determination of the aerosol optical depth may be possible for individual paintings for which all relevant parameters are sufficiently well constrained in order to reduce the related errors.","[von Savigny, Christian; Lange, Anna; Hoffmann, Christoph G.] Univ Greifswald, Inst Phys, Felix Hausdorff Str 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Hemkendreis, Anne] Univ Freiburg, Inst Art Hist, Pl Univ 3, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Rozanov, Alexei] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Otto Hahn Allee 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; University of Freiburg; University of Bremen,"von Savigny, C (corresponding author), Univ Greifswald, Inst Phys, Felix Hausdorff Str 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",csavigny@physik.uni-greifswald.de,,"Hoffmann, Christoph/0000-0003-2712-8648; Rozanov, Alexei/0000-0003-4525-3223",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [398006378],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (project VolARC of the DFG research unit VolImpact FOR 2820, grant no. 398006378).

The employed set of channels corresponds to the instruments ISMAR and MARSS, which are available on the British FAAM research aircraft, and it is complemented by two precipitation channels at low frequencies from Deimos. The channels also cover ICI, which will be part of the MetOp-SG mission. We use simulated atmospheres from the ICON model as basis for the study and quantify the information content with the reduction of degrees of freedom (Delta DOF). The required Jacobians are calculated with the radiative transfer model ARTS. Specifically we focus on the dependence of the information content on the atmospheric composition. In general we find a high information content for the frozen hydrometeors, which mainly comes from the higher frequency channels beyond 183.31 GHz (on average 3.10 for cloud ice and 2.57 for snow). Considerable information about the microphysical properties, especially for cloud ice, can be gained. The information content about the liquid hydrometeors comes from the lower frequency channels. It is 1.69 for liquid cloud water and 1.08 for rain using the full set of channels. The Jacobians for a specific cloud hydrometeor strongly depend on the atmospheric composition. Especially for the liquid hydrometeors the Jacobians even change sign in some cases. However, the information content is robust across different atmospheric compositions. For liquid hydrometeors the information content decreases in the presence of any frozen hydrometeor, for the frozen hydrometeors it decreases slightly in the presence of the respective other frozen hydrometeor. Due to the lack of channels below 183 GHz liquid hydrometeors are hardly seen by ICI. However, the overall results with regard to the frozen hydrometeors also hold for the ICI sensor. This points to ICI's great ability to observe ice clouds from space on a global scale with a good spatial coverage in unprecedented detail.","[Gruetzun, Verena; Buehler, Stefan A.; Brath, Manfred] Univ Hamburg, CEN, Meteorol Inst, Fachbereich Geowissensch, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Kluft, Lukas] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Mendrok, Jana; Eriksson, Patrick] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Space Earth & Environm, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Hamburg; Max Planck Society; Chalmers University of Technology,"Grutzun, V (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, CEN, Meteorol Inst, Fachbereich Geowissensch, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",verena.gruetzun@uni-hamburg.de,"Eriksson, Patrick/A-5321-2009; Mendrok, Jana/D-9349-2013; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/A-4056-2009","Eriksson, Patrick/0000-0002-8475-0479; Mendrok, Jana/0000-0002-0032-2021; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/0000-0001-6389-1160; Brath, Manfred/0000-0003-4898-3811; Kluft, Lukas/0000-0002-6533-3928",European Space Agency (ESA) [4000113023/13/NL/MV]; Universitat Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP); DFG,European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission); Universitat Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the contract Nr. 4000113023/13/NL/MV and by the Universitat Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP, funded by DFG).

This paper suggests formulae grounded in thermodynamic principles in an attempt to estimate the energy requirements necessary to melt copper alloys common to both Old and New World cultures, with the goal of identifying consumption and conservation patterns. It has been suggested that tin bronze metallurgy was first adopted in the Levant during the Early Bronze Age (EB) IV, at the onset of the Late Holocene climate episode (c.2300-2000 bc), becoming the most desired alloy by the Middle Bronze Age (MB) II (2000-1530 bc) due to the ease of melting tin. To test this hypothesis, the formulae are applied here to all published Levantine EB IV - MB II copper alloys. Fuel conservation rates are proposed based on the thermodynamic formulae. Tin bronze is demonstrably more fuel efficient than pure copper. Due to the inherent difficulties in predicting the behaviour of arsenical copper compounds, it is suggested that melting experiments with representative alloys are conducted to further test and refine these energy relationships.","[Kaufman, B.] Brown Univ, Joukowsky Inst Archaeol & Ancient World, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Scott, D.

We design our model upon the triple-bottom-line (TBL) approach consisting of smartness and sustainability dime5nsions. Our study introduces the TBL of smartness covering availability, integrity, and adaptability sub-dimension. TBL of sustainability includes social, environmental, and economic sub-dimensions. The proposed model calculates the Smart and Sustainable Readiness and Maturity Index by averaging sustainability scores' summation and smartness scores' multiplication. Each sub-dimension consists of items measured by a readiness and maturity scale. The findings suggest how smartness and sustainability items create strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the supply chain operations.

In Mediterranean drylands, RA is at incipient state of development and has been limitedly adopted by farmers, partly due to the lack of empirical evidence on its impacts. To support its large-scale adoption, we carried out a participatory monitoring project in southeast Spain, involving local farmers applying different RA practices in 9 almond farms. To assess the effect of RA, in each farm we selected one field with regenerative management and one nearby field with conventional management based on frequent tillage (CT). We clustered fields under regenerative management based on the RA practices applied by farmers and distinguished 4 types of RA treatments: 1) reduced tillage with green manure (GM), 2) reduced tillage with organic amendments (OA), 3) reduced tillage with green manure and organic amendments (GM&OA), and 4) no tillage with permanent natural covers and organic amendments (NT&OA). We evaluated the impacts of RA compared to CT by comparing physical (bulk density and aggregate stability), chemical (pH, salinity, total N, P, K, available P, and exchangeable cations) and biological (SOC, POC, PON, microbial activity) properties of soil quality and the nutritional status of almond trees (leaf N, P and K). Our results show that GM improved soil physical properties, presenting higher soil aggregate stability. We found that OA improved most soil chemical and biological properties, showing higher contents of SOC, POC, PON, total N, K, P, available P, exchangeable cations and microbial respiration. RA treatments combining ground covers and organic amendments (GM&OA and NT&OA) exhibited greater overall soil quality restoration than individual practices. NT&OA stood out for presenting the highest soil quality improvements. All RA treatments maintained similar crop nutritional status compared to CT. We conclude that RA has strong potential to restore the physical, chemical and biological quality of soils of woody agroecosystems in Mediterranean drylands without compromising their nutritional status, thereby enhancing their resilience to climate change and long term sustainability.","[Lujan Soto, Raquel; Martinez-Mena, Maria; de Vente, Joris] Spanish Res Council CEBAS CSIC, Soil & Water Conservat Res Grp, Campus Univ Espinardo 25, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Lujan Soto, Raquel; Cuellar Padilla, Mamen] Univ Cordoba, Agroecol Food Sovereignty & Commons Res Team, Edificio Gregor Mendel Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); Universidad de Cordoba,"Soto, RL (corresponding author), Spanish Res Council CEBAS CSIC, Soil & Water Conservat Res Grp, Campus Univ Espinardo 25, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.;Soto, RL (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Agroecol Food Sovereignty & Commons Res Team, Edificio Gregor Mendel Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",rlujan@cebas.csic.es,"de Vente, Joris/C-1304-2012; Cuéllar-Padilla, Mamen/AAS-3656-2021","de Vente, Joris/0000-0001-7428-0621; Cuéllar-Padilla, Mamen/0000-0002-2466-7454; Lujan Soto, Raquel/0000-0002-4321-408X","Commonland foundation; la Caixa Foundation [ID100010434, LCF/BQ/ES17/11600008]; Seneca Foundation [20917/PI/18, 18933/JLI/13]; ADAPT (Ministry of Science and Innovation); FEDER [CGL2013-42009-R]",Commonland foundation; la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation); Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca); ADAPT (Ministry of Science and Innovation); FEDER(European Commission),"We would like to thank the farmers participating in this participatory research, and AlVelAl association for facilitating the contact with them.

Capitalizing on a newly emerging population of retirees with disposable pension income and on a growing number of middle-class Americans seeking fun in the sun, the family firm targeted these groups in an aggressive, nationwide marketing campaign. Central in this promotional scheme were the sundrenched locations of its residential developments on the east and west coasts of south Florida. The Mackles' marketing strategies belie a complex relationship with the environment, one deeply rooted in American ideas regarding the perfectibility of nature. The company's houses, typically containing generous indoor-outdoor living spaces and lined with bands of windows opening onto waterfront lots, were presumably designed for a living experience tailored to the Edenic qualities of the Sunshine State. But, paradoxically, they relied on central air conditioning, a modern amenity intended to thwart the tropical climate that lured northerners to Florida in the first place. Moreover, the company depended on significant land modifications through dredging and filling, bulkheading and canal digging, beach improvements, and clearing of foliage and trees to make its communities inhabitable and appealing to its out-of-state clients. The tension between celebrating Florida's subtropical landscape while simultaneously altering it pervaded the company's marketing materials, even as the scale of the Mackle Company's efforts increased, culminating in an ambitious project at Marco Island begun in the mid-1960s. Although the Mackles' ambitions did not succeed to the extent they envisioned, their sales pitch to sell sunshine dramatically reshaped the cultural and natural landscape of south Florida.","[Andrzejewski, Anna Vemer] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Environm Humanities, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Andrzejewski, Anna Vemer] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Art Hist, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Andrzejewski, Anna Vemer] UW Madison, Ctr Culture Hist & Environm, Madison, WI USA; [Andrzejewski, Anna Vemer] UW Madison, Bldg Landscapes Cultures Program, Madison, WI USA; [Andrzejewski, Anna Vemer] UW Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Andrzejewski, AV (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Environm Humanities, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Andrzejewski, AV (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Art Hist, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,,97,0,0,0,1,UNIV MINNESOTA PRESS,MINNEAPOLIS,"MILL PLACE, SUITE 290 111 THIRD AVE S, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55401-2520 USA",1936-0886,1934-6832,,BUILD LANDSC,Build Landsc.,FAL,2020,2,,,,59,82,,,,,,24,Architecture,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture,PB1KB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000596087200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Frugal innovations have attracted significant attention in this regard. These user-friendly, cost-effective, and resource-efficient solutions of appropriate quality provide significant value to users and end customers and present attractive solutions to meet the current demands. Nevertheless, knowledge about the development of frugal solutions is scarce. Scrum is one of the most popular agile frameworks and is increasingly implemented in diverse companies' product development processes, although the relationship between Scrum and frugal innovation has not yet been investigated. Based on semi-structured expert interviews with Scrum practitioners, this paper provides the first insights into developing frugal innovations with Scrum. Interviewees generally considered Scrum's impact to be positive, and they named developing a user-friendly solution of appropriate quality as the frugal-innovation characteristic most benefited by applying Scrum. However, Scrum's impact was not explicit on the developed product's price-performance ratio, one of the variables to measure customer value. Therefore, this paper proposes integrating the user perspective into the Scrum process by identifying the actual users of the developed solution and by formally and regularly inviting them to sprint review meetings. To keep the development process efficient while addressing the identified stakeholder needs, organizations should work with fully dedicated, generalist Scrum teams that are knowledgeable on user experience. Additionally, Scrum team members should regularly share their insights gained with marketing departments to improve the effectiveness and appropriateness of pricing decisions. Companies can also address cost-effectiveness and sustainable resource efficiency by developing resource-efficient increments and by reusing existing components. Our study indicates that sustainability efforts, like reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals, can profit from including agile frameworks in innovation activities.","[Endres, Miro; Bican, Peter M.; Woellner, Theresa] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Bican, PM (corresponding author), Nuremberg Campus Technol NCT, Chair Technol Management, Dr Mack Str 81, D-90762 Furth, Germany.",peter.bican@fau.de,,"Bican, Peter M./0000-0003-4937-5818; Endres, Miro Yanik/0000-0002-7099-9505",,,,,102,2,2,5,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

In this work, an attempt was made to develop an accurate multi-hazard exposure map for a mountainous area (Asara watershed, Iran), based on state-of-the art machine learning techniques. Hazard modeling for avalanches, rockfalls, and floods was performed using three state-of-the-art models-support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and generalized additive model (GAM). Topo-hydrological and geo-environmental factors were used as predictors in the models. A flood dataset (n = 133 flood events) was applied, which had been prepared using Sentinel-1-based processing and ground-based information. In addition, snow avalanche (n = 58) and rockfall (n = 101) data sets were used. The data set of each hazard type was randomly divided to two groups: Training (70%) and validation (30%). Model performance was evaluated by the true skill score (TSS) and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) criteria. Using an exposure map, the multi-hazard map was converted into a multi-hazard exposure map. According to both validation methods, the SVM model showed the highest accuracy for avalanches (AUC = 92.4%, TSS = 0.72) and rockfalls (AUC = 93.7%, TSS = 0.81), while BRT demonstrated the best performance for flood hazards (AUC = 94.2%, TSS = 0.80). Overall, multi-hazard exposure modeling revealed that valleys and areas close to the Chalous Road, one of the most important roads in Iran, were associated with high and very high levels of risk. The proposed multi-hazard exposure framework can be helpful in supporting decision making on mountain social-ecological systems facing multiple hazards.","[Rahmati, Omid] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh 758307, Vietnam; [Rahmati, Omid] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh 758307, Vietnam; [Yousefi, Saleh] AREEO, Chaharmahal & Bakhtiari Agr & Nat Resources Res &, Soil Conservat & Water Management Res Dept, Shahrekord 8814843114, Iran; [Kalantari, Zahra] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kalantari, Zahra] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Uuemaa, Evelyn] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Vanemuise St 46, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia; [Uuemaa, Evelyn] NIWA, Gate 10 Silverdale Rd, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand; [Teimurian, Teimur] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Karaj 3158777871, Iran; [Keesstra, Saskia] Wageningen Univ, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tien Dat Pham] VNUA, CARES, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; University of Tartu; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; University of Tehran; Wageningen University & Research; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); Duy Tan University,"Bui, DT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",omid.rahmati@tdtu.edu.vn; buitiendieu@duytan.edu.vn,"Uuemaa, Evelyn/J-2723-2014; YOUSEFI, SALEH/N-5552-2019; keesstra, saskia/Z-5477-2019; Kalantari, Zahra/ABG-6635-2020; Rahmati, Omid/R-2184-2016; Kalantari, Zahra/GRR-4101-2022; Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017; Teimurian, Teimur/AAI-5982-2020; Tien Bui, Dieu/K-2125-2012","Uuemaa, Evelyn/0000-0002-0782-6740; YOUSEFI, SALEH/0000-0002-7198-4612; Kalantari, Zahra/0000-0002-7978-0040; Rahmati, Omid/0000-0001-5672-8525; Kalantari, Zahra/0000-0002-7978-0040; Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847; teimurian, teimur/0000-0002-1392-4275; Tien Bui, Dieu/0000-0001-5161-6479","GIS Research Group, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","GIS Research Group, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","This research was supported by the GIS Research Group, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",,80,42,42,6,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2019,16,,,,,,1943,10.3390/rs11161943,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11161943,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,IV6OL,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000484387600106,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is based on the application of 1) the random forest method to merge multisource precipitation estimates (gauge, satellite, and reanalysis) with terrain elevation, and 2) observed and modeled streamflow data to first detect biases and second further adjust gridded precipitation by inversely applying the simulated results of the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). Hydrological results using RAIN4PE as input for the Peruvian and Ecuadorian catchments were compared against the ones when feeding other uncorrected (CHIRP and ERA5) and gauge-corrected (CHIRPS, MSWEP, and PISCO) precipitation datasets into the model. For that, SWAT was calibrated and validated at 72 river sections for each dataset using a range of performance metrics, including hydrograph goodness of fit and flow duration curve signatures. Results showed that gauge-corrected precipitation datasets outperformed uncorrected ones for streamflow simulation. However, CHIRPS, MSWEP, and PISCO showed limitations for streamflow simulation in several catchments draining into the Pacific Ocean and the Amazon River. RAIN4PE provided the best overall performance for streamflow simulation, including flow variability (low, high, and peak flows) and water budget closure. The overall good performance of RAIN4PE as input for hydrological modeling provides a valuable criterion of its applicability for robust countrywide hydrometeorological applications, including hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods. Significance StatementWe developed a novel precipitation dataset RAIN4PE for Peru and Ecuador by merging multisource precipitation data (satellite, reanalysis, and ground-based precipitation) with terrain elevation using the random forest method. Furthermore, RAIN4PE was hydrologically corrected using streamflow data in watersheds with precipitation underestimation through reverse hydrology. The results of a comprehensive hydrological evaluation showed that RAIN4PE outperformed state-of-the-art precipitation datasets such as CHIRP, ERA5, CHIRPS, MSWEP, and PISCO in terms of daily and monthly streamflow simulations, including extremely low and high flows in almost all Peruvian and Ecuadorian catchments. This underlines the suitability of RAIN4PE for hydrometeorological applications in this region. Furthermore, our approach for the generation of RAIN4PE can be used in other data-scarce regions.","[Fernandez-Palomino, Carlos Antonio; Hattermann, Fred F.; Krysanova, Valentina; Lobanova, Anastasia] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Dept II Climate Resilience, Potsdam, Germany; [Fernandez-Palomino, Carlos Antonio; Bronstert, Axel] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [Vega-Jacome, Fiorella; Lavado, Waldo] Serv Nacl Meteorologia Hidrologia Peru, Hidrologia Estudios Invest Hidrol, Lima, Peru; [Santini, William] Inst Rech Dev, Lab GET, IRD, CNRS,UPS,CNES, Toulouse, France; [Aybar, Cesar] Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Salzburg, Austria",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Salzburg University,"Fernandez-Palomino, CA (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Dept II Climate Resilience, Potsdam, Germany.;Fernandez-Palomino, CA (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany.",cafpxl@gmail.com,"Fernandez Palomino, Carlos Antonio/ABD-6818-2020","Fernandez Palomino, Carlos Antonio/0000-0002-0573-4025",,,,,138,3,3,15,18,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

This paper described the results from a ship-based intercomparison conducted on the Atlantic Meridional Transect 27 from 23rd September to 5th November 2017. Two different radiometric systems, TriOS-Radiation Measurement Sensor with Enhanced Spectral resolution (RAMSES) and Seabird-Hyperspectral Surface Acquisition System (HyperSAS), were compared and operated side-by-side over a wide range of Atlantic provinces and environmental conditions. Both systems were calibrated for traceability to SI (Systeme international) units at the same optical laboratory under uniform conditions before and after the field campaign. The in situ results and their accompanying uncertainties were evaluated using the same data handling protocols. The field data revealed variability in the responsivity between TRiOS and Seabird sensors, which is dependent on the ambient environmental and illumination conditions. The straylight effects for individual sensors were mostly within +/- 3%. A near infra-red (NIR) similarity correction changed the water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) and water-leaving radiance (L-w) spectra significantly, bringing also a convergence in outliers. For improving the estimates of in situ uncertainty, it is recommended that additional characterization of radiometers and environmental ancillary measurements are undertaken. In general, the comparison of radiometric systems showed agreement within the evaluated uncertainty limits. Consistency of in situ results with the available Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data in the range from (400...560) nm was also satisfactory (-8% < Mean Percentage Difference (MPD) < 15%) and showed good agreement in terms of the shape of the spectra and absolute values.","[Alikas, Krista; Vabson, Viktor; Ansko, Ilmar; Vendt, Riho] Tartu Univ, Dept Remote Sensing, Tartu Observ, Observ 1, EE-61602 Tartu, Estonia; [Tilstone, Gavin H.; Dall'Olmo, Giorgio; Nencioli, Francesco] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Donlon, Craig; Casal, Tania] European Space Agcy, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands",University of Tartu; Tartu Observatory; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; European Space Agency,"Alikas, K (corresponding author), Tartu Univ, Dept Remote Sensing, Tartu Observ, Observ 1, EE-61602 Tartu, Estonia.",alikas@ut.ee; viktor.vabson@ut.ee; ilmar.ansko@ut.ee; ghti@pml.ac.uk; gdal@pml.ac.uk; fne@pml.ac.uk; riho.vendt@ut.ee; craig.donlon@esa.int; tania.casal@esa.int,"Vendt, Riho/AAD-5381-2019; Alikas, Krista/F-7279-2017; Vabson, Viktor/AAG-2491-2019; Alikas, Krista/ABE-1431-2020","Vendt, Riho/0000-0003-3740-0772; Alikas, Krista/0000-0003-3855-6525; Vabson, Viktor/0000-0003-0963-706X; Alikas, Krista/0000-0003-3855-6525; Gil Duarte Casal, Tania/0000-0001-7119-3928; Dall'Olmo, Giorgio/0000-0003-3931-4675; Nencioli, Francesco/0000-0001-6107-2479","European Space Agency project Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Color (FRM4SOC) [4000117454/16/I-Sbo]; AMT4SentinelFRM from the European Space Agency [ESRIN/RFQ/3-14457/16/I-BG]; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) National Capability funding; UK Natural Environment Research Council through its National Capability Long-term Single Center Science Program, Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science [NE/R015953/1]; NERC [nceo020007] Funding Source: UKRI","European Space Agency project Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Color (FRM4SOC); AMT4SentinelFRM from the European Space Agency; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) National Capability funding(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Natural Environment Research Council through its National Capability Long-term Single Center Science Program, Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was funded by European Space Agency project Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Color (FRM4SOC), contract No. 4000117454/16/I-Sbo.

Thus, many calcareous soils have been developing rather from dolomitic rocks than from calcite (CaCO3)-dominated limestone. We developed a physical fractionation procedure based on three fractionation steps, using sonication with subsequent density fractionation to separate soil organic matter (SOM) from dolomite-derived soil constituents. The method avoids acidic pretreatment for destruction of carbonates but aims at separating out carbonate minerals according to density. The fractionation was tested on three soils developed on dolostone parent material (alluvial gravel and solid rock), differing in organic-C (OC) and inorganic-C (IC) concentrations and degree of carbonate weathering. Soil samples were suspended and centrifuged in Na-polytungstate (SPT) solutions of increasing density, resulting in five different fractions: two light fractions < 1.8 gcm(-3) (> 20 m and < 20 m), rich in OC and free of carbonate, and two organomineral fractions (1.8-2.4 gcm(-3) and 2.4-2.6 gcm(-3)), containing 66-145 mg g(-1) and 16-29 mg g(-1) OC. The organomineral fractions consist of residual clay from carbonate weathering such as clay minerals and iron oxides associated with SOM. The fifth fraction (> 2.6 gcm(-3)) was dominated by dolomite (85%-95%). The density separation yielded fractions differing in mineral compositions, as well as in SOM, indicated by soil-type-specific OC distributions and decreasing OC : N ratios with increasing density of fractions. The presented method is applicable to a wide range of dolomitic and most likely to all other calcareous soils.","[Kreyling, Olivia; Koelbl, Angelika; Spielvogel, Sandra; Rennert, Thilo; Koegel-Knabner, Ingrid] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Lehrstuhl Bodenkunde, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Spielvogel, Sandra] Univ Koblenz Landau, Abt Geog, Inst Integrierte Nat Wissensch, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany; [Kaiser, Klaus] Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-6120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Koegel-Knabner, Ingrid] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich; University of Koblenz & Landau; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Technical University of Munich,"Kreyling, O (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Lehrstuhl Bodenkunde, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",kreyling@wzw.tum.de,"Kögel-Knabner, Ingrid/A-7905-2008; Kaiser, Klaus/J-1726-2014; Kölbl, Angelika/H-8077-2013; Spielvogel, Sandra/H-8844-2016","Kögel-Knabner, Ingrid/0000-0002-7216-8326; Kaiser, Klaus/0000-0001-7376-443X; Kölbl, Angelika/0000-0003-4453-2271; Spielvogel, Sandra/0000-0003-2310-5975; Rennert, Thilo/0000-0003-1435-2157","Bavarian Research Cooperation Bavarian Ministry of Science, Research and Art; Technische Universitat Munchen, Institute for Advanced Study; German Excellence Initiative","Bavarian Research Cooperation Bavarian Ministry of Science, Research and Art; Technische Universitat Munchen, Institute for Advanced Study; German Excellence Initiative","We gratefully acknowledge the help of Sigrid Hiesch for laboratory assistance and Matthias Handel (Institute of Geo-sciences, FSU Jena) for recording the FTIR spectra.

In Prague, as in countless other cities, teams of organisers prepared lavish multi-day programmes culminating in a public parade and an assembly with a more or less defined political subtext. However, not everyone shared the enthusiasm of the organisers behind the Schiller celebrations in Prague. A look at the press in Prague and Vienna at that time reveals the extent to which contrary ideas about the significance of Schiller's anniversary resonated in the tense social climate of the autumn of 1859. Official documents show that even the state authorities were not sure how politically dangerous it would be to organise the Schiller celebrations in Prague. The organising committee, which was dominated by German writers and members of a group of merchants, was able to count on the support of the authorities and the participation of the universities and government employees, but it encountered resistance from the Prague public who identified with Czech language and culture. Attacks on the authenticity of manuscripts and the political symbolism of the celebrations prompted Czech patriots to boycott the Schiller anniversary and prepare demonstrations of protest. This study seeks to show to what extent the symbolism and rhetoric surrounding the anniversary of Schiller became an opportunity to express a number of often conflicting loyalties and attitudes.","[Simunkova, Alena] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Hist, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Simunkova, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Hist, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,ACADEMIA-PUBL HOUSE CZECHOSLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES,PRAHA 1,"VODICKOVA 40, PRAHA 1 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-200-2562-3,,,,2016,,,,,253,260,,,,,,8,History,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),History,BG0DT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000386189100023,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, directly comparing multi-temporal Landsat LST is challenging, as the observed LST might be strongly affected by climatic factors. This study validated the utility of the pseudo-invariant feature-based linear regression model (PIF-LRM) in normalizing multi-temporal Landsat LST to highlight the urbanization impact on temperature changes, based on five Landsat LST images during 2000-2018 in Changsha, China. Results showed that LST of PIFs between the reference and the target images was highly correlated, indicating high applicability of the PIF-LRM to relatively normalize LST. The PIF-LRM effectively removed the temporal variation of LST caused by climate factors and highlighted the impacts of urbanization caused land use and land cover changes. The PIF-LRM normalized LST showed stronger correlations with the time series of normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) than the observed LST and the LST normalized by the commonly used mean method (subtracting LST by the average, respectively for each image). The PIF-LRM uncovered the spatially heterogeneous responses of LST to urban expansion. For example, LST decreased in the urban center (the already developed regions) and increased in the urbanizing regions. PIF-LRM is highly recommended to normalize multi-temporal Landsat LST to understand the impact of urbanization on surface temperature changes from a temporal point of view.","[Cai, Zhengwu; Chen, Falin] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Dongting La, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China; [Fan, Chao] Univ Idaho, Dept Comp Sci, Moscow 83844, Russia; [Li, Xiaoma] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art Design, Inst Educ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Landscape Ecol & Planning & De, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University; Hunan Agricultural University,"Li, XM (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art Design, Inst Educ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Landscape Ecol & Planning & De, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",caizhengwu@stu.hunau.edu.cn; cfan@uidaho.edu; chenfalin@hunau.edu.cn; lixiaoma@hunau.edu.cn,,"Fan, Chao/0000-0002-6037-8940",ational Natural Science Foundation of China [32001161]; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2021JJ30329],ational Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province),"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 32001161), and the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 2021JJ30329).",,40,0,0,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,NOV,2021,11,,,,,,1540,10.3390/atmos12111540,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12111540,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,XG0JI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000724447700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current solutions often rely on installing costly hardware accelerator to compute the cryptographic algorithms in order to offer responsive experience to the users (e.g. online payment and cloud storage). In this paper, we proposed to utilize GPU as an accelerator to compute the cryptographic algorithms, which is more cost effective compare to dedicated hardware accelerator. Firstly, we present several techniques to utilize the massively parallel architecture in GPU compute block ciphers (AES, Camelia, CAST5 and SEED) and public key cryptography (RSA). Secondly, we present a novel idea that utilizes warp shuffle instruction to speed up the implementation of SHA-3. Thirdly, we evaluated the performance of our implementation with state of the art GPU (Pascal architecture).

Metagenomes allow examination of genetic responses of the entire microbial community to environmental change. However, it is challenging to link metagenomes directly to biogeochemical process rates. Here, we investigate metagenomic responses in natural bacterioplankton communities to simulated environmental stressors in the Baltic Sea, including increased river water input, increased nutrient concentration, and reduced oxygen level. This allowed us to identify informative prokaryotic gene markers, responding to environmental perturbation. Our results demonstrate that metagenomic and metabolic changes in bacterial communities in response to environmental stressors are influenced both by the initial community composition and by the biogeochemical factors shaping the functional response. Furthermore, the different sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) had the largest impact on metagenomic blueprint. Most prominently, changes in DOM loads influenced specific transporter types reflecting the substrate availability and DOC assimilation and consumption pathways. The results provide new knowledge for developing models of ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycling in future climate change scenarios and advance our exploration of the potential use of marine microorganisms as markers for environmental conditions.","[Markussen, Trine; Happel, Elisabeth M.; Riemann, Lasse; Middelboe, Mathias] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Helsingor, Denmark; [Teikari, Jonna E.; Sivonen, Kaarina] Univ Helsinki, Dept Microbiol, Helsinki, Finland; [Huchaiah, Vimala; Kisand, Veljo] Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, Tartu, Estonia; [Alneberg, Johannes; Andersson, Anders F.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Biotechnol, Sci Life Lab, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare; University of Helsinki; University of Tartu; Royal Institute of Technology,"Middelboe, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Helsingor, Denmark.;Kisand, V (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, Tartu, Estonia.",mmiddelboe@bio.ku.dk; kisand@ut.ee,"Riemann, Lasse/J-7091-2014; Kisand, Veljo/H-2466-2012; Andersson, Anders/J-9310-2019; Middelboe, Mathias/B-9995-2009","Riemann, Lasse/0000-0001-9207-2543; Kisand, Veljo/0000-0002-5535-1639; Andersson, Anders/0000-0002-3627-6899; Middelboe, Mathias/0000-0002-9587-9171; Teikari, Jonna/0000-0002-5797-7432; Sivonen, Kaarina/0000-0002-2904-0458","BONUS - EU; Danish Council for Independent Research; Estonian Research Council; Swedish Research Council FORMAS; Academy of Finland; Estonian Research Council [PUT-134, 1389]",BONUS - EU; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council),"The authors would like to thank J.

We propose suitable applications of the different techniques and provide generalised archaeometallurgical implications for the investigated slag types.","[Westner, Katrin Julia] Deutsch Bergbau Museum Bochum, Forsch Bereich Archaomet, Bergbaumuseum 31, D-44791 Bochum, Germany; [Klein, Sabine] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt Isotope & Element Res Ctr, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Klein, Sabine] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Archaol, Bergbaumuseum 31, D-44791 Bochum, Germany; [Sergeev, Dmitry; Muller, Michael] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 2, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52428 Julich, Germany",Deutsches Bergbau Museum Bochum (DBM); Goethe University Frankfurt; Ruhr University Bochum; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Westner, KJ (corresponding author), Deutsch Bergbau Museum Bochum, Forsch Bereich Archaomet, Bergbaumuseum 31, D-44791 Bochum, Germany.",katrin.westner@bergbaumuseum.de,,,German research foundation with DFG (Romischer Bergbau und Metallproduktion nahe der antiken Stadt ULPIANA (Kosovo)) [KL 1259/6],German research foundation with DFG (Romischer Bergbau und Metallproduktion nahe der antiken Stadt ULPIANA (Kosovo)),"This work was supported by the German research foundation with DFG grant KL 1259/6 (Romischer Bergbau und Metallproduktion nahe der antiken Stadt ULPIANA (Kosovo)) awarded to S.

However, compare to ecosystem services (ES), current studies on EDS are still very limited especially from the perspective of classification and valuation. Here, we firstly proposed a function-based classification system to better explain the general effects of EDS. Then, we used Beijing, the capital of China, as a case study to value three common urban EDS (excessive decrease in water quantity, plant-related diseases and infrastructure damage) there. The results suggested that the total EDS value of Beijing was approximately 10.54 billion RMB/year in 2019, which equaled about 5.13% of the total value of five important ecosystem services (food and raw material production, climate regulation, environmental quality regulation, soil retention and ecotourism). The finding showed that although EDS caused considerable financial loss, the potential economic gains from ecosystem services could still greatly outweigh the loss and therefore supported the current urban greening expansion policy in Beijing. Our study attempted to promote the bridging of ecosystem services and disservices studies and call for more equal consideration of both ES and EDS to create more compressive and sustainable planning.","[Wu, Shuyao; Li, Binbin, V] Duke Kunshan Univ, Environm Res Ctr, Kunshan 214316, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shuyao] Shandong Univ, Qingdao Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Binbin, V] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Li, Shuangcheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuangcheng] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Duke Kunshan University; Shandong University; Duke University; Peking University; Peking University,"Li, SC (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",shuyao.wu@dukekunshan.edu.cn; binbin.li@duke.edu; scli@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Wu, Shuyao/AEW-5434-2022","Wu, Shuyao/0000-0002-0057-5483",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41590843],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China to fund this research (41590843) .

Over 60% of lithium produced in 2019 were utilised for the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the compact and high-density energy storage devices crucial for low-carbon emission electric-based vehicles (EVs) and secondary storage media for renewable energy sources like solar and wind. In 2019, the global market value of lithium reached around US $213 B and is forecasted to grow by around 20-25% until 2025. In this review, the current state of global lithium resources, global lithium material flow, and forecasts of future lithium supply-demand dynamics are discussed. Persistent challenges in mining, processing and industrial-scale recycling operations are also examined and recent innovations to address these issues are introduced. Finally, unconventional lithium sources like submarine/deep-sea ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts, industrial wastes (e.g., desalination brines, geothermal brines and coal fly ashes), mining wastes and effluents, and extra-terrestrial materials are explored.","[Tabelin, Carlito Baltazar; Dallas, Jessica; Casanova, Sophia; Pelech, Timothy; Bournival, Ghislain; Saydam, Serkan; Canbulat, Ismet] Univ New South Wales, Sch Minerals & Energy Resources Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Tabelin, CB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Minerals & Energy Resources Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",c.tabelin@unsw.edu.au,"Tabelin, Carlito/HGC-8139-2022; Tabelin, Carlito/B-9474-2018","Tabelin, Carlito/0000-0001-8314-6344",,,,,272,58,57,91,129,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0892-6875,,,MINER ENG,Miner.

In this context, neo-Marxist and new materialist approaches stand out for the way they oblige social theory to catch up with new material realities. We share the conviction that the Anthropocene might constitute a genuine event for social theory and practice. However, we argue that the search for alternative ways of problematizing and 'dramatizing' our eco-political predicament confronts these approaches with unresolved issues of scientism and economic totalization. Looking for another path, we turn to Science and Technology Studies (STS), and especially Actor-Network Theory (ANT). We relay the long-standing focus on nonhuman agency characteristic of this field via Isabelle Stengers' argument that we must 'accept' the reality of Gaia's intrusion into collective historicity. The challenge posed by Stengers, we suggest, requires the development of an art of immanent attention to the politics of varied matters as they unfold across diverse ecologies of practice. Extending further than the present preoccupations of Euro-American social theory, other areas within and across environmental history, activism and politics offer sites of resistance as well as experimentation whose conceptual possibilities and practical efficacies have yet to be explored. Slowing down theory sufficiently to learn from these multiple sites, we argue, is the starting point for an approach more adequate to the problems posed by the Anthropocene event.","[Blok, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Jensen, Casper Bruun] Osaka Univ, Dept Anthropol, Suita, Osaka, Japan",University of Copenhagen; Osaka University,"Blok, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",abl@soc.ku.dk,,"Blok, Anders/0000-0002-3403-698X",,,,,48,19,20,2,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0038-0261,1467-954X,,SOCIOL REV,Sociol.

Hence, alternative non-platinum (Pt)-group metal electrocatalysts have been investigated extensively in this medium to compete with Pt in terms of performance and durability. Among various non-Pt catalysts, one of the most popular class of electrocatalysts is iron-and nitrogen-doped carbon-based (Fe-N-C) by the high electrocatalytic activity and selectivity in ORR. However, the inherent catalytic reactivity of such non-Pt electrocatalysts remains inferior to that of state-of-the-art Pt electrocatalysts. Here, we explore the ORR of hollow and urchin-like, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured Fe-N-Cs prepared via polymerization-induced self-assembly of aniline followed by carbonization. The resulting Fe-N-Cs consist of a hollow microsphere framework coupled with nanorod bundles, and exhibit large surface areas (874 m(2)g(-1)), hierarchical cavities, and excellent electrical conductivities (0.63 Scm(-1)) as electrodes. They are of particular interest as oxygen reduction electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). These unique features, which enhance electrocatalytic efficiency, are attributed to efficient mass-and electro-transport ORR kinetics. Electrochemical experiments reveal improved onset (ca. 1.04 V) and half-wave potentials (ca. 0.9 V), which is comparable to those of commercial Pt electrocatalysts. The 3D hierarchical porous network with high interdigitation of well-dispersed nanorod building blocks is thought to be key to facilitating the ORR reaction. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

However, model evaluation of such a process has not been possible because of the lack of direct flux measurements over lakes. The authors conducted the first-ever comparison of the turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes between state-of-the-art numerical models and direct flux measurements over Lake Erie, focusing on a record LES event in southwest New York in November 2014. The model suite consisted of numerical models that were operationally and experimentally used to provide nowcasts and forecasts of weather and lake conditions. The models captured the rise of the observed turbulent heat fluxes, while the peak values varied significantly. This variation resulted in an increased spread of simulated lake temperature and cumulative evaporation as the representation of the model uncertainty. The water budget analysis of the atmospheric model results showed that the majority of the moisture during this event came from lake evaporation rather than a larger synoptic system. The unstructured-grid Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) simulations, especially those using the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE)-Met Flux algorithm, presented better agreement with the observed fluxes likely due to the model's capability in representing the detailed spatial patterns of the turbulent heat fluxes and the COARE algorithm's more realistic treatment of the surface boundary layer than those in the other models.","[Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Fitzpatrick, Lindsay E.; Xiao, Chuliang] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Wright, David M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gronewold, Andrew D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gronewold, Andrew D.; Anderson, Eric J.; Lofgren, Brent M.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Spence, Christopher] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Chen, Jiquan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Shao, Changliang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Michigan State University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS","Fujisaki-Manome, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Fujisaki-Manome, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ayumif@umich.edu,"Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021; Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009; shao, changliang/ACG-3396-2022; Xiao, Chuliang/D-3612-2013","Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Xiao, Chuliang/0000-0002-8466-9398; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Chen, Jiquan/0000-0003-0761-9458",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI); NOAA's Coastal Storms Program through NOAA; University of Michigan [NA12OAR4320071]; International Joint Commission (IJC) [10042-400759]; Great Lakes Observing System (GLOS),U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI); NOAA's Coastal Storms Program through NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Michigan(University of Michigan System); International Joint Commission (IJC); Great Lakes Observing System (GLOS),"This research is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and NOAA's Coastal Storms Program, awarded to the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the University of Michigan (NA12OAR4320071).

Our theoretical perspective focuses on the performative and political aspects of this place-making process and the discursive and material practices involved. We connect this to Beck's concept of subpolitics. Our findings show how the group performed this place not only through text and talk - giving the area a name, using their knowledge and expertise to raise awareness about its values, lobbying and cooperating with decision-makers -, but also through things - installing art objects and information signs that articulate certain characteristics and values of the area. Our findings demonstrate the struggles involved in these performances. The group involved multiple perspectives on what the important values and characteristics of the area are and on what strategies would work best in trying to influence decision-making and protect the area. However, the use of expertise as the main strategy to gain influence excluded the more critical and activist strategies and privileging archaeological and historical values and characteristics came at the expense of attention on agricultural and natural values. Our findings make clear that performing place cannot be taken to be homogeneous and that it inevitably involves multiple perspectives and demands. The struggles, power relations and dynamics of inclusion and exclusion that this multiplicity implicates reveal a form of sub-politics that involves both politicization and depoliticization. Also, it is a form of subpolitics that is more diverse and ambiguous than Beck's conceptualization presupposes by its emphasis on the role of outsiders as a homogeneous group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this work represents a substantial step for the preservation of the Panama Viejo site, in order to support the selection of the most suitable restoration products, such as consolidants, protectives, etc., but also for choosing the most compatible materials for possible replacements/integrations in the masonries.","[Ciantelli, Chiara] ENEA CR Brasimone, I-40032 Bologna, Italy; [Sardella, Alessandro] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Sardella, Alessandro] Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy; [Arroyo Duarte, Silvia] Univ Panama, Facultad Arquitectura, Art Dept, Panama City 3366, Panama; [Arroyo Duarte, Silvia] Sistema Nacl Investigac SNI, Panama 03940, Mexico; [Pecchioni, Elena] Univ Florence, Dept Earth Sci, I-50121 Florence, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Ferrara; Universidad de Panama; University of Florence,"Sardella, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.;Sardella, A (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy.",chiara.ciantelli@enea.it; a.sardella@isac.cnr.it; silvia.arroyo@up.ac.pa; elena.pecchioni@unifi.it; elena.pecchioni@unifi.it,"Ciantelli, Chiara/HGB-6828-2022","CIANTELLI, CHIARA/0000-0002-2521-7105; Bonazza, Alessandra/0000-0002-9842-9731; Arroyo Duarte, Silvia/0000-0001-9801-7115; Sardella, Alessandro/0000-0002-2194-4970","Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENACYT); Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI) of the Republic of Panama; Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the Italian National Research Council (ISAC-CNR)","Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENACYT); Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI) of the Republic of Panama; Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the Italian National Research Council (ISAC-CNR)","Thanks to a collaboration realized among the Patronato Panama Viejo, which is devoted to the protection of this unique heritage, the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the Italian National Research Council (ISAC-CNR), a research work aimed at supporting the conservation and valorization of this site has been developed as a part of the management plan of the archaeological site.

Several NUS are drought and heat stress-tolerant, making them ideal for improving marginalised cropping systems in drought-prone areas. However, owing to their status as NUS, current crop suitability maps do not include them as part of the crop choices. This study aimed to develop land suitability maps for selected NUS [sorghum, (Sorghum bicolor), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), amaranth and taro (Colocasia esculenta)] using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in ArcGIS. Multidisciplinary factors from climatic, soil and landscape, socio-economic and technical indicators overlaid using Weighted Overlay Analysis. Validation was done through field visits, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to measure AHP model performance. The results indicated that sorghum was highly suitable (S1) = 2%, moderately suitable (S2) = 61%, marginally suitable (S3) = 33%, and unsuitable (N1) = 4%, cowpea S1 = 3%, S2 = 56%, S3 = 39%, N1 = 2%, amaranth S1 = 8%, S2 = 81%, S3 = 11%, and taro S1 = 0.4%, S2 = 28%, S3 = 64%, N1 = 7%, of calculated arable land of SA (12 655 859 ha). Overall, the validation showed that the mapping exercises exhibited a high degree of accuracies (i.e. sorghum AUC = 0.87, cowpea AUC = 0.88, amaranth AUC = 0.95 and taro AUC = 0.82). Rainfall was the most critical variable and criteria with the highest impact on land suitability of the NUS. Results of this study suggest that South Africa has a huge potential for NUS production. The maps developed can contribute to evidence-based and site-specific recommendations for NUS and their mainstreaming. Also, the maps can be used to design appropriate production guidelines and to support existing policy frameworks which advocate for sustainable intensification of marginalised cropping systems through increased crop diversity and the use of stress-tolerant food crops.","[Mugiyo, Hillary; Chimonyo, Vimbayi G.

State-of-the-art extreme flood estimation frameworks propose to address these questions with the help of semicontinuous modeling and reanalysis of simulated state variables. In this context, the present work proposes a new method for the selection of initial conditions for extreme flood simulation. The method is based on generating sets of initial conditions from the matrix of state variables corresponding to a long simulation run of the selected hydrological model. Two sets of initial conditions are obtained: a deterministic set composed of selected state variable quantiles and a stochastic set composed of state variable vectors randomly drawn from the complete state variable matrix. The extreme flood simulations corresponding to both sets are compared in detail, and the stochastic simulations are used in a sensitivity analysis to identify the dominant state variables and possible interactions. The aim hereby is to provide a tool to analyze the role of initial conditions and the importance to account for state variable interactions in extreme flood estimation. The proposed method is applied to probable maximum flood estimation for the Swiss Mattmark Dam catchment with a semilumped hydrological model. The obtained results for this case study show that for high flood peak quantiles, the initial soil saturation is dominating other state variables, and deterministic initial conditions are sufficient to generate extreme floods.","[Zeimetz, Fraenz; Artigue, Guillaume; Schleiss, Anton J.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil Engn & Environm Engn, Lab Hydraul Construct, Stn 18, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zeimetz, Fraenz] Stucky Ltd, Ave Lac 33, CH-1020 Renens, Switzerland; [Schaefli, Bettina] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Surface Dynam, Fac Geosci & Environm, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hernandez, Javier Garcia] Director CREALP, Ctr Rech Environm Alpin, Rue Ind 45, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Lausanne,"Zeimetz, F (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil Engn & Environm Engn, Lab Hydraul Construct, Stn 18, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Zeimetz, F (corresponding author), Stucky Ltd, Ave Lac 33, CH-1020 Renens, Switzerland.",franz.zeimetz@epfl.ch,"Artigue, Guillaume/AAN-8014-2020; Schaefli, Bettina/B-2069-2010","Schaefli, Bettina/0000-0003-1140-6244; Schleiss, Anton J./0000-0003-1559-5740; Garcia Hernandez, Javier/0000-0001-9034-8016",Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Swiss Competence Center on Energy Research-Supply of Energy; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PP00P2_157611],Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Swiss Competence Center on Energy Research-Supply of Energy; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE).

One such family is the Meliaceae. Here we infer the history of the neotropical Meliaceae genus Cedrela (17 species), the sister clade of which today is restricted to tropical Asia. Sequences from the nuclear ribosomal spacer region and five plastid loci obtained for all ingroup species and relevant outgroups were used to infer species relationships and for molecular-clock dating under two Bayesian relaxed clock models. The clock models differed in their handling of rate autocorrelation and sets of fossil constraints. Results suggest that (1) crown group diversification in Cedrela started in the Oligocene/Early Miocene and intensified in the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene, and (2) Central American Cedrela species do not form a clade, implying reentry into Central America after the closure of the Panamanian Isthmus. At present, Cedrela is distributed in both dry and humid habitats, but morphological features suggest an origin in dry forest under seasonal climates, fitting with Miocene and Pliocene Cedrela fossils from deciduous forests.","[Muellner, Alexandra N.] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Jodrell Lab, Mol Systemat Sect, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; [Pennington, Terence D.] Royal Bot Gardens, Herbarium Lib Art & Arch, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England; [Renner, Susanne S.] Univ Munich, Dept Biol, D-80638 Munich, Germany","Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; University of Munich","Muellner, AN (corresponding author), Senckenberg Res Inst, Dept Bot & Mol Evolut, Grunelius Moellgaard Lab, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",alexandra.muellner@senckenberg.de,"Muellner-Riehl, Alexandra N/C-6261-2013","Muellner-Riehl, Alexandra N/0000-0002-2710-469X","EU [MEIF-CT-2003-502194]; Royal Botanic Gardens [189]; Royal Geographical Society [6/05]; Leverhulme Trust [332]; DFG [MU 2934/1-1]; Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts; Senckenberg Research Institute","EU(European Commission); Royal Botanic Gardens; Royal Geographical Society; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts; Senckenberg Research Institute","The authors thank L.

To unravel the charge compensation mechanism of NCM622, spatially resolved atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) and conductive AFM (C-AFM) modes are obtained, and the spectroscopic information and crystallographic information are compared. All experiments are performed with two sets of samples: state-of-the-art samples that are composed of a binder, a conductive additive, and an active material and polished samples for single-particle analysis. Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy shows that ionic Ni2+ reacts to give when Ni(3+)charging and forms covalent bonds with its oxygen neighbors. A Ni2+/Ni3+ gradient across the particles balances out with the increasing state of charge, as verified by ESM. Therefore, the results also provide an important view that improves the mechanistic understanding of ESM in electrode materials. Finally, the interplay between the electronic and ionic conductivities and the crystallinities of NCM622 cathodes is elaborated and discussed.","[Jetybayeva, Albina; Oh, Jimin; Kim, Jaegyu; Kim, Hongjun; Park, Gun; Hong, Seungbum] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Schoen, Nino; Eichel, Ruediger-A; Hausen, Florian] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Schoen, Nino; Eichel, Ruediger-A; Hausen, Florian] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Phys Chem, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Oh, Jimin; Lee, Young-Gi] Elect & Telecommun Res Inst ETRI, Daejeon 34129, South Korea; [Kleiner, Karin] Univ Munster, Munster Electrochem Energy Technol MEET, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Hong, Seungbum] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Inst NanoCentury, Daejeon 34141, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University; Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI); University of Munster; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Hong, S (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.;Hausen, F (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, D-52428 Julich, Germany.;Hausen, F (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Phys Chem, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.;Kleiner, K (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Munster Electrochem Energy Technol MEET, D-48149 Munster, Germany.;Hong, S (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Inst NanoCentury, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.",karin.kleiner@uni-muenster.de; f.hausen@fz.juelich.de; seungbum@kaist.ac.kr,"Hong, Seungbum/B-7708-2009; Hausen, Florian/Y-9889-2019","Hong, Seungbum/0000-0002-2667-1983; OH, JIMIN/0000-0002-5770-0863; Schon, Nino/0000-0002-1411-7264; Hausen, Florian/0000-0001-5712-6761; Eichel, Ruediger-A./0000-0002-0013-6325",KAIST; Big Sciences Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2017M1A2A2044498]; Wearable Platform Materials Technology Center (WMC) - NRF Grant by the Korean Government (MSIT) [2016R1A5A1009926]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03XP0231],"KAIST; Big Sciences Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of Korea); Wearable Platform Materials Technology Center (WMC) - NRF Grant by the Korean Government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","A.J. and N.S. contributed equally to the work described in this manuscript.

The literature contains a number of environmental studies of buildings and energy efficiency improvements analysis. Important advances have also been made by integrating renewable energies within the building envelope. In architecture, however, it must be remembered that the formal aspect is as important as the functional one, and therefore rating the aesthetic perception of these new technologies is very interesting to better integrate more sustainable technologies in the city. This work focuses on the real opinion of the citizens about the aesthetic impact resulting from the use of photovoltaic systems in buildings. A survey was conducted using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to evaluate the feelings through two classic dimensions of affect: hedonic valence (pleasant-unpleasant) and arousal (activation or emotional intensity). Overall, results (error range of 5%) show that all the prototypes were rated positively and with a medium level of arousal, although the integrated systems obtained higher values in both dimensions of affect. The degree of appreciation of the installation by the observer has proved to be a powerful factor. On a socio-demographic level, respondents' age was observed as an influential factor in these subjective evaluations.","[Sanchez-Pantoja, Nuria; Vidal, Rosario] Univ Jaume 1, GID, Dept Mech Engn & Construct, Av Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Carmen Pastor, M.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Basic & Clin Psychol, Av Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Carmen Pastor, M.] Univ Jaume 1, Psychobiol, Av Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Sanchez-Pantoja, N (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, GID, Dept Mech Engn & Construct, Av Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",nbelengu@uji.es,"Pastor, M.

As a result of the intense debate over how to address climate change, Life-Cycle Carbon Emissions Assessment and carbon footprint standards such as the PAS2050, ISO/TS 14067, and the GHG Protocol, are receiving increased attention. However, carbon emission calculations often vary in terms of boundaries, scope, units of greenhouse gas emissions, and methodologies. There is not an internationally accepted method for measuring, reporting, and verifying GHG emissions from existing buildings in a consistent and comparable way. In support of developing a standardized approach, this paper reviews current methodologies for carbon footprint accounting and outlines the inconsistencies of most life-cycle carbon assessments studies. The paper also aims to present the cutting-edge knowledge about emissions resulting from buildings during their life-cycle. The conclusion of this research, after a comprehensive literature review and critical analysis, is that there is a need for a clear, accessible and consistent method to assess the carbon emissions from buildings. The findings in this paper can also support and facilitate the discussion of the meaningful targets required to reduce carbon emissions.","[Fenner, Andriel Evandro; Kibert, Charles Joseph; Woo, Junghoon; Morque, Shirley; Razkenari, Mohamad; Hakim, Hamed] Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sch Construct Management, Powell Ctr Construct & Environm, Gainesville, FL USA; [Lu, Xiaoshu] Jilin Univ, Coll Construct Engn, Changchun 130026, Jilin, Peoples R China",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Jilin University,"Fenner, AE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sch Construct Management, Powell Ctr Construct & Environm, Gainesville, FL USA.",fenner@ufl.edu,"Hakim, Hamed/AAJ-5175-2020; Razkenari, Mohamad/K-5030-2019; Lu-Tervola, Xiaoshu/G-5183-2016","Razkenari, Mohamad/0000-0002-1815-7570; Kibert, Charles/0000-0002-0312-3175; Fenner, Andriel Evandro/0000-0001-5508-9039",,,,,84,70,70,67,233,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Additionally, for this estimation, the effect of seasonal changes of air density has been incorporated. As a reference, the SIEMENS 160/6 turbine has been adopted and wind energy potential has been expressed as the capacity factor (CF) associated to this turbine. The spatial distribution of CF provides an idea of available wind energy potential in the Lebanese coast. The impact of seasonal air density changes has been assessed as percentage reduction in this indicator. In summer, the CF reduction due to high temperatures and lower air density, reaches in some Southern regions of the Lebanese coast to values around 5.5%. The use of such reanalyses is likely to increase in the future, thus making consultancy work easier since a lot of computational work with state-of-the-art meteorological models like WRF or MC2 (used to draw the National Wind Atlas of Lebanon) may not be necessary. Therefore, most likely in the future, for wind potential estimations, rather than heavy calculation efforts, the know-how for consultancy companies will focus into deeper analysis and interpretation of readily-available data from reanalyses.","[Ibarra-Berastegi, Gabriel] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fluid Mech Dept, Plentzia Itsas Estazioa,PIE, Bilbao, Plentzia, Spain; [Gonzalez-Roji, Santos J.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Appl Phys Dept 2, Leioa, Spain; [Gonzalez-Roji, Santos J.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res Climate & Environ, Bern, Switzerland; [Ulazia, Alain] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fluid Mech Dept, Eibar, Spain; [Carreno-Medinabeitia, Sheila] TECNALIA R&I, Meteorol Area, Energy & Environm Div, Basque Country, Spain; [Saenz, Jon] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Appl Phys Dept 2, Plentzia Itsas Estazioa,PIE, Leioa, Plentzia, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country; University of Bern; University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Ibarra-Berastegi, G (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fluid Mech Dept, Plentzia Itsas Estazioa,PIE, Bilbao, Plentzia, Spain.",gabriel.ibarra@ehu.es; santosjose.gonzalez@ehu.eus; alain.ulazia@ehu.es; sheila.carreno@tecnalia.com; jon.saenz@ehu.es,"González-Rojí, Santos J./AAC-6172-2020; Ulazia, Alain/U-7801-2019; Carreno-Madinabeitia, Sheila/AAE-2433-2022; Saenz, Jon/A-7500-2011","González-Rojí, Santos J./0000-0003-4737-0984; Ulazia, Alain/0000-0002-4124-2853; Carreno-Madinabeitia, Sheila/0000-0003-4625-6178; Saenz, Jon/0000-0002-5920-7570",Spanish Government's MINECO project [CGL2016-467 76561-R]; UPV/EHU [GIU17/02],Spanish Government's MINECO project; UPV/EHU,This work has been funded by the Spanish Government's MINECO project CGL2016-467 76561-R (AEI/FEDER EU) and UPV/EHU funded project GIU17/02).,,15,1,1,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-0130-9,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BP8EG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000564548600022,View Full Record in Web of Science

A rapid expert-based assessment method for dam failure of SFRB supported by an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been presented. Flood storage was assessed for 110 example SFRB and the corresponding Dam Failure Risk was evaluated for all dams across the wider Greater Manchester study area. The results show that Dam Failure Risk can be estimated by using the variables Dam Height, Dam Length, Maximum Flood Water Volume, Flood Water Surface Area, Mean Annual Rainfall (based on Met Office data), Altitude, Catchment Size, Urban Catchment Proportion, Forest Catchment Proportion, and Managed Maximum Flood Water Volume. A cross-validation R-2 value of 0.70 for the ANN model signifies that the tool is likely to predict variables well for new data sets. Traditionally, dams are considered safe because they have been built according to high technical standards. However, many dams that were constructed decades ago do not meet the current state-of-the-art dam design guidelines. Spatial distribution maps show that dam failure risks of SFRB located near cities are higher than those situated in rural locations. The proposed tool could be used as an early warning system in times of heavy rainfall. This chapter is based on material from Danso-Amoako et al. (2012). The author recommends that this chapter should be read after the related Chapter 11, Classifying Adaptive Sustainable Flood Retention Basins.","[Scholz, Miklas] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Civil Engn, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Scholz, Miklas] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Scholz, Miklas] Univ Salford, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Civil Engn, Salford, Lancs, England",University of Johannesburg; Lund University; University of Salford,"Scholz, M (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Civil Engn, Johannesburg, South Africa.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Civil Engn, Salford, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,978-0-12-816247-7; 978-0-12-816246-0,,,,2019,,,,,301,321,,10.1016/B978-0-12-816246-0.00012-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816246-0.00012-4,10.1016/C2017-0-04643-8,,21,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BP0PS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000535860400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Popular techniques use knowledge of the human pose for inferring the action, and the most recent approaches tend to combine pose information with either knowledge of the scene or of the objects with which the human interacts. Our approach makes a step forward in this direction by combining the human pose with the scene in which the human is placed, together with the spatial relationships between humans and objects. Based on standard, simple descriptors like HOG and SIFT, recognition performance is enhanced when these three types of knowledge are taken into account. Results obtained in the PASCAL 2010 Action Recognition Dataset demonstrate that our technique reaches state-of-the-art results using simple descriptors and classifiers.","[Shapovalova, Nataliya; Gong, Wenjuan; Pedersoli, Marco; Xavier Roca, Francesc; Gonzalez, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Comp Sci, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Shapovalova, Nataliya; Gong, Wenjuan; Pedersoli, Marco; Xavier Roca, Francesc; Gonzalez, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Comp Vis, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centre de Visio per Computador (CVC),"Shapovalova, N (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Comp Sci, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",shapovalova@cvc.uab.es; wenjuan@cvc.uab.es; marcopede@cvc.uab.es; xavir@cvc.uab.es; poal@cvc.uab.es,"Gonzàlez, Jordi/I-1812-2015; Marva, F.

However, the quantification of VOC exchange on the ecosystem scale is still an analytical challenge. In the present study we tested and applied a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry system (PTR-MS) for the measurement of biogenic VOCs in a mixed deciduous forest, VOC concentrations were from the raw instrument signals based on physical principles. This method allows a consistent quantification also of compounds for which regular calibration with a gas standard is not available. It requires a regular and careful investigation of the mass-dependent ion detection characteristics of the PTR-MS, which otherwise could become a considerable error source. The PTR-MS method was tested in the laboratory for a range of oxygenated and non-oxygenated VOCs using a permeation source. the agreement was within 16% or better, which is well within the expected uncertainty. During the field measurement campaign in a deciduous forest stand, an on-line intercomparison with a state-of-the-art gas-chromatography system showed a generally good agreement. However, the relatively low ambient VOC concentrations revealed some systematic difference for acetone and isoprene, that may indicate an error in the determination of the PTR-MS offset or an interference of an unidentified isobaric compound on the detected ion mass. With the presentation of selected field results, we demonstrate the ability of the PTR-MS system to measure continuous vertical concentration profiles of biogenic VOCs throughout a forest canopy at a time resolution of 20 min. The resulting datasets provide valuable information for the study of the interactions between emission, photochemical transformation and transport processes within and above the forest canopy.

However, the precise composition identification of adhesive in archaeological remains is a real analytical challenge, because the adhesive mainly consists of organic materials that are susceptible to decay during burial process. Of particular interest is to know which animal/plant species were being exploited for glue manufacturing other than for food. The arid climate of the Xiaohe Cemetery, located in Taklamakan Desert, northwestern China, provides favorable conditions for the preservation of organic residues. A bone sculpture-inlaid wooden artifact was collected from the Xiaohe Cemetery, with some semi-transparent yellowish adhesive exposed due to the detachment of an inlaid bone sculpture. In this paper, micro samples of the adhesive were scraped for FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, primary examination) and subsequent proteomic analysis to determine the proteinous component(s) and precise origin(s). The identified tryptic peptides match most closely to known bovine collagen markers, suggesting that this adhesive was an animal glue made from cattle. These results reveal the diverse utilizations of cattle in the Xiaohe Cemetery, which provided not only meat, milk, hides, sinews and dung, but also leftover parts for manufacturing adhesive. This is the earliest evidence of adhesive identified in China up to our knowledge, which sheds light on adhesive development around 3500 years ago. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies that have examined biogeophysical impacts of these crops noted a positive feedback between near-surface cooling and enhanced evapotranspiration (ET), but also potential unintended consequences of soil moisture and groundwater depletion. To better understand hydrometeorological effects of perennial bioenergy crop expansion, this study conducted high-resolution (2-km grid spacing) simulations with a state-of-the-art atmospheric model (Weather Research and Forecasting system) dynamically coupled to a land surface model. We applied the modeling system over the Southern Plains of the United States during a normal precipitation year (2007) and a drought year (2011). By focusing the deployment of bioenergy cropping systems on marginal and abandoned farmland areas (to reduce the potential conflict with food systems), the research presented here is the first realistic examination of hydrometeorological impacts associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion. Our results illustrate that the deployment of perennial bioenergy crops leads to widespread cooling (1-2 degrees C) that is largely driven by an enhanced reflection of shortwave radiation and, secondarily, due to an enhanced ET. Bioenergy crop deployment was shown to reduce the impacts of drought through simultaneous moistening and cooling of the near-surface environment. However, simulated impacts on near-surface cooling and ET were reduced during the drought relative to a normal precipitation year, revealing differential effects based on background environmental conditions. This study serves as a key step toward the assessment of hydroclimatic sustainability associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion under diverse hydrometeorological conditions by highlighting the driving mechanisms and processes associated with this energy pathway.","[Wagner, Melissa; Georgescu, Matei] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wang, Meng; Georgescu, Matei] Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain; [Miller, Jesse; Bernacchi, Carl J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL USA; [Vanloocke, Andy] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA USA; [Bagley, Justin E.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Bernacchi, Carl J.] ARS, Global Change & Photosynth Res Unit, USDA, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Iowa State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Georgescu, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Georgescu, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Matei.Georgescu@asu.edu,"Georgescu, Matei/G-5442-2011; Wang, Meng/AFP-8743-2022; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/K-7008-2017; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/AAA-3295-2019; Bernacchi, Carl/AAH-3833-2019","Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Bernacchi, Carl/0000-0002-2397-425X; VanLoocke, Andy/0000-0002-7516-8479",NSF [EAR-1204774]; Directorate For Geosciences [1204774] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),This work was funded by NSF Grant EAR-1204774.,,65,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-1693,1757-1707,,GCB BIOENERGY,GCB Bioenergy,JUN,2017,6,,,,1024,1041,,10.1111/gcbb.12403,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12403,,,18,Agronomy; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,EW8BQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000402743500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to that ways in which humans engage futurity in their everyday lives and geographies. Although acknowledging some important exceptions, in this article we seek to build specifically on anthropologist Arjun Appadurai's call for a more people-centered and democratic consideration of future making. What Appadurai terms an ethics of possibility is about rescuing the future from the avalanche of numbers associated with expert calculation in the realms of science and technology, security and geopolitics, and health and insurance. We argue that human geographers are among the culturally oriented social scientists who are equipped for scholarly advancement of an ethics of possibility. Our own geographic contribution emerges from field-based qualitative material collected as part of a wider collaborative research project on aspirations in urban Asia. In the accounts that we present from cities in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, it is the prospect of elsewhere-and of being elsewhere-that nurtures imaginings of aspirational futures and spurs efforts to realize them. In addition to drawing empirical attention to people, places, and regions that do not often feature in Anglophone human geography, our article contributes to geographic conceptualization of how futures are being prospected in cultural imaginaries and through an array of spatial practices.","[Bunnell, Tim; Gillen, Jamie; Ho, Elaine Lynn-Ee] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore; [Ho, Elaine Lynn-Ee] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Asia Res Inst, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Bunnell, T (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore.",geotgb@nus.edu.sg; geomjg@nus.edu.sg; geoehle@nus.edu.sg,,,Singapore Ministry of Education AcRF [MOE2012-T2-1-153],"Singapore Ministry of Education AcRF(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","Research for this article was funded by Singapore Ministry of Education AcRF Tier 2 grant (MOE2012-T2-1-153) on Aspirations, Urban Governance and the Remaking of Asian Cities.",,74,36,36,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

In this paper, realistic forecast errors are prescribed, and a corrective approach is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of day-ahead persistence forecast error by short-term forecasts from a state-of-the-art sky imager system. These forecasts preserve the spatiotemporal dependence structure of forecast errors avoiding statistical approximations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a receding horizon quadratic program developed for valley filling the midday net load depression through electric vehicle charging. Throughout one month of simulations the ability to flatten net load is assessed under practical forecast accuracy levels achievable from persistence, sky imager and perfect forecasts. Compared to using day-ahead persistence solar forecasts, the proposed corrective approach using sky imager forecasts delivers a 25% reduction in the standard deviation of the daily net load. It is demonstrated that correcting day-ahead forecasts in real time with more accurate short-term forecasts benefits the valley filling solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to new-generation weather radars, the dual-PAR shows great advantages in tornado detection for its high spatial resolution, reliable polarimetric variables, and rapid-scan strategy. The polaritnetric signature of copolar cross-correlation coefficient with anomalously low magnitude appears to be effective for verifying a tornado and thus is helpful for issuing tornado warnings.

This method makes use of information filtering networks to produce a robust estimate of the global sparse inverse covariance from a simple sum of local inverse covariances computed on small subparts of the network. Being based on local and low-dimensional inversions, this method is computationally very efficient and statistically robust, even for the estimation of inverse covariance of high-dimensional, noisy, and short time series. Applied to financial data our method results are computationally more efficient than state-of-the-art methodologies such as Glasso producing, in a fraction of the computation time, models that can have equivalent or better performances but with a sparser inference structure. We also discuss performances with sparse factor models where we notice that relative performances decrease with the number of factors. The local nature of this approach allows us to perform computations in parallel and provides a tool for dynamical adaptation by partial updating when the properties of some variables change without the need of recomputing the whole model. This makes this approach particularly suitable to handle big data sets with large numbers of variables. Examples of practical application for forecasting, stress testing, and risk allocation in financial systems are also provided.","[Barfuss, Wolfram] FAU Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Phys, Nagelsbachstr 49b, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Massara, Guido Previde; Di Matteo, T.; Aste, Tomaso] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Di Matteo, T.] Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Di Matteo, T.; Aste, Tomaso] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, System Risk Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Barfuss, Wolfram] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Barfuss, Wolfram] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, Newtonstr 15, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of London; University College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Barfuss, W (corresponding author), FAU Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Phys, Nagelsbachstr 49b, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany.;Barfuss, W (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Barfuss, W (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, Newtonstr 15, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",,"Aste, Tomaso/ABA-8973-2020; DiMatteo, Tiziana/AGZ-7196-2022","Aste, Tomaso/0000-0002-4219-0215; Previde Massara, Guido/0000-0003-0502-2789; Barfuss, Wolfram/0000-0002-9077-5242",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K002309/1]; COST Action [TD1210]; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),T.A. acknowledges support of the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in funding the SystemicRiskCentre (Grant No. ES/K002309/1).

It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-of-the-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city. I then use this to develop my own definition and conceptualisation of a circular approach to urban resource management.","[Williams, Joanna] UCL, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Williams, J (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, Cent House,14 Upper Woborn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",joanna.williams@ucl.ac.uk,,"Williams, Joanna/0000-0003-0377-8654",,,,,61,47,47,6,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,OCT,2019,13,,,,2746,2762,,10.1177/0042098018806133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098018806133,,,17,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,IX7RG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000485882000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Computational tools can predict chemical toxicities using the knowledge gained from experimental studies which drastically reduces the attrition rate of compounds during drug discovery and developmental stages. The purpose of in silico predictions for drug leads and anticipating toxicological endpoints of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity, clinical adverse impacts and metabolism of pharmaceutically active substances has gained widespread acceptance in academia and pharmaceutical industries. With unrestricted accessibility to powerful biomarkers, researchers have an opportunity to contemplate the most accurate predictive scores to evaluate drug's adverse impact on various organs. A multiparametric model involving physico-chemical properties, quantitative structure-activity relationship predictions and docking score was found to be a more reliable predictor for estimating chemical toxicities with potential to reflect atomic-level insights. These in silico models provide informed decisions to carry out in vitro and in vivo studies and subsequently confirms the molecules clues deciphering the cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and organ toxicity properties of compounds. Even though the drugs withdrawn by USFDA at later phases of drug discovery which should have passed all the state-of-the-art experimental approaches and currently acceptable toxicity filters, there is a dire need to interconnect all these molecular key properties to enhance our knowledge and guide in the identification of leads to drug optimization phases.

The field location, in the densely populated, water-stressed Mexico City region gives this record particular societal relevance. A detailed paleoclimate reconstruction from central Mexico will enhance our understanding of long-term natural climate variability in the North American tropics and its relationship with changes at higher latitudes. The site lies at the northern margin of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where modern precipitation amounts are influenced by sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), more winter precipitation at the site is hypothesized to have been a consequence of a southward displacement of the mid-latitude westerlies. It thus represents a key spatial node for understanding large-scale hydrological variability of tropical and subtropical North America and is at an altitude (2240 m a.s.l.), typical of much of western North America. In addition, its sediments contain a rich record of pre-Holocene volcanic history; knowledge of the magnitude and frequency relationships of the area's explosive volcanic eruptions will improve capacity for risk assessment of future activity. Explosive eruption deposits will also be used to provide the backbone of a robust chronology necessary for full exploitation of the paleoclimate record.

Historic buildings are considered to be the most vulnerable to this adverse climatic impact, via moisture induced deterioration and resulting strength decay in their construction materials. Therefore, the identification of these climatic effects is important to be able to develop suitable tools to mitigate them, both for individual buildings and on a regional scale. This paper presents the analysis of a comprehensive environmental monitoring of two historic buildings in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, UK, to provide thorough insight on their performances under environmental loading on a comparative basis. Firstly, the effect of wind-driven rain (WDR) and flooding is assessed by correlation with relative humidity (RH) measurements. The WDR measurements are then compared against values calculated using well established semi-empirical models and reasons behind the limited correlation are discussed. The dynamic hygrothermal response of two different historic fabrics is studied in greater detail by monitoring in-wall temperature and RH. The conclusions drawn from the analysis of the monitoring outputs are then further elaborated on by using hygrothermal characterization obtained by dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) testing of material samples extracted from the fabric of these buildings.

However, poor overall accuracy (OA) may be achieved when dealing with small input size and low-resolution images with classic CNNs. This paper proposes a novel, deep CNN architecture called DRSNet for small patch size Landsat 8 remote sensing (RS) image recognition. A module called residual inception channel attention block is applied for feature extraction, which combines the advantages of Inception-ResNet and channel attention. Pooling layers are replaced with reduction modules to prevent representational bottleneck. Unlike existing CNN structures, DRSNet adopts upsampling steps before final pooling layers, retrieving lost information caused by previous downsampling steps. Compared with existing state-of-the-art CNNs, DRSNet achieves the highest classification accuracy in our RS data set. Experimental results show that our model improves OA by 2%-9%, accelerates convergence speed, and effectively reduces loss. DRSNet also exhibits impressive results and outperforms baseline CNNs in three public data sets, namely, EuroSAT, Brazilian Coffee Scenes, and UCMerced Land Use. The proposed network is practical for large-scale land surface classification using free, low-resolution RS data; hence, it could be useful for nongovernment organizations or governments of developing countries.","[Chen, Feihao; Tsou, Jin Yeu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Architecture, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tsou, Jin Yeu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong,"Tsou, JY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jytsou@cityu.edu.hk,,"TSOU, JIN YEU/0000-0002-7682-4327",,,,,47,5,5,4,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1569-8432,1872-826X,,INT J APPL EARTH OBS,Int.

In the absence of instruments suitable for high-frequency measurements, fluxes can also be determined using e.g., chamber techniques. However, up to date fluxes of depositing compounds were rarely determined using chamber techniques, mainly due to a modification of the aerodynamic conditions for the trace gas transport within the chamber. In this study, we present ozone (O-3) deposition fluxes measured by the dynamic chamber technique and validate them against the eddy covariance (EC) method for a natural grassland site in Germany. The chamber system presented in Pape et al. (2009) was used and optimized to (i) reduce the likelihood of non-stationarities, (ii) yield 30 min averages of flux measurements, and (iii) supply simultaneous profile measurements. The raw O-3 fluxes of the dynamic chamber were corrected for gas-phase chemistry in the chamber volume and for the modification of the aerodynamic and boundary layer resistances. Simultaneously measured carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes by both methods compared well during daytime documenting an equal vegetation activity inside and outside the chambers. The final corrected O-3 deposition fluxes of both methods deviated on average by only 11% during daytime. The findings demonstrate the capability of the dynamic chamber method to capture representative O-3 deposition fluxes for grassland ecosystems, even when the canopy height is similar to the chamber height. The canopy resistance to O-3 was assessed by both methods and showed a characteristic diurnal cycle with minimum hourly median values of 180 s m(-1) (chambers) and 150s m(-1) (EC) before noon. During nighttime the fluxes and resistances showed a higher uncertainty for both methods due to frequent low wind associated with non-stationary conditions at the experimental site. Canopy resistances for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) deposition were determined analogously with the chambers and were on average 86% higher than for O-3. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, raw EWFs are usually biased and under-dispersive and so cannot be directly used in ESP, leading to the development of several post-processing methods. The performance of these methods needs to be evaluated/compared in building ESP based on deterministic and probabilistic criteria. In addition, likely influencing factors also need to be identified. This study evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art methods: the Generator-based Post-Processing (GPP) method, Extended Logistic Regression (ExLR), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Affine Kernel Dressing (AKD), using a simple bias correction (BC) method as a benchmark. The evaluation was carried out over four watersheds with different basin areas in the humid region of central-south China based on the weather reforecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS). The results show that the performance of the post-processing methods varies with the forecast variable (precipitation, or air temperature or streamflow), but all of them outperform the BC and GEFS. For the four post-processing methods, the advantage of the generator-based methods (GPP and ExLR) lies in their probabilistic performance, which outperforms the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) by about 10% in precipitation forecasts and about 20% in streamflow forecasts, while the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) are better at their deterministic performance for precipitation forecasts, with a benefit of about 15%. Meanwhile, the post-processing methods generally perform better for precipitation and streamflow forecasts, but worse for air temperature forecasts for a bigger basin compared to the distribution-based methods. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the uncertainty of post-processing methods in ESP.","[Li, Xiang-Quan; Chen, Jie; Xu, Chong-Yu; Chen, Hua] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong-Yu] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Li, Lu] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Uni Res Climate, Bergen, Norway",Wuhan University; University of Oslo; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Chen, hua/AAN-1532-2020; Li, Lu/AAZ-8193-2020; Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012","Li, Lu/0000-0003-3638-618X; Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51779176, 51539009]; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) - Ministry of Education; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs P.

In the present work, Allele specific PCR (AS-PCR) was standardized to detect the nucleotide polymorphism within the HSP90AB1 gene (SNP g. 4338T>C) in Indian breeds of dairy cattle. The identified genotypes were associated with relative thermotolerance in terms of physiological parameters and milk production traits. The results of the experiments revealed that the genotype frequency of CC, CT, and TT for Sahiwal were 0.05, 0.78, and 0.17, respectively, and in Frieswal, the frequencies were 0.20, 0.70, and 0.10, respectively. The average rectal temperature (ART) and average respiration rates (ARR) were recorded during peak summer stress and heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) was calculated. The association studies indicated that TT genotypes had significantly (P<0.01) higher HTC and lower ARR values than CT and CC in both the breeds. The TT genotype animals also had better production parameter in terms of total milk yield (TMY) (P<0.01). These findings may partly suggest the role of HSP90AB1 polymorphisms in the regulation of heat stress response and consequent effect on production traits.

The discovery of modern naturally-occurring C-4 plant species at elevations up to 4500 m in Tibet and 3000 m in Africa and South America, however, suggests that C-4 plants are present in a wider range of environments than previously thought. Environmental conditions on the Tibetan Plateau, including high irradiance, rainfall focused in summer, and saline soils, can favor C-4 plants by offsetting the deleterious effects of low growing season temperature. We present evidence based on leaf wax carbon isotope ratios from Lake Qinghai that C-4 plants accounted for 50% of terrestrial primary productivity on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau throughout the Lateglacial and early Holocene. Despite cold conditions, C-4 plants flourished due to a combination of factors, including maximum summer insolation, pCO(2) ca 250 ppmv, and sufficient summer precipitation. The modern C-3 plant-dominated ecosystem around Lake Qinghai was established ca 6 thousand years ago as pCO(2) increased and summer temperature and precipitation decreased. C-4 plants were also intermittently abundant during the Last Glacial period; we propose that C-4 plants contributed a significant portion of local primary productivity by colonizing the exposed, saline Qinghai Lake bed during low stands. Our results contrast with state-of-the-art ecosystem models that simulate <0.5% C-4 plant abundance on the Tibetan Plateau in modern and past environments. The past abundance of C-4 plants on the Tibetan Plateau suggests a wider temperature range for C-4 plants than can be inferred from modern distributions and model simulations, and provides paleoecological evidence to support recent findings that C-4 plant evolution and distribution was determined by a combination of climatic and environmental factors (temperature, irradiance, precipitation amount and seasonality, and soil salinity). Moreover, this finding highlights the exceptional sensitivity of high-elevation ecosystems to environmental change, and provides critical benchmarks for ecosystem model validation.

One method is to consider building components as multifunctional elements. These elements can perform several functions simultaneously, such as energy and structural aspects. As opposed to traditional sequential design in which each building element performs its own dedicated function. The former requires an integrated approach to prioritise the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of materials. In this paper, we present three multifunctional elements: a lightweight shell roof, a funicular floor and an adaptive solar facade. We focus on the numerical simulation used to integrate thermally active building systems (TABS) and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) with lightweight structures. We outline a framework for the integration of the multifunctional element analysis with a dynamic building model and the performance factors of a district energy network. We exemplify the framework through the design of a real experimental building in Zurich, Switzerland. This delivered a net plus energy building (NPEB) with an annual weighted energy demand of 37.8 kW h/m(2) a and a weighted energy surplus of 45%. The results demonstrate the enhanced performance in terms of operational and embodied emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lydon, G.

In addition to the existing policies that promote energy efficiency in buildings, the embodied energy and the environmental impacts contained in the building materials should be considered. In the case of the construction of insulation facade systems, the environmental implications are different depending on the type of facade system, the insulation materials used and the location of the building. This article aims to provide all of this information for Spain, including not only the production of the components of the facade system but also the installation phase and the transport to the building site. The results show that the most impactful alternative is the ventilated facade combined with the most impactful insulation materials of stone wool and expanded polystyrene. Meanwhile, the most advisable facade in all of the climate zones is the external thermal insulation system combined with any type of insulation. The environmental impacts of insulation materials are very different. Moreover, it is recommended that further studies complete these results with the economic and social implications of the use and maintenance phases for robust decision-making. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Hosting the World Urban Forum in 2014 allowed it to showcase its approach, key elements of which have been: creation of innovative transport infrastructure linking poorer peripheral districts to the city centre; culture-led regeneration; strong support of local development from the local business sector; and a successful municipally-owned utilities company. However, the city is spreading outwards without services and employment being provided; new low-income developments are replicating high-rise models which failed worldwide; there is limited intervention in the existing informal areas, many being in highly vulnerable locations where the level of risk is likely to increase with climate change; development has little regard for topography, ecological and environmental considerations; investment in accessible and good quality public space is restricted to some areas; the quality of the public realm does not always support health and wellbeing of the ageing population. This paper explores the institutional and socio-economic context in which Medellin has achieved the internationally recognized status of an 'innovative city'. It questions to what extent social equity, environmental sustainability and citizen empowerment have been promoted as per the ULI claims when it conferred the prize. The paper queries the extent to which 'urban innovation' is happening in Medellin, which has considerable implications given its recently found role as a 'model' city in Latin America and beyond.","[Ferrari, Soledad Garcia; Rivera, Helena] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, Ctr Contemporary Latin Amer Studies, Minto House,20-22 Chambers St, Edinburgh EH1 1JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Smith, Harry] Heriot Watt Univ, Urban Inst, Edwin Chadwick Bldg, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Coupe, Francoise] Univ Nacl Colombia, Escuela Habitat CEHAP, Calle 59A N 63-20,Bloque 24, Medellin, Colombia",Edinburgh College of Art; University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Ferrari, SG (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, Ctr Contemporary Latin Amer Studies, Minto House,20-22 Chambers St, Edinburgh EH1 1JZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",s.garcia@ed.ac.uk,,"Smith, Harry/0000-0003-0922-5575",,,,,48,8,8,1,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,APR,2018,,,,,354,364,,10.1016/j.cities.2017.12.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.12.011,,,11,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,FW8EQ,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000425561800037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, dam reservoirs are used for recreation, navigation and they provide safety in the downstream valleys against extreme flood events and droughts. All reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation which, without adequate prevention and mitigation counter-measures, threatens their sustainability. As well as the evident loss of storage capacity, the adequate and safe operation of water intakes and bottom outlets belonging to the vital outlet structures can be affected by the deposition of sediments in the reservoir. This Vision Paper first addresses the state-of-the-art and the main scientific advances in terms of prevention and mitigation measures against sedimentation in reservoirs.

Thousands of years ago, wild fruit trees were found in or close to the natural forests. The local inhabitants took them under cultivation and variants of these species exist all over Anatolia. More than 77 fruit species are grown in the different geographical regions of Turkey and several fruit species have been domesticated, especially in the Black Sea forests and Southeast Anatolia. Traditional fruit and nut crops include pear, quince, plum, sweet and sour cherries, rose hip, hazelnut, pistachio nut, almond, walnut, chestnut, olive, fig, pomegranate and grape. Turkey is also the center of many wild fruit species that have potential for food and other uses such as Crataegus azarolus L., Rubus caesis L., Prunus lauricerasus L., Arbutus andrachna L., Elaeagnus orientalis L., Ceratonia siliqua L., Celtis austaralis L., Pistachia terebinthus L., Pistachia khinjuk Stocks, and Prunus mahalep L. Different ecological conditions allow fruit species to be grown in different areas. Wide opportunity of fruit growing supplies a big variation all around the country. The conservation studies of fruit germplasm were started in 1964 with the collaboration of FAO. However, collection and adaptation studies of low chilling temperate zone fruit trees under subtropical conditions only began in the early 1980s. The subtropical climate area is mainly located in the Mediterranean region. The east part of the region is called as Cukurova. In Cukurova, the climate is changing, but there is always a lack chilling for high chilling requiring fruit cultivars. Fruit growing should be done with low chill cultivars. Since 1990s low chilling peach and nectarine breeding and from 2001 low chilling cherry breeding have begun.","[Kuden, A.

The provision of these services depends on the control exerted on the biogeochemistry and plant diversity of the system by the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors, e.g., grazing or mowing intensity. Biogeochemical models incorporate a mechanistic view of the functioning of grasslands and provide a sound basis for studying the underlying processes. However, in these models, the simulation of biogeochemical cycles is generally not coupled to simulation of plant species dynamics, which leads to considerable uncertainty about the quality of predictions. Ecological models, on the other hand, do account for biodiversity with approaches adopted from plant demography, but without linking the dynamics of plant species to the biogeochemical processes occurring at the community level, and this hampers the models' capacity to assess resilience against abiotic stresses such as drought and nutrient limitation. While setting out the state-of-the-art developments of biogeochemical and ecological modelling, we explore and highlight the role of plant diversity in the regulation of the ecosystem processes underlying the ecosystems services provided by multi-species grasslands. An extensive literature and model survey was carried out with an emphasis on technically advanced models reconciling biogeochemistry and biodiversity, which are readily applicable to managed grasslands in temperate latitudes. We propose a roadmap of promising developments in modelling.","[Van Oijen, Marcel] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, Pazmany Ps 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Sci, Excellence Ctr, Brunszvik U 2, H-2462 Martonvasar, Hungary; [Barcza, Zoltan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Confalonieri, Roberto; Movedi, Ermes] Univ Milan, Cassandra Lab, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Korhonen, Panu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Halolantie 31A, Maaninka 71750, Finland; [Kroeel-Dulay, Gyoergy; Lellei-Kovacs, Eszter] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Louarn, Gaetan] INRAE, URP3F, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Louault, Frederique; Martin, Raphael; Picon-Cochard, Catherine; Bellocchi, Gianni] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Moulin, Thibault] Agroscope, Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rolinski, Susanne; Wirth, Stephen Bjoern] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Viovy, Nicolas] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, LSCE, IPSL,CEA,UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of Milan; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research; INRAE; INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); VetAgro Sup; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Van Oijen, M (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland.",mvano@ceh.ac.uk; zoltan.barcza@ttk.elte.hu; Roberto.Confalonieri@Unimi.It; panu.korhonen@luke.fi; kroel-dulay.gyorgy@okologia.mta.hu; lellei-kovacs.eszter@okologia.mta.hu; gaetan.louarn@inrae.fr; frederique.louault@inrae.fr; raphael.martin@inrae.fr; thibault.moulin@agroscope.admin.ch; ermes.movedi@unimi.it; catherine.picon-cochard@inrae.fr; rolinski@pik-potsdam.de; Nicolas.Viovy@Lsce.Ipsl.Fr; wirth@pik-potsdam.de; gianni.bellocchi@inrae.fr,"Gaëtan, Louarn/C-4454-2013; Lellei-Kovács, Eszter/GPL-6111-2022; Viovy, Nicolas/S-2631-2018; Barcza, Zoltán/G-3880-2014; Picon-Cochard, Catherine/J-3954-2013","Gaëtan, Louarn/0000-0003-3701-7036; Viovy, Nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; Barcza, Zoltán/0000-0002-1278-0636; Bellocchi, Gianni/0000-0003-2712-7979; Picon-Cochard, Catherine/0000-0001-7728-8936; LOUAULT, Frederique/0000-0002-9430-4261; Martin, Raphael/0000-0001-8778-7915; Korhonen, Panu/0000-0002-0274-6362",Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program `Investissements d'Avenir' [16-IDEX-0001 CAP 20-25]; Research Council of Norway through project MYR [281109]; Environment & Rural A ffairs Monitoring and Modelling Programme (ERAMMP) (Welsh Government) [C210/2016/2017]; UKCentre for Ecology Hydrology [06297]; Szechenyi 2020 programme; European Regional Development Fund; Hungarian Government [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00028]; OP RDE [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803]; project DivCSA (the Academy of Finland) [316215]; project Climasteppe (BMBF) [01DJ18012],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program `Investissements d'Avenir'(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Research Council of Norway through project MYR(Research Council of Norway); Environment & Rural A ffairs Monitoring and Modelling Programme (ERAMMP) (Welsh Government); UKCentre for Ecology Hydrology; Szechenyi 2020 programme; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Hungarian Government; OP RDE; project DivCSA (the Academy of Finland); project Climasteppe (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program `Investissements d'Avenir' (16-IDEX-0001 CAP 20-25).

Agent-based models (ABMs) are valuable tools to study these linkages because they can represent individual migration decisions of human actors. Indeed, there is an increasing, yet small, number of ABMs that consider the natural environment in rural migration processes. Therefore, we reviewed 15 ABMs of environment-migration linkages in rural contexts to synthesize the current state of the art. The reviewed ABMs are mostly applied in tropical contexts, serve a wide range of purposes, and cover diverse scales and types of environmental factors, migration processes, and social-ecological feedbacks. We identified potential for future model development with respect to the (1) complexity of environmental influence factors, (2) representation of relevant migration flows, and (3) type of social-ecological couplings. We found that existing models tend to not include fully integrated feedbacks and provide recommendations for the further development of ABMs to contribute to an understanding of the environment-migration-nexus in the future.","[Thober, Jule; Schwarz, Nina; Hermans, Kathleen] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Schwarz, Nina] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Enschede, Netherlands; [Hermans, Kathleen] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Twente; Wageningen University & Research,"Thober, J (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany.",,"Schwarz, Nina/A-5409-2011","Schwarz, Nina/0000-0003-4624-488X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Junior Research Group MigSoKo [01UU1606],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Junior Research Group MigSoKo,"We gratefully thank Matthew Berman, Behrooz Hassani-Mahmooei, Marco Janssen, Dominic Kniveton, Jose Manuel Magallanes, Warong Naivinit, Ali Asjad Naqvi, Deborah Rogers, Alexander Smajgl, Christopher Smith, Jing Wu, and Cheng-yi Xia for performing the cross-checks of our model categorization.

The results are compared with results from a fine-resolution, 3D, numerical simulation of the global circulation from 1987 to 1995 [Parallel Ocean Climate Model (POCM)]. For the mean circulation, the models are based on Sverdrup dynamics with the circulation around each island calculated according to the island rule with overlapping islands taken into account. Assuming all of the passages are wide and deep yields an archipelago circulation vastly at odds with observations. A large westward transport through Torres Strait provides the throughflow between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. a large westward transport through Luzon Strait passes southward through the South China Sea into the Sulu Sea and exits into the Pacific Ocean through the Celebes Sea. There is a northwestward transport through the remainder of the archipelago By successively blocking straits under the assumption that frictional effects are sufficient to arrest flow in the strait. an understanding is built up of why the mean circulation in the archipelago is as observed and as simulated in POCM. For example, blocking Torres Strait yields a more realistic circulation with southward flow in the archipelago. Greater realism is achieved by blocking off the South China Sea, so making the dominant pathway for the throughflow from the Pacific westward through the Celebes Sea and southward through,Makassar Strait. The weak throughflow in POCM (7.5 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) is found due to the wind stresses derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 10-m twice-daily winds, which art much weaker than the Hellerman and Rosenstein climatology (HR) used in previous studies. Also, POCM's throughflow is wholly fed by the South Equatorial Current rather than predominantly by the Mindanao Current, as found in models forced by HR climatology. Analysis of the wind stress datasets and that of the Florida Start: University from 1961 to 1995 shows that the latitude of the zero-Sverdrup-transport streamline near the Pacific entrance to the Celebes Sea has shifted poleward over the decades, so decreasing the absolute amount originating from the Mindanao Current. Regarding the seasonal cycle, there is negligible transport below 500 m at annual period within the archipelago in POCM. which suggests that the numerous islands and sills within the archipelago enhance the adjustment to the applied wind stress locally. Assuming a local Sverdrup balance, island-rule-based models of the archipelago show that forcing by wind stresses over the archipelago and Australia give reasonable agreement with POCM for the amplitude of the annual harmonic in depth-integrated transport. Better agreement in phase within the straits and seas is obtained by recognizing that frictional effects within certain straits enabler the influence of wind stress variations to be felt in directions other than just to the west, as in the original island rule. It is further noted that the adjustment to semiannual period wind-stress forcing is incomplete within the seas: there is no local quasi-equilibrium response. In POCM, the archipelago fills above 500 m in February-June and September-November, and drains in the remaining months. There is compensating Bow below. Also, seasonal variability of the currents in the west Pacific is not sufficient to alter significantly the eyre closure in the west Pacific, and the depth-integrated throughflow is fed by the South Equatorial Current throughout the year, either via a western boundary current or a broad zonal jet.","Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, JCESS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Wajsowicz, RC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, JCESS, 3433 Comp & Space Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,31,15,18,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-3670,,,J PHYS OCEANOGR,J.

In this study several combinations of state-of-the-art convection and lightning parameterisations are used in simulations with the global atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM5/MESSy, and are evaluated against lightning observations. A wide range in the spatial and temporal variability of the simulated flash densities is found, attributed to both types of parameterisations. Some combinations perform well, whereas others are hardly applicable. In addition to resolution dependent rescaling parameters, each combination of lightning and convection schemes requires individual scaling to reproduce the observed flash frequencies.

As I learned, thinking about The Zone (as I'll call it) is not a straightforward affair. On the one hand The Zone is exactly what you might think it is - a radioactive territory whose crumbling ruins and growing wildlife bear witness to the failure of the soviet nuclear dream. Yet on the other it's also not what you think it is, like a hole is not the nothing it appears to be but a something that, strictly speaking, it isn't. Because of this ontological uncertainty The Zone is not only something to wander in but something to be wondered about. And as such, it may be better dreamed than simply thought of. Drawing on my zonal meanderings and a speculative-pragmatic form of acoustic ecology, as well as employing a liberal dose of poetic licence, I develop a fabulation that takes a stroll through a forgotten cemetery, an improvised melody played beneath a secret radar array, and a daydream had in a dilapidated post office as expressive of a thought experiment whose meaningful result is more a fictional achievement than a factual reckoning. Images and sounds from my peregrinations through The Zone figure in this work as elements that advance a story about a future people displaced by climate change who evolve the ability to lure affections from environmental spaces by casting melodies into them. In this future history we learn about the costs of noise and the nature of holes; we discover that media travel backwards in time, and we sense not what The Zone is but what mood it's in.","[Priest, Eldritch] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Contemporary Arts, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Priest, E (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Contemporary Arts, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",epriest@sfu.ca,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"SINGIDUNUM UNIV, FAC MEDIA & COMMUNICATIONS",BELGRADE,"KARADORDEVA 65, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",2217-9666,2406-1654,,AM J ART MEDIA STUD,Am.

Although an important species, as its use as a fertilizer sustains human living, ammonia has major consequences for both humans and the environment because of its reactive gas-phase chemistry that makes it easily convertible to particles. Despite its pronounced importance, ammonia emissions are highly uncertain in most emission inventories. However, the great development of satellite remote sensing nowadays provides the opportunity for more targeted research on constraining ammonia emissions. Here, we used satellite measurements to calculate global ammonia emissions over the period 2008-2017. Then, the calculated ammonia emissions were fed to a chemistry transport model, and ammonia concentrations were simulated for the period 2008-2017. The simulated concentrations of ammonia were compared with ground measurements from Europe, North America and Southeastern Asia, as well as with satellite measurements. The satellite-constrained ammonia emissions represent global concentrations more accurately than state-of-the-art emissions. Calculated fluxes in the North China Plain were seen to be more increased after 2015, which is not due to emission changes but due to changes in sulfate emissions that resulted in less ammonia neutralization and hence in larger atmospheric loads. Emissions over Europe were also twice as much as those in traditional datasets with dominant sources being industrial and agricultural applications. Four hot-spot regions of high ammonia emissions were seen in North America, which are characterized by high agricultural activity, such as animal breeding, animal farms and agricultural practices. South America is dominated by ammonia emissions from biomass burning, which causes a strong seasonality. In Southeastern Asia, ammonia emissions from fertilizer plants in China, Pakistan, India and Indonesia are the most important, while a strong seasonality was observed with a spring and late summer peak due to rice and wheat cultivation. Measurements of ammonia surface concentrations were better reproduced with satellite-constrained emissions, such as measurements from CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder).","[Evangeliou, Nikolaos; Eckhardt, Sabine] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Dept Atmospher & Climate Res ATMOS, Kjeller, Norway; [Balkanski, Yves; Cozic, Anne; Hauglustaine, Didier] CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, CNRS, UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Van Damme, Martin; Coheur, Pierre-Francois; Clarisse, Lieven] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Spect Quantum Chem & Atmospher Remote Sensing SQ, Brussels, Belgium; [Shephard, Mark W.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Cady-Pereira, Karen E.] Atmospher & Environm Res Inc, Lexington, MA USA",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Atmospheric & Environmental Research,"Evangeliou, N (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Dept Atmospher & Climate Res ATMOS, Kjeller, Norway.",nikolaos.evangeliou@nilu.no,"Eckhardt, Sabine/I-4001-2012; Clarisse, Lieven/GQQ-4657-2022; Evangeliou, Nikolaos/A-7547-2012; Balkanski, Yves/A-6616-2011","Eckhardt, Sabine/0000-0001-6958-5375; Clarisse, Lieven/0000-0002-8805-2141; Evangeliou, Nikolaos/0000-0001-7196-1018; Van Damme, Martin/0000-0003-1752-0558; Balkanski, Yves/0000-0001-8241-2858",Research Council of Norway [275407]; F.R.S.-FNRS,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"This study was supported by the Research Council of Norway (project ID: 275407, COMBAT - Quantification of Global Ammonia Sources constrained by a Bayesian Inversion Technique).

State-of-the-art flood loss models are often developed on the basis of empirical damage data from specific case studies and do not perform well when spatially and temporally transferred. This is due to the fact that such localized models often cover only a small set of possible damage processes from one event and a region. On the other hand, a single generalized model covering multiple events and different regions ignores the variability in damage processes across regions and events due to variables that are not explicitly accounted for individual households. We implement a hierarchical Bayesian approach to parameterize widely used depth-damage functions resulting in a hierarchical (multilevel) Bayesian model (HBM) for flood loss estimation that accounts for spatiotemporal heterogeneity in damage processes. We test and prove the hypothesis that, in transfer scenarios, HBMs are superior compared to generalized and localized regression models.

Here, this cloud influence is directly quantified by disabling cloud radiative feedbacks or cloud locking within a state-of-the-art and well-documented model. Through comparison of idealized greenhouse warming experiments with and without cloud locking, the influence of Arctic and global cloud feedbacks is assessed. Global cloud feedbacks increase both global and Arctic warming by around 25%. In contrast, disabling Arctic cloud feedbacks has a negligible influence on both Arctic and global surface warming. Interestingly, the sum of noncloud radiative feedbacks does not change with either global or Arctic-only cloud locking. Notably, the influence of Arctic cloud feedbacks is likely underestimated, because, like many models, the model used here underestimates high-latitude supercooled cloud liquid. More broadly, this work demonstrates the value of regional and global cloud locking in a well-characterized model.","[Middlemas, E. A.; Kay, J.

Two boxes, one for plume and one for background conditions, are coupled by means of a mixing parameterization based on turbulence theory. The model considers comprehensive gas phase chemistry for the tropopause region including acetone, ethane and their oxidation products. Heterogeneous halogen, N2O5 and HOx chemistry on various types of background and aircraft-induced aerosols (liquid and ice) is considered, using state-of-the-art solubility dependent uptake coefficients for liquid phase reactions. The microphysical scheme allows for coagulation, gas-diffusive particle growth and evaporation, so that the particle development from 1 s after emission to several days can be simulated. Model results are shown, studying emissions into the upper troposphere as well as into the lowermost stratosphere for contrail and non-contrail conditions. We show the microphysical and chemical evolution of spreading plumes and use the concept of mean plume encounter time, t(l), to define effective emission and perturbation indices (EEIs and EPIs) for the North Atlantic Flight Corridor (NAFC) showing EEI(NOy) and EPI(O-3) for various background conditions, such as relative humidity, local time of emission, and seasonal variations. Our results show a high sensitivity of EEI and EPI s on the exact conditions under which emissions take place.

Thereby they stimulate the interest in space-, cost-, and energy-efficient heat storage technologies. Thermochemical conversion is an attractive candidate technology for heat storage fulfilling these efficiency requirements. The design of practically any complex engineered system is accompanied by theoretical analyses based on model representations. Thus, numerical modelling is particularly important for thermochemical heat storage systems to help realise their potential and to advance the technology from the laboratory to a commercial setting. This article reviews modelling work in the context of heat storage and transformation aimed at capturing the coupled multi-physical processes that are relevant to the simulation of thermochemical heat storage in a space- and time-resolved manner.

This is a region where few palaeoecological records have been preserved and the sequence yields important new palaeobotanical evidence for the late Holocene. The landscape is shown as having been largely open woodland, but more wooded than at present. The vegetation history of the last four millennia in these montane territories of south-western Iberia is discussed in the light of anthropogenic indicators, archaeological and documentary archives; fire incidence and climate change. Alnus is the predominant pollen type, although a decline is noted during the last couple of centuries. Its presence is connected with local topography behaving as a phreatophyte, that is, a plant which obtains a significant amount of water from the zone of saturated soil. A framework is also provided for the age and ecological dynamics of some major woodland taxa-Betula, Corylus, Ilex, evergreen and deciduous oaks, Ericaceae and Pinus. In addition, the natural status of several pollen taxa and local trends in biodiversity are discussed. We consider that the results of our work will have important implications for the understanding of the vegetation history in a floristically very rich area, with a noticeable diversity of woody taxa, and a relatively well preserved ecosystem structure.","[Gil-Romera, Graciela; Garcia Anton, Mercedes; Calleja, Juan A.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dpto Biol Bot, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Gil-Romera, G (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dpto Biol Bot, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",gmg@aber.ac.uk,"Alarcón, Juan Antonio Calleja/T-2297-2019; Calleja Alarcón, Juan Antonio/M-1639-2014; Gil-Romera, Graciela/C-9262-2016","Alarcón, Juan Antonio Calleja/0000-0002-6586-0939; Calleja Alarcón, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-6586-0939; Gil-Romera, Graciela/0000-0001-5726-2536",Spanish Government [AP2002-023]; Science Ministry [REN 2003-02499-GLO]; CICYT [BOS2000-0149]; Seneca Foundation [369 PI/0],Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission); Science Ministry; CICYT(Consejo Interinstitucional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT)); Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca),"G.

There is an intense research effort on the evaluation of the pipeline mechanical behavior and the strength verification at fault crossings. Still, some aspects need in-depth consideration concerning practical applications. A state-of-the-art review is presented on three critical analysis and design aspects, namely, the calculation of the design fault displacement via deterministic and probabilistic methods, the effect of numerical modeling parameters such as soil spring properties, and the alternative pipe protection measures in terms of availability, efficiency, and selection process.

Through a review of contemporary literature and 18 semi-structured interviews, the paper describes and compares five distinct BM archetypes: the atomised market model, market intermediation model, one-stop-shop, energy services agreement and managed energy services agreement. These models range from the traditional approach to highly innovative energy service contracts. The paper further illustrates how the UK and EU market for retrofitting residential buildings is beginning to trial the more innovative BMs. These emerging BMs are characterised by increasingly industrialised processes and integrated supply chains, a holistic customer offering and single point of sale, long-term energy-saving performance contracts (ESPC) and integral project finance. It is argued that whilst the traditional BM is suitable for the implementation of single or piecemeal energy-saving measures, BM innovation will be required to meet the UK's ambitious climate change targets.","[Brown, Donal] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton, Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Brown, D (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton, Sussex, England.",Donal.Brown@sussex.ac.uk,,"Brown, Donal/0000-0001-9629-4936",United Kingdom's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K011790/1],United Kingdom's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by the United Kingdom's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through a grant to the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED), Ref.

Conversely, the global cooling dissolves atmospheric carbon into the upper ocean, driving a 0.1 to 0.3 unit decrease in the aragonite saturation state (Omega(arag)) that persists for similar to 10 years. The peak anomaly in pH occurs 2 years post conflict, while the Omega(arag) anomaly peaks 4- to 5-years post conflict. The decrease in Omega(arag) would exacerbate a primary threat of ocean acidification: the inability of marine calcifying organisms to maintain their shells/skeletons in a corrosive environment. Our results are based on sensitivity simulations conducted with a state-of-the-art Earth system model integrated under various black carbon (soot) external forcings. Our findings suggest that regional nuclear conflict may have ramifications for global ocean acidification.","[Lovenduski, Nicole S.; Toon, Owen B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lovenduski, Nicole S.; Harrison, Cheryl S.; Olivarez, Holly] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Harrison, Cheryl S.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Port Isabel, TX USA; [Olivarez, Holly] Univ Colorado, Environm Sci Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bardeen, Charles] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Bardeen, Charles; Toon, Owen B.] Univ Colorado, Lab Atmospher & Space Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Coupe, Joshua; Robock, Alan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Rohr, Tyler] Water Power Technol Off, Dept Eenergy, Washington, DC USA; [Stevenson, Samantha] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lovenduski, NS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Lovenduski, NS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",nicole.lovenduski@colorado.edu,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016; Lovenduski, Nicole/V-4014-2019; Lovenduski, Nicole/AAS-3216-2020","Lovenduski, Nicole/0000-0001-5893-1009; Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656; TOON, OWEN/0000-0002-1394-3062; Olivarez, Holly/0000-0002-8994-7967; Rohr, Tyler/0000-0001-6599-8068; Harrison, Cheryl/0000-0003-4544-947X; Stevenson, Samantha/0000-0002-1223-8521",Open Philanthropy Project,Open Philanthropy Project,This research was supported by the Open Philanthropy Project.

This allows them to survive in extreme climates. Cren7 is one such chromatin protein conserved in Crenarchaeota. When Cren7 binds to model natural DNA, calf thymus DNA (CTD, 58% AT content) and polynucleotides under adverse solution conditions (high temperature, ionic strength), CD bands at 275-290 nm shift to higher wavelengths indicating structural changes in DNA. It formed a strong complex with CTD and poly(dA-dT)center dot poly(dA-dT), via a combination of electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions. A low binding enthalpy indicated that the process was driven by entropy. The interaction was independent of the nature of the anions present in the solution. On studying the variation in protein affinity with salt concentration, it was estimated that the electrostatic interaction at the interface involves 3 pairs of ions at the protein-DNA interface. The affinity and binding site size decreased on changing the pH of the solution (between pH 6 and 8), but temperature did not result in such effects. Cren7 bound to 10 bp of DNA, increasing its flexibility and thermal stability by more than 30 degrees C. Increasing the amount of Cren7 produces cooperative structural transitions in DNAs without any similar transition in the protein. These crucial binding parameters, energetics, and structural changes decipher the mystery of Cren7 mediated DNA organization in Crenarchaeota.","[Geethika, K.; Thomas, Angel Rose; Vyjayanthi, T.

Their spatial, social, economic, environmental dimensions are interlinked and must be studied from a complexity viewpoint. Yet, while complexity has successfully entered urban scholarship and practice in many fields, urban form, a key component of urban environments, is not yet studied in these terms and consequently they are not yet designed as complex. This paper argues that the discipline of urban design should be (re)defined as the understanding and design of urban environments as places of organised complexity. It can become the discipline best placed to manage a useful global overview of sustainable placemaking. It does so by tracing urban design's historical relationships and attitudes towards the evolution of the city, contrasting definitions of complexity in science, with the deterministic way in which the early urban design practitioners viewed design. It then looks at urban design's relationship with other design professions in the UK and suggests its lack of clarity and efficiency is an enduring consequence of this historic trajectory. Finally, it proposes urban design as the discipline concerned with the understanding and design of complex-adaptive urban environments and advocate its establishment as an independent profession.","[Romice, Ombretta; Porta, Sergio] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Rudlin, David] URBED, Manchester, Lancs, England; [AlWaer, Husam] Univ Dundee, Duncan Jordanstone Coll Art & Design, Architecture & Urban Planning, Dundee, Scotland; [Greaves, Mark] South Ayrshire Council, Cty Bldg, Ayr, Scotland; [Thwaites, Kevin] Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape Architecture, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Strathclyde; University of Dundee; University of Sheffield,"Romice, O (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",ombretta.r.romice@strath.ac.uk,,"Romice, Ombretta/0000-0002-5776-5632; ALWAER, HUSAM/0000-0002-5325-0797",,,,,69,1,1,0,0,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1755-0793,1755-0807,,PROC INST CIV ENG-U,Proc.

Reproduction in goats is described as seasonal. The onset and length of the breeding season is dependent on various factors such as breed, climate, physiological stage, male effect, breeding system, and photoperiod. The reproductive physiology of goats was investigated extensively, including hypothalamic and pituitary control of the ovary related to estrus behavior and cyclicity etc. Photoperiodic treatments coupled with the male effect allow hormone-free synchronization of ovulation, but the kidding rate is still less than for hormonal treatments. Different protocols have been developed to meet the needs and expectations of producers; dairy industries are subject to growing demands for year round production. Hormonal treatments for synchronization of estrus and ovulation in combination with artificial insemination (AI) or natural mating facilitate out-of-season breeding and the grouping of the kidding period. The AI with fresh or frozen semen has been increasingly adopted in the intensive production system, this is perhaps the most powerful tool that reproductive physiologists and geneticists have provided the dairy goat industry with for improving reproductive efficiency, genetic progress and genetic materials transportation. One of the most exciting developments in the reproduction of dairy animals is embryo transfer (ET), the so-called second generation reproductive biotechnology following AI. Multiple ovulation and ET (MOET) program in dairy goats combining with estrus synchronization (ES) and AI significantly increase annual genetic improvement by decreasing the generation interval. Based on the advances in reproduction technologies that have been utilized through experiments and investigation, this review will focus on the application of these technologies and how they can be used to promote the dairy goat research and industry development in the future.","[Luo, Jun; Sun, Shuang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Shaanxi Key Lab Mol Biol Agr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Vet Med, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Shenyang Agricultural University,"Luo, J (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Shaanxi Key Lab Mol Biol Agr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",luojun@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Wang, Wei/0000-0003-4727-1564",Key Research and Development Project of Shaanxi Province of China [2017ZDXM-NY-076],Key Research and Development Project of Shaanxi Province of China,This work is supported by the Key Research and Development Project of Shaanxi Province of China (2017ZDXM-NY-076).

Nanoparticles as catalysts can facilitate better selectivity, yield, and quality with the existing technologies. The feedstocks for biofuel are ample and with better processing, we might be able to reduce the fossil fuel consumption substantially. In this review, discussions on potential nanoparticles, synthetic routes, growth mechanism, and characterization methods have been carried out. The effects of the structure, phase, electronic configuration, and elemental position on the catalytic properties of nanomaterials have been summarized. The contribution of novel technologies to energy optimization and the juxtaposition of hybrid nanoparticle systems for the conversion efficiency have been discussed.

The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is resistant to four separate classes of traditional insecticides, all Bacillius thuringiensis (Bt) toxins currently registered for commercial use, crop rotation, innate plant resistance factors, and even double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting essential genes via environmental RNA interference (RNAi), which has not been sold commercially to date. Clearly, additional tools are needed as management options. In this review, we discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge about biotic factors influencing herbivore success, including host location and recognition, plant defensive traits, plant-microbe interactions, and herbivore-pathogens/predator interactions. We then translate this knowledge into potential new management tools and improved biological control.","[Paddock, Kyle J.] Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Robert, Christelle A.

Their intellectual abilities coupled with their focus and attention to detail have been recognized as desirable traits making them highly productive. However, these individuals report difficulties in employment, and there is a paucity of literature concerning the factors that attract and retain them; particularly from their viewpoint. Method: Data was collected from 76 adults; 44 with autism and 32 neuro-typical (NT; i.e., adults without autism). Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis in which the major themes of: work relationships, and environment; as well as person-organization fit, diversity climate, and bargaining emerged. Quantitative analysis then determined if these themes were more/less likely to be reported by individuals with autism. Results: Those with autism (vs NT individuals) were more likely to indicate enablers, or reasons for occupational longevity consistent with collegial understanding, the physical occupational environment, and circumstances that limited contact with others. Conclusions: The results reflect what is known clinically about Autism Spectrum Disorder, and are consistent with Conservation of Resources and Social Exchange theories. It was concluded that vocational assistance for individuals with autism requires intervention at both individual and organizational levels.","[Hayward, Susan M.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Management, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [McVilly, Keith R.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Fac Art, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Stokes, Mark A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Psychol, Fac Hlth, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Melbourne; Deakin University,"Hayward, SM (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Management, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",susan.hayward@mq.edu.au; keith.mcvilly@unimelb.edu.au; mark.stokes@deakin.edu.au,"Hayward, Susan M/U-7815-2019; Stokes, Mark A/P-8937-2017","Stokes, Mark A/0000-0001-6488-4544; Hayward, Susan M/0000-0003-0037-4275",,,,,50,29,29,0,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-9467,1878-0237,,RES AUTISM SPECT DIS,Res.

In this paper we explore the potential source of predictability in this region given by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events; in particular we analyze winter rainfall in Spain. First, we apply a simple statistical method to assess the teleconnections between rainfall records in 123 gauges over Spain and ENSO events during the last 40 years. A significant teleconnection for dry winter episodes is found associated with La Nina events, extending the results obtained in previous studies. Then, we adapt the statistical method to perform operational seasonal forecasts validation conditioned to ENSO events; in particular we consider a state-of-the-art operational model, the System2 from ECMWF. The validation method defines a forecast interval to account for the ensemble spread, and applies a simple skill measure based on the proportion of hits (observations falling into the forecast interval) compared with a random forecast. As a result, we uncover the significant skill of operational seasonal predictions for reproducing the dry winter episodes associated with La Nina events (a window of opportunity for operational seasonal forecast in midlatitudes). Finally, the results are improved using statistical downscaling methods and some sensitivity studies are conducted. The analysis presented in this paper can be extended to other regions under the influence of any seasonal predictability-driving factor.","[Sordo, C.; Frias, M. D.; Herrera, S.; Cofino, A.

Biomass is one of the most promising future options to produce electricity, given its potential contribution to climate change mitigation. Even though biomass is an old source of energy, it is not yet a well-established commodity. The use of biomass in large centralised systems requires the establishment of delivery channels to provide the desired feedstock with the necessary attributes, at the right time and place. In terms of time to deployment and cost of the solution, co-combustion/co-gasification of biomass and coal are presented as transition and short-medium term alternatives towards a carbon-neutral energy sector. Hence, there is a need to assess an effective introduction of co-combustion/co-gasification projects in the current electricity production share. The purpose of this work is to review recent steps in Process Systems Engineering towards bringing into reality individualised and ad-hoc solutions, by building a common but adjustable design platform to tailored approaches of biomass-based supply chains.

When new buildings are constructed to high performance standards, increased rates of building replacement spurred by rising property values can raise the operating efficiency of building stocks. However, it can take years before the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with new construction are offset by more efficient operations. This paper calculates the carbon dioxide emission payback period of newly constructed efficient single family homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. The average carbon dioxide emission payback period of 168 years for a typical high efficiency new home renders it unlikely that emission savings will be realized before it is replaced. A statistical model called the Teardown Index is presented, which indicates that replacing older poorly performing homes with new high efficiency homes in Vancouver will result in 1.3-2.8 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2017 and 2050. For each percent increase to the compound annual growth rate of property values, an additional 150 thousand tonnes of CO(2)e will be released between 2017-2050. The findings suggest that current policies aimed at reducing emissions through new high efficiency buildings should be reconsidered.

Romania's process of coming to terms with the past was characterized by political reluctance to explore the communist legacy. However, personal attempts of recollecting the past have a unique ability to bridge the intergenerational gap and facilitate the transmission of knowledge and memories. This paper therefore presents two examples of Romanian cinema focused on the experiences of those directly affected by the family planning politics of the communist regime. Das Experiment 770 -Geberen auf Behelf (2005), directed by Razvan Georgescu and Florin Iepan, is a documentary based on oral testimonies and documents that sketch the history of Romanian communism and the involvement of various individuals. The second source used-4 Months, 3 Weekes and 2 Days (2007) directed by Cristian Mungiu-is a film that uses a different language and technics in order to re-appropriate the past, not through direct testimony of those involved, but creating fictional characters. The target audience of these movies-as is often the case with historical cinema-is the second or third generation. Cinematography provides a simple and popular way of connecting these generations with the experiences of their predecessors.","[Adam, Elena; Mitroiu, Simona] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Res Social Human Sci, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Mitroiu, S (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Res Social Human Sci, Iasi, Romania.",monmitroiu@yahoo.com,"Mitroiu, Simona/AAO-8708-2020","Mitroiu, Simona/0000-0001-7600-3484","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0010]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI [grant number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0010].",,42,4,4,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1983,,,COGENT ARTS HUMANITE,Cogent Art Humanities,,2016,,,,,,,1182718,10.1080/23311983.2016.1182718,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311983.2016.1182718,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,DY3DJ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000384970700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Even though water stress should suppress photosynthesis and enhance tree mortality, a green-up has been often observed during the dry season. This interplay between climatic forcing and forest phenology is poorly understood and inadequately represented in most of existing dynamic global vegetation models calling for an improved description of the Amazon seasonal dynamics. Recent findings on tropical leaf phenology are incorporated in the state-of-the-art eco-hydrological model Thetys & Chloris. The new model accounts for a mechanistic light-controlled leaf development, synchronized dry-season litterfall, and an age-dependent leaf photosynthetic capacity. Simulation results from 32 sites in the Amazon basin over a 15-year period successfully mimic the seasonality of gross primary productivity; evapotranspiration (ET); as well as leaf area index, leaf age, and leaf productivity. Representation of tropical leaf phenology reproduces the observed dry-season greening, reduces simulated gross primary productivity, and does not alter ET, when compared with simulations without phenology. Tolerance to dry periods, with the exception of major drought events, is simulated by the model. Deep roots rather than leaf area index regulation mechanisms control the response to short-term droughts, but legacy effects can exacerbate multiyear water stress. Our results provide a novel mechanistic approach to model leaf phenology and flux seasonality in the tropics, reconciling the generally observed dry-season greening, ET seasonality, and decreased carbon uptake during severe droughts.","[Manoli, Gabriele; Fatichi, Simone] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ivanov, Valeriy Y.] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Manoli, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland.",manoli@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,,"Ivanov, Valeriy/0000-0002-5208-2189; Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659; Manoli, Gabriele/0000-0002-9245-2877",Swiss National Science Foundation (r4d-Ecosystems) [152019]; U.S. National Science Foundation [NSF-EAR-1344703]; DOE OBER grant [DE-SC0011078],Swiss National Science Foundation (r4d-Ecosystems)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE OBER grant(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (r4d-Ecosystems, n. 152019).

When carefully manipulated, C sequestration by the soil could balance and mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere char are believed to contribute global warming. The pressing need for assessing the soil's C stocks at local, regional, and global scales, now in the forefront of much research, is considerably hindered by the problems besetting dry-combustion chemical analyses, even with state-of-the-art procedures. To overcome these issues, we developed a new method based on gamma-ray spectroscopy induced by inelastic neutron scattering (INS). The INS method is all in situ, nondestructive, multielemental technique that can be used in stationary or continous-scanning modes of operation. The results from data acquired from all investigated soil mass of a few hundred kilograms to all approximate depth of 30 cm are reported immediately Our initial experiments have demonstrated the feasibility Of Our proposed approach; we obtained a linear response with C concentration and a detection limit between 0.5 and 1% C by weight.","[Wielopolski, Lucian; Mitra, Sudeep] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm Sci Dep, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Hendrey, George] Queens Coll, Sch Earth & Environ Sci, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Prior, Stephen A.; Rogers, Hugo H.; Torbert, H.

The composite PCM fabricated on paraffin/hydrophobic expanded perlite (EPO) showed an apparent density and 28-day compressive strength of 1244.2 kg/m(3) and 17.9 MPa respectively, when integrated into ordinary cementitious composite at 80% volume replacement of fine aggregate. The thermal performance of PCM integrated cementitious composites was experimentally assessed using a prototype test cell made with PCM integrated cement boards (PCMCB) subjected to realistic temperature cycles. The comparison study considers two reference prototypes made with gypsum plasterboards (GPB) and ordinary cement boards (OCB). It was found that the prototype incorporated with PCMCB reduced the peak indoor temperature by up to 2.8 degrees C and 4.43 degrees C during typical summer days and summer design days respectively, compared to the GPB test cell. Numerical simulations conducted on a multi-storey office building for the application of PCMCB as interior surface plastering mortars showed that the PCMCB could significantly reduce the peak indoor temperature and diurnal temperature fluctuations. Indeed, the interior surface application of PCM has limited cold storage at night, leading to reduced latent heat storage. However, cold storage of PCM could be improved by introducing night ventilation. The combined application of PCMCB and night ventilation reduced the peak indoor operative temperature by up to 3.4 degrees C, as opposed to 2.5 degrees C for building refurbishment with PCMCB only.

However, in conventional virtual environments, the visual connection with a green wall is the only way that this natural element could benefit humans. Unfortunately, the impact of such visual connection on human thermal perception is still not well understood. Thus, we conducted an experimental study with 40 participants comparing the thermal state of two virtual sessions: biophilic (a room with a green wall) and non-biophilic (the same room without a green wall). Both sessions were conducted in a climate chamber under a slightly warm condition (28.89 degrees C and 50% relative humidity). Participants' thermal state, skin temperature, and heart rate data were collected. According to the results, participants' thermal comfort and hand skin temperature were significantly different between the two sessions, and their mean skin temperature was statistically increased over time. The study suggests that before the extent to which the impact of visual stimuli (e.g., green walls) on thermal perception is fully understood, researchers may need to control visual and thermal stimuli separately when using them in immersive virtual environments. Furthermore, the virtual exposure time should be an important consideration when designing experimental procedures.","[Sedghikhanshir, Alireza; Zhu, Yimin] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Chen, Yan] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Plant Environm & Soil Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Harmon, Brendan] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Art Design, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Zhu, YM (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",asedgh1@lsu.edu; yiminzhu@lsu.edu; YAChen@agcenter.lsu.edu; baharmon@lsu.edu,"; Harmon, Brendan/J-9970-2014","Sedghikhanshir, Alireza/0000-0002-7735-796X; Zhu, Yimin/0000-0002-3871-4733; Harmon, Brendan/0000-0002-6218-9318",National Science Foundation [1805914],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),FundingThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1805914).,,56,1,1,8,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,1840,10.3390/su14031840,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031840,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YY1NA,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000754559300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lopez and Harry Miskimin on one hand and Carlo M. Cipolla on the other. More than half a century later, this topic can be reconsidered in the light of much wider information on the late medieval/early modern Italian economy. Using data on population, urbanization, prices, wages, and GDP, this article outlines the macroeconomic trends in central and northern Italy in the age of the Renaissance (1350-1550). The frequent plagues during the early Renaissancethat is, between 1348 and 1450decimated the population, probably causing more deaths than in other European countries. Hence resources per worker increased and labour productivity, incomes, and standards of living improved remarkably. A favourable economic environment thus seems to have been a pre-condition for the Renaissance in culture, art, and politics and the spread of new kinds of consumer demand. From the middle of the fifteenth century, living standards gradually worsened and eventually reached the low levels that had prevailed prior to the Renaissance.","[Malanima, Paolo] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy",Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro,"Malanima, P (corresponding author), Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.",mala1950@hotmail.it,,,,,,,166,8,8,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Nevertheless, the existing approaches trained by monocular sequences are still prone to fail in dynamic environments. In this work, we mitigate the negative influence of dynamic environments on the joint estimation of depth and visual odometry (VO) through hybrid masks. Since both the VO estimation and view reconstruction process in the joint estimation framework is vulnerable to dynamic environments, we propose the cover mask and the filter mask to alleviate the adverse effects, respectively. As the depth and VO estimation are tightly coupled during training, the improved VO estimation promotes depth estimation as well. Besides, a depth-pose consistency loss is proposed to overcome the scale inconsistency between different training samples of monocular sequences. Experimental results show that both our depth prediction and globally consistent VO estimation are state of the art when evaluated on the KITTI benchmark. We evaluate our depth prediction model on the Make3D dataset to prove the transferability of our method as well.","[Sun, Qiyu; Tang, Yang; Zhang, Chongzhen; Zhao, Chaoqiang; Qian, Feng] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Smart Mfg Energy Chem Proc, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Kurths, Jurgen] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Kurths, Jurgen] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Kurths, Jurgen] Lobachevsky Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia",East China University of Science & Technology; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Tang, Y (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Smart Mfg Energy Chem Proc, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",yangtang@ecust.edu.cn; juergen.kurths@pik-potsdam.de,,"Zhao, Chaoqiang/0000-0002-3651-2177; Sun, Qiyu/0000-0002-1401-8768","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61988101]; International (Regional) Cooperation and Exchange Project [61720106008]; National Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars [61725301, 61925305]; Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader [20XD1401300]; Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (the 111 Project) [B17017]; Russian Ministry of Science and Education [075-15-2020-808]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International (Regional) Cooperation and Exchange Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader; Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (the 111 Project)(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); Russian Ministry of Science and Education(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Basic Science Center Program) under Grant 61988101, in part by the International (Regional) Cooperation and Exchange Project under Grant 61720106008, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars under Grant 61725301 and Grant 61925305, in part by the Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader under Grant 20XD1401300, in part by the Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (the 111 Project) under Grant B17017, and in part by the Russian Ministry of Science and Education Agreement under Grant 075-15-2020-808.",,55,4,4,8,16,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

In order to validate the same, this study has applied the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) technique, so as to identify the asymmetric association among the Film and Drama Industry, green innovation, and sustainable environment. The quarterly time-series data of the variables is assessed from January 2000 to December 2019. The outcomes of the study have revealed that the appreciation in the Film and Drama stock prices tends to increase the CO2 emissions. Whereas, the depreciation of the Film and Drama stock prices improves the efforts towards a sustainable environment. On the other hand, the increase in green innovation tends to have an adverse impact on environmental degradation, while the decline in green innovation tends to increase the carbon emissions. In order to handle the grievous problem of environmental degradation, caused by the Film and Drama industry of China, this study suggests that adopting green practices in Film and Drama making, such as green filming, the use of hybrid vehicles, LED lights, and solar generator supplies, and perhaps Computer-Generated Imagery sets will ultimately contribute towards the improvement of the quality of the environment.","[Hu, Jiachong; Xu, Jin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Art, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Tong, Lei] Wuhan Business Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Razi, Ummara] Iqra Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Wuhan Business University; Iqra University,"Tong, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Business Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",tonglei20200123@163.com,"Razi, Ummara/AFW-4438-2022","Razi, Ummara/0000-0002-5981-5736",Jiangxi Social Science Planning Fund Program [21YS49],Jiangxi Social Science Planning Fund Program,This study was supported by Jiangxi Social Science Planning Fund Program (no. 21YS49).,,73,9,9,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Ensemble mean rainfall patterns initialized on 5 September (roughly 4+ day lead time) did not forecast the event's persistent nature; conversely, forecasts initialized on 9 September captured the rainfall patterns reasonably well, although with incorrect rainfall values. Accumulated rainfall forecasts improved when the region considered increased from a 0.5 degrees area centered over Boulder to the entire state of Colorado.

While our understanding of the effects of summer drought on ecosystem carbon and water vapour fluxes has recently advanced, the effects of spring drought remain unclear. In Switzerland, spring 2011 (March-May) was the warmest and among the driest since the beginning of meteorological measurements. This study synthesizes Swiss FluxNet data from three grassland and two forest ecosystems to investigate the effects of this spring drought. Across all sites, spring phenological development was 11 days earlier in 2011 compared to the mean of 2000-2011. Soil moisture related reductions of gross primary productivity (GPP) were found at the lowland grassland sites, where productivity did not recover following grass cuts. In contrast, spring GPP was enhanced at the montane grassland and both forests (mixed deciduous and evergreen). Evapotranspiration (ET) was reduced in forests, which also substantially increased their water-use efficiency (WUE) during spring drought, but not in grasslands. These contrasting responses to spring drought of grasslands compared to forests reflect different adaptive strategies between vegetation types, highly relevant to biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system.","[Wolf, Sebastian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wolf, Sebastian; Eugster, Werner; Haeni, Matthias; Zielis, Sebastian; Stieger, Jacqueline; Imer, Dennis; Merbold, Lutz; Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ammann, Christof] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hiller, Rebecca] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol EMPA, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Wolf, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sewolf@berkeley.edu,"Haeni, Matthias/A-3446-2013; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Wolf, Sebastian/B-4580-2010; Merbold, Lutz/K-6103-2012; Haeni, Matthias/N-3786-2019","Haeni, Matthias/0000-0003-3977-2166; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Wolf, Sebastian/0000-0001-7717-6993; Merbold, Lutz/0000-0003-4974-170X; Haeni, Matthias/0000-0003-3977-2166; Ammann, Christof/0000-0002-0783-5444",,,,,49,85,87,4,131,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

A state-of-the-art machine learning technique was used in conjunction with a high frequency data set to calibrate and test predictive benthic lights models for sites dominated by the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Datasets of incident light flux, waters depth, wind speed, wind direction and benthic light flux were collected at two sites, Deception Bay and Eastern Banks, in Moreton Bay, Queensland, that are affected by the toxic marine cyanobacteria L majuscula. Random forest models were calibrated and validated using the dataset. The models predict benthic photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) based on wind speed, wind direction, water depth and incident light. The two benthic light models produced have high predictive capacity with R-2 values of the order 0.8 for both calibration and validation. Wind speed and/or direction influenced the prediction of benthic PAR in the model at each site, suggesting that wind-driven sediment resuspension is an important process in controlling water clarity and hence benthic PAR at both sites; a result consistent with many previous examples from coastal regions. In particular, wind direction had a marked affect on benthic PAR at the partially sheltered Deception Bay site compared to the fully exposed Eastern Banks site. Consistent with other Harmful Algae Bloom (HAB) species, eutrophication has been identified as a common link between sites affected by L majuscula blooms. However, we show here that at least one major bloom of L majuscula in Deception Bay coincided with light conditions for optimal L majuscula photosynthesis, supporting the hypothesis that toxic blooms are a result of a confluence of causes rather than just one. We argue that at eutrophied sites, variation in parameters such as temperature and light rather than nutrients are more likely to cause blooms. This study demonstrates that collection of high frequency variables related to aquatic light flux combined with state of the art machine learning techniques, such as the random forest algorithm, can produce highly accurate models of light flux at shallow coastal sites. These models provide management with the beginnings of an early warning system and scientists with a practical tool for catching the bloom at the incipient stage rather than after the bloom has already developed.

It is the transition zone of the humid East Asia monsoon region and the arid central Asia area, the land-atmosphere interactions are strong there. In this research, the effects of vegetation change on land-atmosphere coupling strength and related land surface hydrological processes in northwest China were examined, and we also tried to confirm the most efficient areas of vegetation increasing for desertification mitigation in northwest China. Using a state-of-the-art Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3) developed by National Center for Atmospheric Research, the effects of vegetation change in northwest China were studied by three numerical experiments: with realistic vegetation characteristics varying monthly (CTL run), without vegetation (NOVEG run), and with increased vegetation (VEG run). Firstly, the influences of vegetation change in northwest China on local hydrological variables (precipitation, surface water surplus, surface runoff, surface soil moisture and so on) were examined. Then, the effects of vegetation change on local land-atmosphere coupling strength were analyzed, land-atmosphere coupling strength is new standard to evaluate the degree of local land-atmosphere interaction, it is based on the ratio of the covariance between annualy precipitation and evaporation anomalies (from their climatological means) over the variance of precipitation anomalies. The coupling strength is easy to compute from observations and standard model output and has a relatively clear physical meaning, and the stronger the local land-atmosphere interaction is, the higher the land-atmosphere coupling strength will be. At last, an Evapotranspiration-Moisture flux divergence Index was calculated to evaluate the influences of vegetation change on evapotranspiration and moisture transport in the atmosphere. This index could reflect the effects of vegetation change on local land-atmosphere interactions and large scale atmosphere circulations to a certain degree, and it also could be used as an indicator of evaluating the effects of artificial ecological restoration programs. The land-atmosphere coupling strength increased from southeast to northwest in this area. Desertification led to reduced precipitation and evapotranspiration in most area of northwest China. In the southeastern area, infiltration and soil moisture were decreased for about 40 similar to 80 mm and 5 similar to 20 mm(3) . mm(-3) respectively, yet surface runoff increased for about 10 similar to 40 mm. Land-atmosphere coupling strength also increased. These might cause happening of soil erosion, this might go against for vegetation recovery in this area. An increased precipitation and evapotranspiration were found in the inland area of northwest China by vegetation increasing, yet surface water surplus was reduced slightly, mainly because evapotranspiration was increased more compare with precipitation. In the southern part of Xinjiang and western part of Inner Mongolia which are the edge of desert, increased infiltration and soil moisture increased for about 5 similar to 20 mm and 5 similar to 20 mm(3) . mm(-3) respectively, the coupling strength reduced. The Evapotranspiration-Moisture flux was also high in this region, and it seemed mainly because the local land-atmosphere interaction was altered by vegetation change. Vegetation has a significant influence on land surface hydrological processes in northwest China, the existence of vegetation could accelerate the hydrological cycle, reduce the variability of evapotranspiration and land-atmosphere coupling. Given limited financial and human resources, concentrated shrub-grass planting and preventing overgrazing in this particular region where the coupling strength could be substantially reduced by vegetation, might be an effective strategy to mitigate serious desertification in Northwest China. In the further research, we should consider the differences between the model land surface vegetation cover and the real situation, the feedback of ocean variability to vegetation change. ensemble simulations are necessary to make this research robust.","[Zhao Jing-Chuan; Liu Shu-Hua] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Zhao, JC (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",stepdancezjc@gmail.com; lshuhua@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,59,4,13,4,83,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0001-5733,,,CHINESE J GEOPHYS-CH,Chinese J.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has become one of the leading analytical approaches for the characterization of OAs and has gained importance in atmospheric chemistry sciences. This review highlights both solid-state and one-and two-dimensional solution-state NMR spectroscopy as unmatched tools for nontarget structural elucidation of atmospheric OAs.

The term cosmeceuticals was coined in 1962 as a fusion of cosmetic and pharmaceutical to cover a new class of products able to achieve aesthetic and drug-like benefits. They not only improve the skin's appearance, but also treat different dermatological conditions, through a physiological activity, shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. This new category of cosmetics should contain no recognized drugs, but nonetheless have medicinal value. Consumers, in fact, are looking for products able to regenerate the skin and maintain not only a youthful appearance together with well-ness and well-being, but preserving the environment also. Consequently, they are searching for cosmetics and food made with high-quality natural ingredients, packaged with biodegradable materials and realized by sustainable technologies, possibly at zero waste. Consumers, in fact, are afraid of the pollution and plastics invading lands and oceans, causing many frequent disasters on our planet. New and smart tissues and films, made by polysaccharides and natural active ingredients, are proposed as innovative cosmeceuticals. These non-woven tissues, embedded by micro/nano complexes of chitin and lignin encapsulating different active ingredients, could represent a new category of vehicles that are characterized for their high effectiveness and safeness. Moreover, they do not induce allergic nor sensitizing phenomena, being biodegradable; skin- and environmentally friendly; and free of preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, fragrances and any kind of chemicals. Last but not least, polysaccharides, chitin and lignin may be obtained from industrial and agro-forestry waste, safeguarding the natural raw materials for the future generations.","[Morganti, Pierfrancesco] Acad Hist Healthcare Art, I-00186 Rome, Italy; [Morganti, Pierfrancesco] China Med Univ, Dept Dermatol, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China; [Morganti, Gianluca; Gagliardini, Alessandro] ISCD NanoSci Ctr, I-00165 Rome, Italy; [Gagliardini, Alessandro] R&D Texol, I-65020 Pescara, Italy; [Lohani, Alka] IFTM Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Moradabad 244001, India",China Medical University,"Morganti, P (corresponding author), Acad Hist Healthcare Art, I-00186 Rome, Italy.;Morganti, P (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Dept Dermatol, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China.",pierfrancesco.morganti@iscd.it; lucamorgan@libero.it; alessandro.gagliardini@textol.it; alkalohamo06@gmail.com,"Lohani, Alka/AAR-6418-2021","Lohani, Alka/0000-0003-2580-7524",,,,,89,3,3,11,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9284,,COSMETICS-BASEL,Cosmetics,SEP,2021,3,,,,,,65,10.3390/cosmetics8030065,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics8030065,,,19,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Dermatology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Dermatology,UZ5SX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000702266500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, it is often important to systematically monitor the spread of species over a broad region. Remote sensing has been an important tool for large-scale ecological studies in the past three decades, but it was not commonly used to study alien invasive plants until the mid 1990s. We synthesize previous research efforts on remote sensing of invasive plants from spatial, temporal and spectral perspectives.

The difference in weather change starts as the first step to change the energy consumption pattern in the domestic, commercial and industrial sector. To find the change in climate and their impact on energy usage, this study examines the medium-term (MT) and long-term (LT) energy prediction for utilities, independent power producers and industrial customers to estimate the energy usage requirement of large-scale city-wide by means of using the nonlinear autoregressive model (NARM), linear model using stepwise regression (LMSR) and random forest (least square boosting) (LSBoost) approaches, based on actual environmental as well as energy consumption data. The irregular load pattern recognition to remove the abnormal trend in actual energy usage is performed by applying the outlier detection and clustering analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) of LSBoost model is 5.019%, 3.159%, 3.292% and 3.184% in summer, autumn, winter and spring season respectively. The machine learning (ML) techniques are validated and compared based on performance and accuracy with the previously existing Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. The optimal modeling of city-wide energy demand prediction using ML-based models are guaranteed the accurate operation and design of distributed energy systems.","[Ahmad, Tanveer; Chen, Huanxin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Chen, HX (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",ahmad_tanveer@hust.edu.cn; chenhuanxin@tsinghua.org.cn,"Ahmad, Tanveer/AAD-7228-2020","Ahmad, Tanveer/0000-0001-7307-7947","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51876070, 51576074]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors have gratefully acknowledged the assistance acquired by 'National Natural Science Foundation of China' under the Grant number and 51876070 & 51576074).,,49,66,67,6,55,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

In order to find the global minimum indeed, an improved differential evolution (DE) is proposed for digital IIR filter design in this paper. The suggested algorithm is a kind of DE variants with a controllable probabilistic (CPDE) population size. It considers the convergence speed and the computational cost simultaneously by nonperiodic partial increasing or declining individuals according to fitness diversities. In addition, we discuss as well some important aspects for IIR filter design, such as the cost function value, the influence of (noise) perturbations, the convergence rate and successful percentage, the parameter measurement, etc. As to the simulation result, it shows that the presented algorithm is viable and comparable. Compared with six existing State-of-the-Art algorithms-based digital IIR filter design methods obtained by numerical experiments, CPDE is relatively more promising and competitive.","[Zhu, Wu; Fang, Jian-an; Tang, Yang; Zhang, Wenbing] Donghua Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yang] Harbin Inst Technol, Res Inst Intelligent Control & Syst, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yang] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Tang, Yang] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Zhang, Wenbing; Du, Wei] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Donghua University; Harbin Institute of Technology; Humboldt University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Zhu, W (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",tangtany@gmail.com,,,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2011M501040],Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This paper was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2011M501040).

Currently, the high investment cost of VIPs is hindering the technology penetrating the building market. However, their high thermal performance coupled with reduced thicknesses can lead to economic benefits associated with space savings, significantly changing the economic standing of VIPs. This study presents a comprehensive life cycle cost (LCC) analysis of the application of VIPs in external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) in office building facades performed from the landlord perspective. The proposed LCC methodology, based on the EU cost-optimal regulation, allows for comparing the cost-effectiveness of VIPs with conventional insulation materials, taking full account of the additional rental income due to space savings. Energy calculations are performed based on transient heat transfer. The study takes into account varying parameters, such as location, cost of materials, insulation thickness, and rental prices, among others. The results demonstrate that VIPs can be economically viable, in particular in cities where office full-leasing rental prices are high. The range of VIP and rental prices that make their use in buildings cost-effective are identified. For example, it is shown that for rental costs higher than 350 (SIC)/(m(2).y) VIP can be cost-effective for a current market price of 3000 (SIC)/m(3), when local climate demands for thermal transmittance bellow 0.19 W/(m(2).K). This analysis is useful for VIP manufacturers, project owners and landlords that may be looking for competitive insulation products.","[Simoes, Nuno; Goncalves, Marcio; Serra, Catarina] Univ Coimbra, ADAI, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Sci & Technol, Rua Luis Reis Santos Polo II, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Simoes, Nuno; Goncalves, Marcio; Serra, Catarina] Itecons Inst Res & Technol Dev Construct Energy E, Rua Pedro Hispano S-N, P-3030289 Coimbra, Portugal; [Resalati, Shahaboddin] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford, England",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Oxford Brookes University,"Simoes, N (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, ADAI, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Sci & Technol, Rua Luis Reis Santos Polo II, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal.",nasimoes@dec.uc.pt; marcio.goncalves@itecons.uc.pt; cserra@itecons.uc.pt; sresalati@brookes.ac.uk,"Resalati, Shahab/GLV-4292-2022; Simoes, Nuno/G-8735-2019","Resalati, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-3360-7648; Simoes, Nuno/0000-0003-3418-0030; Serra, Catarina/0000-0001-5268-764X; Goncalves, Marcio/0000-0002-3538-7749",European Union [723441]; FEDER [CENTRO-01-0247-FEDER-033390]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [PD/BD/135194/2017]; Centro 2020,European Union(European Commission); FEDER(European Commission); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); Centro 2020,"This work has been developed under the INNOVIP project, which has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement N degrees 723441 and under the On Thermal HP project (CENTRO-01-0247-FEDER-033390) co-financed by FEDER and Centro 2020.

Britain's fifth Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, had selected William Dawes, a promising young Marine with a propensity for astronomical observations, as his protege. Maskelyne convinced the British Board of Longitude to supply Dawes with a suite of state-of-the-art instruments and allow the young Marine to establish an observatory in the new settlement. The Astronomer Royal may have had a dual motivation, one driven by strategic national interests combined with a personal investment linked to the suggested re-appearance of a comet in the southern sky. With the unexpected assistance of the French Laperouse expedition, between 1788 and 1791 Dawes established not one but two observatories within a kilometre of Sydney's present-day city centre. Motivated by persisting confusion in the literature, we explore the historical record to narrow down the precise location of Dawes' observatories. We conclude that the memorial plaque attached to Sydney Harbour Bridge indicates an incorrect location. Overwhelming evidence in the form of contemporary maps, charts and pictorial representations implies that Dawes' observatory was located on the northeastern tip of the promontory presently known as The Rocks (formerly Dawes' Point), with any remains having vanished during the construction of the Harbour Bridge in the 1920s and 1930s.","[de Grijs, Richard] Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Balaclava Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Jacob, Andrew P.] Sydney Observ, Museum Appl Arts & Sci, 1003 Upper Ft St,Millers Point, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",Macquarie University,"de Grijs, R (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Balaclava Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",richard.de-grijs@mq.edu.au; Andrew.Jacob@maas.museum,,"de Grijs, Richard/0000-0002-7203-5996",,,,,92,1,1,0,0,NATL ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH INST THAILAND,CHIANGMAI,"SIRIPANICH BLDG, 191 HUAY KAEW RD, CHIANGMAI, 50200, THAILAND",1440-2807,,,J ASTRON HIST HERIT,J.

This study provides a state-of-the-art scientific overview of bottom-up anthropogenic emissions data from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) in the European Union (EU28(1)). The data integrate recent AFOLU emission inventories with ecosystem data and land carbon models and summarize GHG emissions and removals over the period 1990-2016. This compilation of bottom-up estimates of the AFOLU GHG emissions of European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs), with those of land carbon models and observation-based estimates of large-scale GHG fluxes, aims at improving the overall estimates of the GHG balance in Europe with respect to land GHG emissions and removals. Whenever available, we present uncertainties, its propagation and role in the comparison of different estimates. While NGHGI data for the EU28 provide consistent quantification of uncertainty following the established IPCC Guidelines, uncertainty in the estimates produced with other methods needs to account for both within model uncertainty and the spread from different model results. The largest inconsistencies between EU28 estimates are mainly due to different sources of data related to human activity, referred to here as activity data (AD) and methodologies (tiers) used for calculating emissions and removals from AFOLU sectors.

These gravity fields contain both spatially correlated (systematic) and random noise and hence spatial averaging needs to be implemented. Before the fields may be interpreted, optimum averaging radii need to be determined through comparison with independent data. We compare time-series of vertical solid earth deformations computed from 22 approximately monthly GRACE gravity fields (covering 2002.3 until 2004.6) with vertical displacements measured using a global GPS network of 63 sites, about half of which are located on small islands. The GPS data were processed using a Precise Point Positioning approach using fiducial free orbits and attempting to minimize propagated systematic errors. The optimum mean correlations were obtained at 500 km averaging radii for continental sites (R= 0.55), > =2000 for island sites (R = 0.3). Subtracting the GRACE displacement time-series from the GPS ones revealed a mean variance reduction of similar to 14 per cent. To supplement the GPS data at the island sites, we also computed displacements based on TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) sea surface height data between 2002.3 and 2004.0 corrected for steric effects. Correlations reached a maximum at 2000 km with a correlation of 0.38, increasing to 0.47 after the removal of six outlying sites. Overall, we conclude that optimum averaging radii are similar to 500 km for continental sites and > =2000 km over the oceans, but that the measurement precision of GPS and T/P may be inflating these values.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"King, M (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Cassie Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",m.a.king@ncl.ac.uk,"King, Matt/B-4622-2008; Clarke, Peter John/B-1783-2008","King, Matt/0000-0001-5611-9498; Clarke, Peter John/0000-0003-1276-8300",,,,,34,40,42,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0956-540X,1365-246X,,GEOPHYS J INT,Geophys.

The relationship between peat soil burn depth and an active normalized burn ratio (ANBR) is also examined beneath partially and fully burned forest and understory canopies using state-of-the-art active reflectance from a multispectral lidar compared with normalized burn ratio (NBR) derived from Landsat 7 ETM+. We find significant correspondence between depth of burn, lidar-derived ANBR, and difference NBR (dNBR) from Landsat. However, low-resolution optical imagery excludes peatland burn losses in transition zones, which are highly sensitive to peat loss via combustion.

Minimising these impacts requires further development of active cooling technologies, starting with an examination of existing technologies and their characteristics. This paper provides an overview of active cooling technologies using a patent landscape based on patent application data over the past 20 years. In developing the patent landscape, we searched the Derwent Innovation patent database, which contains more than 90 million patent documents, using technology specific keywords and patent classification codes. A careful assessment of the resulting patent dataset shows a range of important trends about the evolution of cooling in the last two decades. Specifically, we discuss annual cooling technology patent application trends, countries of application, and patent assignees. The results show that patenting activity in the field of active cooling has increased significantly since 2010, mainly driven by the rapid patenting trend in China. Patents of the incumbent technology have been dominated by established manufacturers from Japan and the United States. Not-in-kind cooling technologies with a high number of patent applications include thermoelectric, magneto caloric, evaporative, pulse-tube, absorption, and adsorption cooling. The results from examining this global patent help in understanding and shaping the global development of active cooling technology by providing new information on the major supplier countries, the key manufacturers, and maturity levels of alternative cooling technologies.

The heat gain is spatially variable and does not appear to have been persistent for the last 200 years at all locations, but overall continental areas have absorbed energy in the last 50 years. Results indicate a mean surface heat flux of 20.6 mWm(-2) over the last 200 years. The total heat absorbed by the ground is 4.8 x 10(21)J and 13.3 x 10(21)J for the last 50 and 200 years respectively.

However, identification of species and habitats most in need of conservation is challenging as comprehensive information on species-specific threats and population statuses is lacking. Through application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List methodology - the global accepted standard for classifying extinction risk at the species level - we evaluated the regional conservation status of 471 species of marine bony fishes in the Gulf. The best estimate of the proportion of regionally threatened marine bony fishes, based on all species for which sufficient data were available for assessment, is 8.2%; this is at least twice the proportion of other regions where such assessments have been undertaken. Primary threats include those related to fisheries and harvesting and those related to coastal development and loss of habitat, impacting 47% and 32% of marine bony fishes, respectively. Such threats are particularly acute in nearshore areas where spatial analyses indicated high species richness. The future of Gulf ecosystems, and the survival of the marine bony fishes, will depend on concerted, collaborative efforts among all Gulf States to develop efficient and effective local and regional marine conservation practices and policies, particularly for species assessed as regionally threatened.","[Buchanan, Jack R.; Ralph, Gina M.; Carpenter, Kent E.] Old Dominion Univ, Biol Sci, IUCN Global Marine Species Assessment, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Krupp, Friedhelm] Senckenberg Res Inst, Frankfurt, Germany; [Krupp, Friedhelm] Museum Nat, Frankfurt, Germany; [Harwell, Heather] Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Organismal & Environm Biol, Newport News, VA 23606 USA; [Abdallan, Mohamed] Minist Municipal & Environm, Doha, Qatar; [Abdulqader, Ebrahim] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Ctr Environm & Water, Res Inst, Dhahran 31261, Eastern Provinc, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Husaini, Mohsen; Bishop, James M.] Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Ecosyst Based Management Marine Resources Program, Salmiya, Kuwait; [Burt, John A.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Choath, John H.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Collette, Bruce B.; Munroe, Thomas] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Systemat Lab, Washington, DC USA; [Feary, David A.] MRAG Ltd, London W1J 5PN, England; [Hartmann, Stanley A.] Environm Agcy Abu Dhabi, Fisheries Invest & Monitoring, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Iwatsuki, Yukio] Univ Miyazaki, Dept Marine Biol & Environm Sci, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Kaymaram, Farhad] Agr Res Educ & Extens Org, Iranian Fisheries Sci Res Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Larson, Helen K.; Russell, Barry] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia; [Matsuura, Keiichi] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan; [Motomura, Hiroyuki] Kagoshima Univ Museum, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Smith-Vaniz, William] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Williams, Jeffrey] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Museum Support Ctr, Suitland, MD USA; [Buchanan, Jack R.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Dept Fisheries Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",Old Dominion University; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research; James Cook University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miyazaki; National Museum of Nature and Science; Kagoshima University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science,"Carpenter, KE (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Biol Sci, IUCN Global Marine Species Assessment, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",jrbochanan@vims.edu; gralph@odu.edu; f.krupp@senckenberg.de; heather.harwell@enu.edu; mohamad.abdallah@gmail.com; eabdulqader@kfupm.edu.sa; mhusaini466@gmail.com; bishopjmarcus@gmail.com; john.butt@nyu.edu; john.choat@jcu.edu; collettb@si.edu; d.feary@mrag.co.uk; shartmann@ead.ac; yuk@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp; farhadkaymaram@gmail.com; helen.larson@magnt.net.au; matsuura@kahaku.go.jp; motomura@kaum.kagoshima-u.n.jp; munroet@si.edu; barry.russell@magnt.net.au; smithvaniz@gmail.com; williamsjt@si.edu; kcarpent@odu.edu,"Collette, Bruce B./AAA-9532-2019; Fazli, Ghazal/AAE-8320-2022","Burt, John/0000-0001-6087-6424",NPRP award from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation) [NPRP5-309-1-061],NPRP award from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation),"This publication was made possible by a NPRP award [NPRP5-309-1-061] from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation).

Pursuing this goal, this study proposes a conceptual framework for modeling the HEI organizational environment; a set of strategic sustainability actions to drive movements toward sustainability; and an assessment scheme incorporating four indices to measure the degree of commitment, parity, difficulty and institutional performance throughout the implementation process of the actions proposed. Design/methodology/approach - Development of the work included a literature review focused on internationally established concepts, recommendations and guidelines aimed at driving HEIs to fully acknowledge the principles of sustainable development, a study of the state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks for sustainability and an analysis of scientific studies on sustainability in HEIs and society. Findings - The overall approach proposed proved to be robust, as it synthesizes global concepts, recommendations and guidelines endorsed by key international organizations and researchers thoroughly discussed in worldwide publications related to sustainability. Moreover, the conceptual framework for modeling the HEI organizational environment, the strategic sustainability actions formulated and the assessment scheme are confirmed to be a practical and realistic strategy for assisting HEIs to effectively achieve their sustainability targets and goals. Practical implications - Facilitation of institutional performance assessment using the hands-on tool proposed to drive HEIs toward sustainability.

This review also covers the future development of flat plate PV/T solar collector on building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) applications. Different designs feature and performance of flat plate PV/T solar collectors have been compared and discussed. Future research and development (R&D) works have been elaborated. The tube and sheet design is the simplest and easiest to be manufactured, even though, the efficiency is 2% lower compared to other types of collectors such as, channel, free flow and two-absorber. It is clear from the review that for both air and water based PV/T solar collectors, the important key factors that influenced the efficiency of the system are the area where the collector covered, the number of passes and the gap between the absorber collector and solar cells. From the literature review, it is obvious that the flat plate PV/T solar collector is an alternative promising system for low-energy applications in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Other possible areas for the future works of BIPVT are also mentioned. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This work in the upper Moulouya catchment has allowed us to define the landform sequence. Conglomerate platforms previously considered to be fluvial terraces, are interpreted here as exhumed bedrock layers of the Plio-Pleistocene stacked series. The El Hai river incision consists of a first phase, represented only by the exhumation of Gara Soultana butte, and a second phase when five strath terraces developed from +20-22 m to the thalweg, formed since the Middle Pleistocene. Holocene terraces could be associated with brief aggradation phases in the lower Moulouya catchment due to rapid climate changes.

A Bernoulli distribution-based Naive Bayes classifier was the poorest model (AUC=0.50). The Gaussian NB was also the most robust ML model with the slightest variation of Kappa score on training (0.58) and test data (0.64). The results suggest that nonlinear or ensemble classifiers could more accurately understand the complex relationships of socio-environmental data and help develop accurate and robust prediction models of sustainable arsenic mitigation.

This calls for new management strategies and new models for ecological risk assessment that incorporate local density dependence and multiple environmental stressors. The harbor seal metapopulation in Swedish and Danish waters has increased from about 2500 to 25,000 over the past 40 yr. Trend analysis based on aerial survey data and somatic growth curves indicates that the population is close to carrying capacity. We performed a population viability analysis based on realistic life history parameters and investigated a range of potential scenarios caused by future stressors. If the population is able to resume its high intrinsic rate of increase at about 11% annually, when pushed down below carrying capacity, it can also sustain additional mortality such as modest hunting and infrequent epizootics. However, if xenobiotics will cause even a slight reduction in average fecundity, the population becomes significantly more vulnerable. In the absence of epizootics, and given full reproductive capacity, hunting of a few hundred animals annually is not harmful to the long-term persistence of the population. Nevertheless, a slight decrease in growth potential, for example, caused by exposure to endocrine disruptors, makes even limited hunting risky. Our study shows how an apparently stable and abundant marine mammal population can be close to a point of rapid population decline. Thus, careful monitoring of population size, growth rate, health, and exposure to xenobiotics as well as recording of the age and sex structure of the hunt is required to avoid repeating the history of overexploitation and another population collapse.","[Silva, Willian T.

These commitments offer much promise for sustainable commodity production, but are undermined by a lack of transparency about their coverage and impacts. Here, using state-of-the-art supply chain data, we introduce an approach to evaluate the impact of ZDCs, linking traders and international markets to commodity-associated deforestation in the sub-national jurisdictions from which they source. We focus on the Brazilian soy sector, where we find that ZDC coverage is increasing, but under-represents the Cerrado biome where most soy-associated deforestation currently takes place. Though soy-associated deforestation declined in the Amazon after the introduction of the Soy Moratorium, we observe no change in the exposure of companies or countries adopting ZDCs to soy-associated deforestation in the Cerrado. We further assess the formulation and implementation of these ZDCs and identify several systematic weaknesses that must be addressed to increase the likelihood that they achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation in future. As the 2020 deadline for several of these commitments approaches, our approach can provide independent monitoring of progress toward the goal of ending commodity-associated deforestation.","[zu Ermgassen, Erasmus K.

It can be conceptualized as several strategies, which may be implemented in an iterative fashion and in different orders. The key challenges have been the time-, cost- and labor-intensive processes of strain development owing to the difficulties in understanding complex interactions among the metabolic, gene regulatory and signaling networks at the cell level, which are collectively represented as overall system performance under industrial fermentation conditions. These challenges can be overcome by taking systems approaches through the use of state-of-the-art tools of systems biology, synthetic biology and evolutionary engineering in the context of industrial bioprocess. Major systems metabolic engineering achievements in recent years include microbial production of amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, L-lysine and L-arginine), bulk chemicals (1,4-butanediol, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,3-propanediol, butanol, isobutanol and succinic acid) and drugs (artemisinin).","[Lee, Sang Yup; Kim, Hyun Uk] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Metab & Biomol Engn Natl Res Lab, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Plus Program BK21,Ctr Syst & Synthet Biotechnol,I, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Yup; Kim, Hyun Uk] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, BioInformat Res Ctr, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Yup] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, BioProc Engn Res Ctr, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Yup; Kim, Hyun Uk] Tech Univ Denmark, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Biosustainabil, Horsholm, Denmark",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Technical University of Denmark,"Lee, SY (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Metab & Biomol Engn Natl Res Lab, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Plus Program BK21,Ctr Syst & Synthet Biotechnol,I, Daejeon, South Korea.",leesy@kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Hyun Uk/F-4509-2018; Lee, Sang Yup/C-1526-2011","Kim, Hyun Uk/0000-0001-7224-642X; Lee, Sang Yup/0000-0003-0599-3091","Technology Development Program [NRF-2012M1A2A2026556]; Intelligent Synthetic Biology Center through the Global Frontier Project from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [2011-0031963]; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Novo Nordisk Fonden [NNF10CC1016517] Funding Source: researchfish; NNF Center for Biosustainability [New Bioactive Compounds] Funding Source: researchfish","Technology Development Program; Intelligent Synthetic Biology Center through the Global Frontier Project from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea; Novo Nordisk Foundation(Novo Nordisk FoundationNovocure Limited); Novo Nordisk Fonden(Novo Nordisk Foundation); NNF Center for Biosustainability","We thank Seok Hyun Park, Sol Choi, Joungmin Lee, Chan Woo Song, Jae Ho Shin and Won Jun Kim for thoughtful discussions.

Therefore, the development of proper strategies for the management of environmental risks will be crucial to ensure their liveability. Against this backdrop, concepts such as territorial resilience and Social-Ecological Systems (SES) can support the prioritisation of protective efforts. This paper presents a conceptual framework to be applied to areas subject to natural hazards. Its aim is to support the integration of different measures, with a special focus on protection forests and other Nature-based Solutions, into current risk management strategies. The framework considers (i) the definition of SES boundaries; (ii) the identification of the main goals to be achieved; (iii) the quantification of the supply and demand of the ecosystem protection service; and (iv) the development of risk management strategies able to include the management of protection forests among the adopted solutions. This framework is intended as a tool to be adopted by local and regional decision-makers as a tool to identify the areas at risk, to recognise the potential role of protection forests, and to operationalise the concept of resilience through the deployment of grey-green strategies.","[Accastello, Cristian; Blanc, Simone; Brun, Filippo] Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy",University of Turin,"Accastello, C (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.",cristian.accastello@unito.it; simone.blanc@unito.it; filippo.brun@unito.it,,"Brun, Filippo/0000-0001-5042-1469; accastello, cristian/0000-0001-5542-1900; BLANC, SIMONE/0000-0002-9725-1804", [635],,This study was funded by the INTERREG Alpine Space project n.635 GreenRisk4Alps.,,76,17,18,3,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Jan,2019,2,,,,,,489,10.3390/su11020489,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11020489,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4FR,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000457129900193,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current Light Emitting Diode (LED) technologies improved the system efficiency. Nevertheless, having artificial lighting systems extended for hectares with power densities over 50W/m(2) causes energy and power demand of greenhouses to be really significant. The present paper introduces an innovative supervisory and predictive control strategy to optimize the energy performance of the artificial lights of greenhouses. The controller has been implemented in a multi-span plastic greenhouse located in North Italy. The proposed control strategy has been tested on a greenhouse of 1 hectare with a lighting system with a nominal power density of 50 W m(-2) requiring an overall power supply of 1 MW for a period of 80 days. The results have been compared with the data coming from another greenhouse of 1 hectare in the same conditions implementing a state-of-the-art strategy for artificial lighting control. Results outlines that potential 19.4% cost savings are achievable. Moreover, the algorithm can be used to transform the greenhouse in a viable source of energy flexibility for grid reliability.","[Serale, Gianluca; Gnoli, Luca; Fabrizio, Enrico] Politecn Torino, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Serale, Gianluca] Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Olden St 86, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Polytechnic University of Turin; Princeton University,"Gnoli, L (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",gianluca.serale@polito.it; luca.gnoli@polito.it; emanuele86.giraudo@gmail.com; enrico.fabrizio@polito.it,"Fabrizio, Enrico/I-1180-2012","Fabrizio, Enrico/0000-0002-7221-2796; Serale, Gianluca/0000-0003-3100-5632",,,,,54,3,3,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2021,1,,,,,,202,10.3390/en14010202,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14010202,,,19,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,PP4LP,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000605835900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Highly productive arc regions, like those in East Asia, offer a considerable number of widespread isochrons, but before records can be confidently correlated using these layers, a refined and integrated framework of these eruptive events is required. Here we present the first high resolution Holocene cryptotephra study in East Asia, using the Lake Suigetsu sedimentary archive in central Japan. The Holocene tephrostratigraphy has been extended from four to twenty ash layers using cryptotephra extraction techniques, which integrates the deposits from explosive eruptions from North Korea/China, South Korea and along the Japanese arc. This Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy is now the most comprehensive record of East Asian volcanism, and the linchpin site for correlating sequences across this region. Major element glass geochemical compositions are presented for the tephra layers in the sequence, which have been compared to proximal datasets to correlate them to their volcanic source and specific eruptions. This study has significantly extended the ash dispersal of many key Holocene marker layers, and has identified the first distal occurrence of isochrons from Ulleungdo and Chang-baishan volcanoes. Utilising the high-precision Lake Suigetsu chronology, we are able to provide constrained eruption ages for the tephra layers, which can be transferred into other site-specific age models containing these markers. This new framework indicates that several isochrons stratigraphically bracket abrupt climate intervals in Japan, and could be used to precisely assess the regional and hemispheric synchronicity of these events.

Given that the main reason for this phenomenon is the greenhouse gas emissions, buildings cause about half of these emissions, as a sustainable building design will cause to reduce negative effects caused by the improper use of materials and produce wastes. Therefore, sustainability approach based on the needs of today's generation using renewables resources and in opposition to non-renewable resources can be expressed. In fact, sustainable building materials should have the lowest risk to human health. So materials should be investigated from design to implementation and operation to understand the sustainability concepts of building. The present article will review the assessment of sustainable materials to use in residential buildings in the area of Tehran, and the vision of research is to provide solutions for assessing the sustainable architecture through understanding the new way of building life cycle analysis (LCA) of materials in building as a tool to measure. So the research questions are: How much selecting sustainable materials based on LCA in the design of residential complexes in Tehran is effective in reducing energy consumption of these buildings?

The right use of PCM in the envelope can minimize peak cooling loads, allow the use of smaller HVAC technical equipment for cooling; and has the capability to keep the indoor temperature within the comfort range due to smaller indoor temperature fluctuations. This article presents an overview of different PCM applications in buildings for reducing cooling loads under different climate conditions, and the factors affecting the successful and the effective use of the PCM. Many drawbacks have been found in PCM applications, mainly the intense impact of summer weather conditions over the PCM performance, which prohibits its complete solidification during night, and thus, limiting its effectiveness during the day. Proposed solutions are reviewed in this article. Finally, a topology diagram is presented to summarize the steps leading to an effective use of PCM in building applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Taking Steven Connor's recently published book Living by Numbers: In Defence of Quantity (2016) as a springboard, each contributor to the event was invited to deliver a 10-minute presentation, an opening statement to set the scene, and to raise fundamental questions to be considered in the ensuing discussion. The authors retain this structure here, along with some of the informality that live conversation affords. By way of these four presentations and the conversation between the event's speakers and audience, the Roundtable raises a series of pressing concerns around data and big data, life tracking, digital health studies, and the quantifiable self; the quantitative and the qualitative; data forms and flows; climate change data and social media; the bleed between private and public computational infrastructures; labour, productivity, and accountability; time, money, and economies; and the contemporary intensification of surveillance, audit culture, marketization, and outcomes-based performance management. Notwithstanding data dystopia's numerical sublime, the contributors are always looking to keep an eye out for reasons to be optimistic in their discussions around: numbers in education and numeric literacies; the materiality of numbers and numbers as artifacts; data's flexibility and manipulability; sensors, sensor data, and everyday life; the rise of amateurism and citizen scientists; data and numbers vis-a-vis experiences, embodiment, emotions, intensities, and their affective powers; and the contributors' absolute delight (or abject horror) at the very arbitrary nature of numbers, all of which offer hope towards more democratic, creative, imaginative, and personalized futures ...

Posthumanism stands for diverse theoretical positions which together call into question the anthropocentric assertion of the human as a distinctive, unique and dominant form of life - in turn, the concept of affect has been linked with ideas of increasing and decreasing energetic intensities, which underlie, but for some also precede, processes of individuation and subjectivation.The contributors to this issue consider critically the vistas opened by affect studies and by posthumanism. Coming from diverse disciplinary traditions, including literature, philosophy, critical sociology, visual arts, and heritage studies, the articles contribute to the four thematic idioms of this issue (sensation, subjectivity, sociality, and politics) in an attempt to structure a dialogical space on posthumanist perspectives on affect and on affect-based politics. Questions of environmental governance, the critique of speciesism, the formation of cross-species solidarity, the politics of the inhuman, biopolitics and necropolitics form the intellectual mosaic of this issue. Finally, we pose the question of academic affects, in circulation in the researcher's encounter with her others - humans, insects, ghostly presences or inanimate objects - and we ask how these affects, including anger and mourning, but also joyful affirmation, are brought to bear on the process of writing.","[Roelvink, Gerda] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Zolkos, Magdalena] Australian Catholic Univ, Inst Social Justice, Sydney, NSW 2059, Australia",Western Sydney University; Australian Catholic University,"Roelvink, G (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",g.roelvink@uws.edu.au; magdalena.zolkos@acu.edu.au,,,,,,,73,14,14,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-725X,1469-2899,,ANGELAKI,Angelaki-J Theor.

The IPCC estimates focus mainly on structural uncertainties, including uncertainties in aerosol sources. Here, we study the uncertainty of the sulfate aerosol radiative forcing due to parametric uncertainty in a state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM). Numerical experiments were carried out by perturbing seven cloud parameters in the model. We find that the uncertainty due to a single one of these parameters can be as large as 0.5 W/m(2), and the uncertainty due to combinations of these parameters can reach more than 1 W/m(2). These numbers should be compared with the sulfate aerosol forcing of -1.9 W/m(2) for the year 2000, obtained using the default values of the parameters. The uncertainty results from a high sensitivity of cloud optical properties to aerosol concentrations, which can be amplified by changing cloud parameter setting. Citation: Haerter, J. O., E.

However, fruit quality attributes can be affected by pre-harvest factors, especially environmental stresses. This research aimed to evaluate the influence of two shading nets (white net -30% and pearl grey net -40% shading degree) on the yield and phytochemical profile of tomato fruits grown in summer under the Mediterranean climate. Mineral and organic acid content (by ion chromatography-IC), phenolic profile (by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-UHPLC coupled with an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry-HRMS), carotenoid content (by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection-HPLC-DAD), and antioxidant activities DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP (by UV-VIS spectrophotometry) were determined. Tomato fruits grown under the pearl grey net recorded the highest values of total phenolic compounds (14,997 mu g 100 g(-1) of fresh weight) and antioxidant activities DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP, without affecting either fruit color or marketable yield. The reduction of solar radiation through pearl grey nets proved to be an excellent tool to increase the phytochemical quality of tomato fruits during summer cultivation in a Mediterranean environment.","[Formisano, Luigi; Ciriello, Michele; El-Nakhel, Christophe; De Pascale, Stefania; Rouphael, Youssef] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, Italy; [Poledica, Milena] Sachim Srl, Res & Dev Lab, I-70017 Putignano, Italy; [Starace, Giuseppe] Univ Bari LUM Giuseppe Degennaro, Dept Management Finance & Technol, I-70010 Casamassima, Italy; [Graziani, Giulia; Ritieni, Alberto] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Pharm, Via Domenico Montesano 49, I-80141 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"De Pascale, S (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, Italy.",luigi.formisano3@unina.it; michele.ciriello@unina.it; christophe.elnakhel@unina.it; milena.poledica@sachim.it; starace@lum.it; giulia.graziani@unina.it; ritialb@unina.it; depascal@unina.it; youssef.rouphael@unina.it,"Graziani, Giulia/AAN-4828-2020; Starace, Giuseppe/N-4718-2015","Graziani, Giulia/0000-0003-3070-5389; El-Nakhel, Christophe/0000-0002-1200-2834; De Pascale, Stefania/0000-0002-3653-7497; Ritieni, Alberto/0000-0003-0314-8839; Rouphael, Youssef/0000-0002-1002-8651; Formisano, Luigi/0000-0001-6208-4869; Starace, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4272-7104","Sachim s.r.l., Putignano (BA), Italy [17-BURP, 139, 26]","Sachim s.r.l., Putignano (BA), Italy","The authors would like to acknowledge Arrigoni spa (Uggiate Trevano (CO), Italy) for its logistics and commercial support to provide and install shading nets.

Two queries are set out, the first one from a holistic point of view of the topic, while the second one has a special consideration on concrete as TES under high-temperature conditions. Most part of the literature research pays attention to concrete applications in buildings, while other applications such as solar energy are in the rear face. Throughout the years, great interest in latent heat storage technology is observed using phase change material (PCM), implementing them in concrete mixtures or in other formats integrated into a building component. Despite the fact that the area of research is currently in prominent development, some literature gaps and new research directions are identified. Concepts such as climate change mitigation, concrete components, maintenance, are possible in-progress initiatives which need to be further studied.","[Boquera, Laura; Pisello, Anna Laura] CIRIAF Interuniv Res Ctr Pollut & Environm Mauro, Via G Duranti 63, I-06125 Perugia, Italy; [Boquera, Laura; Castro, J.

Numerous conducted studies have only paid attention to design of colleges according to climate and investigated the impact of physical dimensions in educational spaces such as dimensions and proportions, light, color, furniture and arrangement of spaces, etc, or per capita and radii of access to educational spaces. These studies have been conducted in general for all educational spaces, but they are not conducted in particular for all technical and vocational colleges. In this study, a questionnaire is designed for evaluating the impact of workspace at Sama technical and vocational college of Ardabil and distributed among 100 students. The results indicate that most of the students agree with creation of workspace at this college; and establishment of a workplace in the form of workshop and attendance at Sama technical and vocational collage can be a step in development of educational goals and increase in students' creativity and skills.","[Namadieslam, Solmaz] Sama Tech & Vocat Coll, Kermanshah, Iran; [Lotfollahian, Hamid] Gazi Univ Ankara, Yenimahalle Ankara, Turkey; [Lotfollahian, Hamid] Islamic Azad Univ, Sama Tech & Vocatinal Training Coll, Ardebil Branch, Ardebil, Iran",Gazi University; Islamic Azad University,"Namadieslam, S (corresponding author), Sama Tech & Vocat Coll, Kermanshah, Iran.",s.namadieslam@yahoo.com; hamid_19732002@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,ISTANBUL KULTUR UNIV,ISTANBUL,"ATAKOY CAMPUS, BAKIRKOY, ISTANBUL, 34156, TURKEY",2146-5193,,,TURK ONLINE J DES AR,Turk.

The present investigation concerns the applications related to thermal insulation. The idealized composite wall considered here numerically can be thought of as resulting from the incorporation of shape-stabilized PCM particles in a polymer matrix. A novel model is developed to study the thermal behavior of this PCM-composite when used as a planar insulating material submitted to variable thermal modulations on one of its faces. The numerical model couples the heat transfer in the wall with the heat transfer and the crystallization/melting process within PCM inclusions considered as spherical. Both processes are modeled by a finite volume approach combined with the enthalpy method to account for the phase change. Simulation results are used to monitor the temperatures in the wall and quantify the energy exchanges between its two sides. The thickness of the wall and the volume fraction of the incorporated PCM were varied in this study. This analysis permits to point out the configurations for which the negative effect of the higher thermal conductivity of the PCM outweighs the benefits related to its latent heat. The analysis is extended to different external temperature modulations representing different typical seasons/climates. The results show the impact of the choice of the PCM phase change temperature on the wall thermal efficiency over the year. For the case investigated, it was shown that a PCM composite board with increased performances during a summer day exhibits a degraded behavior during a winter day when compared to a pure (without PCM) insulation material.

Short-term temperature responses are not well described by a constant Q(10) of respiration, and longer-term responses often include acclimation. Despite this, many carbon balance models use a static Q(10) of respiration to describe the short-term temperature response and ignore temperature acclimation. We replaced static respiration parameters in the ecosystem model photosynthesis and evapo-transpiration (PnET) with a temperature-driven basal respiration algorithm (Rd(acclim)) that accounts for temperature acclimation, and a temperature-variable Q(10) algorithm (Q(10var)). We ran PnET with the new algorithms individually and in combination for 5 years across a range of sites and vegetation types in order to examine the new algorithms' effects on modeled rates of mass- and area-based foliar dark respiration, above ground net primary production (ANPP), and foliar respiration-photosynthesis ratios. The Rd(acclim) algorithm adjusted dark respiration downwards at temperatures above 18 degrees C, and adjusted rates up at temperatures below 5 degrees C. The Q(10var) algorithm adjusted dark respiration down at temperatures below 15 degrees C. Using both algorithms simultaneously resulted in decreases in predicted annual foliar respiration that ranged from 31% at a tall-grass prairie site to 41% at a boreal coniferous site. The use of the Rd(acclim) and Q(10var) algorithms resulted in increases in predicted ANPP ranging from 18% at the tall-grass prairie site to 38% at a warm temperate hardwood forest site. The new foliar respiration algorithms resulted in substantial and variable effects on PnETs predicted estimates of C exchange and production in plants and ecosystems. Current models that use static parameters may over-predict respiration and subsequently under-predict and/or inappropriately allocate productivity estimates. Incorporating acclimation of basal respiration and temperature-sensitive Q(10) have the potential to enhance the application of ecosystem models across broad spatial scales, or in climate change scenarios, where large temperature ranges may cause static respiration parameters to yield misleading results.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Forest Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Wythers, KR (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",kwythers@umn.edu,"Tjoelker, Mark G/M-2413-2016","Tjoelker, Mark G/0000-0003-4607-5238; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",,,,,90,96,99,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Comparison of ice-core trends, estimated past emissions, and state-of-the-art atmospheric aerosol transport modeling suggest that coal burning was responsible for thallium pollution in Europe, particularly from 1920 to 1965 because of high coal consumption at that time. The subsequent decline resulted from decreased coal consumption and reduced emissions following technological improvements. The ice-core data suggest that the rapid growth of cement production that took place in Europe after 1950 had a limited impact on thallium pollution.","[Legrand, Michel; Preunkert, Susanne] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, Grenoble, France; [Legrand, Michel; Bergametti, Gilles; Desboeufs, Karine] Univ Paris, Lab Interuniv Syst Atmospher, Creteil, France; [Legrand, Michel; Bergametti, Gilles; Desboeufs, Karine] Univ Paris Est Creteil, CNRS, LISA, Creteil, France; [McConnell, Joseph R.; Chellman, Nathan J.] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV USA; [Plach, Andreas; Stohl, Andreas] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria; [Eckhardt, Sabine] NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Atmospher & Climate Res, Kjeller, Norway",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; University of Vienna; Norwegian Institute for Air Research,"Legrand, M (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, Grenoble, France.;Legrand, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Lab Interuniv Syst Atmospher, Creteil, France.;Legrand, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris Est Creteil, CNRS, LISA, Creteil, France.",michel.legrand@lisa.ipsl.fr,"Stohl, Andreas/A-7535-2008; Eckhardt, Sabine/I-4001-2012","Stohl, Andreas/0000-0002-2524-5755; McConnell, Joseph/0000-0001-9051-5240; Eckhardt, Sabine/0000-0001-6958-5375; Plach, Andreas/0000-0003-4899-5871; Bergametti, Gilles/0000-0002-0839-1048",European Community [ENV4-CT97]; EU CARBOSOL project [EVK2 CT2001-00113]; Region Rhone-Alpes; LEFE-CHAT (CNRS) program; ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie); NSF [1925417],European Community(European Commission); EU CARBOSOL project; Region Rhone-Alpes(Region Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes); LEFE-CHAT (CNRS) program; ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The ice core drilling operations at CDD were supported by the European Community via ENV4-CT97 (ALPCLIM) contract, the EU CARBOSOL project (contract EVK2 CT2001-00113), and the Region Rhone-Alpes.

In addition, maps of changes in indicator values per 5 or 10years are visualised. As a result, spatial regions within Germany that have received increases in, for instance, higher numbers of elderly citizens can be visualised. Maps visualise the increasing susceptibility to hazards such as floods, heatwaves, storms or technological accidents. At the same time, increases or decreases in capacities, such as hospital density or care homes, highlight regions that have adjusted or still have to adjust to demographic change demands. The main purpose of this paper is to test stability and heterogeneity of indicators over time and offer advice on a selection of indicators that are not only based on static and singular assessments but also take dynamics and related richness of additional temporal change information into account for longitudinal monitoring of disaster risk with a focus on vulnerability.","[Fekete, Alexander] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Cologne, Germany",,"Fekete, A (corresponding author), TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Cologne, Germany.",alexander.fekete@th-koeln.de,"Fekete, Alexander/C-4071-2017","Fekete, Alexander/0000-0002-8029-6774",,,,,71,17,18,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Evaluating the impact of agriculture on climate thus requires capacity to predict the net exchanges of these gases in a systemic approach, as related to environmental conditions and crop management. Here, we used experimental data sets from intensively monitored cropping systems in France and Germany to calibrate and evaluate the ability of the biophysical crop model CERES-EGC to simulate GHG exchanges at the plot-scale. The experiments involved major crop types (maize-wheat-barley-rapeseed) on loam and rendzina soils. The model was subsequently extrapolated to predict CO2 and N2O fluxes over entire crop rotations. Indirect emissions (IE) arising from the production of agricultural inputs and from use of farm machinery were also added to the final greenhouse gas balance. One experimental site (involving a maize-wheat-barley-mustard rotation on a loamy soil) was a net source of GHG with a net GHG balance of 670 kg CO2-C eq ha(-1) yr(-1), of which half were due to IE and half to direct N2O emissions. The other site (involving a rapeseed-wheat-barley rotation on a rendzina) was a net sink of GHG for -650 kg CO2-C eq ha(-1) yr(-1), mainly due to high C returns to soil from crop residues. A selection of mitigation options were tested at one experimental site, of which straw return to soils emerged as the most efficient to reduce the net GHG balance of the crop rotation, with a 35% abatement. Halving the rate of N inputs only allowed a 27% reduction in net GHG balance. Removing the organic fertilizer application led to a substantial loss of C for the entire crop rotation that was not compensated by a significant decrease of N2O emissions due to a lower N supply in the system. Agro-ecosystem modeling and scenario analysis may therefore contribute to design productive cropping systems with low GHG emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Within the first 10 years of the injection, we find an abrupt deepening of the Antarctic ozone hole by 8%-20% and changes up to +/- 5% for other regions and seasons. The ozone hole recovery is delayed by similar to 25 to over 55 years, with the fastest recovery for low-altitude injections and slowest for equatorial injections. Mid to high-latitude TCO increases by similar to 15% in Northern Hemisphere winter and spring between 2010-2019 and 2080-2089 due to both increasing greenhouse gases and increasing sulfur injections.

Herein, porous activated carbon derived from silk waste is prepared by a simple method. Various porous activated carbons are obtained using different types and concentrations of activator (KOH, KCl, and KHCO3). The effect of the microstructure on the electric heating performance of these carbons is investigated carefully. The type, activator concentration, and carbonization temperature play key roles in the regulation of electric heating properties. The porous carbon activated by 0.05 M KHCO3 at 800 degrees C demonstrates larger specific surface area (3077 m(2) g(-1)), higher graphitization degree, and lower resistance (2.4 Omega cm), which synergistically contribute greatly to its higher electrothermal efficiency and better electric heating performance. The equilibrium temperature could reach 73 degrees C in 2 min under a safe voltage of 12 V, proving the better pore-forming capacity and activating function of KHCO3. An electric heating cotton@carbon composite fabric with quite good electric heating property and stability is also prepared, which could reach 38 degrees C in 2 min under 12 V safe voltage and maintain a temperature 10 degrees C higher than the ambient temperature even when bent at an angle of 55 degrees. This activated carbon derived from waste protein using a simple and cheap process has great potential in practical applications.","[Xu, Qiao; Si, Yinsong; He, Rui; Qi, Xiaoming; Fu, Yaqin] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Qiao; Su, Xiuping] Shaoxing Univ, Sch Text Apparel & Art Design, Yuanpei Coll, Shaoxing 312000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Shaoxing University,"Si, YS (corresponding author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",siys@zstu.edu.cn,,"Qi, Xiaoming/0000-0002-5379-2457; Si, Yinsong/0000-0001-9378-2731; Xu, Qiao/0000-0001-9107-9153","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20A20264, 52003243]; China Agriculture Research System of MOF; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ21E030010]; High-level Talents Startup Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University [19012394-Y]; Fundamental Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University [2021Q013]; China Agriculture Research System of MARA",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Agriculture Research System of MOF; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); High-level Talents Startup Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Fundamental Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; China Agriculture Research System of MARA,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U20A20264 and 52003243), China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA, Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LQ21E030010), the High-level Talents Startup Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (19012394-Y), and the Fundamental Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (2021Q013).",,43,2,2,33,59,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

As it lies in east-west direction in terms of its location, there is a striking vegetation contrast between the north and south slopes. The wide distribution of characteristically hygrophilous elements such as Uludag fir (Abies bornmulleriana) and beech (Fagus orientalis) on the north slopes of the mountain makes it very interesting. The purpose of this study is to reveal the reason behind this interesting situation and to describe the features of these two slopes by comparing them. The vegetation was examined on site, notes were taken, and samples were collected in the preparation phase of the study. Later, these findings were classified. Based on the observations and materials, a vegetation map with a scale of 1/25.000 was prepared by using forest management plans and topographic maps. Data provided by Mustafakemalpasa and Kepsut meteorological stations, which respectively represent the north and south slopes, was used in order to find out about the relationship between the vegetation and the climate. Besides, 1/25.000 scaled geological and soil maps were drawn with the purpose of demonstrating the edaphic conditions of plant communities. In order to indicate the orographic influence, cross section views of the vegetation along the north and south slopes were generated. Cataldag lies in east-west direction, and is about 50 km away from the Marmara Sea as the crow flies. Thus, the north slopes are exposed to sea effects. The aspect, geographical position, and the elevation of the mountain led to the formation of a hygrophilous plant community. The study not only reveals that the aspect has a great influence on the vegetation of the north and south slopes of mountains, but also demonstrates that this area is a border between the phytogeographical regions of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In addition, the area is important in that it is the farthest western edge of the land where Uludag fir (Abies bornmulleriana) grows. Beech communities, a dominant plant species on the north slopes, are found as islets and belts in regions situated in further west and south. This proves that Cataldag is located in the Black Sea phytogeographical region. (C) 2013 The Authors.

While previous reviews of IAQ on Passivhaus-certified buildings foccused on offices, this study examines residential buildings. A summary of data collection methods and pollutant concentrations is presented, followed by a critical discussion of the impact of Passivhaus design strategies on IAQ. This review indicates that IAQ in Passivhaus-certified dwellings is generally better than in conventional homes, but both occupant behaviour and pollution from outdoor sources play a significant role in indoor concentrations. Moreover, there are differences in data collection and reporting methods. Many of the available studies depend on short-term IAQ monitoring of less than two weeks, making it difficult to determine the longer impact of housing design on IAQ and occupants' well-being. There is also a lack of studies from non-European countries. Future research should focus on investigating associations between IAQ and Passivhaus design strategies in hot and humid climates, where evidence is particularly lacking. Further effort is also required to investigate potential links between occupant's perception of IAQ and physical exposure to indoor pollution. Finally, the lack of homogeneous monitoring and reporting methods for IAQ studies needs to be addressed.","[Moreno-Rangel, Alejandro] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Inst Contemporary Arts, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Sharpe, Tim; McGill, Grainne] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, 75 Montrose St, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland; [Musau, Filbert] Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Environm Architecture Res Unit, 167 Renfrew St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland",Lancaster University; University of Strathclyde; Glasgow School of Art,"Moreno-Rangel, A (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Inst Contemporary Arts, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",a.morenorangel@lancaster.ac.uk; tim.sharpe@strath.ac.uk; grainne.mcgill@strath.ac.uk; f.musau@gsa.ac.uk,"Rangel, Alejandro Moreno/AAT-7224-2020","Rangel, Alejandro Moreno/0000-0001-6405-4233; Sharpe, Tim/0000-0002-4275-5351; McGill, Grainne/0000-0002-8716-9567","CONACyT; AHRC [AH/N006607/1, AH/S010467/1, AH/R00207X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This research was partially funded by CONACyT through a PhD grant.,,106,22,22,3,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

To better manage the pandemic, a high-throughput, rapid point-of-care device is needed for early detection and isolation of patients. Electrochemical biosensors offer a promising solution, as they can be used to perform on-site tests without the need for centralized labs, producing high-throughput and accurate measurements compared to rapid test kits. In this work, we detail important considerations for the use of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of respiratory viruses. Methods of enhancing signal outputs via amplification of the analyte, biorecognition of elements and modification of the transducer are also explained. The use of portable potentiostats and microfluidics chambers that create a miniature lab are also discussed in detail as an alternative to centralized laboratory settings. The state-of-the-art usage of portable potentiostats for detection of viruses is also elaborated and categorized according to detection technique: amperometry, voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In terms of integration with microfluidics, RT-LAMP is identified as the preferred method for DNA amplification virus detection. RT-LAMP methods have shorter turnaround times compared to RT-PCR and do not require thermal cycling. Current applications of RT-LAMP for virus detection are also elaborated upon.","[Ghani, Muhammad Afiq Abdul; Nordin, Anis Nurashikin; Atan, Muhammad Khairul Faisal Muhamad; Ab Rahim, Rosminazuin] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Engn Fac, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, MEMS VLSI Res Unit, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Federal Territo, Malaysia; [Zulhairee, Munirah; Zain, Zainiharyati Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Appl Sci, Electrochem Mat & Sensor EMaS Res Grp, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Nor, Adibah Che Mohamad; Noorden, Mohd Shihabuddin Ahmad] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Pharm, Puncak Alam Campus, Bandar Puncak Alam 42300, Selangor, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Nordin, AN (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Engn Fac, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, MEMS VLSI Res Unit, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Federal Territo, Malaysia.",anisnn@iium.edu.my,"NORDIN, ANIS NURASHIKIN/E-3570-2012","NORDIN, ANIS NURASHIKIN/0000-0002-8301-4365; Ab Rahim, Rosminazuin/0000-0002-7220-9183","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) [CV02211032]","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI)(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia)","This research was funded by Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) with reference number of CV02211032.",,107,1,1,20,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-6374,,BIOSENSORS-BASEL,Biosensors-Basel,AUG,2022,8,,,,,,666,10.3390/bios12080666,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bios12080666,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation,4D4AX,36005062,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000847086000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the mountains, temperature decreases with increasing elevation. This is why the onset of spring activity of vipers can be expected to vary regionally between warm lowland and cold montane climates. To analyze the relationship between elevation and onset of spring activity, the authors surveyed habitats for emerging male vipers of the genera Montivipera and Macrovipera between April and May in Turkey and Cyprus. Sexually active male vipers shed soon after leaving their hibernacula and before mating. The male spring shedding is obligatory and therefore represents a chronometer for the onset of the vipers' surface activity. During field trips between 2004 and 2015, fifteen male vipers were found in habitats between sea level and 2,300 m a.s.l. elevation with milky-opaque eyes reflecting their state of pre-ecdysis. The observed significant positive correlation between onset of the vipers' spring activity and the elevation of the record site represents an ecological dine. The information can help to forecast duration of hibernation and activity of the vipers in the field. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study about spring phenology of vipers from the eastern Mediterranean.","[Stuempel, Nikolaus] Staatliches Nat Hist Museum Braunschweig, Gausstr 22, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Zinenko, Oleksandr] Kharkov Natl Univ, Svobody Sq 4, UA-61058 Kharkov, Ukraine; [Mebert, Konrad] Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University,"Stumpel, N (corresponding author), Staatliches Nat Hist Museum Braunschweig, Gausstr 22, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",nikolaus.stuempel@gmx.de,"Zinenko, Oleksandr/N-4867-2015","Zinenko, Oleksandr/0000-0001-5228-9940",Volkswagen Stiftung,Volkswagen Stiftung(Volkswagen),"The authors thank Volkswagen Nutzfahrzeuge Hannover for generous support of the fieldtrips in 2003 and 2004 and Volkswagen Stiftung for funding the fieldtrip in 2011.

The forward model is built around a doubling-adding routine and calculates, in a spherical refractive geometry, the outgoing radiation emitted by the Earth and the atmosphere containing one layer of aerosol. The inverse model uses an optimal estimation approach and can simultaneously retrieve atmospheric trace gases, aerosol effective radius, and concentration. It is different from existing codes, as most forward codes dealing with multiple scattering assume a plane-parallel atmosphere, and as for the retrieval, it does not rely on precalculated spectra, the use of microwindows, or two-step retrievals. The simultaneous retrieval on a broad spectral range exploits the full potential of current state-of-the-art hyperspectral IR sounders, such as AIRS and IASI, and should be particularly useful in studying major pollution events. We present five example retrievals of IASI spectra observed in the range from 800 to 1200 cm(-1) above dust, volcanic ash, sulfuric acid, ice particles, and biomass burning aerosols.

Suitable carbonate and phosphate RMs for determination of Sr isotope ratios in such materials are limited. Thus, we determined Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of several carbonate (JCt-1, JCp-1, MACS-1, MACS-3) and phosphate (MAPS-4, MAPS-5, NIST SRM 1400, NIST SRM 1486) international RMs using dissolved samples and two different multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometers (MC-ICP-MS). Our Sr isotope data are in agreement with published data and have an improved measurement precision for some RMs. For MACS-1, we present the first Sr-87/Sr-86 value. We tested the suitability of these materials for microanalytical analyses by LA-MC-ICP-MS, with two different laser ablation systems: a conventional nanosecond laser and a state-of-the-art femtosecond laser. We investigated the RMs micro-homogeneity and compared the data with our solution data. Both laser ablation systems yielded identical Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios within uncertainty to the solution data for RMs with low interferences of REEs. Therefore, these carbonate and phosphate RMs can be used to achieve accurate and precise results for insitu Sr isotope investigations by LA-MC-ICP-MS of similar materials.","[Weber, Michael; Scholz, Denis] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geosci, JJ Becher Weg 21, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Weber, Michael; Jochum, Klaus Peter] Otto Hahn Inst, Max Planck Inst Chem, Climate Geochem Dept, POB 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Lugli, Federico; Cipriani, Anna] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Chem & Geol Sci, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Cipriani, Anna] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Max Planck Society; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Columbia University,"Weber, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geosci, JJ Becher Weg 21, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.;Weber, M (corresponding author), Otto Hahn Inst, Max Planck Inst Chem, Climate Geochem Dept, POB 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany.",mweber02@students.uni-mainz.de; k.jochum@mpic.de,"Weber, Michael/AAC-1853-2020; Cipriani, Anna/A-2797-2012; Scholz, Denis/G-1861-2016","Cipriani, Anna/0000-0001-8457-0147; Scholz, Denis/0000-0002-0055-8915; Weber, Michael/0000-0002-9086-9345; Lugli, Federico/0000-0002-5642-2216",Max Planck Graduate Centre; Programma Giovani Ricercatori Rita Levi Montalcini; German Research Foundation [DFG SCHO 1274/9-1],Max Planck Graduate Centre; Programma Giovani Ricercatori Rita Levi Montalcini; German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This study was funded by the Max Planck Graduate Centre (to Michael Weber) and by the Programma Giovani Ricercatori Rita Levi Montalcini to Anna Cipriani.

However, the observed quantities are not directly comparable to the prognostic variables of NWP models (e.g. hydrometeor densities, wind vector, temperature, pressure, etc.), so a common approach to facilitate this comparison is to derive synthetic radar observations from model variables; this is the so-called radar forward operator'. In the present article, a new Efficient Modular VOlume scanning RADar Operator (EMVORADO) for Doppler velocity and reflectivity is introduced. Although it has been developed in the COSMO model framework, it can be also coupled online to any other NWP model. Comprehensive physical aspects of radar measurements (e.g. beam bending/broadening/shielding, Doppler velocity with fall speed and reflectivity weighting, attenuated reflectivity, detectable signal, etc.) have been implemented in a modular way, using state-of-the-art methods with different levels of approximation and numerical costs that can be optionally chosen. The reflectivity derivation from the prognostic model variables is as model consistent' as possible and carefully honours the uncertainties associated with partially melted particles. Efficiency and applicability on supercomputers (MPI-parallelism) is a major design criterion, which allows us to simulate entire networks of 3D volume-scanning meteorological radars within one model run and makes EMVORADO well suited for operational applications. This article aims to give a thorough description of the EMVORADO and to provide a first insight to the performance of different modules by some selected case-studies.","[Zeng, Yuefei; Jerger, Dorit] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Zeng, Yuefei; Blahak, Ulrich] Deutscher Wetterdienst DWD, Offenbach, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Zeng, YF (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany.",yuefei.zeng@lmu.de,"Jerger, Dorit/AAF-9019-2019",,Extramural Research Program at DWD; German Research Foundation [DFG JA1077/3-1],Extramural Research Program at DWD; German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the Extramural Research Program at DWD.

Understanding the biophysical controls of the surface nitrogen exchange is essential for the parameterization of process-based and chemical transport models that can be used for the determination of regional or national nitrogen budgets. In this study, we investigated similarities in time series of net total reactive nitrogen (Sigma N-r) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes above forest with regard to their variability and driving factors. We found corresponding shapes of the mean diurnal summertime patterns of Sigma N-r, and CO2. While ecosystem respiration leads to a net CO2 release at night, Sigma N-r, was on average deposited throughout the entire observation period. Using artificial neural network analysis, global radiation (R-g) was identified to be the main control for both Sigma N-r, and CO2. While the concentration of Sigma N-r, substantially improved the coefficient of determination for IN, fluxes when used as a secondary driver, only minor improvements of 2-3% were found for CO2 fluxes when using for example temperature or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) as secondary driver. Considering two dominant drivers, 41 and 66% of the variability in Sigma N-r, and CO2 fluxes, respectively, could be explained. Further data stratification for Sigma N-r revealed that higher concentrations, higher temperature, and higher VPD as well as dry leaf surfaces tend to favour higher deposition of Sigma N-r,N- whereas lower concentrations, lower temperature, and lower VPD as well as wet leaf surfaces mainly correspond to situations when less Sigma N-r, was deposited or even emitted. Our results support the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions, their driving factors, and establish a link between Sigma N-r, and CO2 exchange, which may be beneficial for future developments in state-of-the-art exchange modelling.","[Zoell, Undine; Lucas-Moffat, Antje M.; Wintjen, Pascal; Schrader, Frederik; Bruemmer, Christian] Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Bundesallee 65, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Lucas-Moffat, Antje M.] German Meteorol Serv, Ctr Agrometeorol Res, Bundesallee 33, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Beudert, Burkhard] Bavarian Forest Natl Pk, D-94481 Grafenau, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Brummer, C (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Bundesallee 65, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",christian.bruemmer@thuenen.de,"Brümmer, Christian/J-1183-2016","Brümmer, Christian/0000-0001-6621-5010; Lucas-Moffat, Antje/0000-0003-1307-2065; Schrader, Frederik/0000-0002-5668-3467",German Environment Agency [FKZ 3715512110]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LN1308A],German Environment Agency; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Funding for this study from the German Environment Agency under the guidance of Dr. Markus Geupel (project FORESTFLUX, support code FKZ 3715512110) and from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the Junior Research Group NITROSPHERE under support code FKZ 01LN1308A is greatly acknowledged.

Though traditionally water managers have looked towards supply-based solutions (e.g., expanding reservoirs), recent trends indicate a shift towards demand-side management (e.g., encouraging conservation behaviors). A major part of successfully implementing demand management strategies is understanding the community-specific attitudes and beliefs that may influence uptake of conservation behaviors. Here, we present results from a study aimed at understanding these community-specific attitudes and beliefs towards water conservation. In particular, we leverage survey data from three cities in the Southwestern United States and a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm to determine seven key archetypes of water consumers. These archetypes can be used to determine demand management strategies that might have greater (or lesser) success. This study provides transferable archetypes of consumer attitudes towards water conservation, as well as a novel interdisciplinary methodology that combines social survey data with unsupervised machine learning.","[Obringer, Renee] Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, Hosler Bldg, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Obringer, Renee] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [White, Dave D.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave, Tempe, AZ 85004 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Obringer, R (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, Hosler Bldg, University Pk, PA 16801 USA.;Obringer, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA.",obringer@psu.edu,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The novelty of IGM is that it models the ice flow by a Convolutional Neural Network, which is trained from data generated with hybrid SIA + SSA or Stokes ice flow models. By doing so, the most computationally demanding model component is substituted by a cheap emulator. Once trained with representative data, we demonstrate that IGM permits to model mountain glaciers up to 1000 x faster than Stokes ones on Central Processing Units (CPU) with fidelity levels above 90% in terms of ice flow solutions leading to nearly identical transient thickness evolution. Switching to the GPU often permits additional significant speed-ups, especially when emulating Stokes dynamics or/and modelling at high spatial resolution. IGM is an open-source Python code which deals with two-dimensional (2-D) gridded input and output data. Together with a companion library of trained ice flow emulators, IGM permits user-friendly, highly efficient and mechanically state-of-the-art glacier and icefields simulations.","[Jouvet, Guillaume; Luthi, Martin; Vieli, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cordonnier, Guillaume; Kim, Byungsoo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Comp Graph Lab, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cordonnier, Guillaume] Univ Cote Azur, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Cordonnier, Guillaume] INRIA, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Aschwanden, Andy] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Geophys, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Aschwanden, Andy] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Glaciol & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Cote d'Azur; Inria; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland,"Jouvet, G (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland.",guillaume.jouvet@geo.uzh.ch,,"Kim, Byungsoo/0000-0003-4482-8363; Jouvet, Guillaume/0000-0002-8546-8459; Luthi, Martin Peter/0000-0003-4419-8496",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021-162444],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We acknowledge Ed Bueler, Fabien Maussion and an anonymous referee for their valuable comments on the original manuscript.

The first mode of variability characterizes WMB variability in Northern and Central Europe and the second mode primarily represents WMB variability in northwestern North America, but also is related to variability in WMB of one glacier in Europe and one in Central Asia. These two modes of WMB variability are explained by variations in mesoscale atmospheric circulation which art: driving forces of variations in surface temperature and precipitation. The first mode is highly correlated with the Arctic Oscillation Index, whereas the second mode is highly correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index. In addition, the second mode of WMB variability is highly correlated with variability in global winter temperatures.

Sediments are a product of mass dispersal at the Earth surface and take part in global cycles. Sediment budgets aim at quantifying this mass transfer based on the principle of mass conservation and are the key to determine ancient fluxes of solid matter at the earth surface. This involves fundamental questions about the interplay of uplift, climate and denudation in mountain belts and transfer of sediments from the continents to the oceans as well as applied issues such as soil and gully erosion, reservoir siltation, and coastal protection. First, after introducing basic concepts, relevant scales and methodologies, the different components of Quaternary routing systems from erosion in headwaters, river systems, glacial and paraglacial systems, lakes, deltas, estuaries, coasts, shelves, epicontinental seas, and deep-sea fans are discussed in terms of their sediment budget. Most suitable are sedimentologically closed or semi-closed depositional environments e.g. alluvial fans, lakes, deltas and deep-sea fans. In a second step, the dynamics of passive, active, and collisional tectonic settings and sediment budgets in related sedimentary basins are explored and new concepts of sediment portioning at large geodynamic scales are introduced. Ancient routing systems are more or less incomplete and may be intensively fragmented or destroyed in active tectonic settings. In terms of sedimentary basin types, rifts, intracontinental and epicontinental settings are preferred objects of sediment budgets, because of their persistence and relatively simple overall sedimentary architecture. However, closing basins, such as foreland, forearc, retroarc, piggy-back and wedge-top basins may provide excellent snapshots of orogenic sediment fluxes. In a third step, the large long-lived routing systems of the Amazon, the Ganges-Brahmaputra, and the Rhine are reviewed. For each system estimates of either sediment volumes (mass) or sediment fluxes of continental and marine subsystems have been compiled in order to receive a complete routing in terms of mass conservation for specific time periods since the Late Glacial Maximum as well as the Cenozoic. Following lessons can be taken from these case studies: (i) depositional centers and fluxes show strong shifts in space and time and call for caution when simply looking at subsystems, (ii) the response times of these large systems are within the Milankovich time interval, thus lower than predicted from diffusion models, (iii) cyclic routing of sediments in continental basins is much more dominated by climate (human) control than by eustacy. and (iv) at long time scales, ultimate sinks win over intermittent storage. It is concluded from this review that the quantitative understanding of global sediment cycling over historic and geologic time and its response to allogenic forcing is still in its infancy and further research is needed towards a holistic view of sediment routing systems at various temporal and spatial scales and their coupling with global biogeochemical cycles. This includes (i) to better determine response times of large routing systems by linking Quaternary with Cenozoic sediment budgets and continental with marine sub-systems, (ii) to combine advanced provenance techniques with sediment budgets in order to reconstruct ancient systems, (iii) to study sediment partitioning at the basin scale, (iv) to reconcile continental, supply-dominated sequence stratigraphy with the eustatic-dominated marine concept, and (iv) to account for non-actualism of ancient systems with respect to their erosion and transport mode, in particular, during glaciations and pronounced arid intervals. Glacial and eolian sediment routing may cross over hydrologic boundaries of drainage basins, thus challenging the principle of mass conservation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To systematically fulfill the research aims, this study integrates both numerical and descriptive data by sequentially applying three interdependent research techniques namely inductive analysis of literature, modified Delphi method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP).

Climate change is expected to further exacerbate water scarcity in many parts of the world. The Water Poverty Index (WPI) is used as one of the important tools for measuring water scarcity. Although WPI is linked to the development of countries, the impacts of WPI components on the development are not clearly investigated. There are studies that demonstrate strong associations between water-related factors such as availability and accessibility, and development capacity. However, limited knowledge exists on the impacts of multiple WPI sub-components on the Human Development Index (HDI). This paper aims to assess the impacts of the WPI components (i.e., resource, capacity, access, use, and environment) on the HDI in Iran. For this purpose, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression modeling is used. The results show that the resource component of the WPI has the largest impact on the HDI in Iran, followed by the capacity, environment, use, and access components. Also, while the use component inversely impacts the HDI, the increase in the other components leads to an increase in the HDI. Based on the findings, the paper provides planning recommendations for improving the WPI and consequently the HDI in Iran.","[Ladi, Tahmineh] Univ Toledo, Dept Geog & Planning, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Mahmoudpour, Asrin] Univ Art, Dept Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Hiroshima, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Tabriz, Iran",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; Hiroshima University,"Sharifi, A (corresponding author), 1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan.",Tahmineh.Ladi@rockets.utoledo.edu; a.mahmoudpour@art.ac.ir; sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613",,,,,63,12,12,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0197-3975,1873-5428,,HABITAT INT,Habitat Int.,JUL,2021,,,,,,,102375,10.1016/j.habitatint.2021.102375,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2021.102375,,21-Jun,10,Development Studies; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration; Urban Studies,TD6EQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000669418100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The multithreaded programming model is inherently more expressive than the data-parallel model but is not especially adapted to regular data structures common to many scientific codes. One goal of this study is to understand what, if any, are the performance penalties of multithreaded execution when implementing a program that is well suited for data-parallel execution. To avoid technology and machine configuration issues, the two implementations are compared in terms of overhead cycles per required floating point operation. When flows in complex geometries typical of ocean basins are simulated, the data-parallel model only remains efficient if redundant computations are performed over land. The generality of the Id programming model, however, allows one to easily and transparently implement a parallel code that computes only in the ocean. When ocean basins with complex and irregular geometry are simulated the normalized performance on Monsoon is comparable with that of the CM-5. For more regular geometries that map well to the computational domain, the data-parallel approach proves to be a better match. We conclude by examining the extent to which clusters of mainstream symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems offer a scientific computing environment which can capitalize on and combine the strengths of the two paradigms.

Due to the evaporation of Si from MoSi2 at spraying conditions suitable for YSZ, more moderate conditions and a shorter time of flight are required for depositing MoSi2. At the same time, the spraying conditions still need to be sufficient for melting the YSZ particles in order to produce a coating. To obtain a homogeneous mixture, both conditions can be matched using an injection system that allows powder injection at two different locations of the plasma jet. Two-color pyrometry during flight (DPV-2000, Tecnar) was used to monitor the actual particle temperature. By optimizing the injection point for the MoSi2, a mixed coating was obtained without decomposition of the MoSi2, which has been analyzed by means of XRD and SEM.","[Koch, D.; Mauer, G.; Vassen, R.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch IEK 1, Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Koch, D (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch IEK 1, Julich, Germany.",d.koch@fz-juelich.de; r.vassen@fz-juelich.de,,,European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7 [309849],European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7,"The authors would like to thank Karl-Heinz Rauwald and Frank Vondahlen for their support during the manufacture of the thermally sprayed samples, Dr. Doris Sebold for the SEM analysis of the coatings prepared with mixed powders, and Dr. Yoo Jung Sohn for the quantitative analysis of the XRD data (all Institute of Energy and Climate Research-Materials Synthesis and Processing (IEK-1), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH).

The Hector thunderstorms were observed in a variety of aerosol conditions so the data serve as an ideal dataset to test whether aerosols have a significant impact on the evolution of convective clouds and precipitation. We find evidence for an aerosol effect on the storm's properties, which are reproduced with a state-of-the-art mesoscale cloud-resolving model. Including the measured aerosol concentration within the model is shown to improve the fractions skill-score metric for every case presented in the article, thus giving us confidence that the deep convection observed during the period was indeed influenced by the aerosol entering the storm's inflow. However, we do not find a general relationship for the way aerosols affect properties such as cloud-top height, precipitation or radiative properties, as has been suggested in previous work. The reasons for this appear to be because of the nonlinearity of interactions between neighbouring cells and because of the variability in the meteorological profiles of temperature, wind and humidity.","[Connolly, P.

It is a continuous Galerkin spectral finite-element method designed for fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes. The current configurations in CAM are based on the cubed-sphere grid. The main motivation for including a spectral element dynamical core is to improve the scalability of CAM by allowing quasi-uniform grids for the sphere that do not require polar filters. In addition, the approach provides other state-of-the-art capabilities such as improved conservation properties. Spectral elements are used for the horizontal discretization, while most other aspects of the dynamical core are a hybrid of well-tested techniques from CAM's finite volume and global spectral dynamical core options. Here we first give an overview of the spectral element dynamical core as used in CAM. We then give scalability and performance results from CAM running with three different dynamical core options within the Community Earth System Model, using a pre-industrial time-slice configuration.

As a result, Energy Performance Certificates have been designed as important evaluation and rating criterion to increase the retrofit rate in the EU and Germany. Yet, today's most frequently used and legally required methods to quantify building energy performance show low prediction accuracy, as recent research reveals. To enhance prediction accuracy, the research community introduced data-driven methods which obtained promising results. However, there are no insights in how far Energy Quantification Methods are particularly suited for energy performance prediction. In this research article the data-driven methods Artificial Neural Network, D-vine copula quantile regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression are compared with and validated by real-world Energy Performance Certificates of German residential buildings issued by qualified auditors using the engineering method required by law. The results, tested for robustness and systematic bias, show that all data-driven methods exceed the engineering method by almost 50% in terms of prediction accuracy. In contrast to existing literature favoring Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression, all tested methods show similar prediction accuracy with marginal advantages for Extreme Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression in terms of prediction accuracy. Given the higher prediction accuracy of data-driven methods, it seems appropriate to revise the current legislation prescribing engineering methods. In addition, data-driven methods could support different organizations, e.g., asset management, in decision-making in order to reduce financial risk and to cut expenses.","[Wenninger, Simon] Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Wenninger, Simon; Wiethe, Christian] Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Wiethe, Christian] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Wenninger, S (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",simon.wenninger@fim-rc.de,,"Wenninger, Simon/0000-0002-7565-3562",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,59,10,10,1,9,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",2363-7005,1867-0202,,BUS INFORM SYST ENG+,Bus.

J,"Yang, W; Karspeck, A; Shaman, J",,,,"Yang, Wan; Karspeck, Alicia; Shaman, Jeffrey",,,Comparison of Filtering Methods for the Modeling and Retrospective Forecasting of Influenza Epidemics,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENSEMBLE; INFERENCE,"A variety of filtering methods enable the recursive estimation of system state variables and inference of model parameters. These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology. For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.g. forecast, parameter estimation, etc.). Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity. Three particle filtersa basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)and three ensemble filtersthe ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence. The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003-2012, for 115 cities in the United States. Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks. For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1-5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past. Author Summary Influenza, or the flu, is a significant public health burden in the U.S. that annually causes between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths. Predictions of influenza, if reliable, would provide public health officials valuable advanced warning that could aid efforts to reduce the burden of this disease. For instance, medical resources, including vaccines and antiviral drugs, can be distributed to areas in need well in advance of peak influenza incidence. Recent applications of statistical filtering methods to epidemiological models have shown that accurate and reliable influenza forecast is possible; however, many filtering methods exist, and the performance of any filter may be application dependent. Here we use a single epidemiological modeling framework to test the performance of six state-of-the-art filters for modeling and forecasting influenza. Three of the filters are particle filters, commonly used in scientific, engineering, and economic disciplines; the other three filters are ensemble filters, frequently used in geophysical disciplines, such as numerical weather prediction. We use each of the six filters to retrospectively model and forecast seasonal influenza activity during 2003-2012 for 115 cities in the U.S. We report the performance of the six filters and discuss potential strategies for improving real-time influenza prediction.","[Yang, Wan; Shaman, Jeffrey] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Karspeck, Alicia] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Columbia University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Yang, W (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",wy2202@columbia.edu,"Yang, Wan/K-7592-2013","Yang, Wan/0000-0002-7555-9728","US NIH [GM100467]; NIH [1U54GM088558]; NIEHS Center [ES009089]; RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate; US Department of Homeland Security; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES [P30ES009089] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [U54GM088558, R01GM100467] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",US NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIEHS Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate; US Department of Homeland Security(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"Funding was provided by US NIH grant GM100467 (WY, AK, JS) as well as the NIH Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study program through cooperative agreement 1U54GM088558 (JS), NIEHS Center grant ES009089 (JS), and the RAPIDD program of the Science and Technology Directorate, US Department of Homeland Security (JS).

The approach includes the quantification of data input uncertainties in terms of their Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs), their sampling and the uncertainty propagation through Monte Carlo (MC) methods. A sensitivity analysis through Variance based decomposition (Sobol' method) techniques are used to point out the key parameters uncertainties that mostly affect the LCA results distributions. The paper presents a building case-study where the MC-based uncertainty and sensitivity analysis method is applied considering different design options (XPS and Cork internal insulation measures) and different scenarios for the assessment of the building energy need (use phase). Results obtained highlight that the differences on the Climate change environmental impact between the two design options is quite limited (about 12%) and this is mainly due to the use phase which is the more relevant input parameter on the overall result. Concerning the Sensitivity Analysis, when the building energy need is considered as a deterministic input in the LCA assessment, the unitary impacts of the design options materials uncertainties are the most influential parameters. On the other hands, when the building energy need is represented by a PDF, the quantity of energy carrier consumed and its unitary environmental impact are the most influential parameters on the output variance.

In this regard, electric vehicles are the utmost feasible solution. However, the commercialization of on-road electric vehicles faces multiple challenges such as an adequate number of charging stations availability, charging time and range anxiety. To overcome the issues of charging time and range anxiety, the energy storage system plays a vital role. Thus, in this paper, the various technological advancement of energy storage system for electric vehicle application has been covered which includes the support for the superiority of the Li-ion batteries in terms of various parameters. The various aspect such as expected futurist development in EV battery technology, capacity demand, battery sizing and life cycle of Li-ion batteries are well explained. Further, the details of the Battery management system with working and operation have been explained under the cell balancing, consistency, charging/discharging control, state of charge, state of health, and improved life span.

Each year these warnings guide life-saving assistance that reaches millions of people. A new NASA multimodel, remote sensing-based hydrological forecasting and analysis system, NHyFAS, has been developed to support such efforts by improving the FEWS NET's current early warning capabilities. NHyFAS derives its skill from two sources: (i) accurate initial conditions, as produced by an offline land modeling system through the application and/or assimilation of various satellite data (precipitation, soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage), and (ii) meteorological forcing data during the forecast period as produced by a state-of-the-art ocean-land-atmosphere forecast system. The land modeling framework used is the Land Information System (LIS), which employs a suite of land surface models, allowing multimodel ensembles and multiple data assimilation strategies to better estimate land surface conditions. An evaluation of NHyFAS shows that its 1-5-month hindcasts successfully capture known historic drought events, and it has improved skill over benchmark-type hindcasts. The system also benefits from strong collaboration with end-user partners in Africa and the Middle East, who provide insights on strategies to formulate and communicate early warning indicators to water and food security communities. The additional lead time provided by this system will increase the speed, accuracy, and efficacy of humanitarian disaster relief, helping to save lives and livelihoods.","[Arsenault, Kristi R.; Hazra, Abheera; Getirana, Augusto; McNally, Amy; Kumar, Sujay, V; Koster, Randal D.; Peters-Lidard, Christa D.; Jung, Hahn Chul; Wang, Shugong; Mocko, David M.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Arsenault, Kristi R.; McNally, Amy; Wang, Shugong; Mocko, David M.] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Reston, VA 20190 USA; [Shukla, Shraddhanand; Funk, Chris; Harrison, Laura; Husak, Gregory J.; Adoum, Alkhalil; Galu, Gideon; Magadzire, Tamuka] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Climate Hazards Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hazra, Abheera; Getirana, Augusto; Navari, Mahdi] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [McNally, Amy; Verdin, James P.] US Agcy Int Dev, Off Food Peace, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Zaitchik, Benjamin F.; Badr, Hamada] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Narapusetty, Bala] NOAA, INNOVIM, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD USA; [Funk, Chris] US Geol Survey, Ctr Earth Resources Observat & Sci, Sioux Falls, SD USA; [Adoum, Alkhalil] Famine Early Warning Syst Network, Niamey, Niger; [Galu, Gideon] Famine Early Warning Syst Network, Nairobi, Kenya; [Magadzire, Tamuka] Famine Early Warning Syst Network, Gaborone, Botswana; [Roningen, Jeanne] New Hampshire Dept Informat Technol, Concord, NH USA; [Roningen, Jeanne; Shaw, Michael; Eylander, John] US Army Corps Engineers, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Hanover, NH USA; [Bergaoui, Karim] Int Ctr Biosaline Agr, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Bergaoui, Karim] Natl Inst Meteorol, Tunis, Tunisia; [McDonnell, Rachael A.] Int Water Management Inst, Rome, Italy",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC); University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Johns Hopkins University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory (CRREL),"Arsenault, KR (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.;Arsenault, KR (corresponding author), Sci Applicat Int Corp, Reston, VA 20190 USA.",kristi.r.arsenault@nasa.gov,"Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012; Peters-Lidard, Christa D/E-1429-2012","Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383; Peters-Lidard, Christa D/0000-0003-1255-2876; Badr, Hamada/0000-0002-9808-2344; Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Funk, Chris/0000-0002-9254-6718",NASA Earth Science Applications: Water Resources program [13-WATER13-0010]; FEWS NET's NASA PAPA Water Availability Monitoring Activity; NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied Sciences) [80NSSC17K0625],NASA Earth Science Applications: Water Resources program; FEWS NET's NASA PAPA Water Availability Monitoring Activity; NASA Harvest Consortium (NASA Applied Sciences),"This work was supported by the NASA Earth Science Applications: Water Resources program, award 13-WATER13-0010 (PI: Peters-Lidard), and the FEWS NET's NASA PAPA Water Availability Monitoring Activity.

Falls are considered as major health hazards for both the elderly and people with neurodegenerative diseases. To mitigate the adverse consequences of falling, a great deal of research has been conducted, mainly focused on two different approaches, namely, fall detection and fall prevention. Required hardware for both fall detection and prevention are also available in SPs. Consequently, researchers' interest in finding SP-based solutions has increased dramatically over recent years. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published review on SP-based fall detection and prevention. Thus in this paper, we present the taxonomy for SP-based fall detection and prevention solutions and systematic comparisons of existing studies. We have also identified three challenges and three open issues for future research, after reviewing the existing articles. Our time series analysis demonstrates a trend towards the integration of external sensing units with SPs for improvement in usability of the systems.","[Habib, Mohammad Ashfak; Mohktar, Mas S.; Ibrahim, Fatimah] Univ Malaya, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Habib, Mohammad Ashfak; Mohktar, Mas S.; Kamaruzzaman, Shahrul Bahyah; Lim, Kheng Seang; Pin, Tan Maw; Ibrahim, Fatimah] Univ Malaya, CIME, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Habib, Mohammad Ashfak] Chittagong Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chittagong 4349, Bangladesh; [Kamaruzzaman, Shahrul Bahyah; Lim, Kheng Seang; Pin, Tan Maw] Univ Malaya, Dept Med, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET); Universiti Malaya,"Ibrahim, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",ashfak@siswa.um.edu.my; mas_dayana@um.edu.my; shahrulk@um.edu.my; kslimum@um.edu.my; mawpin@um.edu.my; fatimah@um.edu.my,"MOKHTAR, MAS SAHIDAYANA/B-5313-2010; Tan, Maw Pin/G-6917-2011; Kamaruzzaman, Shahrul Bahyah/B-9728-2010; LIM, KHENG SEANG/B-8863-2010; Habib, Mohammad Ashfak/F-3740-2014; IBRAHIM, FATIMAH/B-8506-2010; Kamaruzzaman, Shahrul Bahyah/Q-3189-2019","MOKHTAR, MAS SAHIDAYANA/0000-0001-7859-4396; Tan, Maw Pin/0000-0002-3400-8540; LIM, KHENG SEANG/0000-0002-2787-2365; Habib, Mohammad Ashfak/0000-0002-4140-0970; IBRAHIM, FATIMAH/0000-0003-1804-4362; ","University of Malaya (UM) High Impact Research (HIR) Grant from the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Malaysia [UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/ASH/02]; eScienceFund of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia [SF-017-2013]","University of Malaya (UM) High Impact Research (HIR) Grant from the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Malaysia; eScienceFund of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia)","This research is a part of the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) project which is fully funded by University of Malaya (UM) High Impact Research (HIR) Grant from the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Malaysia (UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/ASH/02) and is also supported by the eScienceFund of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia (SF-017-2013).",,112,136,141,0,62,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2014,4,,,,7181,7208,,10.3390/s140407181,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s140407181,,,28,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,AI3TB,24759116,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000336784600080,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forty-two publications were identified and included in the review following study selection and quality assessment steps. Extracted data from the publications were categorized in relation to five research questions. Approaches that were used to assess cognitive, normative, and relational learning outcomes of collaborative serious games were subsequently identified based on the categorizations. As a result, these approaches distinguished between the nature of learning in the assessment of collaborative serious games. Combined, these approaches provide an overview of how to assess social learning outcomes of collaborative serious games, including the methods and procedures that can be used, and may serve as a reference for scholars designing and evaluating collaborative serious games.","[den Haan, Robert-Jan; van der Voort, Mascha C.] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Dept Design Prod & Management, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522NB Enschede, Netherlands",,"den Haan, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Dept Design Prod & Management, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522NB Enschede, Netherlands.",r.j.denhaan@utwente.nl; m.c.vandervoort@utwente.nl,,"den Haan, Robert-Jan/0000-0001-6255-1789; van der Voort, Mascha/0000-0002-4800-7557",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) - Ministry of Economic Affairs [P12-14],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) - Ministry of Economic Affairs,"This research is part of the research programme RiverCare: towards self-sustaining multifunctional rivers, supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and partly funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs under grant number P12-14 (Perspective Programme).",,95,39,39,7,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2018,12,,,,,,4529,10.3390/su10124529,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124529,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HG9OL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000455338100195,View Full Record in Web of Science

The shipping sector is also one of the industries that emits GHG, including carbon. One way to reduce GHG emissions in the shipping sector is to use shore power (SP) rather than auxiliary engines during berthing. Port authorities are actively expanding SP facilities because it is possible to achieve the long-term goals of environmental benefits and green ports. However, the low economic feasibility of SP is a stumbling block for ship operators. Therefore, in this study, an economic analysis of SP use was conducted by container-ship size from the perspective of ship operators in consideration of benefits from differences in fuel oil and electricity prices, benefits through carbon emission reduction, and incentives from the port authorities. The result of the analysis showed that the benefit from the price of oil as well as the converted benefit from carbon emission reduction increased according to the size of the vessels. The economic analysis of a single port confirmed that small ships providing feeder services presented economic feasibility due to low installation costs and increased number of calls, while insufficient economic feasibility was presented for large ships above the old Panamax class due to the increased costs for installation. However, economic feasibility differs widely depending on whether port incentives are provided, and it was estimated that even large ships will be able to secure the economic feasibility of using SP if additional calls are made to ports that provide similar policy advantages.","[Kim, Kyunghwan] Korea Inst Maritime & Fisheries Technol, Busan 49111, South Korea",,"Kim, K (corresponding author), Korea Inst Maritime & Fisheries Technol, Busan 49111, South Korea.",anchormind@gmail.com,,"Kim, Kyunghwan/0000-0002-9970-9794",,,,,52,1,1,16,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

Over the past twenty-five years, hundreds of articles have addressed the topic of hybrid systems considering different configurations and final uses and, over the past decades, many reviews have made a comprehensive summary of various results obtained. However, some reviews deal with the research in a too general and qualitative way, without providing quantitative data, and other reviews are too focused on a specific topic aspect. To provide a qualitative-quantitative prospect of the research trend in the last twenty-five years, the present work is aimed at carrying out a literature review and statistical analysis starting from data extracted from the 550 most relevant and recent articles concerning hybrid systems, published between 1995 and 2020. The review aim was to produce an upgradable matrix literature database that schematizes the content of all articles in terms of different categories, such as the geographical distribution, their component configurations, operating mode and the auxiliary components used to support it, their intended uses and study methodologies (simulation, experimental, economic, energy, environmental and social analysis etc.) and software used. In addition, all the optimization algorithm, energy, economic, environmental and social indicators available in the literature were extracted and elaborated to identify the most used. The 550 articles were analysed, compared, and classified into several categories to provide an overall framework of the state of the art. The objective is to clearly and appropriately show important trends and findings in the development of hybrid wind and solar PV experimental, simulation and optimization projects. Data are elaborated to obtain a statistical analysis for each category or a combination of categories. In particular, the analysis highlighted that research is more focused on testing systems in warm or temperate localities, with the Ko?ppen climate groups B and C prevalent over the others. From the geographical point of view, Asia is the continent most involved in world research (with China, India and Iran the first three countries for total publications produced). However, also in other parts of the world, a growing interest was noticed in this technology. The prevalent tested system configuration mode is the stand-alone hybrid systems, in a wide variety of climates and especially for residential uses. Simulations are mostly implemented in the analysed publications, mainly through HOMER and MATLAB software. Parametric analysis is widely used for optimal system design with a large variety of techniques. In particular, the system performance is examined mostly from an energy point of view. Economic analysis is also very common, alone or in combination with energy analysis. The most frequently used optimization algorithms are the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), while the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and renewable fraction (RE) for the energy analysis, the net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) for the economic analysis and the emissions (E) of CO2 for the environmental analysis are most widespread indicators. Finally, an analysis on the size of the system components is performed to study which renewable source is more preferred at low and high installed power, for stand alone, grid-connected systems and overall, considering different intended uses. The analysis highlights that PV systems are preferred at low installed powers, especially for residential use and stand-alone mode, while wind systems, in addition to being extensively used for low installed powers, demonstrates higher employment compared to PV systems as the power increases. The paper findings and upgradable matrix literature database are proposed as a valuable tool for engineers, experts and national and international policymakers.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This follows from the fact that engines are required to operate under increasingly harsh conditions in all kind of gas turbine applications following the demands for higher efficiency and operational flexibility. While the understanding of the mechanism of CMAS induced degradation of TBCs as well as approaches for mitigation of CMAS attack by means of advanced TBC compositions have grown remarkably, most of the reported results have been obtained from lab testing at isothermal conditions or from evaluation of ex-service components, either. The isothermal tests are not reproducing important thermomechanical effects from service conditions, and it may be hard to figure out the thermal history of the ex-service examples. In this study a burner rig facility has been used for the evaluation of TBC performance, where a thermal gradient is applied across the TBC at cyclic load and CMAS is continuously injected to the combustion environment to simulate the conditions closer to actual service in an engine while allowing control of important degradation limiting parameters. Tests have been performed on the state of the art material YSZ while loading parameters as high temperature dwell time and CMAS deposition rate have been varied. Tests have been evaluated in terms of chemical degradation, failure mode and TBC spallation lifetime by means of SEM, EDS and XRD. Test conditions and relevance to in-service operating conditions are discussed. Major impacts on thermal gradient cycling lifetime and similarities and discrepancies related to reported failure mechanism are reviewed.

However, the performance of lithium-ion batteries used in EVs is known to deteriorate at low temperatures. Hence, preheating of EV batteries becomes imperative in cold climates. In the present paper, a potassium carbonate salt hydrate-based Thermochemical Energy Storage System (TESS) is proposed for battery preheating. The Energy Storage Bed (ESB) is a reactor of this system in which hydration-dehydration reactions take place. The ESB is envisioned as a modular design that presents the advantage of scalability for different EV variants and ambient conditions. A 2-D model of ESB is developed and its performance is analysed by various parametric studies. The proposed TESS achieves cycle efficiency of 47.1 %, volumetric energy storage density of 153.4 kWh m- 3, and specific heating power of 88.6 W kg- 1. Further, the analysis is extended to study the temporal variation in the battery temperature of an electric car by the addition of the proposed TESS to the existing heating architecture. The effect of various parameters associated with the heating circuit, on the evolution of battery temperature is also studied. Using the proposed TESS, a heating rate of 0.43 degrees C min- 1 can be achieved for battery preheating of a typical electric passenger car.","[Chate, Akshay; Dutta, Pradip] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Mech Engn, Bangalore 560012, India; [Murthy, Srinivasa S.] Indian Inst Sci, Interdisciplinary Ctr Energy Res, Bangalore 560012, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Murthy, SS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Interdisciplinary Ctr Energy Res, Bangalore 560012, India.",ssmurthy@iitm.ac.in,,,,,,,63,0,0,5,5,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1359-4311,1873-5606,,APPL THERM ENG,Appl.

Biodesign integrates living organisms into designed solutions and can offer opportunities for new kinds of technologies to facilitate a transition to the home of the future. Many families have had to learn to work alongside each other, and technology has mediated a transition from standard models of operation for industries. These are the challenges of the 21st century that mandate careful thinking around interactive systems and innovations that support new ways of living and working at home. In this workshop, we will explore opportunities for biodesign interactive systems in the future home. We will bring together a broad group of researchers in HCI, design, and biosciences to build the biodesign community and discuss speculative design futures.

The sources of riverine Hg across the Mackenzie River basin (MRB) are uncertain, which leads to a poor understanding of potential future release. Measurements of dissolved and particulate mercury (DHg, PHg) and carbon (DOC, POC) concentration were performed, along with analyses of Hg stable isotope ratios (incl. Delta 199Hg, delta 202Hg), radiocarbon content (Delta 14C) and optical properties of DOC of river water. Isotopic ratios of Hg revealed a closer association to terrestrial Hg reservoirs for the particulate fraction, while the dissolved fraction was more closely associated with atmospheric deposition sources of shorter turnover time. There was a positive correlation between the Delta 14C-OC and riverine Hg concentration for both particulate and dissolved fractions, indicating that waters transporting older-OC (14C-depleted) also contained higher levels of Hg. In the dissolved fraction, older DOC was also associated with higher molecular weight, aromaticity and humic content, which are likely associated with higher Hg-binding potential. Riverine PHg concentration increased with turbidity and SO4 concentration. There were large contrasts in Hg concentration and OC age and quality among the mountain and lowland sectors of the MRB, which likely reflect the spatial distribution of various terrestrial Hg and OC reservoirs, including weathering of sulfate minerals, erosion and extraction of coal deposits, thawing permafrost, forest fires, peatlands, and forests.

The model was parameterized by virtue of data for dry matter yield, leaf area index, root mass, soil mineral N uptake and biological N fixation from a long-term field trial in north-eastern Switzerland. It was tested using 5 years of independent data for yield and clover fraction from a field experiment with two management regimes carried out on the Swiss Central Plateau. The results of transient simulations indicated that under intensive fertilization grass dominance was initiated by preferential allocation of assimilates to the roots. The rapid growth of the grass root system lowered the substrate C:N ratio, favouring carbon allocation to the shoot, which eventually provided competitive advantages with respect to light interception. Under extensive management, limited N acquisition capacity of the grass root system maintained preferential allocation to the roots, limiting shoot development in the grass and leading to clover dominance. Co-existence regimes with dominance by one of the components were also found in equilibrium experiments, with a transition regime from clover to grass dominance for annual N applications in the range 100-200 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) that reflected adjustments of the root system to fertilization. It is concluded that the dynamics of grass/clover mixtures is driven by negative and positive feedbacks in the soil-plant system that are strongly controlled by root development and therefore by the allocation patterns of the grass component.

Implementation of green policies is, however, not free from obstacles. This research investigated the critical barriers to green human resource management (GHRM) implementation among Ghanaian firms. Seventeen barriers were identified and subsequently categorized into five major barriers. An interview was conducted with twenty human resource and environmental management professionals to pre-test the survey items. Later, one hundred and nineteen questionnaires were administered to selected chief executive officers (19), human resource managers (30), chief financial officers (30), and heads of employees (40) in selected firms. The Preference selection index (PSI) method was applied to rank the major barriers and sub-barriers. The economic barrier accounted for 23.3% of GHRM hindrances in the study area. Overall, the lack of financial resources scored (0.999), and emerged as the most critical barrier within the sub-barriers. The political and regulatory barrier (20.1%) came second, while the culture and education barrier (18.2%) ranked lowest. To mitigate the most critical barriers, the government and financial institutions can provide funding opportunities in the form of low-interest loans to organizations to design and implement green corporate policies and strategies. This paper adds to the existing green human resource management literature by investigating and analyzing GHRM implementation barriers within a developing country setting. This provides policy makers and practitioners with knowledge in designing suitable policies to counter environmental innovation obstacles and thereby promote GHRM implementation in Ghana and in similar economies.","[Kodua, Lois Tweneboa; Xiao, Yuchun; Ofosu, Bright Okyere; Amankona, David] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Business Adm, 18 Xuezheng St,Xiasha Higher Educ Pk, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Adjei, Nana Osae] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Educ, PMB Univ Post Off, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Asante, Dennis] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Med & Publ Hlth Rural & Remote Hlth, GPO BOX 852, Renmark, SA 5341, Australia",Zhejiang Gongshang University; University of Cape Coast; Flinders University South Australia,"Xiao, YC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Business Adm, 18 Xuezheng St,Xiasha Higher Educ Pk, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",loiskodua32@outlook.com; xiaoyuchun2006@126.com,"Asante, Dennis/GVU-8611-2022","AMANKONA, DAVID/0000-0003-0907-3399; Asante, Dennis/0000-0001-6966-7354","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074195]; Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education, China [19YJA630092]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education, China","Funding information This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72074195) and Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education, China (No. 19YJA630092) .",,65,3,3,16,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Our aim was to use stable carbon isotopes as indicators of palsa degradation. Depth profiles of stable carbon isotopes generally reflect organic matter dynamics in soils with an increase of delta C-13 values during aerobic decomposition and stable or decreasing delta C-13 values with depth during anaerobic decomposition. Stable carbon isotope depth profiles of undisturbed and degraded sites of hummocks as well as hollows at three palsa peatlands in northern Sweden were used to investigate the degradation processes. The depth patterns of stable isotopes clearly differ between intact and degraded hummocks at all sites. Erosion and cryoturbation at the degraded sites significantly changes the stable carbon isotope depth profiles. At the intact hummocks the uplifting of peat material by permafrost is indicated by a turning in the delta C-13 depth trend, and this assessment is supported by a change in the C / N ratios. For hollows isotope patterns were less clear, but some hollows and degraded hollows in the palsa peatlands show differences in their stable carbon isotope depth profiles indicating enhanced degradation rates.

As the selective pressures imposed by this environment determine the fate of cancer cells, an improved understanding of how this ecosystem evolves will better elucidate how tumors grow and respond to therapy. State of the art imaging methods can now provide highly resolved descriptions of the microenvironment, yielding the data required for a thorough study of its role in tumor growth and treatment resistance. The field of landscape ecology has been studying such species-environment relationship for decades, and offers many tools and perspectives that cancer researchers could greatly benefit from. Here, we discuss one such tool, species distribution modeling (SDM), that has the potential to, among other things, identify critical environmental factors that drive tumor evolution and predict response to therapy. SDMs only scratch the surface of how ecological theory and methods can be applied to cancer, and we believe further integration will take cancer research in exciting new and productive directions.Significance:Here we describe how species distribution modeling can be used to quantitatively describe the complex relationship between tumor cells and their microenvironment. Such a description facilitates a deeper understanding of cancers eco-evolutionary dynamics, which in turn sheds light on the factors that drive tumor growth and response to treatment.","[Gatenbee, Chandler D.; Anderson, Alexander R.

For science missions, customized payload electronics have to be developed, depending on measurement tasks and requirements. Especially for the deployment of complex remote sensing payloads, state-of-the-art performance is needed to provide operational control and specific data processing, e.g., for image sensors. Highly integrated system-on-module (SoM) architectures offer low resource requirements regarding power and mass, but moderate to high processing power capabilities. However, a requirement to use a standard SoM in a satellite is to quantify its radiation tolerance. The radiation environment has been modeled, estimating the hazards at module level and reducing the risks to an acceptable level by applying appropriate mitigation techniques. This approach results in a sensor electronics design that combines hardware and software redundancies to assure system availability and reliability for long-life science missions in low earth orbits. Integrated in a miniaturized limb sounding instrument for atmospheric remote sensing imaging, the payload electronics will be deployed on a technology demonstration satellite for in-orbit verification.

Recent statistics show that the building sector is the main contributor to the world total energy consumption, which makes it responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Several studies have been carried out to design buildings focusing on reducing their energy consumption and improving occupants' comfort. This study focused on the impact of parameters influencing the seasonal transition periods (STPs) and annual energy consumption through numerical simulations in residential buildings. For this purpose, the thermal performance of six different wall constructions with similar U values under different ventilation rates was investigated. In addition, the effect on building heating and cooling loads during spring and autumn STPs in buildings with diurnal occupation patterns in hot, arid climates was studied. A small building located in Tehran, Iran, was selected as a case study model and simulated as the reference building. The results showed that Wall 4 with an effective surface mass of 249 kg/m(2) had the best performance in reducing energy consumption and had a significant effect on STPs. When Wall 2's ventilation rate reached 10 ach (air changes per hour), its impact on STPs was significant within the 60 days of the autumn transition period. The effect of natural ventilation on STPs was minimal for Wall 4. It was also found that a 5 ach ventilation rate was the most appropriate for this period.","[Memarian, Sina; Fayaz, Rima] Univ Art, Dept Architecture & Energy, Tehran 1136813518, Iran; [Kari, Behrouz Mohammad] Bldg & Housing Res Ctr, Tehran 1463917151, Iran; [Asadi, Somayeh] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, University Pk, PA 16801 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Asadi, S (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, University Pk, PA 16801 USA.",sina.memarian@yahoo.com; asadi@engr.psu.edu,"Fayaz, Rima/ABF-1607-2021; Asadi, Somayeh/AEP-1055-2022",,,,,,37,2,2,1,4,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0431,1943-5568,,J ARCHIT ENG,J.

To capture the high spatial and temporal variability of constituent transport and residence times in the critical zone (between the bedrock and canopy) of these altered landscapes, both storm event and continuous measurements are needed. The Intensively Managed Landscapes Critical Zone Observatory (IML-CZO) is comprised of three highly characterized, well instrumented, and representative watersheds (i.e., Clear Creek, Iowa; Upper Sangamon River, Illinois; and Minnesota River, Minnesota). It is organized to quantify the heterogeneity in structure and dynamic response of critical zone processes to human activities in the context of the glacial and management (anthropogenic) legacies. Observations of water, sediment, and nutrients are made at nested points of the landscape in the vertical and lateral directions during and between storm events (i.e., continuously). The measurements and corresponding observational strategy are organized as follows. First, reference measurements from surface soil and deep core extractions, geophysical surveys, lidar, and hyperspectral data, which are common across all Critical Zone Observatories, are available. The reference measurements include continuous quantification of energy, water, solutes, and sediment fluxes. The reference measurements are complemented with event-based measurements unique to IML-CZO. These measurements include water table fluctuations, enrichment ratios, and roughness as well as bank erosion, hysteresis, sediment sources, and lake/floodplain sedimentation. The coupling of reference and event-based measurements support testing of the central hypothesis (i.e., system shifts from transformer to transporter in IML-CZO due to the interplay between management and weather/climate). Data collected since 2014 are available through a data repository and through the Geodashboard interface, which can be used for process-based model simulations.","[Wilson, Christopher G.; Abban, Benjamin; Giannopoulos, Christos; Zhou, Shengnan; Papanicolaou, A.

Nevertheless, most existing GCN-based community detection approaches are semi-supervised and local structure-aware, even though community detection is an unsupervised learning problem essentially. In this paper, we develop a novel GCN method for unsupervised community detection under the framework of mutual information (MI) maximization, called UCDMI. Specifically, a novel MI maximization mechanism is developed to capture more fine-grained information of the global network structure in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, a new aggregation function is proposed for GCN to distinguish the importance between different neighboring nodes, which enables our method to identify more high-quality node representations and improve the community detection performance.

The simulation days are selected in the year 2009 and according to four environmental regimes defined by the daily flow direction (Ragi et al. (IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens 55:3466-3474, 2017)) using QuikSCAT scatterometer and the comparison of the same with National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) final analysis (FNL) data. The observations used for analysis are from Indian Meteorological Department, Wyoming, TRMM satellite data, and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. This study finds that WRF is capable of reproducing the season-specific differences in the precipitating patterns that reflect the different phases of the monsoon. Extensive comparisons to observations point out that the model simulates reasonably well the temperature and the humidity fields, including their diurnal variability and vertical structure. However, the model-produced precipitation and winds do not compare so well, especially the winds. The simulated large-scale monsoon circulation and rainfall patterns indicate a wet bias in the model rainfall simulations than the TRMM rainfall observations over the selected region. In particular, WRF overestimates the rain. The base variables such as outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), latent and sensible heat fluxes, and convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition energy (CIN) are nearly in agreement with the observations. In effect, WRF is skilled to represent the variability in different seasons and its spatial distribution, an important characteristic of the precipitation, especially concerning prediction of the monsoon onset. The disagreements between the observed and the model precipitation and winds can be due to the WRF model physics which generates different dynamics and different precipitating systems and initial conditions.","[Ragi, A.

Currently, no observation systems nor model forecasts provide relevant information with a high sampling rate in both space and time. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite systems deliver HR sea surface fields, with a spatial resolution below 0.01., but they are also characterized by a large revisit time up 7 to 10 days for temperate zones. Meanwhile, operational model predictions typically involve a high temporal resolution (e.g., every 6 h), but also a low spatial resolution (0.5 degrees). With a view to leve-raging both data sources, we investigate statistical downscaling schemes. In this study, a new model based on a machine learning method, namely support vector regression (SVR), is built to reconstruct HR sea surface wind fields from low-resolution operational model forecasts. The considered case study off Norway demonstrates the relevance of the proposed SVR model. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches [namely, linear, analog, and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) downscaling models] in terms of mean square error. It also realistically reproduces complex space-time variabilities of the observed SAR wind fields. We further discuss the SVR model as a generalization of the popular linear and analog models.","[He, Liyun; Chapron, Bertrand; Tournadre, Jean] IFREMER, Lab Oceanog Space, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Fablet, Ronan] Telecom Bretagne, SC, F-29280 Brest, France",Ifremer; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique,"He, LY (corresponding author), IFREMER, Lab Oceanog Space, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",liyun.he@gmail.com; ronan.fablet@telecom-bretagne.eu; bertrand.chapron@ifremer.fr; Jean.Tournadre@ifremer.fr,"tournadre, jean/F-8402-2010; fablet, ronan/L-5574-2019","tournadre, jean/0000-0003-1159-4388; fablet, ronan/0000-0002-6462-423X",,,,,36,7,7,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

A 23-acre peninsula on the east side of the Hudson at Beacon, New York, the site includes the Peter J. Sharp Park and the Klara Sauer Hudson River Trail. Two decades in the making, beginning in 1997, it took a decade to plan and remediate, and, by its completion in early 2017, it will have taken just as long to build and recover. In 1997, nonprofit Scenic Hudson, the largest environmental and land preservation group focused on the Hudson River Valley, started assembling the different ownership parcels of the Long Dock site. From 1999 to 2003, they engaged the Beacon community through a series of community meetings and workshops to articulate its vision for its waterfront and cleanup of the site began. From 2003 to 2007, the design team developed the architectural and site program for the project, restoration measures, and its physical expression with the client. Working with the City and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the project completed the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR) process, filing a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and received approval of the final EIS ensuring that there was significant environmental, social, or economic value. The NYSDEC and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) were also directly involved in oversight of the brownfield remediation and work within the Hudson River and site wetlands. With the SEQR process complete and approval of a mitigation plan from the USACE, the team worked with the City of Beacon to complete the site plan application process for construction. Our mandate was clear from the startbuild resilience, but realize it incrementally. The project's first phase, opened in 2009, included additional remediation and removal of contaminated soils, removal of invasive species, stabilization of the south shoreline, a test plot for different materials, a wetland boardwalk and interior pathways, installation of native plantings, and site-specific artwork. By 2014, the landscape's multiple character zones were complete: the established meadow, the connective network of trails and boardwalks, the working site infrastructure of wetlands with swales and seeps, the dynamic intertidal zone, and earthen buttresses. A new pavilion for kayak storage and rentals and an arts and environmental education center in the historic Red Barn were significant additions for the program and community engagement of the park (refer to Figure 1). Over the past summer of 2016, portions of the site originally designed as a LEED platinum eco-hotel and conference center are now being remediated and reconceived as a new civic plaza, amphitheater, overlook west deck, boardwalk at Quiet Harbor, and a shade structure with an area for food trucks. Long Dock Park will continue to adjust and adapt to changing circumstances of ecology, climate change, flooding and sea level rise, and culture. Our original goals of renewing and revealing the historic waterfront, increasing public access to the river, restoring degraded environmental conditions, and demonstrating exemplary, environmentally sensitive development-these are complete. And the park was one of the first pilot projects for the Sustainable-SITES certification program and subsequently received SITES's highest rating of a SITES project at the time. Even as we considered program, spatial organization, and aesthetics, our work also sought to create in Long Dock a functional and sustainable ecosystem. The park's design needed to initiate natural processes for the degraded post-industrial brownfield to function and sustain ecosystem services that had not existed before. The design of healthy soils, the integration of hydrology, and the establishment of native plant communities form the true story of the site's transformation from postindustrial ruin into a significant waterfront park.","[Moyles, Chris] Reed Hilderbrand LLC, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Craul, Timothy] Craul Land Scientists Inc, State Coll, PA USA",,"Moyles, C (corresponding author), Reed Hilderbrand LLC, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,4,65,COLLEGE PUBLISHING,GLEN ALLEN,"12309 LYNWOOD DR, GLEN ALLEN, VA 23059 USA",1552-6100,1943-4618,,J GREEN BUILD,J.

The number of intact and easily discoverable UCH sites is decreasing due to excavation in China. To conduct active surveys for mapping archaeological sites, rather than mapping based only on incidental reported finds from fishing operations, a regional archaeological underwater survey method is proposed according to independent geographical units and historical archives. This method is based on the approach used for systematic regional archaeological surveys on land and comprehensively examines similar survey examples. Old port districts, sea routes, fishing zones and naval battle areas are potential targets for this method. From 2012 to 2017, the survey method performed well when applied in the Haitan Strait, China, discovering intact sites, fragmented shipwrecks and numerous interfering objects. The method needs further refinement to eliminate interference and to obtain more detailed information about UCH. The main steps in this method include the selection of potential wreck site areas, the use of sequential equipment and survey line design. Cooperation between archaeologists and surveyors is essential.","[Hu, Yi; Liu, Yipang; Liu, Boran] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yi] Fujian Prov Key Lab Marine Phys & Geol Proc, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yipang] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Adv Mfg, Quanzhou, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jianxiang] Shanghai Univ, Sch Cultural Heritage & Informat Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Chu, Zhongxin] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Geosci, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Fuzhou University; Shanghai University; Ocean University of China,"Hu, Y (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Ding, JX (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Sch Cultural Heritage & Informat Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",huyi@tio.org.cn; jxding1981@shu.edu.cn,,,Fujian Science and Technology Program Guiding Project [2022Y0070]; Ocean Public Welfare Scientific Research Project [201305038],Fujian Science and Technology Program Guiding Project; Ocean Public Welfare Scientific Research Project,"Fujian Science and Technology Program Guiding Project, Grant/Award Number: 2022Y0070; Ocean Public Welfare Scientific Research Project, Grant/Award Number: 201305038",,88,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1075-2196,1099-0763,,ARCHAEOL PROSPECT,Archaeol.

On the basis of material cultural patterns, including the style and material used in bridle cheek-pieces found in tombs of the late second and early first millennium BC, this paper points to a northern origin for Zhou horses. Important intermediaries, providing these horses, were the clans whose cemeteries have been identified on the northern edges of the Central Plains. The necessity for repeated exchanges bringing south horses from the north was a consequence of key environmental differences between the steppe and the Central Plains, including climate, geomorphology, essential soil nutrients, and land use. These created significant difficulties in sustainably breeding and pasturing horses of quality. As a result, the people of the Central Plains were bound, over millennia, to seek horses from the northwest, along a cultural corridor that also moved northern materials and technologies, such as gold-, iron- and some bronze-working, into the Central Plains from the steppes.","[Rawson, Jessica; Huan, Limin] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England; [Taylor, William Timothy Treal] Univ Colorado, Museum Nat Hist, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Oxford; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Rawson, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England.",jessica.rawson@merton.ox.ac.uk; limin.huan@arch.ox.ac.uk; william.taylor@colorado.edu,,,Merton College; Leverhulme Trust [F/08 735/G],Merton College; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"We have benefited greatly from collaboration with Konstantin Chugunov of the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg during his visit to Oxford in January 2019, funded by Merton College and Ian Taylor.

This was undertaken under the auspices of the Forum for Operational Oceanography Surface Waves Working Group. The main steps in the process were first, soliciting possible research questions from the community via an online survey; second, reviewing the questions at a face-to-face workshop; and third, online ranking of the research questions by individuals. This process resulted in 15 identified priorities, covering research activities and the development of infrastructure. The top five priorities are 1) enhanced and updated nearshore and coastal bathymetry; 2) improved understanding of extreme sea states; 3) maintain and enhance the in situ buoy network; 4) improved data access and sharing; and 5) ensemble and probabilistic wave modeling and forecasting. In this paper, each of the 15 priorities is discussed in detail, providing insight into why each priority is important, and the current state of the art, both nationally and internationally, where relevant. While this process has been driven by Australian needs, it is likely that the results will be relevant to other marine-focused nations.","[Greenslade, Diana; Aijaz, Saima; Allen, Stewart; Colberg, Frank;

With this aim, we analyzed ethnographic, bioclimatic and landscape data using habitat suitability models. The location of different types of archaeological sites was then compared with the projected models. The results for the current data show that the bioclimatic variables have a central role in determining the location of summer camp areas, showing a better capacity of explanation than the solely use of landscape variables as altitude. The projection of the bioclimatic model into the past showed significant temporal and spatial variation, although the archaeological sites are consistently localised in the limit between annually available and summer areas. For the Late Holocene, burial and rock art sites are mainly placed in areas available annually and in areas characterised as summer camps, respectively. Our findings show the usefulness of studying the ways of life and use of space of modern transhumant herders as a valid resource to generate hypotheses or expectations about the distribution of the archaeological sites from the same region.","[D'Abramo, Sergio L.] Univ Nacl La Plata UNLP, Lab Invest Etnog Aplicada LINEA, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo FCNyM, Comis Invest Cient CIC, La Plata, Argentina; [Cobos, Virginia A.; Perez, S.

Environmental risk assessment (ERA) is a process of estimating the probability and consequences of the adverse effects of human activities and other stressors on the environment. Bayesian networks (BNs) can synthesize different types of knowledge and explicitly account for the probabilities of different scenarios, therefore offering a useful tool for ERA. Their use in formal ERA practice has not been evaluated, however, despite their increasing popularity in environmental modeling. This paper reviews the use of BNs in ERA based on peer-reviewed publications. Following a systematic mapping protocol, we identified studies in which BNs have been used in an environmental risk context and evaluated the scope, technical aspects, and use of the models and their results. The review shows that BNs have been applied in ERA, particularly in recent years, and that there is room to develop both the model implementation and participatory modeling practices. Based on this review and the authors' experience, we outline general guidelines and development ideas for using BNs in ERA.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-17.

It is exploiting the relation between the attenuation of CML signal levels and the integrated rain rate along a CML path. The opportunistic nature of this method requires a sophisticated data processing using robust methods. In this study we focus on the processing step of rain event detection in the signal level time series of the CMLs, which we treat as a binary classification problem. This processing step is particularly challenging, because even when there is no rain, the signal level can show large fluctuations similar to that during rainy periods. False classifications can have a high impact on falsely estimated rainfall amounts. We analyze the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is trained to detect rainfall-specific attenuation patterns in CML signal levels, using data from 3904 CMLs in Germany. The CNN consists of a feature extraction and a classification part with, in total, 20 layers of neurons and 1.4 x 10(5) trainable parameters. With a structure inspired by the visual cortex of mammals, CNNs use local connections of neurons to recognize patterns independent of their location in the time series. We test the CNN's ability to recognize attenuation patterns from CMLs and time periods outside the training data. Our CNN is trained on 4 months of data from 800 randomly selected CMLs and validated on 2 different months of data, once for all CMLs and once for the 3104 CMLs not included in the training. No CMLs are excluded from the analysis. As a reference data set, we use the gauge-adjusted radar product RADOLAN-RW provided by the German meteorological service (DWD). The model predictions and the reference data are compared on an hourly basis. Model performance is compared to a state-of-the-art reference method, which uses the rolling standard deviation of the CML signal level time series as a detection criteria. Our results show that within the analyzed period of April to September 2018, the CNN generalizes well to the validation CMLs and time periods. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis shows that the CNN is outperforming the reference method, detecting on average 76% of all rainy and 97% of all nonrainy periods. From all periods with a reference rain rate larger than 0.6 mm h(-1), more than 90% was detected. We also show that the improved event detection leads to a significant reduction of falsely estimated rainfall by up to 51 %. At the same time, the quality of the correctly estimated rainfall is kept at the same level in regards to the Pearson correlation with the radar rainfall. In conclusion, we find that CNNs are a robust and promising tool to detect rainfall-induced attenuation patterns in CML signal levels from a large CML data set covering all of Germany.","[Polz, Julius; Chwala, Christian; Graf, Maximilian; Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Campus Alpin, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Chwala, Christian; Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Chair Reg Climate & Hydrol, Augsburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg,"Polz, J; Chwala, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Campus Alpin, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.;Chwala, C (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Chair Reg Climate & Hydrol, Augsburg, Germany.",julius.polz@kit.edu; christian.chwala@kit.edu,"Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013; Polz, Julius/AAT-8066-2020; Chwala, Christian/AAF-8283-2020; Graf, Maximilian/AAR-5986-2020","Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Polz, Julius/0000-0001-5910-3037; Chwala, Christian/0000-0002-4583-3327; Graf, Maximilian/0000-0003-2246-1273","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [CH 1785/1-1, KU 2090/7-2]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [13N14826]; Helmholtz Association [ZT-0025]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),"This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant nos.

Here we ask if phytoplankton species composition and their food quality based on the percentage of long-chain essential fatty acids (LCEFA) is another factor contributing to high secondary production in these ecosystems. We used long-term measurements of major phytoplankton taxonomic groups and estimated their content of LCEFA along the salinity gradient in coastal-estuarine ecosystems, with emphasis on Chesapeake Bay and the Baltic Sea, and an oceanic transect. Our data show that cyanobacteria with low nutritional quality often dominate at low-salinity regions, while intermediate to higher salinity regions produce diatoms and dinoflagellates that have a higher content of LCEFA and are thus a higher-quality food resource for consumers. Higher salinity regions have less pronounced seasonal changes in the percentage of phytoplankton LCEFA compared to low salinity regions, providing a stable supply of nutritious phytoplankton to consumers. The phytoplankton LCEFA content is similarly high in coastal upwelling systems and it decreases further offshore in oligotrophic oceanic regions dominated by picophytoplankton. Our results from a broad range of coastal-ecosystem types show that ecosystems at the land-sea interface provide a valuable service by producing phytoplankton enriched in the biochemicals essential for consumers. High primary production, coupled with high quality of that production, explain why the production of fish and shellfish is high where land and sea meet.","[Winder, Monika] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Carstensen, Jacob; Jakobsen, Hans H.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Roskilde, Denmark; [Galloway, Aaron W.

The findings indicated that an operative indoor temperature of 24-27 degrees C in summer and above 23 degrees C in winter could be considered to mark a thermally comfortable zone. Noticeably, older people preferred a warmer environment in both summer and winter, while the measurement results showed that the indoor operative temperature was lower, and the humidity was higher than the comfort standard for summer, which was confirmed by the occupant survey. The mean illuminance level could meet the national threshold; interestingly, there was a negative correlation between age groups and their satisfaction of natural lighting in winter. The mean street noise level was between 74-75 dB, exceeding the maximum 55 dB for neighborhoods. The street noise level was significantly negatively correlated with residents' satisfaction.

The calculations are based on the analytical footprint model by Kormann, R. and Meixner, FX [2001. An analytical footprint model for Non-neutral Stratification. Boundary-Layer Meteorology 99, 207-224]. The footprint density function of a flux sensor is determined using readily available data from standard eddy covariance measurements. This footprint density function is integrated over defined surface areas given as quadrangular polygons representing e.g. agricultural fields. We illustrate the use and performance of the tool by applying it to CO2 flux measurements with three eddy covariance system at the Swiss CarboEurope grassland site. Two flux towers were positioned in the centre of two neighbouring fields, respectively, that showed a very different CO2 flux during the study period. The third tower was located near the border of the two fields and was frequently influenced by both fields to a similar degree. The calculated footprint fractions were used to simulate the latter flux from the other two systems. The measured and simulated fluxes showed a good agreement and thus support the reliability of the footprint calculation. The presented simple footprint tool can be used as a routine quality check for flux monitoring stations influenced by surface areas with varying vegetation covers and/or land-use.

In the state of the art of fluid inclusion isotope research, however, there is a scarcity of reported inter-technique comparisons to account for possible analytical offsets. Along with improving analytical precisions and sample size limitations, interlaboratory comparisons can lead to a more robust application of fluid inclusion isotope records. Methods Mineral samples-including speleothem, travertine, and vein material-were analyzed on two newly setup systems for fluid inclusion isotope analysis to provide an inter-platform comparison. One setup uses a crusher unit connected online to a continuous-flow pyrolysis furnace and an isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) instrument. In the other setup, a crusher unit is lined up with a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) system, and water samples are analyzed on a continuous standard water background to achieve precisions on water injections better than 0.1 parts per thousand for delta O-18 values and 0.4 parts per thousand for delta H-2 values for amounts down to 0.2 mu L. Results Fluid inclusion isotope analyses on the IRMS setup have an average 1 sigma reproducibility of 0.4 parts per thousand and 2.0 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and delta H-2 values, respectively. The CRDS setup has a better 1 sigma reproducibility (0.3 parts per thousand for delta O-18 values and 1.1 parts per thousand for delta H-2 values) and also a more rapid sample throughput (<30 min per sample). Fluid inclusion isotope analyses are reproducible at these uncertainties for water amounts down to 0.1 mu L on both setups. Fluid inclusion isotope data show no systematic offsets between the setups. Conclusions The close match in fluid inclusion isotope results between the two setups demonstrates the high accuracy of the presented continuous-flow techniques for fluid inclusion isotope analysis. Ideally, experiments such as the one presented in this study will lead to further interlaboratory comparison efforts and the selection of suitable reference materials for fluid inclusion isotopes studies.","[de Graaf, Stefan; Vonhof, Hubert B.; Wassenburg, Jasper A.; Levy, Elan J.; Haug, Gerald H.] Max Planck Inst Chem, Climate Geochem Dept, Hahn Meitner Weg 1, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Weissbach, Therese; Kluge, Tobias] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany",Max Planck Society; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"de Graaf, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Climate Geochem Dept, Hahn Meitner Weg 1, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",stefan.graaf@mpic.de,,"De Graaf, Stefan/0000-0003-1054-1049; Vonhof, Hubert/0000-0002-0897-8244; Kluge, Tobias/0000-0001-7559-4737",,,,,55,13,13,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0951-4198,1097-0231,,RAPID COMMUN MASS SP,Rapid Commun.

The wind fields predicted by two state-of-the-art meteorological models, namely ECMWF and SKIRON, were used as forcing for a hydrodynamic and particle-tracking model applied to reproduce a set of observed drifters trajectories in a coastal area of the Mediterranean Sea. A set of anemometric data derived by in situ measurements were also adopted as model forcing to reproduce the observed drifter paths. This approach provided a baseline that was used as a reference for evaluating the effects of the predicted wind accuracy on the numerical model solution. The accuracy of the simulation results obtained using, as model forcing, the observed wind data was fair and suitable for most of the operational oceanographic purposes. It decreased when using the wind data predicted by the two meteorological models. In particular, the results obtained using ECMWF data were about 3 times more accurate than the ones obtained using SKIRON ones. The uncertainties were strongly dependent on the range of observed wind speed classes with a different behavior depending on the type of adopted wind data. Finally, the amplification of the errors in predicting the sea surface transport generated by the inaccuracies of the predicted wind fields was quantified.","[Cucco, A.; Quattrocchi, Giovanni; Satta, A.; Antognarelli, F.] CNR, Inst Marine Coastal Environm, Oristano, Italy; [De Biasio, F.; Zecchetto, S.] CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Padua, Italy; [Cadau, E.] Sardegna Clima Onlus, Fonni, Italy; [Umgiesser, G.] CNR, Inst Marine Sci, Venice, Italy; [Umgiesser, G.] Klaipeda Univ, Open Access Ctr Marine Res, Klaipeda, Lithuania",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); Klaipeda University,"Cucco, A (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Marine Coastal Environm, Oristano, Italy.",andrea.cucco@cnr.it,"Quattrocchi, Giovanni/Q-3970-2018; cucco, andrea/B-4553-2012; Umgiesser, Georg/ABF-2127-2020; De Biasio, Francesco/ABA-6233-2020; ZECCHETTO, STEFANO/O-2523-2015","Quattrocchi, Giovanni/0000-0002-0020-1780; cucco, andrea/0000-0002-4469-2286; Umgiesser, Georg/0000-0001-9697-275X; De Biasio, Francesco/0000-0002-6250-9588; Antognarelli, Fabio/0000-0003-4126-1509; ZECCHETTO, STEFANO/0000-0003-4633-1238","Flagship Project RITMARE [SP3-WP4-AZ5]; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research within National Research Program","Flagship Project RITMARE; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research within National Research Program(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This research was funded by the Flagship Project RITMARE (SP3-WP4-AZ5)-The Italian Research for the Sea-coordinated by the Italian National Research Council and funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research within the National Research Program 2011-2013.

Shoreline rotation occurs when one end of a beach accretes, while the opposite retreats. This phenomenon is attributed to periodic or long-term changes in wave climate. To simulate the variability of the shoreline orientation in a simple and efficient way, the aim of this paper is to present a new equilibrium-based shoreline rotation model derived from a shoreline migration formulation. This model assumes that beach rotation is induced by the incoming wave power and direction. The proposed model was applied to two embayed beaches with different hydrodynamic and morphodynamic contexts located in the South Pacific Ocean. Almost fifteen years of shoreline positions extracted from hourly time-averaged images captured at Tairua Beach, New Zealand, and thirty-seven years of shoreline position data acquired from beach profile surveys at Narrabeen Beach, Australia, were used to evaluate the model performance. The results from the last beach have been compared and discussed with respect to an existing semi-empirical model, which has shown to successfully reproduce the time-varying shoreline rotation on embayed beaches. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully represents the general shoreline orientation variability both qualitatively and quantitatively. Nevertheless, observations from different sites with diverse beach characteristics and wave conditions are needed to broadly validate the proposed model.","[Jaramillo, Camilo; Gonzalez, Mauricio; Medina, Raul] Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, Avda Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain; [Turki, Imen] Univ Rouen, CNRS, UMR Continental & Coastal Morphodynam M2C 6143, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France",Universidad de Cantabria; IHCantabria - Instituto de Hidraulica Ambiental de la Universidad de Cantabria; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Jaramillo, C (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, Avda Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain.",jaramilloc@unican.es; mauricio.gonzalez@unican.es; raul.medina@unican.es; imen.turki@univ-rouen.fr,"CARDONA, CAMILO JARAMILLO/AAO-9110-2020; Medina, Raul/L-2456-2014","CARDONA, CAMILO JARAMILLO/0000-0002-0021-1014; Turki, Emma Imen/0000-0002-5919-2620; Medina, Raul/0000-0002-0126-2710","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness [BIA2017-89491-R]","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness under Grant BIA2017-89491-R (the Beach-Art Project).

Using network analysis, this paper comprehensively reviews ninety-eight years of peer-reviewed literature on gender and environmental activism. We identify six avenues of gendered artistic activism (or 'artivism') on environmental issues that communities have pursued in the past. We present a non-prescriptive description of each avenue based on key references in the literature. A gendered lens on artistic activism makes visible the power of different groups to act, be they women, men, LGBTQ or other collectives, their chosen (or available) scopes of creative action when engaging with environmental protection and their thematic foci. A highlight of the study is the significant presence of younger demographics, including children and students in environmental artivism.

The original field on the Swiss Central Plateau had been separated into two plots of equal size, one plot was subjected to intensive management with nitrogen inputs of 200 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and frequent cutting, and the other to extensive management with no fertilization and less frequent cutting. For both plots, net CO2 exchange (NEE) was monitored by the eddy covariance technique. and the flux data were submitted to extensive quality control and gap filling procedures. Cumulative NEE was combined with values for carbon export through biomass harvests and carbon import through application of liquid manure (intensive field only) to yield the annual net carbon balance of the grassland ecosystems. The intensive management was associated with an average net carbon sequestration of 147 (+/- 130) g C m(-2) year(-1), whereas the extensive management caused a non-significant net carbon loss of 57 (+130/-110) g C m(-2) year(-1) Despite the large uncertainty ranges for the two individual systems, the special design of the paired experiment led to a reduced error of the differential effect, because very similar systematic errors for both parallel fields could be assumed. The mean difference in the carbon budget over the 3-year study period was determined to be significant with a value of 204 (+/- 110) g C m(-2) year(-1). The difference occurred in spite of similar aboveground productivities and root biomass. Additional measurements of soil respiration under standardized laboratory conditions indicated higher rates of soil organic carbon loss through mineralization under the extensive management.

We explain theoretically the quasi-Rayleigh LDR peak at side-scattering angles typical of low-density soot fractals and conclude that the measurement of this feature enables one to evaluate the compactness state of BC clusters and trace the evolution of low-density fluffy fractals into densely packed aggregates. We show that small backscattering LDRs measured with ground-based, airborne, and spaceborne lidars for fresh smoke generally agree with the values predicted theoretically for fluffy BC fractals and densely packed near-spheroidal BC aggregates. To reproduce higher lidar LDRs observed for aged smoke, one needs alternative particle models such as shape mixtures of BC spheroids or cylinders.

The MiCNiT model explicitly calculates decomposition, dynamics of microbial biomass, denitrification, autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification, applying the microbial activity concept, as well as transport of gases and solutes between anaerobic and aerobic soil fractions and through the soil profile. The model was tested against N2O and CO2 emission as well as C and N pool data from the Hoglwald Forest, Germany.

In this context, the 'business as usual' approach to running businesses with negative environmental consequences is not an option. Industrial ecology and sustainable business models offer solutions on how this transformation can take place. However, transformation of non-manufacturing industries in this respect has not been covered in the literature. The aim of this paper is therefore is to use scientific and industry literature and interview data from the Nordic non-life insurance sector to propose closed-loop insurance models. The new models allow insurance leaders to move away from running the insurance business in an old-fashioned linear way, and thus gain a better understanding of how the business contributes to sustainable development. The transformation of insurers' business models is an example of how business models of non-manufacturing industries can be reinvented to support sustainable economic growth by utilizing ideas from industrial ecology. The new business models proposed place insurance business models within the overall research in industrial ecology, thereby filling an evident gap in the literature by showing that the closed-loop concept applies to non-manufacturers.

The risk of consecutive disasters will increase due to growing exposure, the interconnectedness of human society, and the increased frequency and intensity of nontectonic hazard. This paper provides an overview of the different types of consecutive disasters, their causes, and impacts. The impacts can be distinctly different from disasters occurring in isolation (both spatially and temporally) from other disasters, noting that full isolation never occurs. We use existing empirical disaster databases to show the global probabilistic occurrence for selected hazard types. Current state-of-the art risk assessment models and their outputs do not allow for a thorough representation and analysis of consecutive disasters. This is mainly due to the many challenges that are introduced by addressing and combining hazards of different nature, and accounting for their interactions and dynamics. Disaster risk management needs to be more holistic and codesigned between researchers, policy makers, first responders, and companies.","[de Ruiter, Marleen C.; Couasnon, Anais; Ward, Philip J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Homberg, Marc J.

Compared to earlier calculations by Clough and coworkers the model used a spherical atmosphere instead of a plane parallel atmosphere, updated spectroscopic parameters from HITRAN, and updated continuum parameterizations from Mlawer and coworkers. These modifications lead to a reduction in simulated OLR by approximately 4.1%, the largest part, approximately 2.5%, being due to the absence of the plane parallel approximation. As a simple application of the new model, the sensitivity of OLR to changes in humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature were investigated for different cloud-free atmospheric scenarios. It was found that for the tropical scenario a 20% change in humidity has a larger impact than a doubling of the carbon dioxide concentration. The sensitive altitude region for temperature and humidity changes is the entire free troposphere, including the upper troposphere where humidity data quality is poor. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The accuracy of developed datasets in terms of monthly runoff prediction was assessed using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for a wide range of river basins. The results show that accounting for R5 data for runoff reconstruction underpins a substantial gain in NSE of SOTA over the BASE dataset.

When the continuum absorption contribution is ignored because of the different implementations, residuals are generally in the sub-Kelvin range and smaller than 0.1 K for some window channels (and all atmospheric models and lbl codes). None of the three codes turned out to be perfect for all channels and atmospheres. Remaining discrepancies are attributed to different lbl optimization techniques, Lbl codes seem to have reached a maturity in the implementation of radiative transfer that the choice of the underlying physical models (line shape models, continua etc) becomes increasingly relevant.

Here we present and compare three 25-year present-day offline simulations with chemical mechanisms of different levels of complexity using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1.2 CAM-chem (CAM4): the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 4 (MOZART-4) mechanism, the Reduced Hydrocarbon mechanism, and the Super-Fast mechanism. We show that, for most regions and time periods, differences in simulated ozone chemistry between these three mechanisms are smaller than the model-observation differences themselves. The MOZART-4 mechanism and the Reduced Hydrocarbon are in close agreement in their representation of ozone throughout the troposphere during all time periods (annual, seasonal, and diurnal). While the Super-Fast mechanism tends to have higher simulated ozone variability and differs from the MOZART-4 mechanism over regions of high biogenic emissions, it is surprisingly capable of simulating ozone adequately given its simplicity. We explore the tradeoffs between chemical mechanism complexity and computational cost by identifying regions where the simpler mechanisms are comparable to the MOZART-4 mechanism and regions where they are not. The Super-Fast mechanism is 3 times as fast as the MOZART-4 mechanism, which allows for longer simulations or ensembles with more members that may not be feasible with the MOZART-4 mechanism given limited computational resources.","[Brown-Steiner, Benjamin; Prinn, Ronald] MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Brown-Steiner, Benjamin; Selin, Noelle E.; Prinn, Ronald] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Selin, Noelle E.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Selin, Noelle E.; Prinn, Ronald] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tilmes, Simone; Emmons, Louisa; Lamarque, Jean-Francois] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, 3450 Mitchell Lane, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Cameron-Smith, Philip] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Brown-Steiner, Benjamin] Atmospher & Environm Res, 131 Hartwell Ave, Lexington, MA 02421 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Atmospheric & Environmental Research,"Brown-Steiner, B (corresponding author), MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Brown-Steiner, B (corresponding author), MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Brown-Steiner, B (corresponding author), Atmospher & Environm Res, 131 Hartwell Ave, Lexington, MA 02421 USA.",bbrownst@aer.com,"Cameron-Smith, Philip/E-2468-2011; Selin, Noelle E/A-4158-2008; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Emmons, Louisa K/R-8922-2016","Cameron-Smith, Philip/0000-0002-8802-8627; Selin, Noelle E/0000-0002-6396-5622; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Emmons, Louisa K/0000-0003-2325-6212; Tilmes, Simone/0000-0002-6557-3569","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-94ER61937]; Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program - DOE Office of Science, Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Biological and Environmental Research; DOE by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; National Science Foundation","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program - DOE Office of Science, Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Biological and Environmental Research; DOE by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This model development work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Grant DE-FG02-94ER61937 to the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

The main cause for this is that renewable sources are often more abundant in geographical areas far away from the main demand centers, so new transmission lines are required to connect the new renewable energy capacity. In addition, by connecting different geographical zones, the transmission network could smooth the intermittency and the variability of renewable energy production. Thus, the changing energy landscape leads to a need to reinforce the transmission network through the Network Transmission Expansion Planning. Ideally, all the idiosyncrasies of the electricity system are considered in the operation and expansion planning process. However, several critical dimensions of the planning process are routinely ignored since they may introduce parameters that are difficult to quantify and complexity that state-of-the-art planning methods cannot handle. This paper identifies the most relevant elements related to the human factor, which have been grouped around the main topics: the human behind the technical, the human at the institutional level, and the human at the individual level.

Among them are production of clinker, lime and ammonia, blast furnace operations, refineries and others. The emission intensity of these installations is closely tied to the fuel type used. Global warming scenarios of 1.5 degrees C recently presented by the IPCC require fast emission reduction in all sectors until 2030, followed by deep reductions, reaching carbon neutrality around 2050. In this paper, the technical potential to use biomass and electricity with existing or available technologies in important industrial processes is reviewed. The investigated industries account for 95% of the total verified emissions in the EU ETS industrial sector 2015 and 64% of total industrial emissions of the EU28. We find that 34% (184 Mt) of these emissions could be avoided from a technical perspective until 2030 with fuel switch measures towards biomass and electricity. This reduction is in line with 1.5 degrees C global warming scenarios until 2030, but further effort is required beyond that. We also find that available options lack economic competitiveness under present conditions, e.g. due to high electricity prices. We conclude that, although considerable fast emission saving potential by switching to biomass and electricity are possible, deep decarbonisation in line with climate targets requires innovative production processes only available in the long term.","[Rehfeldt, M.; Eichhammer, W.; Fleiter, T.] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Rehfeldt, M.; Worrell, E.; Eichhammer, W.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Vening Meineszgebouw A, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Utrecht University,"Rehfeldt, M (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",Matthias.Rehfeldt@isi.fraunhofer.de; Wolfgang.Eichhammer@isi.fraunhofer.de; E.Worrell@uu.nl; Tobias.Fleiter@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Eichhammer, Wolfgang/AAF-7589-2020","Eichhammer, Wolfgang/0000-0002-2699-2410; Rehfeldt, Matthias/0000-0002-3132-0109",,,,,103,50,50,9,81,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Soil moisture is accordingly linked to T2M, and realistic soil moisture initialization has, in previous studies, been shown to improve the skill of subseasonal T2M forecasts. The relationship between soil moisture and evapotranspiration, however, is distinctly nonlinear, with ET tending to increase with soil moisture in drier conditions and to be insensitive to soil moisture variations in wetter conditions. Here, through an extensive analysis of subseasonal forecasts produced with a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast system, this nonlinearity is shown to imprint itself on T2M forecast error in the conterminous United States in two unique ways: (i) the T2M forecast bias (relative to independent observations) induced by a negative precipitation bias tends to be larger for dry initializations, and (ii) on average, the unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) tends to be larger for dry initializations. Such findings can aid in the identification of forecasts of opportunity; taken a step further, they suggest a pathway for improving bias correction and uncertainty estimation in subseasonal T2M forecasts by conditioning each on initial soil moisture state.","[Koster, Randal D.; Schubert, Siegfried D.; Molod, Andrea M.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [DeAngelis, Anthony M.; Schubert, Siegfried D.] Sci Syst & Applicat, Lanham, MD USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Koster, RD (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",randal.d.koster@nasa.gov,"Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012","Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383","NASA MAP program [NNG17HP01C, WBS802678.02.17.01.33]; NOAA MAPP program [NA14OAR4310221]",NASA MAP program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA MAPP program,"This work was supported by the NASA MAP (NNG17HP01C and WBS802678.02.17.01.33) and NOAA MAPP (NA14OAR4310221) programs.

Organic compounds undergo chemical and biological transformations when they interact with environmental matrices and biotic species; identifying the transformation products is thus a critical component of the risk assessment process. Here, we used zero valent iron (ZVI) to initiate the reduction of the diazo compound dye Disperse Yellow 7 (DY 7). Using state-of-the-art accurate mass Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-QToF-MS), four transformation products were conclusively identified, while a fifth product was tentatively ascertained. The conclusively established transformation products included p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA, a known genotoxin), 4-aminoazobenzene (4-AAB, a category 2 carcinogen) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP, a category 1 human carcinogen). 4-ABP is thought to form via a benzidine rearrangement; this is the first report of DY 7 undergoing a benzidine rearrangement. Given the importance of reduction processes in the metabolism of organic contaminants by aquatic species, we used LC-MS/MS to analyze sediment samples that had been generated previously upon exposure of Western clawed frogs (Silurana tropicalis) to DY 7 (at exposure levels where cellular stress was observed in S. tropicalis). We found p-PDA, 4-AAB, and 4-ABP were present in all exposures, but not in any of the sediment controls, demonstrating that upon release of DY 7 to the aquatic environment, sediment dwelling organisms will metabolize DY 7 to generate known (and suspected) human carcinogens, including through a previously unreported in vivo benzidine rearrangement to produce 4-ABP.

This uncertainty is in part due to sparse observations of aerosol concentrations in the pre-satellite era. To address this lack of measurements, ice cores can be used, which contain the aerosol concentration record. To date, these observations have been under-utilized for comparison to aerosol concentrations found in state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs). Here we compare long term trends in concentrations of sulfate and black carbon (BC) between 15 ice cores and 11 ESMs over nine regions around the world during the period 1850-2000. We find that for sulfate concentration trends model results generally agree with ice core records, whereas for BC concentration the model trends differ from the records. Absolute concentrations of both investigated species are overestimated by the models, probably in part due to representation errors. However, we assume that biases in relative trends are not altered by these errors. Ice cores in the European Alps and Greenland record a maximum BC concentration before 1950, while most ESMs used in this study agree on a post-1950 maximum. We source this bias to an error in BC emission inventories in Europe. Emission perturbation experiments using NorESM2-LM support the observed finding that BC concentrations in Northern Greenland ice cores are recording European emissions. Errors in BC emission inventories have implications for all future and past studies where Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 historical simulations are compared to observations relevant to aerosol forcing.","[Moseid, Kine Onsum; Schulz, Michael; Olivie, Dirk] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway; [Moseid, Kine Onsum; Schulz, Michael] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway; [Moseid, Kine Onsum] Expert Analyt, Oslo, Norway; [Eichler, Anja; Schwikowski, Margit] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Environm Chem, Villigen, Switzerland; [Eichler, Anja; Schwikowski, Margit] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Schwikowski, Margit] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, Bern, Switzerland; [McConnell, Joseph R.] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV USA; [Criscitiello, Alison S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Kreutz, Karl J.] Univ Maine, Sch Earth & Climate Sci, Orono, ME USA; [Kreutz, Karl J.] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME USA; [Legrand, Michel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, Grenoble, France; [Legrand, Michel] Univ Paris, Lab Interuniv Syst Atmospher, Paris, France; [Legrand, Michel] Univ Paris Est Creteil, CNRS, LISA, Paris, France",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; University of Oslo; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; University of Bern; University of Bern; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; University of Alberta; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Moseid, KO (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway.;Moseid, KO (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway.;Moseid, KO (corresponding author), Expert Analyt, Oslo, Norway.",komoseid@gmail.com,"Eichler, Anja/A-2132-2014; Schulz, Michael/A-6930-2011","Eichler, Anja/0000-0003-0206-7463; Schulz, Michael/0000-0003-4493-4158; Moseid, Kine Onsum/0000-0001-9601-6821; Criscitiello, Alison/0000-0002-8741-709X; McConnell, Joseph/0000-0001-9051-5240","Norwegian infrastructure for computational science [NS2345K, NS9560K, NS9252K]; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; European Union [821205]; Research Council of Norway [295046]",Norwegian infrastructure for computational science; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; European Union(European Commission); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This study benefited greatly from the CMIP6 data infrastructure for handling and providing model data for analysis.

Using two state-of-the-art Martian GCMs, the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique and Max Planck Institute models that self-consistently cover the atmosphere from the surface to the thermosphere, these physical mechanisms are investigated. Simulations demonstrate that the CO2 radiative cooling with a sufficiently large atomic oxygen abundance and the gravity wave-induced cooling can alone result in up to 40K colder temperature in the lower thermosphere. Accounting for both mechanisms produce stronger cooling at high latitudes. However, radiative cooling effects peak above the mesopause, while gravity wave cooling rates continuously increase with height. Although both mechanisms act simultaneously, these peculiarities could help to further quantify their relative contributions from future observations.","[Medvedev, Alexander S.; Hartogh, Paul] Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, Gottingen, Germany; [Medvedev, Alexander S.] Univ Gottingen, Inst Astrophys, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Gonzalez-Galindo, Francisco] CSIC, Inst Astrofis Andalucia, Granada, Spain; [Yigit, Erdal] George Mason Univ, Sch Phys Astron & Computat Sci, Space Weather Grp, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Feofilov, Artem G.; Forget, Francois] CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, Paris, France",Max Planck Society; University of Gottingen; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA); George Mason University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Medvedev, AS (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, Gottingen, Germany.",medvedev@mps.mpg.de,"Yiğit, Erdal/C-8609-2009; Yiğit, Erdal/J-3084-2019; Medvedev, Alexander S./AAC-3242-2019; Feofilov, Artem/A-2271-2015; Gonzalez-Galindo, Francisco/I-2495-2015","Yiğit, Erdal/0000-0002-2819-2521; Yiğit, Erdal/0000-0002-2819-2521; Medvedev, Alexander S./0000-0003-2713-8977; Feofilov, Artem/0000-0001-9924-4846; Gonzalez-Galindo, Francisco/0000-0001-9443-291X","German Science Foundation (DFG) [ME2752/3-1]; CSIC; European Social Fund; Spanish MICINN [CSD2009-00038, AYA2011-23552/ESP]; NASA [NNX13AO36G]","German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); CSIC; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Spanish MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","Mars Climate Database is available at http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars/access.html.

The results show that: (1) The number of publications on landscape microclimate research shows an increasing trend in China and other countries, and the number of publications increased significantly after 2016. Although the number of publications by Chinese scholars is less than that of foreign scholars, they have developed rapidly in recent years, and their international influence has increased significantly. (2) A positive exchange has been formed among international scholars, and the number of collaborative studies has been increasing. China's microclimate research has formed relatively stable teams that have conducted numerous studies in the fields of urban communities, street greening, and plant communities, respectively. Although the links between research teams and institutions in China and other countries are relatively close, they still need to be further strengthened. (3) In the past decade, the theoretical system of landscape microclimates has been improved, and the research themes have become more concentrated, but it still has remained close to the early basic research. (4) Future research will remain centered on mitigating the urban heat island effect and optimizing human heat perception. New topics such as biodiversity, carbon cycle, and climate change have been added. In conclusion, the research needs to continue to explore the evaluation system of microclimates and verify the evaluation index of outdoor thermal comfort for human thermal adaptation in different regions.

Methods used to estimate the theoretical upper limit of precipitation are often outdated and in need of updating. The rarity of extreme events means that old storms with limited observational data are often used to define the upper bound of precipitation. Observations of many important old storms are limited in spatial and temporal coverage, and sometimes of dubious quality. This reduces confidence in flood hazard assessments used in dam safety evaluations and leads to unknown or uncertain societal risk. This paper describes a method for generating and applying ensembles of high-resolution, state-of-the-art numerical model simulations of historical past extreme precipitation events to meet contemporary stakeholder needs. The method was designed as part of a research-to-application-focused partnership project to update state dam safety rules in Colorado and New Mexico. The results demonstrated multiple stakeholder and user benefits that were applied directly into storm analyses utilized for extreme rainfall estimation, and diagnostics were developed and ultimately used to update Colorado state dam safety rules, officially passed in January 2020. We discuss how what started as a prototype research foray to meet a specific user need may ultimately inform wider adoption of numerical simulations for water resources risk assessment, and how the historical event downscaling method performed offers near-term, implementable improvements to current dam safety flood risk estimates that can better serve society today.","[Mahoney, Kelly] NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [McColl, Chesley; Compo, Gilbert P.] Univ Colorado, Phys Sci Lab, NOAA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McColl, Chesley; Compo, Gilbert P.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hultstrand, Douglas M.; Kappel, William D.] Appl Weather Associates, Monument, CO USA; [McCormick, Bill] Colorado Div Water Resources, Denver, CO USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Mahoney, K (corresponding author), NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",kelly.mahoney@noaa.gov,,,"Colorado Water Conservation Board; New Mexico Office of the State Engineer; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office and Physical Sciences Laboratory","Colorado Water Conservation Board; New Mexico Office of the State Engineer; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office and Physical Sciences Laboratory","This project was completed under the CO-NM REPS effort, supported by the Colorado Water Conservation Board, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and other state entities; support from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory made the completion of this study possible.

The scattering/absorption/polarization properties from the precalculated database are incorporated into a radiative transfer model, the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (ARTS). A number of sub-mm/mm bands have been considered from radiometric and polarimetric studies for potential applications to retrieving ice cloud properties at shorter sub-mm/mm wavelengths (higher frequencies). The IR atmospheric window has also been thoroughly investigated for its feasibility to observe ice clouds. However, in the literature there is a lack of studies utilizing these high frequency bands or polarimetric IR observations to infer ice cloud properties. This study focuses on performing simulations of ice clouds between 680 and 183 GHz (sub-mm/mm regime) and between 8.6 and 12 mu m wavelengths (IR-window regime) toward determining potential applications to simultaneous retrievals of ice water path (IWP) and effective diameter (D-eff) with a primary focus on optically thin cirrus clouds. IWP andD(eff)isoline plots (lookup tables) are created to conduct sensitivity analyses and to perform preliminary retrievals.

Remote sensing can assist in the assessment and monitoring of such cultural ecosystem services. However, due to the limitations imposed by rugged topography and the occurrence of vegetation, the application of a single high-resolution topography (HRT) technique is challenging in these particular agricultural environments. Therefore, data fusion of HRT techniques (terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and aerial/terrestrial structure from motion (SfM)) was tested for the first time in this context (terraces), to the best of our knowledge, to overcome specific detection problems such as the complex topographic and landcover conditions of the terrace systems. SfM-TLS data fusion methodology was trialed in order to produce very high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) of two agricultural terrace areas, both characterized by the presence of vegetation that covers parts of the subvertical surfaces, complex morphology, and inaccessible areas. In the unreachable areas, it was necessary to find effective solutions to carry out HRT surveys; therefore, we tested the direct georeferencing (DG) method, exploiting onboard multifrequency GNSS receivers for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and postprocessing kinematic (PPK) data. The results showed that the fusion of data based on different methods and acquisition platforms is required to obtain accurate DTMs that reflect the real surface roughness of terrace systems without gaps in data. Moreover, in inaccessible or hazardous terrains, a combination of direct and indirect georeferencing was a useful solution to reduce the substantial inconvenience and cost of ground control point (GCP) placement. We show that in order to obtain a precise data fusion in these complex conditions, it is essential to utilize a complete and specific workflow. This workflow must incorporate all data merging issues and landcover condition problems, encompassing the survey planning step, the coregistration process, and the error analysis of the outputs. The high-resolution DTMs realized can provide a starting point for land degradation process assessment of these agriculture environments and supplies useful information to stakeholders for better management and protection of such important heritage landscapes.","[Cucchiaro, Sara; Tarolli, Paolo] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Fallu, Daniel J.; Brown, Antony G.] UiT Art Univ Norway, Tromso Univ Museum, Kvaloyen 30, N-9013 Tromso, Norway; [Zhang, He; Van Oost, Kristof] UCLouvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Walsh, Kevin] Univ York, Dept Archaeol, Kings Manor, York YO1 7EP, N Yorkshire, England; [Brown, Antony G.] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Padua; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of York - UK; University of Southampton,"Cucchiaro, S (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.",sara.cucchiaro@unipd.it; daniel.j.fallu@uit.no; he.zhang@uclouvain.be; kevin.walsh@york.ac.uk; kristof.vanoost@uclouvain.be; antony.g.brown@uit.no; paolo.tarolli@unipd.it,"Cucchiaro, Sara/AAC-1294-2022; Tarolli, Paolo/C-2866-2009; Brown, Antony/G-4498-2014","Cucchiaro, Sara/0000-0002-8042-836X; Tarolli, Paolo/0000-0003-0043-5226; Fallu, Daniel/0000-0002-6717-473X; Van Oost, Kristof/0000-0002-4938-9438; Brown, Antony/0000-0002-1990-4654; Walsh, Kevin/0000-0003-1621-2625","European Research Council [ERC-2017-ADG: 787790]; project SOiLUTION SYSTEM Innovative solutions for soil erosion risk mitigation and a better management of vineyards in hilly and mountain landscapes, within Programma di Sviluppo Rurale per il Veneto 2014-2020","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); project SOiLUTION SYSTEM Innovative solutions for soil erosion risk mitigation and a better management of vineyards in hilly and mountain landscapes, within Programma di Sviluppo Rurale per il Veneto 2014-2020","This research was funded by the European Research Council, Advanced grant for the TerrACE research project (ERC-2017-ADG: 787790, 2019-2023; https://www.terrace.no/).This study was also partly supported by the project SOiLUTION SYSTEM Innovative solutions for soil erosion risk mitigation and a better management of vineyards in hilly and mountain landscapes, within Programma di Sviluppo Rurale per il Veneto 2014-2020 (www.soilutionsystem.com).",,127,29,29,10,46,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUN,2020,12,,,,,,1946,10.3390/rs12121946,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12121946,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,MR8XE,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000553872800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our analysis uses a database consisting of complete, high quality and homogenous daily maximum and minimum air temperature records at 40 stations, spanning the period from 1983 to 2015. The trends were assessed using a least squares regression model, and its significance was determined by means of the modified Mann-Kendall test (p < .05). Results demonstrate that the frequency, intensity, and persistence of warm extremes increased significantly over the study period, with a clear spatial gradient from southeast to northwest. The strongest warming was more evident in coastal areas along the Red Sea and the Sinai Peninsula. In contrast, changes in cold extremes were mostly non-significant, with a divergence in the trends (i.e. positive and negative). Changes in variability indices such as the diurnal temperature range (DTR) were more consistent with those of warm extremes than with cold extremes. Our results also demonstrate that maximum air temperature witnessed stronger warming than minimum air temperature, leading to a dramatic increase in DTR, especially in the last decade. This study also points at the possible physical mechanisms responsible for the detectable changes in temperature extremes using sea level pressure and geopotential field data. Results indicate that anomalous warm events over Egypt are directly related to easterly winds that bring warm and dry air from the Arabian Peninsula and the Iranian Plateau, accompanied by strong ridges over the eastern Mediterranean and an intensification of the Asian monsoon lows. On the other hand, the occurrence of anomalous cold events can be linked to the east-west pressure gradient between the North Atlantic Highs and the Siberian and Persian Troughs, which enhances a northerly and northwesterly cold advection from Northern Europe to Egypt. This situation is also combined with a subsidence of cooler air from the mid to low troposphere. Overall, the observed changes in warm extremes could have profound ecological, hydrological and socioeconomic impacts, especially for crop production, water resources management and energy consumption. As such, improving the insight and understanding of such changes is of considerable importance to provide guidance to policymakers and stakeholders to develop more appropriate adaptation strategies.","[El Kenawy, Ahmed M.; Lopez-Moreno, Juan I.; Dominguez-Castro, Fernando; Pena-Gallardo, Marina; Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.] Inst Pirena Ecol, Campus Aula Dei,Avda Montanana, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [El Kenawy, Ahmed M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura, Egypt; [McCabe, Matthew F.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Robaa, S.

By using the total column ozone data (1979-2011), interannual variation of the springtime Antarctic ozone low is investigated, together with its relationship with the polar vortex evolution in the lower stratosphere. The results show that springtime Antarctic ozone depletion has continued in the 2000s, seemingly contradicting the consensus view of a global ozone recovery expected at the beginning of the 21st century. The spring Antarctic polar vortex in the lower stratosphere is much stronger in the 2000s than before, with a larger area, delayed breakup time, and greater longevity during 2000-2011. Further analyses show that the recent continuation of springtime Antarctic ozone depletion could be largely attributed to the abnormal variation of the Antarctic polar vortex.","[Zhou Libo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LAPC, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LAOR, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zhou, LB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LAPC, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zhoulibo@mail.iap.ac.cn,"IAP, LAPC/AAI-6390-2020; Zhou, Libo/AAH-6087-2020","IAP, LAPC/0000-0002-6195-7362; ",Public Science and Technology Research Funds for Projects of the Ocean [201005017-5]; China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund [GYHY201206041]; Project of Comprehensive Evaluation of Polar Areas on Global and Regional Climate Changes and Polar Environment Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment,Public Science and Technology Research Funds for Projects of the Ocean; China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund; Project of Comprehensive Evaluation of Polar Areas on Global and Regional Climate Changes and Polar Environment Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment,"Supported by the Public Science and Technology Research Funds for Projects of the Ocean (201005017-5), China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund (GYHY201206041), Project of Comprehensive Evaluation of Polar Areas on Global and Regional Climate Changes and Polar Environment Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment (2012-2015).",,31,1,1,1,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

The simulations refer to five sites belonging to a monitoring network setup within the framework of the European Union project GREENGRASS. Simulated gross primary productivity ranges from 0.4 to 1.9 kg C m(-2) year(-1) depending on environmental conditions and management. Ecosystem respiration is calculated in the order of 0.7-1.5 kg C m(-2) year(-1), resulting in a net CO2 uptake of about 0.3 kg C m(-2) year(-1), in reasonable agreement with observations. Linear relationships between ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity, as well as between net primary productivity and annual precipitation are indicated by the simulations. Annual emissions of NO are predicted in the range of 1-5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), a factor of 2-10 higher than observed. This is caused by an overestimation of the background fluxes. On the other hand, the model fails to faithfully reproduce timing, duration and magnitude of peak emissions triggered by the application of mineral and organic fertilizers and by rain events.

In Turkey also this method has been used for many years to dispose solid waste. Due to increasing migration from rural to urban areas, the amount of solid waste in the cities has been rising in addition unplanned urbanization caused these open dump areas to remain in the middle of residential zones. Mersin one of Turkey's 10 major cities experienced a rapid population growth in the city center in relation to migration. 25 years ago in about 10 km north of Mersin city center in the Sergeant Village a solid waste landfill was built, but as a result of uncontrolled dumping this site has become an open dump area. In time, Sergeant Village, where the dump area is, has become a district due to the city's expansion. Gas generated from wastes in the dump area and also smoke from the fires in dump area started to affect districts in the city center and has become a permanent part of Mersin's climate. For years, sheep herds and garbage collectors on the dump area, ponds of leachate and fires all caused this open dump area to become city's bleeding wound. Mersin's primary environmental problem, this open dump area, has come to an end with the implementation of Mersin Metropolitan Municipality Solid Waste Landfill project and a rehabilitation project has been started. Rehabilitation project included; slope arrangements, barrier formations, leachate drainage and collection pool, surface water drainage, final cover, gas drainage and disposal systems for the waste mass which covers a total area of 16 ha and has a average depth of 10 m. As a result of these investments a stable structure of the waste mass is attained, with modern technology area has been taken under control. By preventing water infiltration to the waste mass via precipitation, ground water pollution has been minimized and also collection and disposal of greenhouse gases has been achieved. This project, which created an area with sports and recreation facilities on it for public use and eleminated a potential risk factor, stands as an example project in Turkey where hundreds of similar areas still waiting for rehabilitation.","[Erturk, Murat Cem] ITU Ayazaga Yerleskesi Teknokent Art, Cevre Cozumleri Ar Ge Ltd Sti, Maslak, Turkey; [Gorgun, Erdem] Istanbul Tech Univ, Insaat Fak, Cevre Muhendisligi Bolumu, Maslak, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Erturk, MC (corresponding author), ITU Ayazaga Yerleskesi Teknokent Art, Cevre Cozumleri Ar Ge Ltd Sti, Maslak, Turkey.",muratcem@iocevre.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,0,YILDIZ TECHNICAL UNIV,ISTANBUL,"YILDIZ CAMPUS, BESIKTAS, ISTANBUL, 34349, TURKEY",1304-7205,1304-7191,,SIGMA J ENG NAT SCI,Sigma J.

This work proposes a new strategy based on celluloseinspired hydrogel (Gel-glycerol) as soil modulates to transform harsh soil into arable soil to promote seed germination and growth. Gel-glycerol with a 3D network structure exhibited good rheological properties, high thermal stability, thermal reversibility (-81.3 degrees C), and ultrahigh water-retention capacity (160%) for enhancing seeds germination. Compared with the control sample, the germination percentage and the average leaves number of wheat plants increased by 21.88% and 100% after 21, days with Gel-glycerol. Associated with the most common water-retaining agents (potassium polyacrylate, KPAM), the germination percentage of lettuce seeds for 16 days increased by 38% and 22% with Gel-glycerol treatment under harsh soils. Moreover, the water uptake value of wheat plants with Gel-glycerol improved by 94.7%. This result confirmed that adding GelGlycerol as an amendment can significantly tailor soil salt content. This finding offers excellent applicability in the agriculture ecosystem, displaying the potential value in soil amendments and an alternate solution for solving the continuing challenge of harsh environmental conditions.","[Qin, Cong-Cong; Abdalkarim, Somia Yassin Hussain; Zhou, Ying; Yu, Hou-Yong] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Key Lab Adv Text Mat & Mfg Technol, Minist Educ, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [He, Xia] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Art & Design, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Abdalkarim, Somia Yassin Hussain; Yu, Hou-Yong] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Xiasha Higher Educ Zone, 928 Second Ave, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,"Abdalkarim, SYH; Yu, HY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Xiasha Higher Educ Zone, 928 Second Ave, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",somia@zstu.edu.cn; phdyu@zstu.edu.cn,,,"Outstanding Youth Project of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation [LR22E030002]; Scientific Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University [21202283-Y, 19082472-Y]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Key Foundation of China [LZ20E030003, LY21E030020, LGG22E03005]; Zhejiang Prov- ince Clean Dyeing Technology Research Key Laboratory Open Fund Project [QJRZ1905]",Outstanding Youth Project of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation; Scientific Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Key Foundation of China; Zhejiang Prov- ince Clean Dyeing Technology Research Key Laboratory Open Fund Project,"The authors acknowledge Outstanding Youth Project of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (LR22E030002) , the Scientific Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (21202283-Y, 19082472-Y) , Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Key Foundation of China (LZ20E030003, LY21E030020, LGG22E03005) , Zhejiang Prov- ince Clean Dyeing Technology Research Key Laboratory Open Fund Project (QJRZ1905) .",,32,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Monitoring data from field tests show non-negligible deviations regarding SCOPs compared to values identified according to state-of-the-art standards. Observed deviations are partly due to neglecting instationary effects during momentary efficiency measurements of standards. To counter this problem, three institutes have collaborated on developing a novel dynamic testing procedure making use of the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) concept. Furthermore, the control volume for the energy balance is extended to the whole system including the energy conversion system's controller. The energy conversion system is coupled via adequate test benches to a real-time building performance simulation. In order to evaluate the annual efficiency according to the HiL approach, the experiments demand a feasible time frame. For this purpose, we apply the k-medoids algorithm to shrink down one year to four representative days. We call the novel approach Dynamic System Evaluation (DSE) test. In this work, we compare the annual efficiency factors of three energy conversion systems: a micro combined heat and power system (mCHP), a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) and an air-source heat pump (ASHP). For this purpose, we use three different types of building performance simulation software as well as three different test facilities. The systems were investigated on two test benches each and result in annual efficiencies with relative deviations of Delta eta(rel,mCHP,HiL) = 0.6%, Delta SCOPrel,GSHP,HiL = 0.9% and Delta SCOPrel,ASHP,HiL = 11.3%.","[Mehrfeld, Philipp; Nuerenberg, Markus; Lauster, Moritz; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Knorr, Martin; Schinke, Lars; Beyer, Maximilian; Seifert, Joachim] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Power Engn, Helmholtzstr 14, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Grimm, Manuel; Stergiaropoulos, Konstantinos] Inst Bldg Energet Thermotechnol & Energy Storage, Pfaffenwaldring 10, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Mehrfeld, P (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",pmehrfeld@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,"Mehrfeld, Philipp/0000-0002-9777-9166","Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), Germany [03ET1211 A/B/C]","Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), Germany(Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi))","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), Germany, promotional reference 03ET1211 A/B/C.",,60,6,6,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

Meanwhile, international policy documents such as the United Nations 2019 Climate Action Summit Report point at the importance of action for sustainable development for establishing acceptable life conditions for current and future generations. Therefore, a candidate learning outcome for broadening effectiveness research's scope is action competence in sustainable development (ACiSD), which consists of the relevant knowledge, willingness, capacity expectations, and outcome expectancy regarding actions for sustainable development. In order to initiate adding ACiSD as a learning outcome to effectiveness research, the current study contributed to establishing that formal education plays a part in changes in students' ACiSD. Firstly, we studied how much variance in ACiSD can be attributed to what happens in classrooms. Secondly, we looked into how class groups' and early adolescent students' ACiSD changed after one school year. Following recommendations for rigour in effectiveness research, we performed multilevel analyses on survey data (question one: n = 1398; question two: n = 633). Our evidence showed that 11% of variance in ACiSD was attributable to what happens in classrooms with explained variance in the subconstructs ranging between 7.2 and 14.2%. Furthermore, individual students as well as class groups showed higher ACiSD scores when comparing measurements at beginning and end of one school year. We conclude that the classroom level matters to changes in ACiSD within early adolescents. Further research can now look into how and to which extent teachers' educational approaches affect these changes.","[Sass, Wanda; De Maeyer, Sven; Boeve-de Pauw, Jelle; Van Petegem, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Training & Educ Sci, Res Unit Edubron, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Sass, W (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Dept Training & Educ Sci, Res Unit Edubron, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",wanda.sass@uantwerpen.be; sven.demaeyer@uantwerpen.be; Jelle.Boeve-dePauw@uantwerpen.be; peter.vanpetegem@uantwerpen.be,"Sass, Wanda/AAP-4559-2021; Van Petegem, Peter/R-5494-2016; De Maeyer, Sven/K-7446-2015","Sass, Wanda/0000-0002-3573-1423; Van Petegem, Peter/0000-0002-4078-7800; De Maeyer, Sven/0000-0003-2888-1631",Flanders Research Foundation (FWO) [S010317N],Flanders Research Foundation (FWO)(FWO),This study is part of the VALIES project and is funded by the Flanders Research Foundation (FWO) under grant agreement S010317N within the Strategic Basic Research programme.,,59,1,1,3,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Although previous studies have examined the ecology and biochemistry of these communities, none has examined viral assemblages associated with these habitats. We employed virus particle purification, genome amplification, pyrosequencing and gene/genome reconstruction and annotation on two metagenomic libraries, one prepared for ssDNA and the other for all DNA, to identify the viral community in a methane seep. Similarity analysis of these libraries (raw and assembled) revealed a community dominated by phages, with a significant proportion of similarities to the Microviridae family of ssDNA phages. We define these viruses as the Eel River Basin Microviridae (ERBM). Assembly and comparison of 21 ERBM closed circular genomes identified five as members of a novel sister clade to the Microvirus genus of Enterobacteria phages. Comparisons among other metagenomes and these Microviridae major-capsid sequences indicated that this clade of phages is currently unique to the Eel River Basin sediments. Given this ERBM clade's relationship to the Microviridae genus Microvirus, we define this sister clade as the candidate genus Pequenovirus.","[Bryson, Samuel Joseph; Correa, Adrienne M.

The key idea is to use combination of low- and high-resolution simulations (that differ not only in spatial resolution but also in geospatial patterns) to train a neural network to map from the former to the latter. Specifically, we define two types of CNNs, one that stacks variables directly and one that encodes each variable before stacking, and we train each CNN type both with a conventional loss function, such as mean square error (MSE), and with a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), for a total of four CNN variants. We compare the four new CNN-derived high-resolution precipitation results with precipitation generated from original high-resolution simulations, a bilinear interpolater and the state-of-the-art CNN-based super-resolution (SR) technique. Results show that the SR technique produces results similar to those of the bilinear interpolator with smoother spatial and temporal distributions and smaller data variabilities and extremes than the original high-resolution simulations. While the new CNNs trained by MSE generate better results over some regions than the interpolator and SR technique do, their predictions are still biased from the original high-resolution simulations. The CNNs trained by CGAN generate more realistic and physically reasonable results, better capturing not only data variability in time and space but also extremes such as intense and long-lasting storms. The new proposed CNN-based downscaling approach can downscale precipitation from 50 to 12 km in 14 min for 30 years once the network is trained (training takes 4 h using 1 GPU), while the conventional dynamical downscaling would take 1 month using 600 CPU cores to generate simulations at the resolution of 12 km over the contiguous United States.","[Wang, Jiali; Kotamarthi, V.

Outdoor containers can be detected from geotagged images using state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Eight breeding site container types in Google street view images are detected using convolutional neural networks. We investigate the added value of including container information from geotagged images in predicting dengue risk. To explain the target variable dengue incidence, weather variables are added to complement the container variable predictors. Linear mixed-effects models are built to account for the effects of spatial and seasonal variation in weather and container variables on the dengue incidence. Evaluation is carried out over three provinces in Thailand: Bangkok, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Krabi in comparison with classic linear models as well as the mixed effect models without container information. The proposed model with the container information outperforms both baseline models in all three provinces. We further perform sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of dengue incidence to the changes in the number of containers as well as the improvement in the model performance. This is the first work on dengue risk prediction models using container density information from geotagged images analysis. Dengue is an emerging vector-borne viral disease across the world. The primary dengue mosquito vectors breed in containers with sufficient water and nutrition. Outdoor containers can be detected from geotagged images using state-of-the-art deep learning methods. In this study, we utilize such container information from street view images in developing a risk mapping model and determine the added value of including container information in predicting dengue risk. We developed seasonal-spatial models in which the target variable dengue incidence was explained using weather and container variable predictors. Linear mixed models with fixed and random effects are employed in our models to account for different characteristics of containers and weather variables. Using data from three provinces of Thailand between 2015 and 2018, the models are developed at the sub-district level resolution to facilitate the development of effective targeted intervention strategies. The performance of the models is evaluated with two baseline models: a classic linear model and a linear mixed model without container information. The performance evaluated with the correlation coefficients, R-squared, and AIC shows the proposed model with the container information outperforms both baseline models in all three provinces. Through sensitivity analysis, we investigate the containers that have a high impact on dengue risk. Our findings indicate that outdoor containers identified from street view images can be a useful data source in building effective dengue risk models and that the resulting models have potential in helping to target container elimination interventions.","[Yin, Myat Su; Haddawy, Peter] Mahidol Univ, Fac ICT, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Bicout, Dominique] Grenoble Alpes Univ, VetAgro Sup, EPSP TIMC, Biomath & Epidemiol,UMR CNRS 5525, Grenoble, France; [Bicout, Dominique] Laue Langevin Inst, Theory Grp, Grenoble, France; [Haddawy, Peter; Schoening, Johannes] Univ Bremen, Bremen Spatial Cognit Ctr, Bremen, Germany; [Laosiritaworn, Yongjua] Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Dis Control, Informat Technol Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sa-Angchai, Patiwat] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Bangkok, Thailand",Mahidol University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); VetAgro Sup; Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL); University of Bremen; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; Mahidol University,"Yin, MS (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac ICT, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",myatsu.yin@mahidol.ac.th,,"Schoning, Johannes/0000-0002-8823-4607; Bicout, Dominique/0000-0003-0750-997X","Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg Institute for Advanced Study, Delmenhorst, Germany; Mahidol University Office of International Relations; Volkswagen Foundation, Germany","Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg Institute for Advanced Study, Delmenhorst, Germany; Mahidol University Office of International Relations; Volkswagen Foundation, Germany(Volkswagen)","This work was partially supported by a fellowship from the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg Institute for Advanced Study (https://www.h-w-k.de/), Delmenhorst, Germany to MSY, by a grant from the Mahidol University Office of International Relations to PH in support of the MIRU joint unit, and by the Volkswagen Foundation, Germany (https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/foundation) through a Lichtenberg professorship for JS and conducted within the Bremen Spatial Cognition Center (BSCC), Germany.

Famous for its clay quarries and the poor quality of its wine, the Vatican did, in fact, house some great parks, both private and imperial, including the gardens where the emperor Caligula built his circus and where Nero later had the Christians who were accused of causing the Great Fire of Rome of 64 A.D. executed. Adjacent to the circus were the Horti Domitiae, where the emperor Hadrian built his majestic mausoleum, known as Castel Sant'Angelo. As in all marginal areas, the paths that crossed the Vatican-Via Triumphalis to Veio (now Isola Farnese), Via Cornelia-Aurelia to Caere (now Cerveteri)-were skirted with tombs of all kinds, many of which have been discovered in the current area of Vatican City. The Necropolis along the Via Triumphalis is of great significance in the context of the rich archaeological heritage of the city of Rome. In fact, there exists no other equally vast and varied complex of tombs representing lower and middle Rome. More frequently we find imperial tombs, the noble tombs of the Via Appia but not the tombs of common people. There, it is possible to observe a wide variety of burial customs, ranging from the poorest cremation in wooden urns to lavish sarcophagi of the middle to upper strata of society, with tombs adorned with frescoes and mosaics. Scenes of daily life can be observed from one burial site to another: thus we find Alcimus, slave of emperor Nero assigned to the scenes of the Theatre of Pompeus in Rome; Tiberius Claudius Optatus, archivist of the imperial accounts; Clement, the horseman of the faction of the Azures who could have competed several times in the nearby circus, as well as many others. Recent excavations, carried out between 2009 and 2011 in the central area of the Necropolis and currently visible, have linked the sectors of the Autoparco (1956-1958 excavations) and Santa Rosa (excavations 2003), which were previously separated. Among the important finds of the excavations was a designated area for the cremations (ustrina), rarely preserved in complexes of this type. This area is a veritable laboratory for archaeological research. Several scientific investigations and assessments are underway, such as prospecting with geo-radar and anthropological analysis. These last analyses were performed by Prof. Henri Duday of the University of Bordeaux; cremations were studied in collaboration with the Ecole Francaise de Rome, and the burials in collaboration with the service of Anthropology of the Superintendence for Archaeological Heritage of Rome, coordinated by Dr. Paola Catalano. Restoration and conservation aspects certainly have a primary role in the work that continues on the archaeological site. The monitoring as well as chemical and optical analysis inside the museum area enable us to verify climate changes and any damage to graves and preserved artefacts. At the same time, new technologies such as laser cleaning are being used and new methodologies of bio-restoration are being tested.","Vatican Museums, Greek & Roman Art Dept, Vatican City, Vatican",,"Spinola, G (corresponding author), Vatican Museums, Greek & Roman Art Dept, Vatican City, Vatican.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",,,978-1-315-73997-7; 978-1-138-02694-0,,,,2014,,,,,17,26,,,,10.1201/b17570,,10,Archaeology,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Archaeology,BC3ZE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000352104800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Solar energy is a sustainable energy source which can be exploited to drive catalytic reactions for utilizing CO2, including converting the CO2 into useful products. Solar energy can be harnessed through a range of different pathways to valorize CO2. Whilst using solar energy to drive CO2 reduction has vast potential to promote catalytic CO2 conversions, the progress is limited due to the lack of understanding of property-performance relations as well as feasible material engineering approaches. Herein, we outline the various driving forces involved in photothermal CO2 catalysis. The heat from solar energy can be utilized to induce CO2 catalytic reduction reactions via the photothermal effect. Further, solar energy can act to modify reaction pathways through light-matter interactions. Light-induced chemical functions have demonstrated the ability to regulate intermediary reaction steps, and thus control the reaction selectivity. Photothermal catalyst structures and specific catalyst design strategies are discussed in this context.

However, poor electrochemical corrosion resistance during extended use and repeated cyclic operation of PEMFCs shortens their practical device lifetime; surface defects, such as nanosized disordered domains, have been established as the most influential factors. Herein, we coupled polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (pg-CN) with amorphous carbon black (a-CB) in a core@shell structure to produce an electrochemically efficient and stable electrocatalyst support. Our protocol allowed for the simultaneous optimization of uniformly thin graphitic shell structures for electrochemical corrosion stability and nitrogen-enriched functionalities on the carbon surfaces for electrocatalyst (e.g., platinum) nucleation. The newly prepared a-CB@pg-CNs enhanced the stable fuel cell devices operation and remained invariant even at high potential (1.2-1.7 V). Significantly, when used for constructing the PEMFC electrode, a-CB@pg-CN support-based Pt catalyst electrodes outperformed and exhibited superior stability over state-of-the-art commercial a-CB-based counterparts. Experimental observations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the unusual electrocatalytic properties of as prepared a-CB@pg-CNs originated from an intrinsic chemical and electronic coupling that synergistically reduced electrochemical corrosion kinetics and promoted catalyst support interactions.","[Lee, In Hyuk; Cho, Jinwon; Ham, Hyung Chul; Kim, Jin Young] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Hwarangno 14 Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Lee, In Hyuk; Jung, Juhae; Cho, Jongin; Lee, Hyun Jin] Doosan Corpoarat Electromat, 10,Suji Ro St 112 Beon Gil, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, In Hyuk; Kim, Jin Young] Univ Sci & Technol, Daejeon 305355, South Korea; [Chae, Keun Hwa; Cho, Min Kyung] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Adv Anal Ctr, Hwarangno 14 Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); University of Science & Technology (UST); Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST),"Kim, JY (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Hwarangno 14 Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",jinykim@kist.re.kr,"Chae, Keun Hwa/D-1191-2011","Chae, Keun Hwa/0000-0003-3894-670X; Cho, Min Kyung/0000-0002-5185-9988; Cho, Jinwon/0000-0003-0200-2950; Ham, Hyung Chul/0000-0003-0850-584X","KIST Institutional Programs [2E27301]; KIST-UNIST partnership program [2V05120/1.160097.01]; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - Nation Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea [2016M3A6A7945505]; New and Renewable Energy of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea [20153010031920]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2016M1A2A2937136]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, & Future Planning [NRF-2015 M1A2A2056690]","KIST Institutional Programs; KIST-UNIST partnership program; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - Nation Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea; New and Renewable Energy of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, & Future Planning","This work was supported by the KIST Institutional Programs (2E27301 and KIST Young Fellow).

Over the past decade, several Power-to-X (PtX) technologies have been proposed to store and convert the surplus of renewable energies into chemical bonds of chemicals produced by different processes. CO2 is a major contributor to climate change, yet it is also an undervalued source of carbon that could be recycled and represents an opportunity to generate renewable energy. In this context, PtX technologies would allow for CO2 valorization into renewable fuels while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With this work we want to provide an up-to-date overview of biomethanation as a PtX technology by considering the biological aspects and the main parameters affecting its application and scalability at an industrial level. Particular attention will be paid to the concept of CO2-streams valorization and to the integration of the process with renewable energies. Aspects related to new promising technologies such as in situ, ex situ, hybrid biomethanation and the concept of underground methanation will be discussed, also in connection with recent application cases. Furthermore, the technical and economic feasibility will be critically analyzed to highlight current options and limitations for implementing a sustainable process.","[Bellini, Ruggero; Bassani, Ilaria; Vizzarro, Arianna; Azim, Annalisa Abdel; Pirri, Candido Fabrizio; Menin, Barbara] Fdn Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Sustainable Future Technol, Via Livorno 60, I-10144 Turin, Italy; [Vasile, Nicolo Santi; Pirri, Candido Fabrizio; Verga, Francesca] Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Menin, Barbara] CNR, Ist Biol & Biotecnol Agr, Via Alfonso Corti 12, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Polytechnic University of Turin; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Bellini, R; Menin, B (corresponding author), Fdn Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Sustainable Future Technol, Via Livorno 60, I-10144 Turin, Italy.;Menin, B (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Biol & Biotecnol Agr, Via Alfonso Corti 12, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",ruggero.bellini@iit.it; ilaria.bassani@iit.it; arianna.vizzarro@iit.it; annalisa.abdelazim@iit.it; nicolo.vasile@polito.it; fabrizio.pirri@iit.it; francesca.verga@polito.it; barbara.menin@ibba.cnr.it,,"Bellini, Ruggero/0000-0002-3434-4544; Verga, Francesca/0000-0002-1187-9052; Menin, Barbara/0000-0002-9628-8971",,,,,167,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUN,2022,11,,,,,,4064,10.3390/en15114064,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15114064,,,34,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,1Z2IN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000808654400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The field of transition studies has been critically interrogated for undermining the role of power, which has inspired various endeavours to theorize power and agency in transitions. This paper presents the POwer-IN-Transition framework (POINT), which is developed as a conceptual framework to analyse power and (dis)empowerment in transformative social change, integrating transition concepts and multiple power and empowerment theories. The first section introduces transitions studies and discusses its state-of-the-art regarding power. This is followed by a typology of power relations and different types of power (reinforcive, innovative, transformative). These notions are then used to reframe transition concepts, in particular the multi-level perspective, in terms of power dynamics. The critical challenges of (dis)empowerment and unintended power implications of discourses on and policies for sustainability transitions' are discussed. The paper concludes with a synthesis of the arguments and challenges for future research.

It is found primarily in subcutaneous tissues of the legs, and is more commonly known as 'legworm'. Blackflies are intermediate hosts and transmit larvae to ungulates when they blood-feed. In this article we report the first records of O. cervipedis from high latitudes of North America and its occurrence in previously unrecognized host subspecies including the Yukon-Alaska moose (Alces americanus gigas) and the Grant's caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti). Methods: We examined the subcutaneous connective tissues of the metacarpi and/or metatarsi of 34 moose and one caribou for parasitic lesions. Samples were collected from animals killed by subsistence hunters or animals found dead in the Northwest Territories (NT), Canada and Alaska (AK), USA from 2005 to 2012. Genomic DNA lysate was prepared from nematode fragments collected from two moose. The nd5 region of the mitochondrial DNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Results: Subcutaneous nodules were found in 12 moose from the NT and AK, and one caribou from AK. Nematodes dissected from the lesions were identified as Onchocerca cervipedis based on morphology of female and male specimens. Histopathological findings in moose included cavitating lesions with multifocal granulomatous cellulitis containing intralesional microfilariae and adults, often necrotic and partially mineralized. Lesions in the caribou included periosteitis with chronic cellulitis, eosinophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and abundant granulation associated with intralesional adult nematodes and larvae. Sequences of the nd5 region (471bp), the first generated for this species, were deposited with Genbank (JN580791 and JN580792). Representative voucher specimens were deposited in the archives of the United States National Parasite Collection. Conclusions: The geographic range of O. cervipedis is broader than previously thought, and extends into subarctic regions of western North America, at least to latitude 66 degrees N. The host range is now recognized to include two additional subspecies: the Yukon-Alaska moose and Grant's caribou. Accelerated climate change at high latitudes may affect vector dynamics, and consequently the abundance and distribution of O. cervipedis in moose and caribou. Disease outbreaks and mortality events associated with climatic perturbations have been reported for other filarioids, such as Setaria tundra in Fennoscandia, and may become an emerging issue for O. cervipedis in subarctic North America.","[Verocai, Guilherme G.; Kashivakura, Cyntia K.; Fuentealba, Carmen; Kutz, Susan J.] Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Dept Ecosyst & Publ Hlth, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Lejeune, Manigandan; Kutz, Susan J.] Canadian Cooperat Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Beckmen, Kimberlee B.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Wildlife Conservat, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Veitch, Alasdair M.; Popko, Richard A.] Govt NW Terr, Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Norman Wells, NT, Canada; [Hoberg, Eric P.] ARS, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA",University of Calgary; Alaska Department of Fish & Game; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Verocai, GG (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Dept Ecosyst & Publ Hlth, 3330 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada.",gui.verocai@ucalgary.ca,"Lejeune, Manigandan/AAI-9474-2021","kutz, susan/0000-0003-2352-8687; Beckmen, Kimberlee/0000-0003-0747-7883","Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Calgary; NSERC Canada International Polar Year Funding; NWT Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program (CIMP); Sahtu Renewable Resources Board","Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Calgary; NSERC Canada International Polar Year Funding; NWT Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program (CIMP); Sahtu Renewable Resources Board","This study was supported by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Calgary (U of C), and NSERC Canada International Polar Year Funding, the NWT Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program (CIMP), and the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board.

The PCM composite was fabricated on paraffin and hydrophobic expanded perlite. The mass percentage of paraffin in the composite can reach as much as 50% due to the excellent absorption capacity of expanded perlite. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests show that the fabricated PCM composite has good chemical compatibility and thermal stability. TESCs developed by partially replacing the fine aggregate with PCM composite reveals that the composite PCM has good compatibility with cement matrix. It is shown that TESC developed with 60% substitution level of composite PCM resulted in 28-day compressive strength of 25 M.P a. Furthermore, compared to ordinary cement mortar, maximum reductions on 28-day compressive strength, apparent density and thermal conductivity with the 80% substitution level.are 70%, 48% and 66% respectively. The thermal performance test shows that thermal energy storage capacity of TESC with 80% substitution level is increased by 166% compared to ordinary cement mortar. Furthermore, mechanical and thermal reliability tests reveal that the TESCs do not show any signs of degradation when subjected to 1000 accelerated thermal cycles.","[Ramakrishnan, Sayanthan; Sanjayan, Jay; Wilson, John] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Ctr Sustainable Infrastruct, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Petinakis, Eustathios] CSIRO, Mfg Flagship, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Ramakrishnan, S (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Ctr Sustainable Infrastruct, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",sramakrishnan@swin.edu.au,"Sanjayan, Jay/AAE-1468-2019; Sanjayan, Jay/AAD-1432-2020; Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008","Sanjayan, Jay/0000-0002-5400-5988; Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-6648-0057; Wilson, John L/0000-0001-6650-308X; Ramakrishnan, Sayanthan/0000-0001-8055-8167",Swinburne University of Technology through a SUPRA scholarship; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship through CSIRO top-up scholarship,Swinburne University of Technology through a SUPRA scholarship; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship through CSIRO top-up scholarship,The first author acknowledges Swinburne University of Technology and CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship for supporting the project through a SUPRA scholarship and CSIRO top-up scholarship respectively.

Numerical experiments with the offline land surface scheme demonstrated that the implementation of the Mualem-van Genuchten water retention curve has the advantage for describing the processes of soil moisture transfer in comparison with Brooks-Corey parameterization. The last one is used in the basic version of the model. The Mualem-van Genuchten function provides better computational stability of the soil model in case of soils with high coarse grain content. An important contribution to the soil moisture error in the analysis and forecast is caused by specifying an inaccurate profile of the soil granulometric composition. It indicates a need to involve state-of-the-art databases for soil characteristics.,"[Travova, S., V; Stepanenko, V. M.; Medvedev, A., I; Tolstykh, M.

This disease is not a serious disease commonly, but it is one of the most widespread infectious diseases which can still be fatal. HFMD still poses a threat to the lives and health of children and adolescents. An effective prediction model would be very helpful to HFMD control and prevention. Several methods have been proposed to predict HFMD outpatient cases. These methods tend to utilize the connection between cases and exogenous data, but exogenous data is not always available. In this paper, a novel method combined time series composition and local fusion has been proposed. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is used to decompose HFMD outpatient time series. Linear local predictors are applied to processing input data. The predicted value is generated via fusing the output of local predictors. The evaluation of the proposed model is carried on a real dataset comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our model is more accurately compared with other baseline models. Thus, the model we proposed can be an effective method in the HFMD outpatient prediction mission.","[Wang, Ziyang; Wang, Zhijin; Lin, Yingxian; Liu, Jinming; Fu, Yonggang; Cai, Bing] Jimei Univ, Comp Engn Coll, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peisong] Jimei Univ, Sch Sci, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China",Jimei University; Jimei University,"Wang, ZJ; Lin, YX (corresponding author), Jimei Univ, Comp Engn Coll, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",zhijin@jmu.edu.cn; yxlin@jmu.edu.cn,,"Zhijin, Wang/0000-0002-7962-2827; Wang, Ziyang/0000-0003-1656-0638","Jimei University [ZP2021013, ZP2020043]; Science Project of Xiamen City (CN) [3502Z20193048]; Education Department of Fujian Province (CN) [JAT200277, JAT200232]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (CN) [2019J01713]",Jimei University; Science Project of Xiamen City (CN); Education Department of Fujian Province (CN); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (CN),"This work was partly supported by Jimei University (nos.

In this paper, we report on fish remains from the Gran Dolina cave (Trinchera del Ferrocarril) in the Sierra de Atapuerca in Spain, to increase what is known of the freshwater ecosystems close to the cave. The 19-m-thick section, divided into 11 stratigraphic levels, represents an Early to Middle Pleistocene time span as dated by biostratigraphy, ESR, U-series, and magnetostratigraphy. We focus on the Sondeo South site, excavated from 1993 to 1999, which has yielded 1087 fish bones comprising the following taxa: brown trout (Salmo trutta), the common European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and chub (Squalius sp.). Taphonomic studies suggest that the European eagle owl (Bubo bubo) was the most likely predator responsible for the accumulation. Changes observed in the body size of brown trout through the sequence cannot be attributed to climate change (contravening Bergmann's rule). Our study documents the presence of a premountain river system characterized by permanent, oxygen-rich, relatively cold flowing waters around the Sierra de Atapuerca during Early-Middle Pleistocene times.","[Blanco-Lapaz, Angel] Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm SHEP, Holderlinstr 12, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Blanco-Lapaz, Angel] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, Rumelinstr 23, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Martinez-Monzon, Almudena; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Martinez-Monzon, Almudena; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Cuenca-Bescos, Gloria] Univ Zaragoza, Aragosaurus IUCA, Dept Ciencias Tierra, Fac Ciencias, C Pedro Cerbuna 12, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Zaragoza,"Blanco-Lapaz, A (corresponding author), Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm SHEP, Holderlinstr 12, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany.",angel.blanco-lapaz@uni-tuebingen.de,"Gloria, Cuenca-Bescós/A-3616-2013","Gloria, Cuenca-Bescós/0000-0001-5125-9651; Martinez-Monzon, Almudena/0000-0001-5120-9478","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MICINN [PGC2018-093925-B-C33]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2017SGR859]; Aragosaurus (Gobierno de Aragon); Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya [2021 FI_B2 00207]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence [CEX2019-000945-M]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Aragosaurus (Gobierno de Aragon); Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR)(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN))","Many people deserve thanks for their contributions to this study, in particular the Atapuerca Research Team for the extraction, sieving and washing of sediments each year.

To ensure rapid start-up times whilst retaining the structural reliability of the SOFC system components, requires a safe heating-up operation. To master a controlled heating-up stage, detailed understanding of the component interaction and multiphysics within a fuel cell system is required. State of the art dynamic fuel cell system modelling comprises sub-models of the assembly, or is based on empirical nature. However, invaluable information of the multiphysics inside the system is lost. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand and improve the knowledge of the detailed processes, occurring within the interacting components. The effect of integrating different electrical heater cartridges at different locations has been thoroughly investigated to optimise the heating up of the system. The study utilises a previously developed and experimentally validated full scale three dimensional planar type SOFC system model to mitigate experimental costs and shed light on the details, occurring within the system. A comparison to a simplified variant of the model has been added to shed light on its effect on the results. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While very few in situ observations are available to validate the soil moisture fields, the simulated runoff can be compared with river discharge measurements. This strategy is employed here to assess the quality of GSWP simulations based on the ISBA land surface model. The ISBA runoff is transformed into 10 x to gridded stream flows by using the TRIP river routing model. The focus is on the Amazon basin where all models participating in GSWP showed a strong underestimation in the annual runoff and a significant lag in the annual cycle of the runoff. A sample of 31 gauging stations is selected to validate the gridded runoff simulated by ISBA. Sensitivity tests have been performed, that suggest that deficiencies in both the precipitation forcing and the boundary conditions provided by ISLSCP contribute to the poor simulation of the Amazon water balance. The use of alternative precipitation, soil and vegetation datasets allows ISBA to produce a more realistic annual runoff, although the amplitude of the annual cycle remains exaggerated at the downstream gauging station of Obidos. Among these experiments, the simulation leading to the best annual runoff has been used as a reference to test simple modifications in the TRIP river routing model. Tuning the parameters of TRIP or increasing the resolution of the river channel network is not sufficient to improve the annual cycle of the simulated discharge. New developments are necessary to deal more explicitly with the floodplain inundation that occurs during the rainy season over the Amazon basin, and to derive a geographically variable and time-evolving stream flow velocity. In future, considerable efforts are needed to provide more reliable global land surface and forcing datasets in the continuation of GSWP, in order to validate more efficiently the land surface models and thereby to produce more realistic soil moisture climatologies.","Meteo France, F-31057 Toulouse, France; Inst Rech Dev, BR-71619970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of Tokyo,"Douville, H (corresponding author), Meteo France, 42 Ave Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",,"Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010","Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678",,,,,19,24,24,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The new version of the model takes advantage of the finite-volume approach, whereas its predecessor version, FESOM1.4 was based on the finite-element approach. The model sensitivity to arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) linear and nonlinear free-surface formulation, Gent-McWilliams eddy parameterization, isoneutral Redi diffusion and different vertical mixing schemes is documented. The hydrographic biases, large-scale circulation, numerical performance and scalability of FESOM2.0 are compared with its predecessor, FESOM1.4. FESOM2.0 shows biases with a magnitude comparable to FESOM1.4 and simulates a more realistic Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Compared to its predecessor, FESOM2.0 provides clearly defined fluxes and a 3 times higher throughput in terms of simulated years per day (SYPD). It is thus the first mature global unstructured-mesh ocean model with computational efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art structured-mesh ocean models.

The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II (Comfort Database), now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying right-here-right-now subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information. Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data.","[Licina, Veronika Foldvary; Zhang, Hui; Arens, Edward; Schiavon, Stefano; Luo, Maohui; Brager, Gail; Kaam, Soazig] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm, 390 Wurster Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cheung, Toby] Berkeley Educ Alliance Res Singapore, 1 Create Way, Singapore 138602, Singapore; [de Dear, Richard; Parkinson, Thomas; Deuble, Max; Kim, Jungsoo] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, IEQ Lab, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Chun, Chungyoon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Interior Architecture & Built Environm, Seoul, South Korea; [Li, Peixian] Univ British Columbia, Dept Civil Engn, 6250 Appl Sci Lane, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Adebamowo, Michael A.] Univ Lagos, Dept Architecture, Lagos, Nigeria; [Andamon, Mary Myla] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, 24 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Babich, Francesco; Cook, Malcolm; Loveday, Dennis] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Ashby Rd, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Bouden, Chiheb] ENIT, Rue Bechir Salem Belkhiria Campus Univ,BP 37, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Bukovianska, Hana; Petras, Dusan] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Bldg Serv, Radlinskeho 11, Bratislava 81005, Slovakia; [Candido, Christhina] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Cao, Bin; Zhu, Yingxin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Architecture, Dept Bldg Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Carlucci, Salvatore] Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hogskoleringen 7a, Trondheim, Norway; [Cheong, David K.

The latter utilizes plain machinery and equipment used for many decades and the only significant improvement made over the years has been the introduction of automation in the process. Still, at the beginning of the new century, there are ways and room for further vast improvements. More specifically, the low cost of rather advanced sensors and small-scale devices, now even connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), allowed them to be introduced in the process and used within agricultural production systems. New and emerging technologies and methodologies, like the utilization of cheap network storage, are expected to advance this development. In this sense, the main goals of this paper may be summarized as follows: (a) To identify, group, and acknowledge the current state-of-the-art research knowledge about intelligent agriculture approaches, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful data sources categories, and (c) to describe current efficient data processing and utilization aspects from the perspective of the main trends in the field.","[Voutos, Yorghos; Mylonas, Phivos; Katheniotis, John; Sofou, Anastasia] Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, Corfu 49132, Greece; [Sofou, Anastasia] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, GR-15773 Athens, Greece",Ionian University; National Technical University of Athens,"Mylonas, P (corresponding author), Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, Corfu 49132, Greece.",c16vout@ionio.gr; fmylonas@ionio.gr; jkathen@hotmail.com; natasa.sofou@gmail.com,"Mylonas, Phivos/AAF-2497-2019","Mylonas, Phivos/0000-0002-6916-3129; Voutos, Yorghos/0000-0002-4039-7714",European Union [5007310]; Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020 [5007310],European Union(European Commission); Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020,"This research was funded by the European Union and Greece (Partnership Agreement for the Development Framework 2014-2020) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020, project title: 'Smart vine variety selection and management using ICT-EYOINOS', project number: 5007310.",,68,6,7,9,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Jun,2019,12,,,,,,3278,10.3390/su11123278,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11123278,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IG4DG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000473753700048,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, workers have been confronted with multiple challenging demands: they have been required to develop flexibility in their jobs and to work faster and better, often with evident costs in terms of performance and their workplace well-being. Given these evidence, as also shown by some of the most recent developments in the field of Positive Work and Organizational Psychology, healthy organizations are those organizations that could resist to these challenges, because they engage in creating an environment that can promote employees' health and safety, maximising performance. Yet, healthy organizations support positive organizational behaviors through a coherent culture, a positive climate, and good practices. Healthy organizations might also create the conditions to encourage workers to perform job crafting behaviors, meant as proactive individual behaviours aimed at modifying job demands in order to adjust them to personal needs, motivations and talents, thus maximising well-being and performance. Objective: The aim of the study was to overview the state of the art of the debate about the relationship between job crafting and healthy organizations' factors by performing a scientometric analysis of job crafting. Therefore, the study was aimed to emphasize performances of countries, journals and authors, highlighting the dominant perspectives on the topic. Method: The starting point of the analysis was data recovery from the Scopus database using the term job crafting as search criterion within the title, abstract or keywords of the documents retrieved. The analysis was carried out with two softwares, R and VOSviewer, in order to investigate the growth of interest on the topic over the years, the scientific production of countries, journals and authors, the social structure of collaborative network, and the network of keywords. Results: 375 documents about job crafting were retrieved, showing a growing number of publications in recent years, with a preponderance of productions and citations in USA and Netherlands (where the construct was proposed and validated). Cluster analysis performed on the most frequently used keywords showed three main groups, each of them theoretical linked to workplace health: stimulus factors; Job Demands-Resources Model; health dimensions. Discussion: The present bibliometric analysis showed an increasing scientific interest toward job crafting and the importance of specific papers (that opened the two main perspective about it) for the whole research line. Through the cluster analysis of keywords network, it was underlined the relevance of constructs that promote healthy organizations in the scientific production on job crafting.","[Gemmano, Cataldo Giuliano; Caffo, Alessandro; Palmisano, Gianluca; Bosco, Andrea; Manuti, Amelia] Univ Bari, Dept Educ Sci Psychol Commun, Bari, Italy; [Signore, Fulvio] Univ Salento, Dept Hist Soc & Human Studies, Lecce, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Salento,"Manuti, A (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Dept Educ Sci Psychol Commun, Bari, Italy.",amelia.manuti@uniba.it,"Signore, Fulvio/AAZ-8499-2021","Gemmano, Cataldo Giuliano/0000-0003-4519-8594",,,,,94,4,4,2,10,UNIV STUDI SALENTO,LECCE,"EDIFICIO STUDIUM 2000, VIA DI VALESIO, LECCE, 73100, ITALY",2070-5948,,,ELECTRON J APPL STAT,Electron.

In a number of locations in north-west Europe, for example the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, DOC levels are increasing over time, most likely due to climate change effects and changes in land use. For these types of water, ion exchange (IX) is of interest as a pre-treatment option because the removal of colour and DOC by IX will increase the efficiency of all downstream processes, including: coagulation, membrane filtration, advanced oxidation processes (AOP) and granular activated carbon filtration (GAC). It will also lead to improved water quality (i.e., less by-product formation) and most likely improvements in biostability within the distribution network. Surface waters also contain suspended and colloidal matter, making it nearly impossible to use standard state-of-the-art, fixed bed IX columns. This is because these beds will foul quickly (i.e., head loss build-up) with suspended matter. When this happens, the IX bed starts to function as a filtration bed rather than as an adsorption media. The newly developed suspended ion exchange process SIX (R) (suspended ion exchange, PWN Technologies, Netherlands) presents an advanced solution for a world-wide challenge: how to remove natural organic matter (NOM/DOC) as a first step in surface water treatment to improve the efficiency of downstream processes and water quality. In addition to the possibility to treat water that contains suspended matter, another advantage is that the process has advanced to an economically and technically feasible process, requiring low contact times and small resin inventories, with a large tolerance for flow fluctuations. Depending on the water source, adding a relatively low concentration of coagulant after IX removes even greater quantities of DOC, especially in the fraction of the high molecular weight organic carbon (whilst the IX primarily removed the humic and fulvic organic fractions). The most important advancement is that almost any commercially available resin can be used, creating the desired flexibility in resin suppliers for water supply companies. This paper describes the process and its advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional technologies. NOM-characterisation with size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography - organic carbon detection (SEC/LC-OCD) before and after this process showed the outstanding performance of the process, especially on water types which contain high colour/DOC-concentrations and low total dissolved solids, which are typical of the majority of the surface waters in the north-west of Europe.","[Galjaard, G.; Koreman, E.] PWN Technol, Dijkweg 1, NL-1619 HA Andijk, Netherlands; [Metcalfe, D.] South West Water, Exeter, Devon, England; [Moore, G.] Scottish Water, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland; [Ericsson, Per] Norrvatten, Sundbyberg, Sweden",,"Galjaard, G (corresponding author), PWN Technol, Dijkweg 1, NL-1619 HA Andijk, Netherlands.",ggaljaard@pwntechnologies.com,,,European Regional Development Fund; Dutch Government; Province of North Holland; Interreg,European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Dutch Government; Province of North Holland; Interreg,"This research has partly been carried out within the Interreg 2 Seas project DOC2C's.

STRATIGRAPHY AND PALAEOGEOGRAPHIC EVOLUTION FROM UPPER PLENIGLACIAL TO RECENT HOLOCENE The Scarpe plain is a depression in the Eocene marine sands between the Pevele and Ostrevant regions. A high plain is distinguished northwards from a low plain southwards. The infilling is mainly sandy (with a peaty part in the low plain). Numerous micro-topographics are scattered throughout the plain. The small water courses which drain the plain are not proportionate to its size. The laying of a gas pipeline across the plain was preceded by archaeological borings. We present the stratigraphy as a long cross-section and propose an evolution scenario for the plain since the Weichselian Upper Pleniglacial. The sedimentation consists mainly of sandy beds alternating with loamy laminae. This alluvial sheet, present everywhere in the plain, was deposited under strongly contrasted hydrological conditions during the Weichselian Upper Pleniglacial (OSL dates about 34, 21 and 21 ka). It may be correlated to the northern sand belt Older conversand 1. Repeated avulsions of wide yet shallow channels have left deflection marks in the micro-topography. The high plain is comparable to flat and broad alluvial fans emanating from Pevele. At the end of the Weichselian Upper Pleniglacial, under a dryer climate, small elongated dunes (sand or sand alternating with loess) formed in the center of the plain or alongside the Pevele border (OSL dates about 19 and 15 ka). This phase is at least partly contemporary with the Beuningen gravel bed. An ultimate deflation phase is imputed to the Younger Dryas. This last aeolian deposit is even fainter and looks like a thin yet continuous sheet restricted to a large southern part of the plain. Slightly scoured Late Glacial and Holocene streams can be found in the last state of Pleniglacial channels (04 dates since 12345 BP). The former main Pleniglacial channels may thus constitute the overbank channel of the faint Late Glacial and Holocene channels. During the Holocene, the water table rose and consecutively the peat spread in the lower areas of the plain.

To date, PPR has been confirmed in more than 70 countries. In China, PPR has occurred in more than 20 provinces and cities. In this study, based on geographic information system (GIS), spatial analysis was used to examine the occurrence of PPR in China from 2007 to 2018. The results showed that PPR first occurred in Tibet and gradually spread to other provinces. The outbreaks of PPR were concentrated in 2014, 2015 and 2018. Combining climate factors with the maximum entropy (MaxEnt), the results also suggested that the potential risk areas of PPR outbreaks in China were mainly Jiangsu, Yunnan and Anhui in Southeast China. Finally, a phylogenetic tree was used to analyse the evolutionary relationship between the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) in China and the global ones, and it was found that the one in China had a close genetic relationship with the one in Mongolia, India and Bangladesh. Understanding and forecasting the distribution of PPR in China will help policymakers develop targeted monitoring plans. Likewise, analysing the global PPRV epidemic trends will play an important role in the elimination and prevention of PPR.","[Niu, Bing; Liang, Ruirui; Zhang, Shuwen; Sun, Xiaodong; Zhang, Hui; Bao, Songhao; Zhong, Junjie; Chen, Qin] Shanghai Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Li, Fuchen] Vanderbilt Univ, Coll Art & Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Qiu, Songyin] Chinese Acad Inspect & Quarantine, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinxiang] Shanghai Univ, Coll Sci, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Vanderbilt University; Chinese Academy of Inspection & Quarantine; Shanghai University,"Niu, B; Chen, Q (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.;Li, XX (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Coll Sci, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",bingniu@shu.edu.cn; xinxiang.lee@ishu.edu.cn; chen-qincc@shu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0501101]; High Performance Computing Center Program of Shanghai University,National Key Research and Development Program of China; High Performance Computing Center Program of Shanghai University,"National Key Research andDevelopment Programof China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFD0501101; HighPerformanceComputing Center Programof Shanghai University by PPR epidemics is as high as 145-210 million US dollars (Jones et al., 2016).

The problems of development of a regional investment policy mechanism, increase in the efficiency of implementing investment potential, and, therefore, investment activity and attractiveness, and improvement of the investment climate are one of the key topics in the field of regional economic policy. Traditionally, the definition of investment attractiveness means the existence of such investment conditions that affect investor preferences in the choice of an investment object [2, p.47]. Conducting a sound investment policy stipulates control of investment parameters of economic development, one of which is the investment potential. The market economy model objectively assumes rivalry of regions for funds available for investment. In order to attract these resources to their territories, regional authorities, first of all, should correctly assess their competitive positions, their strengths and weaknesses [12, p.219]. In this article, the system of realizing the investment potential of the Republic of Tatarstan, one of the most favorable regions for the investment of the Russian Federation, is considered. A purposeful impact on the factors of the investment environment can improve the efficiency of managing the regional investment process, and fully unlock an investment potential [8, p.5077].

The hindcast, covering the period 1979-2013, has been obtained using WavewatchIII with calibrated source-term parameters recently proposed by L. Mentaschi et al. (2015) [1]. The main advantage of such a calibration is that it takes into account the peculiarity of the Mediterranean basin with respect to other calibrations carried out in the oceans. The high resolution allowed to perform a detailed analysis of wave energy potential characteristics providing information on seasonal and longer term variability necessary for reliable and optimal design of wave energy conversion devices. As a result, the identification of areas where the mean wave power reaches values of the order of 10 kW/m clearly emerge. However, these regions are not necessarily optimal in relation to the efficiency of energy extraction, due to possible relevant time variation of the energy availability. The high temporal resolution allows to address issues related to the time variability of the available resource and thus to provide a complete set of statistical information to carry out optimal design of WEC (wave energy converter).

In brief, the proposed optimization model considers: (i) unit commitment constraints for boilers and turbines; (ii) minimum and maximum runtimes as well as minimum idle times for boilers and turbines; (iii) bounds on the operating levels for boilers and turbines within desired operating regions; (iv) extreme operating regions for turbines; (v) energy balances for turbines; (vi) total electricity and heat balances for satisfying the corresponding demands for electricity and heat (for each heat network); and (vii) maintenance tasks for units that must occur within given flexible time-windows. The minimization of the annual total cost of the cogeneration plant constitutes the optimization goal here, and consists of startup and shutdown costs, fixed operating and fuel costs, maintenance costs, and penalties for deviation from heat and electricity demands, and penalties for turbines for operating outside the desired operating regions. An extensive data analysis of historical data has been performed to extract the necessary input data. In comparison to the implemented industrial solution that follows a predefined maintenance policy, the solutions derived by the proposed approach achieve reductions in annual total cost more than 21% and completely avoid turbines operation outside their desired operating regions. Our solutions report substantial reductions in startup/shutdown, fuel and fixed operating costs (about 85%, 15%, and 13%, respectively). The comparative case study clearly demonstrates that the proposed approach is an effective means for generating optimal energy production and maintenance plans, enhancing significantly the resource and energy efficiency of the plant. Importantly, the proposed optimization framework could be readily applied to other cogeneration plants that have a similar plant structure.","[Kopanos, Georgios M.; Murele, Oluwatosin C.] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Silvente, Javier] UCL, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London WC1E 7JE, England; [Zhakiyev, Nurkhat; Akhmetbekov, Yerbol] Nazarbayev Univ, Natl Lab Astana, Energy Ecol & Climate Lab, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan; [Tutkushev, Damir] Kazakhstan Util Syst LLP, Karaganda 100012, Kazakhstan",Cranfield University; University of London; University College London; Nazarbayev University,"Kopanos, GM (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",g.kopanos@cranfield.ac.uk,"Zhakiyev, Nurkhat K/D-6159-2017","Zhakiyev, Nurkhat K/0000-0002-4904-2047","Royal Academy of Engineering under the project Increase of energy efficiency in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants using state-of-the-art optimization methods: Case study in LLP KUS [IAPP\1516\115]; Petroleum Technology Development Fund, Nigeria [PTDF/ED/PHD/MOC/876/16]","Royal Academy of Engineering under the project Increase of energy efficiency in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants using state-of-the-art optimization methods: Case study in LLP KUS; Petroleum Technology Development Fund, Nigeria","Financial support from the Royal Academy of Engineering under the project Increase of energy efficiency in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants using state-of-the-art optimization methods: Case study in LLP KUS (Ref: IAPP\1516\115) is gratefully acknowledged.

The cause of this increase can be attributed to a variety of factors including global climatic change, an increase in global population, and a related increase in the use of lands more vulnerable to natural disaster events. Timely monitoring and warning of natural disaster events is critical to our ability to respond to and recover from these disasters. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is the next generation of environmental satellites to study the Earth and its climate. It will provide a significant increase in the ability to monitor and respond to disaster events by increasing temporal resolution and decreasing the timeline required for information to be accessible to ground stations. This paper will present an introduction to NPOESS and discuss its potential utility in natural disaster monitoring and response efforts in combination with state of the art data mining techniques. NPOESS is a constellation of low orbiting polar satellites capable of achieving near global coverage and is supplemented with a next generation METSAT capability. Its primary mission is the observation of Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere, including the troposphere, stratosphere and the near space boundary. This system, due to come online in approximately 2013, will replace the United States' current constellation of environmental and weather satellites. NPOESS will revolutionize the way remote sensing is used in natural hazard monitoring and response efforts. It will allow simultaneous or near-simultaneous collection of atmospheric phenomena by multiple sensors. This capability will increase our understanding of atmospheric phenomena by reducing time between collections of data from multiple sensors and by providing a common platform for data distribution and analysis. The new sensor types flown in NPOESS will also increase our collection capabilities. Increased data collection capability allows for advanced analysis of the atmosphere and will lead to better forecasting of natural hazard formation, development, and evolution. These increases in technical capability and bandwidth provide significantly more data for data mining algorithms. These algorithms have the ability to quickly interpret remotely sensed data and provide timely products to the natural disaster response community. While the NPOESS data provide a new testing ground for existing algorithms, it will also lead to the development of new algorithms driven by the need to efficiently exploit the volume of data produced by this system. The combination of new capabilities within NPOESS and the development of new advanced data mining applications will provide the disaster response community with the tools it needs to face the challenges of the new century.","[Bowman, Mark C.; Foster, Kyle; Wilkerson, Matthew] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Bowman, MC (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-4562-2,,,,2009,,,,,1179,1182,,,,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Remote Sensing,BOU28,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000277622400224,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observational analyses show that a warm SST anomaly in TNA during spring can induce a warm SST anomaly in the western part of the western North Pacific (WNP) in subsequent autumn, through a chain of air-sea coupled processes such as Rossby-wave response, wind-evaporation-SST feedback, and westward advection of warm surface water. The physical mechanisms are verified using a suite of coupled numerical experiments performed by the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model. The warm SST anomaly in the western part of WNP is responsible for the genesis and intensification of intense TCs in situ, and the climatologically mean southeasterly steering flow is favourable for the intense TCs to make landfall over mainland China.","[Gao, Si] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Si] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Si; Shen, Xinyong] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhifan; Shen, Xinyong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhifan; Shen, Xinyong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Iowa,"Zhang, W (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",wei-zhang-3@uiowa.edu,"Zhang, Wei/J-3155-2019","Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-8134-6908","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFC1510400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41930967, 41575078, 41975054]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science [XDA20100304]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2019YFC1510400; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41930967, 41575078, 41975054; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science, Grant/Award Number: XDA20100304",,48,6,6,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The last decade has seen a step change in technology and analytical approaches available to define, manage and conserve Farm Animal Genomic Resources (FAnGR). However, these rapid changes pose challenges for FAnGR conservation in terms of technological continuity, analytical capacity and integrative methodologies needed to fully exploit new, multidimensional data. The final conference of the ESF Genomic Resources program aimed to address these interdisciplinary problems in an attempt to contribute to the agenda for research and policy development directions during the coming decade. By 2020, according to the Convention on Biodiversity's Aichi Target 13, signatories should ensure that the genetic diversity of ...farmed and domesticated animals and of wild relatives ...is maintained, and strategies have been developed and implemented for minimizing genetic erosion and safeguarding their genetic diversity. However, the real extent of genetic erosion is very difficult to measure using current data Therefore, this challenging target demands better coverage, understanding and utilization of genomic and environmental data, the development of optimized ways to integrate these data with social and other sciences and policy analysis to enable more flexible, evidence based models to underpin FAnGR conservation. At the conference, we attempted to identify the most important problems for effective livestock genomic resource conservation during the next decade. Twenty priority questions were identified that could be broadly categorized into challenges related to methodology, analytical approaches, data management and conservation. It should be acknowledged here that while the focus of our meeting was predominantly around genetics, genomics and animal science, many of the practical challenges facing conservation of genomic resources are societal in origin and are predicated on the value (e.g., socio-economic and cultural) of these resources to farmers, rural communities and society as a whole. The overall conclusion is that despite the fact that the livestock sector has been relatively well-organized in the application of genetic methodologies to date, there is still a large gap between the current state-of-the-art in the use of tools to characterize genomic resources and its application to many non-commercial and local breeds, hampering the consistent utilization of genetic and genomic data as indicators of genetic erosion and diversity. The livestock genomic sector therefore needs to make a concerted effort in the coming decade to enable to the democratization of the powerful tools that are now at its disposal, and to ensure that they are applied in the context of breed conservation as well as development.","[Bruford, Michael W.; Orozco-terWengell, Pablo; Barbato, Mario; Costa, Mafalda] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Bruford, Michael W.] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Ginja, Catarina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteragoes Ambientais CE3C, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ginja, Catarina] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet CIBIO, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Hoffmann, Irene] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Anim Genet Resources Branch, Anim Prod & Hlth Div, Rome, Italy; [Joost, Stephane; Duruz, Solange; Leempoel, Kevin] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Geog Informat Syst LASIG, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Alberto, Florian J.; Pompanon, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Amaral, Andreia J.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, BioISO Biosyst & Integrat Sci Inst, Campo Grande, Portugal; [Biscarini, Filippo; Nicolazzi, Ezequiel L.] Parco Tecnol Padano, Lodi, Italy; [Colli, Licia; Ajmone-Marsan, Paolo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore Piacenza, Ist Zootecn, BioDNA Ctr Ric Biodiversita DNA Ant, Piacenza, Italy; [Curik, Ino; Ferencakovic, Maja] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Fischer, Daniel; Kantanen, Juha] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Green Technol, Jokioinen, Finland; [Fitak, Robert] Vetmeduni, Inst Populat Genet, Vienna, Austria; [Groeneveld, Linn F.] NordGen, As, Norway; [Hall, Stephen J.

The research was carried out in 12 sites in the Triangulo Mineiro region, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The study area is part the Cerrado biome and, of the 12 sites, three were composed of fragments of cerrado sensu stricto (s.s.), three by abandoned pastures, three by veredas and three by eucalypt plantation. The collection of litter arthropods occurred through pitfall traps in the dry and rainy seasons. The individuals collected were identified at the family level and categorized according to the tmphic function and body size. Although the different ecosystems in isolation did not influence the quantitative parameters of arthropod communities, an important interaction between ecosystems and seasonality was observed. During the rainy season the litter arthropod communities in cerrado s.s. and veredas presented similar richness with slightly greater Simpson diversity in the cerrado s.s., but the veredas were much richer and diverse than other ecosystems in the dry season. A high diversity was also observed in the eucalypt plantations in the rainy season, but with a low functional richness. The functional and taxonomic compositions of the litter arthropod communities differed among ecosystems. In addition, even with a high richness in anthropized ecosystems, the communities present in the savannas were not similar to those present in anthropized ecosystems. Therefore, it was observed that the litter arthropod communities formed spatial and temporal mosaics that play complementary roles in supporting litter arthropod biodiversity.","[Soares, Danubia Magalhaes; Nascimento, Andre R.

Therefore educators should have the responsibility to create awareness for the problems of electronic waste. Devices such as mobile phones contain environmental pollutants, heavy metals, dangerous chemical compounds as well as very rare and valuable resources. These resources are very difficult to recycle and therefore many broken or outdated electronic devices are thrown away. Students have to be aware of these problems and change their behaviours, and to act responsibly and in a sustainable way. In this paper, we present the concept of our project Schrotty (Schrott stands in German for waste) intended to find possible solutions to create this awareness and we will share results and lessons learnt from the first project year. Awareness can only be created if people understand the underlying technology. To achieve this, teachers have to provide students with appropriate situations and possibilities to learn about electronics. Also they should understand possibilities and problems of prototyping platforms, mobile devices and 3D-Printing. Two problems often reported are - especially in primary schools- the lack of knowledge of teachers about the technical background in physics, chemistry or electricity and the limited financial resources of schools. In our project, we bring together schools and organizations dealing with electronic waste. Therefore knowledge and resources can be provided by the participating companies and children learn about the work and goals of these companies. By using obsolete devices and electronic parts students can learn about the basics of electronics in a constructivist way by trial and error. Since abandoned electronic components are free of charge, students are able to learn from their mistakes without fearing consequences when something is broken. We have created an Internet platform to exchange pedagogical material as well as experience of teachers and students. We intend to start a process where organizations and teachers work together to develop courses and workshops to increase their knowledge on these topics as well as to create awareness. Students who participate in this project and who the results are aimed at are between 10 to 18 years old. The workshops can either be conducted in the fields of art (making decorations and jewellery out of broken or discarded electronic equipment), technology (reusing parts of abandoned devices for building e.g. robots, microphones and speakers) or didactics (students research and create learning materials about sustainability). With a special video platform we intend to give students the possibility to publish their experience and to motivate and help other students.","[Sprung, G.; Strohmaier, R.; Schadenbauer, S.; Nischelwitzer, A.] FH JOANNEUM Univ Appl Sci, Vienna, Austria",,"Sprung, G (corresponding author), FH JOANNEUM Univ Appl Sci, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Strohmaier, Robert/0000-0003-1837-9939",,,,,27,0,0,1,4,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-606-8243-1,EDULEARN PROC,,,2015,,,,,2168,2175,,,,,,8,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BE8PL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000376685702038,View Full Record in Web of Science

USA) this study examines the effects of a set of environmental parameters on the foraminiferal distribution. The studied parameters are: elevation above mean high water: salinity of the porewater: various sediment characteristics: vegetation: and food source. Relations between the environmental parameters and foraminiferal properties (frequencies. densities and diversities) are quantified with correlation coefficients. For the first time Siphotrochammina lobata and Balticammina pseudomacrescens are documented in the New England region. The following species show a significant correlation with one or more of the studied parameters and are designated as key-species: Haplophragmoides manilaensis. Jadammina macrescens. Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Milammina fusca and Tiphotrocha comprimata. Based on cluster analysis and the presence. absence or dominance of the key-species characteristic associations art: distinguished. The distribution of three associations is indicative of specific marsh environments: the marsh fringe, the middle marsh and the marsh edge. These three marsh units are separated by their own salinity regime. flooding and sediment characteristics. The marsh fringe is typified by the H. manilaensis, Association and experiences freshwater input (seepage, surface runoff and rainwater) and only slight marine influence. resulting in low salinity values (2.5-20 parts per thousand). The width of the marsh fringe is variable, dependent on the amount of seepage which in turn is controlled by the permeability of the basement and the peat. The J. macrescens Association characterizes the middle marsh where salinities are controlled by infiltration of sea- and rainwater and by evaporation. Salinity values are higher than 20 parts per thousand while temporarily salinity can reach extreme high values during periods without flooding and high evaporation rates (e.g., 44 parts per thousand). The fully marine M. fusca Association occupies the daily hooded marsh edge where,:he salinities have the same values as Cape Cod bay water (ca. 28 parts per thousand). Unlike many other salt marshes the distribution of foraminiferal assemblages in the Great Marshes does not show a vertical zonation with respect to mean high water. This shows that a worldwide applicable model for paleoenvironmental studies in salt marshes based on foraminifera is not feasible. Each salt marsh has its own characteristics. Regional factors such as climate play an important role in the salinity regime. while the local upland characteristics determine if seepage takes place. Thus each marsh has its own foraminiferal fingerprint showing the opportunistic behaviour of the salt marsh agglutinants. A surface study is an indispensable first step in assessing the value of foraminifera as paleo-ecological indicators.

However, it can be difficult to execute robust morphological identification of fish bones from species-rich fossil assemblages, especially from post-cranial material with few distinguishing features. Fragmentation, weathering and burning further impede taxonomic identification, resulting in large numbers of unidentifiable bones from archaeological sites. This limitation can be somewhat mitigated by taking an ancient DNA (aDNA) bulk-bone metabarcoding (BBM) approach to faunal identification, where DNA from non-diagnostic bone fragments is extracted and sequenced in parallel. However, a large proportion of fishing communities (both past and present) live in tropical regions that have sub-optimal conditions for long-term aDNA preservation. To date, the BBM method has never been applied to fish bones before, or to fossils excavated from an exposed context within a tropical climate. Here, we demonstrate that morphologically indistinct bulk fish bone from the tropics can be identified by sequencing aDNA extracted from 100 to 300 ya archaeological midden material in southwest Madagascar. Despite the biases of the approach, we rapidly obtained family, genus, and species level assemblage information, and used this to describe a subset of the ichthyofauna exploited by an 18th century fishing community. We identified 23 families of fish, including benthic, pelagic, and coral dwelling fishes, suggesting a reliance on a variety of marine and brackish habitats. When possible, BBM should be used alongside osteological approaches to address the limitations of both; however, this study highlights how genetic methods can nevertheless be a valuable tool for helping resolve faunal assemblages when morphological identification is hindered by taphonomic processes, lack of adequate comparative collections, and time constraints, and can provide a temporal perspective on fish biodiversity in the context of accelerated exploitation of the marine environment.

However, state of the art SSM retrieval products suffer from very poor coverage over northern latitudes. In this study, we propose an innovative drought indicator with a wider spatial and temporal coverage than that obtained from satellite SSM retrievals. We evaluate passive microwave brightness temperature observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite as a surrogate drought metric, and introduce a Standardized Brightness Temperature Index (STBI). We compute the STBI by fitting a Gaussian distribution using monthly brightness temperature data from SMOS; the normal assumption is tested using the Shapior-Wilk test. Our results indicate that the assumption of normally distributed brightness temperature data is valid at the 0.05 significance level. The STBI is validated against drought indices from a land surface data assimilation system (LDAS-Monde), two satellite derived SSM indices, one from SMOS and one from the ESA CCI soil moisture project and a standardized precipitation index based on in situ data from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project. When comparing the temporal dynamics of the STBI to the LDAS-Monde drought index we find that it has equal correlation skill to that of the ESA CCI soil moisture product (0.71). However, in addition the STBI provides improved spatial coverage because no masking has been applied over regions with dense boreal forest. Finally, we evaluate the STBI in a case study of the 2018 Nordic drought. The STBI is found to provide improved spatial and temporal coverage when compared to the drought index created from satellite derived SSM over the Nordic region. Our results indicate that when compared to drought indices from precipitation data and a land data assimilation system, the STBI is qualitatively able to capture the 2018 drought onset, severity and spatial extent. We did see that the STBI was unable to detect the 2018 drought recovery for some areas in the Nordic countries. This false drought detection is likely linked to the recovery of vegetation after the drought, which causes an increase in the passive microwave brightness temperature, hence the STBI shows a dry anomaly instead of normal conditions, as seen for the other drought indices. We argue that the STBI could provide additional information for drought monitoring in regions where the SSM retrieval problem is not well defined. However, it then needs to be accompanied by a vegetation index to account for the recovery of the vegetation which could cause false drought detection.","[Blyverket, Jostein; Hamer, Paul D.; Schneider, Philipp; Lahoz, William A.] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Inst Veien 18, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway; [Blyverket, Jostein] Univ Bergen UiB, Geofys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Albergel, Clement] Univ Toulouse, CNRM, Meteo France, CNRS, F-31057 Toulouse, France",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; University of Bergen; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse,"Blyverket, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Inst Veien 18, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway.;Blyverket, J (corresponding author), Univ Bergen UiB, Geofys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",jb@nilu.no; pdh@nilu.no; philipp.schneider@nilu.no; clement.albergel@meteo.fr; wal@nilu.no,,"Blyverket, Jostein/0000-0003-1777-1971; Schneider, Philipp/0000-0001-5686-8683; Hamer, Paul/0000-0003-0645-2932; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702",Research Council of Norway (NFR PhD-grant) [239947],Research Council of Norway (NFR PhD-grant),"The main author is supported by the Research Council of Norway (NFR PhD-grant 239947, 2015-2019).",,47,7,7,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,2-May,2019,10,,,,,,1200,10.3390/rs11101200,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11101200,,,18,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,IQ1QG,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000480524800058,View Full Record in Web of Science

Effects of firming of seedbeds with various sowing depths and water contents,ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); compaction; evaporation; rolling after sowing; soil texture,SEEDLING EMERGENCE,"Extensive experiments were carried out in shallow plastic boxes placed directly on the ground in the field to study the effects of seedbed properties on the emergence of various crops in a cool temperate climate. In a group of experiments with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), we studied the effects on crop emergence of firming (slight compaction) of the seedbed, simulating the recompacting effects of rolling after sowing or press wheels on the seed coulters. Most of the experiments were carried out without irrigation after sowing. The firming usually had a slightly positive effect on emergence when the water content in the surface layer at sowing was below the wilting point. When the water content in the surface layer was higher, firming often reduced emergence drastically, particularly with deep sowing and in coarse-textured soils. The main reason for negative effects was harmful hardening of the surface layer when the more firm seedbed gradually dried out. When irrigation kept the seedbed continuously moist, the negative effect of firming was almost eliminated. Very high initial water content in the basal layer tended to delay surface layer drying and hardening, and to reduce the negative effect of firming. Firming only slightly influenced the evaporative water losses from the soil. In contrast to the results presented here, previous field trials with cereals have usually resulted in more positive effects of rolling after sowing. This indicates that other effects than firming, such as modification of sowing depth and reshaping of the soil surface, are other important effects of rolling.","[Hakansson, Inge; Rydberg, Tomas; Keller, Thomas; Arvidsson, Johan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Keller, Thomas] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Arvidsson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, POB 7014, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",johan.arvidsson@mark.slu.se,"Keller, Thomas/AAC-3317-2019","Keller, Thomas/0000-0002-9383-3209",,,,,18,4,4,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

The site is located in the Gaia River Valley, on the southern Catalonian coast. The shelter, situated at the foot of a low limestone wall, was discovered in 1994. Preliminary fieldwork was performed in 1995, comprising excavation of the early Holocene layers and the sampling of the stratigraphic succession. The geoarchaeological study was undertaken using a descriptive approach and so far has included a geomorphological survey of the surroundings, the stratigraphic study of the site and micromorphological analysis. High priority goals are a diachronic reconstruction of environmental change at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary and an understanding of the relationships between anthropic and non-anthropic dynamics, paying special attention to site formation processes. The site's archaeological record represents human occupations affiliated to the microlaminar Epipalaeolithic (complex C and unit B) and to early Holocene macrolithic technocomplexes (unit A), according to the lithic assemblages recovered. Artefacts, by-products, ecofacts, manuports and art objects were collected during excavations and archaeological features were detected. The results of the micromorphological study show that the abrupt climate changes around the Pleistocene-Holocene (PH) limit are well recognisable at the site. The beginning of the Younger Dryas (YD) and the PH limit are both represented by erosional surfaces and by the inwash of slope sediments cutting the late glacial pre-YD alluvial succession deposited by the Gaia River. The shift from alluvial to a gravity-driven sedimentary system is the result of an overall modification of the valley's morphodynamics. The early Holocene units record the transition to a Mediterranean environment and the stabilisation of the slope. Human inputs are abundant in the entire stratigraphic succession, except in the YD layers, where a sudden decrease is observed. Anthropic activities determined the accumulation and modification of various components and the formation of anthropogenic microfacies and features. The observation of micromorphological samples from layer A, which contains occasional potsherds, suggests its in situ position, which is in contrast with the existing models on the regional processes of neolithisation. A comparison between the pedo-sedimentary and archaeological records indicates that the timing of environmental and cultural change at Abric de la Cativera is differential, suggesting that the latter results from behavioural and cultural dynamics, rather from environmental factors.

Thermal orbits are phase-space representations of air and ground temperature relationships that are generated by plotting daily or monthly ground temperatures against air temperatures. Thermal orbits are useful descriptive tools that provide straightforward illustrations of air and ground temperature relationships in the presence of land surface processes related to snow cover, soil freezing, and vegetation effects. The utility of thermal orbits has been limited, however, by the lack of quantitative analyses that describe changes in orbits across different environments or in time. This shortcoming is overcome in the present study by developing a linear regression analysis of thermal orbits that allows changes to be tracked in time and space and as a function of depth within the subsurface. The theory that underlies the thermal orbit regression analysis is developed herein, and the utility of the application is demonstrated using controlled model experiments.","[Smerdon, Jason E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Beltrami, Hugo; Creelman, Chance; Stevens, M.

Design/methodology/approach - Fungal strains producing natural colours of different shades were isolated. Colourant production was carried out by fermentation method. Natural lime, milk, oil-in-water emulsion paints using natural microbial colours and eco-friendly ingredients were prepared. Bio-paint applications were carried out and evaluated. Findings - Our results indicate that microbes in general and fungi in specific represent dependable source of variety of natural colours, and cost-effective durable natural paints can be prepared with commonly available natural ingredients using scientific information based on history of paints. Research limitations/implications - Natural colours are gaining importance because of their use in health, nutrition, pharmaceutical, textile and environmental applications. Nature is quite rich in several types of colourants. Chemical synthesis of synthetic dyes is complex and not environmental friendly. Microbial dyes manufactured can evade inherent environmental problems of synthetic dyes and offer significant opportunity as a colourant in paints. However, only generally regarded as safe microbial strains are to be considered for colour production. Practical implications - Choosing natural alternatives to protect the health and environment is the need of hour. Fungal colourants are relatively more stable and robust and offer significant opportunity as a colourant in paints. Cost-effective durable natural paints can be prepared using selected stable fungal colourants with commonly available natural ingredients. High diversity of rich and complex natural colourants can be obtained from microorganisms. With the available techniques of fermentation, natural colours can be produced in large quantities of on an economically viable scale and explored for their applications. Social implications - Bio-paints are eco-friendly natural paints, low volatile organic compounds (VOC) paints or organic paints alternate to conventional paints. Most of these natural paints are durable, breathable, prevent moisture problems, contribute to a positive room climate, use safer technology and are less energy-intensive than conventional latex paints to produce. These paints improve indoor air quality and reduce urban smog and offer beneficial characteristics such as low odour, excellent durability and a washable finish. Originality/value - Many of the old art works that still survive today are a tangible proof and evidence of beauty and durability of natural paints. Organic materials used in these paints include natural pigments of mineral, plant and animal origin and other raw biodegradable ingredients. Successful commercialisation of many microbial pigments for food and textile applications is reported in literature. Therefore, present research work aims at developing natural paints using microbial pigments and recipes that have been successfully used by people for years.","[Sastry, D.

Materials science has had a key role in lowering CO2 emissions from the electricity sector through the development of technologies for renewable energy generation and high-performance energy storage. However, outside of the energy sector, there remain considerable greenhouse gas emissions linked to materials production, particularly due to growth in the built environment infrastructure, transportation and chemicals manufacture. This Review focuses on the challenge of reducing the emissions impact of materials production. We assess the potential for decarbonization in the cement, metals (including steel and aluminium) and chemicals manufacturing industries, including the potential to reduce emissions from the inputs to the production and the transformation processes, as well as through the design of desired outputs.

To date however PSS application has remained niche due to a variety of critical barriers. This paper explores how 'demand pull' national government policies could support PSS activity by addressing these barriers and cultivating market demand. Lessons are drawn from a case study of how regulatory, economic incentive, informative and procurement policies have supported Energy Service Company (ESCo) activity in the UK; a sub-set of the PSS family focused on energy service provision. Subsequently five policy recommendations are presented to support PSS activity: (1) balancing economic incentives and regulatory disincentives; (2) promoting indirect policy support; (3) redesigning existing market structures; (4) promoting locally-led PSS activity; and (5) creating stable policy frameworks. The paper warns however that national government policy cannot easily address all PSS barriers, such as customer preferences, international developments, technological progress and inherent business model weaknesses, pointing to the need for other complementary solutions. Furthermore, other governance actors beside national government could also implement PSS supporting policies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The objective of the pan-European assessment using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was not to outcompete any regional- or national-scale modelling, but to harmonize and improve our knowledge and our understanding of current soil erosion rates by water across the European Union. The focus of such a modelling project is on the differences and similarities between regions and countries beyond national borders and nationally adapted models. In order to do so, a state-of-the-art large-scale spatially distributed modelling exercise using harmonized datasets and a unified methodology to suit the pan-European scale was carried out. We reply that the semi-qualitative approach proposed by Evans and Boardman (2016) is not suitable for application at the European scale because of work force and time requirements, input data accessibility issues, accuracy of field-based estimates, subjectivity of soil loss estimates during the aerial and terrestrial photo interpretation, impossibility of upscaling or downscaling, inadequate representation of sheet erosion processes, lack of spatial and temporal representativeness, and lack of detailed description expressing the risk level. As such, their methodology has limited applicability, with today's financial resources it is not feasible at European or at national scale and, most important, cannot respond to policy requests regarding scenarios of climate and land cover/use change. In contrast to Evans and Boardman (2016), we do know that RUSLE, like probably any other approach, is not able to reproduce reality. The latter is actually a misjudgment which has been extensively discussed 20 years ago. Modelling in general and large-scale modelling specifically can per se not aim at an accurate prediction of point measurements, but tests our hypothesis on process understanding, relative spatial and temporal variations, scenario development and controlling factors (Oreskes et al., 1994). As such, our approach can be offered as a helpful tool to policy makers at pan-European scale. We are confident that the simple transparent structure of RUSLE as well as the discussion of the uncertainties of each modelling factor will help to supply objective guidance to policy makers.

Ground-based and spaceborne measurements with lidar, radar, and radiometric techniques are discussed together with a global view on past and ongoing remote sensingmeasurement campaigns concerned with the study of ice formation and evolution. This chapter has the intention of a literature study and should illustrate themajor efforts that are currently taken in the field of remote sensing of atmospheric ice. Since other chapters of this monograph mainly focus on aircraft in situ measurements, special emphasis is put on active remote sensing instruments and synergies between aircraft in situ measurements and passive remote sensing methods. The chapter concentrates on homogeneous and heterogeneous ice formation in the troposphere because this is a major topic of this monograph. Furthermore, methods that deliver direct, process-level information about ice formation are elaborated with a special emphasis on active remote sensing methods. Passive remote sensingmethods are also dealtwith but only in the context of synergy with aircraft in situ measurements.","[Buehl, J.; Kalesse, H.] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Alexander, S.] Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas, Australia; [Alexander, S.] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Crewell, S.] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Heymsfield, A.] NCAR, Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorol Lab, Phys Meteorol Sect, Boulder, CO USA; [Khain, A.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Maahn, M.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO USA; [Maahn, M.] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Van Tricht, K.] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Wendisch, M.] Leipzig Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); Australian Antarctic Division; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); University of Tasmania; University of Cologne; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; KU Leuven,"Buhl, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany.",buehl@tropos.de,"amplification,  - Arctic/AAU-6640-2020; Noyhouzer, Tomer/J-5066-2015; Maahn, Maximilian/E-8363-2014","Noyhouzer, Tomer/0000-0002-3638-6238; Maahn, Maximilian/0000-0002-2580-9100; Kalesse-Los, Heike/0000-0001-6699-7040; Alexander, Simon/0000-0001-6823-8857",,,,,156,3,3,0,0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108 USA",0065-9401,,978-1-944970-26-0,METEOR MON,,,2017,,,,,,,,10.1175/AMSMONOGRAPHS-D-16-0015.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/AMSMONOGRAPHS-D-16-0015.1,,,21,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BJ2PW,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000419754400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Shrubs and vines dominate the climax communities in these environments, and with comparatively long regeneration periods, they are highly vulnerable to shifting topography and climate. We investigated abiotic and biotic components of two barrier island landscapes with similar plant communities but different site histories to clarify relationships among physical factors, woody plants, and vines. On Hog Island, Virginia and at Duck, North Carolina, intrasite comparisons with reference to distance from shoreline and elevation were made to evaluate relationships between woody and vine communities, as well as edaphic characteristics. Elevation was significantly related to woody species presence, and vine presence was significantly related to presence of woody structure, indicating an indirect association of the climbing species to elevation. Differing histories of management and development at the two sites have resulted in varying degrees of both topographic complexity and stability. Greater topographic complexity has resulted in similar species richness values for the two sites, despite the considerable difference in total area. Presumably, stabilization and prior management efforts at the Duck site have enabled a community assemblage comparable to that of the much larger Hog Island; however, the Duck site may be more vulnerable because of a decreased potential to migrate in response to continued sea level rise and storm impacts.","[Bissett, Spencer N.; Zinnert, Julie C.; Young, Donald R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Young, DR (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",dyoung@vcu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DEB-0625014]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1237733] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This research was supported by National Science Foundation grant DEB-0625014.

Freshwater salinization originates from diverse anthropogenic and geologic sources including road salts, human-accelerated weathering, sewage, urban construction, fertilizer, mine drainage, resource extraction, water softeners, saltwater intrusion, and evaporative concentration of ions due to hydrologic alterations and climate change. The complex interrelationships between salt ions and chemical, biological, and geologic parameters and consequences on the natural, social, and built environment are called Freshwater Salinization Syndrome (FSS). Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of salinization issues (past, present, and future), and we investigate drivers and solutions. We analyze the expanding global magnitude and scope of FSS including its discovery in humid regions, connections to human-accelerated weathering and mobilization of 'chemical cocktails.' We also present data illustrating: (1) increasing trends in salt ion concentrations in some of the world's major freshwaters, including critical drinking water supplies; (2) decreasing trends in nutrient concentrations in rivers due to regulations but increasing trends in salinization, which have been due to lack of adequate management and regulations; (3) regional trends in atmospheric deposition of salt ions and storage of salt ions in soils and groundwater, and (4) applications of specific conductance as a proxy for tracking sources and concentrations of groups of elements in freshwaters. We prioritize FSS research needs related to better understanding: (1) effects of saltwater intrusion on ecosystem processes, (2) potential health risks from groundwater contamination of home wells, (3) potential risks to clean and safe drinking water sources, (4) economic and safety impacts of infrastructure corrosion, (5) alteration of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and (6) application of high-frequency sensors in state-of-the art monitoring and management. We evaluate management solutions using a watershed approach spanning air, land, and water to explore variations in sources, fate and transport of different salt ions (e.g. monitoring of atmospheric deposition of ions, stormwater management, groundwater remediation, and managing road runoff). We also identify tradeoffs in management approaches such as unanticipated retention and release of chemical cocktails from urban stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) and unintended consequences of alternative deicers on water quality. Overall, we show that FSS has direct and indirect effects on mobilization of diverse chemical cocktails of ions, metals, nutrients, organics, and radionuclides in freshwaters with mounting impacts. Our comprehensive review suggests what could happen if FSS were not managed into the future and evaluates strategies for reducing increasing risks to clean and safe drinking water, human health, costly infrastructure, biodiversity, and critical ecosystem services.","[Kaushal, Sujay S.; Reimer, Jenna E.; Maas, Carly M.; Galella, Joseph G.; Duan, Shuiwang; Kryger, Julia R.; Yaculak, Alexis M.; Boger, Walter L.; Bailey, Nathan W.; Haq, Shahan; Wood, Kelsey L.; Collison, Daniel C.; Aisin, Belie Y.

As Vienna is influenced by Pannonian continental climate, characterized by hot summers and cold winters, a temperature correction is introduced and applied to the NO2 differential slant column densities (DSCDs) retrieved in the visible spectral range to correct for the temperature dependence of the NO2 cross-section. The results show that not accounting for such a correction leads to an overestimation of absolute values by up to 15% in the winter season. Path-averaged NO2 VMRs from selected horizontal viewing directions are compared with surface NO2 VMRs from air quality monitoring stations located below and/or in close proximity to the particular MAX-DOAS line of sight. Good agreement between the two independent data sets is found, in particular during the summer season, with correlation coefficents ranging between 0.76 and 0.94. Seasonal and diurnal cycles of path-averaged NO2, HCHO, and CHOCHO VMRs are evaluated for a full year of measurements taken at the lowest elevation angles. While the highest daytime monthly averages of NO2 VMRs are found in winter, peaks of HCHO occur in summer. Highest amounts of CHOCHO conversely are observed over the course of the year, with the exception of summer. Seasonally-averaged diurnal cycles indicate that elevated NO2 and CHOCHO amounts are generally found in the morning hours and that there is a clear difference in trace gas amounts between weekdays and weekends when pointing at anthropogenic sources. The horizontal variabilty of tropospheric NO2, HCHO, and CHOCHO amounts is investigated by analyzing seasonally-averaged path-averaged VMRs, again obtained from measurements taken at the lowest elevation angles. The results show that highest amounts of NO2 and CHOCHO are found when the MAX-DOAS instruments are pointing towards the city center and/or towards busy roads and industrial areas, whereas highest amounts of HCHO are found over northern and western parts of Vienna, in particular in summer, which implies that anthropogenic sources are not the dominant drivers of HCHO production during that time of the year. Finally, the influence of wind direction and wind speed on tropospheric NO2, HCHO, and CHOCHO amounts is evaluted. The results show that tropospheric pollution levels over the city center of Vienna are highest at low wind speeds and wind directions from the Southeast.","[Schreier, Stefan F.; Weihs, Philipp] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria; [Richter, Andreas; Peters, Enno; Ostendorf, Mareike; Burrows, John P.] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Bremen, Germany; [Schmalwieser, Alois W.] Univ Vet Med, Unit Mol Physiol & Biophys, Vienna, Austria; [Peters, Enno] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Protect Maritime Infrastruct, Bremerhaven, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Bremen; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR)","Schreier, SF (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria.",stefan.schreier@boku.ac.at,"Philipp, Weihs/AAF-9027-2019","Philipp, Weihs/0000-0001-7452-0330; Schreier, Stefan/0000-0002-2119-4743",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 2296N29]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [RI 1800/6-1],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This study was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): I 2296N29 and the German Research Foundation (DFG): RI 1800/6-1.

Within the Netherlands the LOTOS-EUROS model has been developed by a consortium of institutes, after combining its independently developed predecessors in 2005. Recently, version 2.0 of the model was released as an open-source version. This paper presents the curriculum vitae of the model system, describing the model's history, model philosophy, basic features and a validation with EMEP stations for the new benchmark year 2012, and presents cases with the model's most recent and key developments. By setting the model developments in context and providing an outlook for directions for further development, the paper goes beyond the common model description. With an origin in ozone and sulfur modelling for the models LOTOS and EUROS, the application areas were gradually extended with persistent organic pollutants, reactive nitrogen, and primary and secondary particulate matter. After the combination of the models to LOTOS-EUROS in 2005, the model was further developed to include new source parametrizations (e.g. road resuspension, desert dust, wildfires), applied for operational smog forecasts in the Netherlands and Europe, and has been used for emission scenarios, source apportionment, and long-term hindcast and climate change scenarios. LOTOS-EUROS has been a front-runner in data assimilation of ground-based and satellite observations and has participated in many model intercomparison studies. The model is no longer confined to applications over Europe but is also applied to other regions of the world, e.g. China. The increasing interaction with emission experts has also contributed to the improvement of the model's performance. The philosophy for model development has always been to use knowledge that is state of the art and proven, to keep a good balance in the level of detail of process description and accuracy of input and output, and to keep a good record on the effect of model changes using benchmarking and validation. The performance of v2.0 with respect to EMEP observations is good, with spatial correlations around 0.8 or higher for concentrations and wet deposition. Temporal correlations are around 0.5 or higher. Recent innovative applications include source apportionment and data assimilation, particle number modelling, and energy transition scenarios including corresponding land use changes as well as Saharan dust forecasting. Future developments would enable more flexibility with respect to model horizontal and vertical resolution and further detailing of model input data. This includes the use of different sources of land use characterization (roughness length and vegetation), detailing of emissions in space and time, and efficient coupling to meteorology from different meteorological models.","[Manders, Astrid M.

Furthermore, the observations are used to validate the simulation results through two outdoor and indoor environmental parameters, air temperature and relative humidity dur-ing the hottest period of the year. Findings indicated that the main thermal comfort differ-ences among case studies were mainly due to their architectural layouts where the associated variables including length, width, height, orientation, window-to-wall ratio, and shading depth were optimized through a linkage between Ladybug-tools and Genetic Algorithm (GA) concerning adaptive thermal comfort model definition and could enhance the annual thermal comfort by 31%.(c) 2022 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

The average velocities for this dataset are estimated to be between +/- 11 mm/y. The Raunthi River catchment from where the flood was triggered is undergoing similar to 8 mm/y subsidence and similar to 10 mm/y uplift. Compared to this the basin wide deformation (Rishi Ganga basin) is estimated to be around +/- 10 mm/y with commulative ground displacement of around +/- 45 mm. The times series analysis suggests an increase in the ground displacement by around 5 mm/y and seems to be responsible for the expansion of pre-existing cracks in the vicinity of the Vaikrita Thrust (VT) and subsequent failure of the northern face of Nandi Peak on 7th February 2021. The Global Positioning System (GPS) derived strain distribution pattern indicate a relatively higher accumulation of strain (>0.35 mu strain/y). The normalized steepness index (k(sn)) variation along the longitudinal section of Rishi Ganga and Raunthi River sub-basin in Central Himalayan region shows anomalous increase at the glacio-fluvial transitional processes. Moreover, the chi profiles as well as planform plots shows anomalously lower values within the Raunthi River sub-basin when compared with the Rishi Ganga basin. Based on the lower values of chi it is observed that Raunthi River sub-basin is undergoing high erosion which can be caused by the presence of sheared lithology and incision of the relict glacial and paraglacial sediments. We negate the suggestion that abrupt rise in the temperature was the major triggering mechanism for the recent disaster, instead it is the sheared lithology and preexisting fissure developed because of differential uplift and subsidence in Raunthi River that led to the wedge failure and subsequent flash flood. Had the climate was the major driver of the recent tragedy ?, it should have impacted multiple hanging glaciers in the Rishi Ganga valley. Therefore, the study calls for detailed geomorphological, structural and glaciological investigation in regions dominated by glacial and paraglacial processes in the strategic regions of the Himalaya. Towards this, the state of art PSInSAR technique seems to provide fast and reliable detection of terrain instability/stability along with identification of potential areas of slope failures in near future in the glacial and preglacial zones.

Founded in the early 1930's it is now home of more than 160000 inhabitants, and it is characterized by low water quality, poor housing, lack of drainage and sanitation systems, and of green and public spaces. This paper presents the preliminary results of a joint research project between the Politecnico di Milano and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) for the improvement of the urban quality, health, livability and inclusiveness of Rocinha, that moves from an upgrading process of the environmental performance of the existing built environment. The project, in the frame the social responsibility program of Politecnico di Milano (Polisocial), is based on a multidisciplinary and integrated design methodology named IMM (Integrated Modification Methodology). The research aims to demonstrate that in a planet where the informal settlements are exponentially growing, strategies to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants are possible, and preliminary results, mostly achieved in the diagnostic phase of the process, are presented. Rocinha is seen as a complex system that has been investigated in its own morphological structure and the related environmental performance, focusing on: climate and energy, ecosystem services, waste management and their relation with urban morphology. This phase opens up to the next phases, specifically the intervention and retrofitting, that intend to select intervention areas and priorities and then to objectively size the implementation in Rocinha.

Numerical modelling is an essential tool for the quantification of natural hazards. Yet, state-of-the-art operational models are based on parameter back-calculation and thus reach their limits when facing unprece-dented or complex events. Here, we advance our predictive capabilities for mass movements and process cas-cades on the basis of a three-dimensional numerical model, coupling fundamental conservation laws to finite strain elastoplasticity. In this framework, model parameters have a true physical meaning and can be evaluated from material testing, thus conferring to the model a strong predictive nature. Through its hybrid Euler-ian-Lagrangian character, our approach naturally reproduces fractures and collisions, erosion/deposition phe-nomena, and multi-phase interactions, which finally grant accurate simulations of complex dynamics. Four benchmark simulations demonstrate the physical detail of the model and its applicability to real-world full-scale events, including various materials and ranging through five orders of magnitude in volume. In the future, our model can support risk-management strategies through predictions of the impact of potentially catastrophic cascading mass movements at vulnerable sites.","[Cicoira, A.; Blatny, L.; Li, X.; Trottet, B.; Gaume, J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cicoira, A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Li, X.] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Dept Geotech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gaume, J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geotech Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gaume, J.] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland; [Gaume, J.] Climate Change Extremes & Nat Hazards Alpine Reg R, Davos, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Zurich; Tongji University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Cicoira, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland.",alessandro.cicoira@uzh.ch,,"Cicoira, Alessandro/0000-0002-0065-4464",Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF;  [CRSK-2_195914];  [PCEFP2_181227],Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ; ,"Acknowledgments We thank Renato Vacondio (Vajont rockslide) , Fabrizio Troilo and Paolo Perret (Whymper hanging glacier) , Robert Kenner and Yves B?hler (Fl?ela Wisshorn) , Matthias Huss, Fabian Walter and the office for natural hazards of the Kanton Graub?nden and in particular Roderick K?hne (Piz Cengalo) for sharing the data and for fruitful dis-cussions.

The system will be developed under the framework of the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) Directive and the Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, which both aim to make relevant, harmonized, high-quality geographic information available to support the formulation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies and activities that have a direct or indirect impact on the environment. Three databases have been proposed (on emissions, field data and model results), and each will be equipped with state-of-the-art, open-source software to allow for the highest performance possible. Web-based user-interfaces and prototype applications will be developed to demonstrate the potential of blending different datasets from different servers for environmental assessment studies. Several services (i.e. catalog browsers, WMS and WCS services, web GIS services) will be developed to facilitate data integration, data re-use, and data exchange within and beyond the GMOS project. Different types of measurement and model datasets provided by project partners and other sources will be integrated into PostgreSQL-PostGIS, harmonized by creating INSPIRE-compliant metadata and made available to a larger community of stakeholders, policy makers, scientists, and NGOs (as well as to other public and private institutions, as dictated by the Directive 2003/4/EC). Since interoperability is a central concept for the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), the Global Monitoring for Environmental and Security (GMES) and the INSPIRE Directive, guidelines developed in these three frameworks will be adopted. The use of standards will be a key concern throughout the encoding process. We will use the international standards for data and spatial schemas (ISO19107, ISO14825), for metadata (ISO19115: 2003, ISO/DTS19139: 2005, ISO15836) and for services (WMS 1.1.1, WFS 1.0, SLD 1.0, GML 3.1). On the other side, we will use XML for data exchange, together with SOAP, XSD, J2EE (for applications development) and W3C (for standard interfaces). With specific reference to GMES, the global database on mercury monitoring and the GMOS model outputs will be made available through a series of monitoring, forecast and re-analysis services. Finally, we hope the GMOS operational services will contribute to the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project, by providing access to atmospheric environmental services.","[Cinnirella, S.; D'Amore, F.] CNR, Div Rende, Inst Atmospher Pollut Res, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [D'Amore, F.] Univ Calabria, DEIS, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Mazzetti, P.; Nativi, S.] CNR, Inst Atmospher Pollut Res, Rome, Italy; [Pirrone, N.] CNR, Inst Atmospher Pollut Res, Monterotondo, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR); University of Calabria; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR),"Cinnirella, S (corresponding author), CNR, Div Rende, Inst Atmospher Pollut Res, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",s.cinnirella@iia.cnr.it,"Nativi, Stefano/AAI-7982-2020; CINNIRELLA, SERGIO/AAX-1934-2020; Nativi, Stefano/E-7180-2016; Mazzetti, Paolo/B-6098-2015","Nativi, Stefano/0000-0003-3185-8539; CINNIRELLA, SERGIO/0000-0003-3251-5298; Nativi, Stefano/0000-0003-3185-8539; Mazzetti, Paolo/0000-0002-8291-1128",GMOS Project [265113],GMOS Project,The authors would like to express their gratitude for the financial support provided by the GMOS Project (FP7-ENV-2010 No. 265113).,,12,1,1,0,16,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,,,E3S WEB CONF,,,2013,,,,,,,28001,10.1051/e3sconf/20130128001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20130128001,,,4,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,BHR45,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000326475400220,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, the stochastic characteristic of wind may have an impact on the reliability and power quality of electrical grids due to short-term power fluctuations. For wind power smoothing purposes, many researchers have been using energy storage systems (ESSs) as they perform extremely well, and are becoming less costly. In this context, this article presents a comprehensive review of the significant research conducted on the topic of wind power smoothing using high-power ESSs. Firstly, some energy storage technologies are discussed and compared, and a brief description of the main short-term applications of these technologies is provided. Afterwards, a literature review on wind power smoothing is conducted, showing evidence of the development of methods over the years. A bibliometric analysis is also presented, showing an increasing number of publications on this subject. Finally, this review indicates that more research is still needed to overcome wind power fluctuation issues and that further attention to topics such as hybrid ESSs and smoothing impacts on electrical grids should arise over the next years.","[Barra, P.

These dams were built during the last decade to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and depleting aquifers due to excessive Groundwater (GW) extraction. It was expected that these dams would recharge the GW resources and save the aquifer system from collapsing. Check-dams have traditionally been the permanent source of water within the province. A check-dam is used to delay the floodwater runoff to make it available for domestic and agriculture purposes or to recharge GW. The water along these dams permeates into the ground to keep the aquifer genuinely stable throughout the year. The data were collected based on studies of published research papers and reports of international organizations containing key characteristics of performance evaluation techniques. This review will help to evaluate procedures, policy, and governance interventions in Balochistan by comparing them with the adopted practices in other regions of the world and its impact on the well-being of the society. In this paper, the performance evaluation of check-dams for specific cases is presented. The knowledge acquired will be utilized to highlight state-of-the-art practices and to identify the need for further research in this field.","[Panhwar, Vengus; Zaidi, Arjumand; Ullah, Asmat] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Water, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan",Mehran University Engineering & Technology,"Panhwar, V (corresponding author), Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Water, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan.",venguspanhwar23@gmail.com; arjumand.uspcasw@faculty.muet.edu.pk; asmatullah@faculty.muet.edu.pk,"Ullah, Md Asmat/GYU-9827-2022","Ullah, Md Asmat/0000-0003-4308-4200","US-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Water, Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, Pakistan","US-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Water, Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, Pakistan","The authors acknowledge the support provided by the US-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Water, Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, Pakistan, in conducting this study.",,38,0,0,1,2,MEHRAN UNIV ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY,JAMSHORO,"C/O MS MUMTAZ S MEMON, LIBRARIAN, JAMSHORO, 00000, PAKISTAN",0254-7821,2413-7219,,MEHRAN UNIV RES J EN,Mehran Univ.

Spatially explicit model units are created to test for spatial and seasonal differences in model performance and FLS sensitivities to changes in predictors, and effects of different data preprocessing procedures are evaluated. The statistical models show good performance in predicting FLS occurrence during validation, with R-2>0.9 especially in winter high pressure situations.The predictive skill of the models seems to be dependent on data availability, data preprocessing, time period, and geographic characteristics. It is shown that atmospheric proxies are more important determinants of FLS presence than surface characteristics, in particular mean sea level pressure, near-surface wind speed and evapotranspiration are crucial, together with FLS occurrence on the previous day. Higher wind speeds, higher land surface temperatures and higher evapotranspiration tend to be negatively related to FLS. Spatial patterns of feature importance show the dominant influence of mean sea level pressure on FLS occurrence throughout the central European domain. When only high pressure situations are considered, wind speed (in the western study region) and evapotranspiration (in the eastern study region) gain importance, highlighting the influence of moisture advection on FLS occurrence in the western parts of the central European domain. This study shows that FLS occurrence can be accurately modeled using machine learning techniques in large spatial domains based on meteorological and land surface predictors. The statistical models used in this study provide a novel analysis tool for investigating empirical relationships in the FLS - land surface system and possibly infer processes.","[Pauli, Eva; Andersen, Hendrik; Cermak, Jan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Pauli, Eva; Andersen, Hendrik; Cermak, Jan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Bendix, Joerg; Egli, Sebastian] Philipps Univ Marburg, Lab Climatol & Remote Sensing, Marburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Philipps University Marburg,"Pauli, E (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Pauli, E (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe, Germany.",eva.pauli@kit.edu,"Cermak, Jan/B-7844-2009","Cermak, Jan/0000-0002-4240-595X; Pauli, Eva/0000-0002-5506-4736",,,,,78,4,4,1,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

In this study, a double pipe PCM floor heating system with three independent heating modules was proposed for clean energy heating in rural China. A 26-day experimental study was conducted to study the operation effect of the system under four different strategies. Strategy 1: partial power operation strategy; Strategy 2: daytime energy storage strategy; Strategy 3: nocturnal energy storage strategy; and Strategy 4: phased energy storage strategy. In the early stage of heating, the average temperature of experiment room was 18.9 degrees C and the daily temperature fluctuation was controlled within 2.1 degrees C, which showed an effective guarantee of indoor comfort under Strategy 1. In the late stage of heating, the differences in indoor temperature fluctuations could be caused by changes in outdoor climate and operation strategies. And operating strategy had less impact on indoor temperature distribution. Moreover, the experiment results revealed that the system could provide a comfortable indoor thermal environment while adjusting operational strategies. And the 3 C average daily temperature fluctuation confirmed the feasibility of creating a comfortable environment with gentle temperature fluctuations via the PCM floor intermittent heating.

These F-region density depletions are particularly deep during geomagnetically quiet nights, when slow plasma convection creates polar holes, extending 100-1000 km in size, where the electron density is several orders of magnitude lower than the background values. Polar holes are believed to be formed during the periods of the very slow anti-sunward convection, when the plasma is trapped just poleward of the auroral oval in the absence of any ionization sources. At the same time, fast convection with rapid vertical plasma transport has also been associated with the polar hole formation. Combining the electron density measurements from the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR) and Poker Flat ISR (PFISR), the state of art variational data assimilation tool Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four-Dimensional (IDA4D), and the convection data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) array, the polar hole formation and evolution are experimentally investigated. The F-region plasma is traced back in time prior to the polar hole formation to analyze the favorable conditions for the formation of the polar holes. The role of plasma convection in the formation of the polar holes is experimentally investigated. The results show that the polar holes can be formed in the twilight condition and without being trapped in the closed convection loops. The formation of the polar holes were equally possible during slow and strong convection flows, predominantly with a standard two-cell convection configuration.","[Forsythe, Victoriya V.] ASTRA LLC, Louisville, CO 80027 USA; [Kunduri, Bharat] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Zou, Shasha] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Forsythe, VV (corresponding author), ASTRA LLC, Louisville, CO 80027 USA.",victoriyaforsythe@gmail.com,"; Zou, Shasha/G-2205-2011","Forsythe, Victoriya/0000-0003-0894-2951; Zou, Shasha/0000-0001-7726-2349; Kunduri, Bharat/0000-0002-7406-7641",NSF [AGS-2022159]; NASA [80NSSC20K1313],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was supported by NSF grant AGS-2022159.

The primary focus is on thermal demand during the electrical grid-stress period (16:00 h-20:00 h on winter weekdays) when the primary heat source, a heat pump, is turned off. Though this phenomenon may be evident in other countries, the main focus of this work is on electrical grid stress in UK conditions. In this work, PCM encapsulated in pipe coils surrounded by water in a hot water storage tank is considered. Two alternative samples of salt hydrate are evaluated experimentally and the results are used to inform system modelling. A new model is proposed for relating the enthalpy and temperature of the PCM during melting and solidification. A compact hybrid store design is proposed and a detailed thermal model of the hybrid store with an air-source heat pump is constructed and applied to an example house. Seasonal energy results compared with a conventional water tank are broadly similar but the hybrid store offers better comfort tracking during grid stress periods average house temperatures falling below 19 degrees C for 22.7% of the time with a conventional store but only 5.8% of the time using the hybrid store.

We analyzed the simulation together with in situ observations. Coinciding with the decreasing nutrient level at the beginning of the 1990s, we find a surprising increase in phytoplankton in the German Bight, but not in the more offshore parts of the SNS. We explain these complex patterns by a series of factors which are lacking in many state-of-the-art coupled ecosystem models such as changed light availability and physiological acclimation in phytoplankton. We also show that many coastal time-series stations in the SNS are located in small patches where our model predicts an opposite trend than found for the surrounding waters. Together, these findings call for a reconsideration of current modeling and monitoring schemes.","[Xu, Xu; Lemmen, Carsten; Wirtz, Kai W.] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht Zentrum Mat & Kusten, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Xu, X (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht Zentrum Mat & Kusten, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany.",xu.xu@hzg.de,"Wirtz, Kai/GRY-5339-2022",,program PACES of the Helmholtz society,program PACES of the Helmholtz society,The work was supported by the program PACES of the Helmholtz society.

Here, we applied both methods in parallel to determine C stock changes of two temperate grassland fields previously converted from long-term cropland. The grasslands differed in management intensity with either intensive management (high fertilization, frequent cutting) or extensive management (no fertilization, less frequent cutting). Soil organic C stocks (0-45 cm depth) were quantified at the beginning (2001) and the end (2006) of a 5 year observational period using the equivalent soil mass approach. For the same period and in both fields, NBP was quantified from net CO(2) fluxes monitored using eddy covariance systems, and measured C import by organic fertilizer and C export by harvest. Both NBP and repeated soil inventories revealed a consistent and significant difference between management systems of 170 +/- 48 and 253 +/- 182 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. For both fields, the inventory method showed a tendency towards higher C loss/smaller C gain than NBP. In the extensive field, a significant C loss was observed by the inventory but not by the NBP approach. Thus neither flux measurements nor repeated soil sampling may be suitable for tracking absolute changes in SOC, but both give similar answers with respect to relative changes.","[Leifeld, Jens; Ammann, Christof; Neftel, Albrecht; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Ammann, Christof/0000-0002-0783-5444",,,,,40,30,30,1,81,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

With its intensification, understanding species' capacity to adapt is critical for conservation planning. However, little is known about whether and how different species are responding, particularly among frogs. We used a continental-scale citizen science dataset of >226,000 audio recordings of 42 Australian frog species to investigate how calling-a proxy for breeding-phenology varied along an anthropogenic modification gradient. Calling started earlier and breeding seasons lengthened with increasing modification intensity. Breeding seasons averaged 22.9 +/- 8.25 days (standard error) longer in the most modified compared to the least modified regions, suggesting that frog breeding activity was sensitive to habitat modification. We also examined whether calls varied along a modification gradient by analysing the temporal and spectral properties of advertisement calls from a subset of 441 audio recordings of three broadly distributed frog species. There was no appreciable effect of anthropogenic habitat modification on any of the measured call variables, although there was high variability. With continued habitat modification, species may shift towards earlier and longer breeding seasons, with largely unknown ecological consequences in terms of proximate and ultimate fitness.","[Liu, Gracie; Kingsford, Richard T.; Callaghan, Corey T.; Rowley, Jodi J.

Level MIR49 (11,396 to 8430 cal BP) has provided the richest bat assemblage from this chronology in the Iberian Peninsula. The 14 taxa identified conform a bat association with no extant equivalent, although all of them belong to the current Iberian fauna, evidencing a high biodiversity among the Iberian Early Holocene bat communities that had not been detected until now. The sibling species Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii appear together, showing the earliest clear evidence of the arrival of the eastern-coming M. blythii into Europe far West, probably related to the expansion of open environments during the Younger Dryas event. Conversely, the overlaying Middle Holocene section has provided low numbers of bats' remains.

We extended the regional atmospheric chemistry model WRFC-hem (Weather Research Forecast model with Chemistry module) to comprehensively study the atmospheric distribution and the fate of low-concentration, slowly degrading semivolatile compounds. The WRF-Chem-PAH model reflects the state-of-the-art understanding of current PAHs studies with several new or updated features. It was applied for PAHs covering a wide range of volatility and hydrophobicity, i.e. phenanthrene, chrysene and benzo[a] pyrene, in East Asia. Temporally highly resolved PAH concentrations and particulate mass fractions were evaluated against observations. The WRF-Chem-PAH model is able to reasonably well simulate the concentration levels and particulate mass fractions of PAHs near the sources and at a remote outflow region of East Asia, in high spatial and temporal resolutions. Sensitivity study shows that the heterogeneous reaction with ozone and the homogeneous reaction with the nitrate radical significantly influence the fate and distributions of PAHs. The methods to implement new species and to correct the transport problems can be applied to other newly implemented species in WRF-Chem.","[Mu, Qing; Lammel, Gerhard; Chen, Ying; Zhang, Yuxuan; Shiraiwa, Manabu; Su, Hang; Poeschl, Ulrich; Cheng, Yafang] Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, Mainz, Germany; [Lammel, Gerhard; Pribylova, Petra] Masaryk Univ, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm, Brno, Czech Republic; [Gencarelli, Christian N.; Hedgecock, Ian M.] CNR Inst Atmospher Pollut Res, Div Rende, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Chen, Ying; Teich, Monique; van Pinxteren, Dominik; Herrmann, Hartmut] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Zheng, Guangjie] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Brookhaven, NY USA; [Zhang, Qiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shiraiwa, Manabu] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Spichtinger, Peter] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Su, Hang; Cheng, Yafang] Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Max Planck Society; Masaryk University Brno; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR); Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Tsinghua University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Jinan University,"Lammel, G; Cheng, YF (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, Mainz, Germany.;Lammel, G (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm, Brno, Czech Republic.;Cheng, YF (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",g.lammel@mpic.de; yafang.cheng@mpic.de,"Herrmann, Hartmut/C-2486-2009; Lammel, Gerhard/ABE-1446-2021; Pöschl, Ulrich/A-6263-2010; Spichtinger, Peter/F-5587-2014; Su, Hang/A-6226-2010; Teich, Monique/AAQ-8683-2020","Herrmann, Hartmut/0000-0001-7044-2101; Lammel, Gerhard/0000-0003-2313-0628; Pöschl, Ulrich/0000-0003-1412-3557; Spichtinger, Peter/0000-0003-4008-4977; Su, Hang/0000-0003-4889-1669; Zheng, Guangjie/0000-0002-8103-2594; Hedgecock, Ian/0000-0002-3743-1870; Gencarelli, Christian Natale/0000-0002-2366-661X",Max Planck Society; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41330635],Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the Max Planck Society.

J,"Hellie, R",,,,"Hellie, R",,,The structure of Russian imperial history,HISTORY AND THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Path dependency is a most valuable tool for understanding Russian history since 1480, which coincides with the ending of the Mongol yoke, Moscow's annexation of northwest Russia, formerly controlled by Novgorod, and the introduction of a new method for financing the cavalry-the core of a new service class. The cavalry had to hold off formidable adversaries (first Lithuania, then the Crimean Tatars, then the Livonians, the Poles, the Swedes, and the Ottomans) for Muscovy to retain its independence. Russia in 1480 was a poor country lacking subsurface mineral resources and with a very poor climate and soil for the support of agriculture. These basic problems inspired autocratic power and by 1515 an ideology was in place justifying it. Religion, literature, and law were employed to support the autocracy. A variant of a caste society was created to support the army. This made up the substance of the first service-class revolution in which all resources (human and intellectual) were mobilized to support a garrison state. After 1667 the external threats to Muscovy diminished, but the service class kept its privileges, especially the land fund and the peasant-serfs. Russia faced major foreign threats again in 1700 and in the 1920s and 1930s. Those threats precipitated the second and third service-class revolutions. The second and third service-class revolutions broadly paralleled the first. Reinvigorated service classes were created with state institutions to support them. As society became more complex, so did the service classes and their privileges. Ideologies (Russian Orthodoxy and then Marxism-Leninism) were converted into devices to support the infallible autocratic ruler and his elites. Almost the entire population was bound to state service, either directly, working to support the service state, or paying taxes. The church and clergy were harnessed first by Peter's Holy Synod and then Stalin's Department 5 of the Secret Police after he revived the church during World War II. Writers and artists were also put into uniform, until they finally rebelled-but the arts retained their civic functions, first supporting the regime, and then criticizing it. Finally, law retained its traditional programmatic functions in regimes themselves beholden to no law. As the foreign threats diminished, the service classes lost their function, but the elite servicemen kept their privileges as the service states disintegrated and the service classes lost their collective elan. Both the Russian Empire (in 1917) and then the Soviet Empire (in 1991) collapsed almost without a whimper.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Hellie, R (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,55,25,29,0,16,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0018-2656,,,HIST THEORY,Hist.

Electrodialysis can be used to concentrate one of the primary components (NaCI) and obtain a suitable raw material for industrial applications, such as the chlor-alkali industry. An electrodialysis pilot plant was used to evaluate the efficiency of concentrating a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) brine under representative full-scale operational conditions covering the temperature range of a semiarid climate. The results indicate that electrodialysis is a technology that can concentrate SVVRO brines from approximately 70 to 245 g/L NaCl, achieving an additional intrinsic purification of major multivalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-) due to the selectivity patterns of ion exchange membranes and the ion-complexation reactions in the concentrated brines. However, minor components, such as Ni and Cu, are concentrated due to the formation of Cu and Ni complexes with chloride ions to form monocharged species (e.g., NiCl+ and CuCl+). Energy consumption values of 0.12 kWh/kg NaCl for 185 g NaCl/l at 27 degrees C and 0.35 kA/m(2) or 0.19 kWh/kg NaCl for 203 g NaCl/l at 27 degrees C and 0.50 kA/m(2) were reached. These results were compared with the data obtained from the literature for salt production by electrodialysers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is of particular importance to the construction industry, as an overarching majority of construction companies are SMEs who account for the majority of employment and income generation within the industry. In the UK, previous research has identified construction SMEs as some of the worst affected by EWEs. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Given the recent occurrences of EWEs and predictions suggesting increases in both the intensity and frequency of EWEs in the future, improving the resilience of construction SMEs is vital for achieving a resilient construction industry. A conceptual framework is first developed which is then populated and expanded based on empirical evidence. Positioned within a pragmatic research philosophy, case study research strategy was adopted as the overall research strategy in undertaking this investigation. Findings - Based on the findings of two in-depth case studies of construction SMEs, a framework was developed to represent EWE resilience of construction SMEs, where resilience was seen as a collective effect of vulnerability, coping strategies, and coping capacities of SMEs, characteristics of the EWE and the wider economic climate. Originality/value - The paper provides an original contribution towards the overarching agenda of the resilience of SMEs, and policy making in the area of EWE risk management by presenting a novel conceptual framework depicting the resilience of medium sized construction companies.","[Wedawatta, Gayan] Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Engn Syst & Management, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Ingirige, Bingunath] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, GDRC, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England",Aston University; University of Huddersfield,"Wedawatta, G (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Engn Syst & Management, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",g.wedawatta@aston.ac.uk,"Wedawatta, Gayan/AAN-8579-2020","Wedawatta, Gayan/0000-0002-8600-5077",,,,,35,17,18,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-124X,2044-1258,,BUILT ENVIRON PROJ A,Built Environ.

Low total column mass losses (< 1 wt.%), correlated with the absence of pitting or surface roughening of primary silicate grains. BET surface area (S-BET) increased, primarily due to Fe-oxyhydroxide precipitation. Surface areas returned to within factors of 2-3 of their original values after dithionite extraction. Miscible displacement experiments indicated homogeneous plug flow with negligible immobile water, commonly cited for column experiments. Fresh granitoid effluent solute concentrations initially declined rapidly, followed by much slower decreases over the next decade. Weathered granitoid effluent concentrations increased modestly over the same time period, indicating losses of natural Fe-oxide and/or clay coatings and the increased exposure of primary mineral surfaces. Corresponding (fresh and weathered) elemental effluent concentrations trended toward convergence during the last decade of reaction. NETPATH/PHREEQC code simulations indicated non-stoichiometric dissolution involving Ca release from disseminated calcite and excess K release from interlayer biotite. Effluent Sr-87/(85) Sr ratios reflected a progressive weathering sequence beginning and ending with Sr-87/Sr-85 values of plagioclase with an additional calcite input and a radiogenic biotite excursion proportional to the granitoid ages. Effluents became thermodynamically saturated with goethite and gibbsite, slightly under-saturated with kaolinite and strongly under-saturated with plagioclase, consistent with kinetically-limited weathering in which solutes such as Na varied with column flow rates. Effluent Na concentrations showed no clear trend with time during the last decade of reaction (fresh granitoids) or increased slowly with time (weathered granitoids). Analysis of cumulative Na release indicated that plagioclase dissolution achieved steady state in 3 of the 4 fresh granitoids during the last decade of reaction. Surface-area normalized plagioclase dissolution rates exhibited a narrow range (0.95-1.26 10(-13) moles m(-2) s(-1)), in spite of significant stoichiometric differences (An(0.21) to An(0.50)). Rates were an order of magnitude slower than previously reported in shorter duration experiments but generally 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than corresponding natural analogs. CrunchFlow simulations indicated that more than a hundredfold decrease in column flow rates would be required to produce near-saturation reaction affinities that would start to slow plagioclase weathering to real-world levels. Extending simulations to approximate long term weathering in naturally weathered profiles required additional decreases in the intrinsic plagioclase dissolution and kaolinite precipitation rates and relatively large decreases in the fluid flow rate, implying that exposure to reactive mineral surfaces is significantly limited in the natural environment compared to column experiments.

The obtained range of the difference in the terrestrial biomass between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and present is roughly consistent with previous estimates. The phosphate concentrations in the intermediate and the deepwater were found to vary with almost art opposite phase. No such phase shift was found for the evolutions of total alkalinity and of total dissolved inorganic carbon throughout the glacial-interglacial cycles. This probably reflects the difference between the average remineralization depths of particulate carbonate and organic matter.

This was not only a time of rapid climate change but also of human occupation into suitable habitats made available by decline of the large lake. Using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods we have determined depositional ages for sediment samples from bar features (reworked deltaic sands), braided fluvial channels, and topographically inverted fluvial channels collected from DPG. All samples analyzed showed good luminescence characteristics. An uncertainty estimate incorporated into Minimum Age Model analysis increased confidence in the equivalent dose (D-e) estimate for the majority of samples.

The goal was to find emulators that could fit simulation data and provide reliable predictions of new simulation output. Four types of statistical emulators were compared-linear models, non-linear models, linear splines and cubic splines-which varied in complexity due to the use of different functional forms to fit main effects and different methods to determine model parameters. Two methods of model validation were used to ensure that the emulator selected provided good fits to the initial simulation output and gave adequate predictions of future simulation output. We illustrated the various techniques of model development and validation using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) plant growth model. The effects of rainfall amount, rainfall frequency, temperature and radiation on APSIM-generated biomass production of the perennial pasture species lucerne Medicago sativa were used as a case study. We conclude that, in this case, the best statistical emulator is the cubic spline. The novel approach illustrated here provides a rigorous, flexible and powerful means of developing and testing emulators for any complex simulation model.","[Ramankutty, Padmaja; Ryan, Megan; Renton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Ramankutty, Padmaja; Ryan, Megan; Renton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Ramankutty, Padmaja; Ryan, Megan; Renton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Future Farm Ind CRC, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Ramankutty, Padmaja; Speijers, Jane] Dept Agr & Food, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Lawes, Roger; Renton, Michael] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Ramankutty, P (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",ramanp01@student.uwa.edu.au,"Ryan, Megan/A-4009-2010; Lawes, Roger A/B-3538-2010; Renton, Michael/A-9979-2011","Ryan, Megan/0000-0003-0749-0199; Renton, Michael/0000-0003-1316-0145; Lawes, Roger/0000-0002-1305-1478",Future Farm Industries CRC,"Future Farm Industries CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)",We thank Art Diggle for his assistance in hastening the completion of this paper.

Even though SBTFs can achieve a reasonably good effluent quality, further process optimization is hampered by a lack of mechanistic understanding of the factors influencing nitrogen removal, notably when it comes to mainstream anaerobically treated sewage. In this study, the factors that control the performance of SBTFs following anaerobic (i.e., UASB) reactors for sewage treatment were investigated. A demo-scale SBTF fed with anaerobically pretreated sewage was monitored for 300 days, showing a median nitrification efficiency of 79% and a median total nitrogen removal efficiency of 26%. Heterotrophic denitrification was limited by the low organic carbon content of the anaerobic effluent. It was demonstrated that nitrification was impaired by a lack of inorganic carbon rather than by alkalinity limitation. To properly describe inorganic carbon limitation in models, bicarbonate was added as a state variable and sigmoidal kinetics were applied. The resulting model was able to capture the overall longterm experimental behaviour. There was no nitrite accumulation, which indicated that nitrite oxidizing bacteria were little or less affected by the inorganic carbon limitation. Overall, this study indicated the vital role of influent characteristics and operating conditions concerning nitrogen conversions in SBTFs treating anaerobic effluent, thus facilitating further process optimization.","[Bressani-Ribeiro, T.; Volcke, E.

A method to produce design storms exhibiting anisotropic spatial scaling is presented by combining a state-of-the-art stochastic rainfall generator STEPS with the linear generalized scale invariance (GSI) notation. The enhanced model is used to create ensembles of design storms based on an extreme storm with a distinct rainband shape observed in Melbourne, Australia. Design storms are generated both with and without accounting for anisotropy. Effect of anisotropy on precipitation characteristics is studied using the entire region covered by the radar (radar scale) and at a significantly smaller catchment scale. A rainfall-runoff model is applied to route the rainfall through the catchment into streamflow. Accounting for anisotropy allows for a more realistic description of precipitation features at the radar scale. At the catchment scale, anisotropy increases the probability of high rainfall accumulations, which translates into greater flood volumes. No discernible difference was observed in streamflow characteristics after controlling for the accumulation over the catchment. This could be explained by a lower importance of anisotropy relative to other factors affecting streamflow generation, and by the difficulties in creating representative rainfall temporal properties at the catchment scale when the radar scale is used for model calibration. The proposed method provides a tool to create ensembles of design storms when the anisotropic shape of the fields is of importance.","[Niemi, Tero J.; Guillaume, Joseph H.

State-of-the-art 1 km SM data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, SMOS-BEC L4 version 3 are used for this purpose. A strategy is developed to prepare the SMOS-L4 surface soil moisture (SSM) product for the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO) model initialization by applying a cumulative density function (CDF)-matching biascorrection and the exponential filter method to calculate corresponding SM profiles (L4-Expo). The processed satellite-derived product is validated with 38 observing sites from three in-situ SM networks REMEDHUS (19), SMOSMANIA (11) and VAS (8). All networks measure at a soil depth of 5 cm, only at the SMOSMANIA network additional measurements at 10, 20 and 30 cm are available. Four HPEs are selected to evaluate the impact of the high-resolution realistic initialization. The results show a high agreement index (AI = 0.91) and a low root-mean-square deviation (0.03 m(3)/m(3)) of the high-resolution, bias-corrected SMOS-L4 SSM product compared to in-situ observations. Moreover, the derived L4-Expo SM profile field agrees with ground-based observations and successfully removes the wet bias of the original COSMO simulated SM profile. Enhanced SM initialization with the SMOS-L4 SM derived profiles improves precipitation modelling in all selected HPEs as a consequence of improved near-surface 2 m-temperature and induced changes in the pressure field (-0.5 hPa), atmospheric humidity distribution (dqs = 5-15%) as well as wind circulations (dw(700hPa) = 25%), thus convergence/divergence fields. The sensitivity study, applying the same methodology for SM initialization for a SMOS-L3 (similar to 25 km), shows a weaker improvement of the precipitation forecast of an analysed HPE than the 1 km SMOS-4 product. Our results highlight the benefit of high-resolution SSM remote sensing satellite data for scientific disciplines like meteorology in overcoming present limitations such as the uncertainty associated to SM initialization in models.","[Helgert, Sebastian; Khodayar, Samiro] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Khodayar, Samiro] Mediterranean Ctr Environm Studies CEAM, Technol Pk,Charles R Darwin St 14, Valencia 46980, Spain",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Helgert, S (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",sebastian.helgert@kit.edu; samira.khodayar@uv.es,,,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) [01LN1319A],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors acknowledge the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) for providing the COSMO model (http://www.cosmo-model.org) and ECMWF for the initial and boundary data (https://www.ecmwf.int).The SMOS-L4 data were obtained from the SMOS-BEC (Barcelona Expert Center) (http://bec.icm.csic.es).Many thanks to the HyMeX database team who made a comprehensive rain gauge network available.

Many arctic birds start nesting shortly after snow recedes from their breeding sites and timing of snowmelt can vary substantially over the breeding range of widespread species. We tested the hypothesis that migration schedules of individuals co-occurring at the same non-breeding areas are adapted to average local environmental conditions encountered at their specific and distant Arctic breeding locations. We predicted that timing of breeding site availability (measured here as the average snow-free date) should explain individual variation in departure time from shared non-breeding areas. We tested our prediction by tracking American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica) nesting across the North-American Arctic. These plovers use a non-breeding (wintering) area in South America and share a spring stopover area in the nearctic temperate grasslands, located >1,800 km away from their nesting locations. As plovers co-occur at the same non-breeding areas but use breeding sites segregated by latitude and longitude, we could disentangle the potential confounding effects of migration distance and timing of breeding site availability on individual migration schedule. As predicted, departure date of individuals stopping-over in sympatry was positively related to the average snow-free date at their respective breeding location, which was also related to individual onset of incubation. Departure date from the shared stopover area was not explained by the distance between the stopover and the breeding location, nor by the stopover duration of individuals. This strongly suggests that plover migration schedule is adapted to and driven by the timing of breeding site availability per se. The proximate mechanism underlying the variable migration schedule of individuals is unknown and may result from genetic differences or individual learning. Temperatures are currently changing at different speeds across the Arctic and this likely generates substantial heterogeneity in the strength of selection pressure on migratory schedule of arctic birds migrating sympatrically.","[Lamarre, Jean-Francois] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Lamarre, Jean-Francois; Bety, Joel] Polar Knowledge Canada, Canadian High Arctic Res Stn, Cambridge Bay, NU, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lanctot, Richard B.; Saalfeld, Sarah T.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Migratory Bird Management, Anchorage, AK USA; [Love, Oliver P.] Univ Windsor, Dept Integrat Biol, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Reed, Eric] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Yellowknife, NT, Canada; [Johnson, Oscar W.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Liebezeit, Joe] Portland Audubon, Portland, OR USA; [McGuire, Rebecca] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Arctic Beringia Program, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Russell, Mike] Alberta Environm & Pk, Grande Prairie, AB, Canada; [Nol, Erica; Koloski, Laura] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Sanders, Felicia] South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Mcclellanville, SC USA; [McKinnon, Laura] York Univ, Bilingual Biol Program, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Smith, Paul A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife Res Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Flemming, Scott A.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Delta, BC, Canada; [Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Giroux, Marie-Andree] Univ Moncton, KC Irving Res Chair Environm Sci & Sustainable De, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Bauer, Silke; Emmenegger, Tamara] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Dept Bird Migrat, Sempach, Switzerland; [Emmenegger, Tamara] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Mol Ecol & Evolut Lab, Lund, Sweden",Laval University; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; Laval University; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; University of Windsor; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Wildlife Conservation Society; Trent University; York University - Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Laval University; University of Moncton; University of Moncton; Swiss Ornithological Institute; Lund University,"Lamarre, JF (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.;Lamarre, JF (corresponding author), Polar Knowledge Canada, Canadian High Arctic Res Stn, Cambridge Bay, NU, Canada.",Jean-Francois.Lamarre@polar-polaire.gc.ca,,"Emmenegger, Tamara/0000-0002-2839-6129; Gauthier, Gilles/0000-0002-2624-3508",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Natural Resources Canada (Polar Continental Shelf Program); Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); W.

However the space-based observations are available for monitoring the atmospheric aerosols even in the heavy aerosol events. Here retrieval algorithms from space for such aerosol events are proposed. In practice, appropriate index for detection of dust storm or biomass burning plume, diagnostic method of core part of the aerosol event, and simulation code of radiative transfer for semi-infinite atmosphere model are newly developed.

Capsicum species have an important place in world spice production and markets. They are adapted to warm climates and are widely grown in China and Turkey. Besides food purposes, they have renowned therapeutic properties for a number of illnesses. In the present study, various Capsicum species and lines were studied for their capsaicin contents according to different harvest time and drying parameters. In this concept, some local lines and introduced Capsicum species (Capsicum frutescens 26, Aci Cicek 52 and Capsicum chinense 38) from different countries were cultivated under the ecological conditions of the Cukurova region of Turkey in 2003-2004. Plants were harvested at two different times and three phases in each harvest time and drying parameters, related to ripening, and dried by various techniques (sun, solar tunnel dryer and cabinet dryer at varying drying temperatures such as 40 degrees, 60 degrees and 80 degrees). The capsaicin contents of different Capsicum species and lines were affected by harvest time and drying parameters. Capsaicin contents were within the range 0.50-4.20%. The highest capsaicin content was obtained from the solar tunnel drying at the second harvest in the local Capsicum line Act Cicek 52.

A cradle to grave approach has been taken for the environmental evaluation of the product life-cycle, including its integration in an existing residential building for the evaluation of the building's use phase. The model developed has been also assessed in the 5 European climate zones, evaluating the different performance due to the different weather conditions and the effect of increasing the thickness used. Also, an evaluation of the impacts achieved depending on the heating source used, together with the comparative analysis with other traditional insulation materials complete the paper. This innovative aerogel based panel takes advantage of nanotechnology to increase its lifetime and reduce its thickness, in-building installation time and cost in comparison to conventional insulating materials. As a result, due to its low thermal conductivity (0.015 W/mK), only 10 mm aerogel based insulation panel is needed to achieve the same level of insulation of 25 mm thickness of standard Expanded Polystyrene Panel. This difference increases when the passive house requirements of facade thermal insulation are considered with thermal transmittance values in the range between 0.1 and 0.15 W/(m(2)K). From the results, a reasonable thickness of insulation material is available only with Aeropan in comparison to Expanded Polystyrene, Extruded Polystyrene and Mineral Wool, demonstrating its suitability in the accomplishment of passive house requirements with a significant reduction of the space needed. Thus, net life-cycle environmental benefits were found in all scenarios making this product suitable for the retrofitting of existing buildings by both, external or internal thermal insulation, minimizing at the same time the space occupied by the insulation solution.

While management tools have been developed to control early-stage invasions or to clean particular sites from INNP, they are only rarely available to halt and reduce large-scale invasions. Importation biological weed control (IBWC; also termed classical biological weed control) offers a potentially effective tool, especially when combined with other land management interventions. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between IBWC advocates and critics by providing a state of the art of IBWC and exploring untapped opportunities and new ideas to further increase efficacy and safety of this tool. We first present a decision tree to identify the circumstances under which IBWC should be considered, either alone or as part of an integrated weed management approach. We then address concerns raised against IBWC by contrasting historical approaches with recently suggested improvements and outline a path forward. With two case studies, we emphasize that successful reduction of weed densities using IBWC will specifically also contribute to environmental health and human well-being by restoring ecosystem services without pesticide input and reaching areas with otherwise no INNP management options. We hope that our compilation helps to reconcile advocates and critics of IBWC and lead to a more constructive discourse and hopefully closer collaboration between the two groups. A joint effort is needed to further improve IBWC and to consider it more often, as the increasing threats imposed by INNP are urgently awaiting sustainable and affordable solutions.","[Sun, Yan] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Schaffner, Urs] CABI, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Fribourg,"Muller-Scharer, H (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",heinz.mueller@unifr.ch,,,"Novartis Foundation [17B083]; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_166448, 400440_152085]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Scholars, Huazhong Agricultural University [11042110026]; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation as part of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d) [400440_152085]; CABI; 'Center of Excellence of Weed and Invasive Plant Management under Climate Change' of the University of Tehran","Novartis Foundation(Novartis); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Scholars, Huazhong Agricultural University; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation as part of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d); CABI; 'Center of Excellence of Weed and Invasive Plant Management under Climate Change' of the University of Tehran","We are grateful to Rachel Winston and Hariet Hinz for providing the updated records of the weed biocontrol catalogue (Winston et al., 2021).

This study surveyed water managers across the United States to assess how knowledge is formed and disseminated, or how it is not. Inland freshwater harmful algal blooms are a growing threat to drinking water worldwide. Here we present the results of a national survey of how drinking water managers experience and perceive both nuisance harmful algal blooms and toxic harmful algal blooms (TABs) (N = 335) in the United States. We find that previous experience with harmful algal blooms increases drinking water systems' planning and preparation. However, unexpectedly, we also find that (1) water managers who experienced TABs rate them as more difficult to manage than do those with no previous TAB experience, and (2) managers in systems that experience TABs become increasingly reliant on internal resources to respond to TABs once they occur rather than reaching out for external sources of information and technology. This turn towards self-reliance could make the effective dissemination of state-of-the-art information and solutions more difficult among water systems and further isolate some vulnerable systems.","[Treuer, Galen; Kirchhoff, Christine] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lemos, Maria Carmen; McGrath, Francesca] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [McGrath, Francesca] Arcadia Fund, London, England",University of Connecticut; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Treuer, G (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",gtreuer@gmail.com,,"Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X; Kirchhoff, Christine/0000-0002-2686-6764",National Science Foundation [OCE-1600012],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by the National Science Foundation award no.

The purpose of this research is to develop a hygrothermal simulation model of grottoes to analyze the changes in the hygrothermal environment under different influencing factors. First, the temperature and relative humidity (RH) in Cave 101 of the Maijishan Grottoes were monitored throughout the year. The results indicated that the hygrothermal environment in Cave 101 was in an annual cycle from low temperature and RH to high temperature and RH. Then, a hygrothermal simulation model of the cave was established via the coupled heat and moisture transfer method. In addition, the accuracy of the model was verified by error analysis. Finally, the influences of different factors on the hygrothermal environment in the cave were evaluated by the model. The corridor and door can effectively weaken the influence of climate change on the hygrothermal environment in the cave. With increasing size and decreasing air change per hour, the annual amplitude and diurnal change in temperature and RH in the cave decrease. However, the environment in the cave remains moist in summer. The ventilation dehumidification design could be adopted as a regulation measure.

By exploring the disparities between Western conventions and pre-colonial African design, the paper lays the groundwork for critiquing the current use of neoliberal design paradigms in postcolonial Africa. The paper argues that there is a need for decentering Western design in order to decolonize African design. To do this, there is need for a stronger appreciation of Africa's sociocultural specificities. The paper contributes to that appreciation by discussing exemplary design from around the continent in order to articulate attributes of African design. Those attributes are aimed at promoting a stronger African design identity that can inform relevant solutions for African societies.","[Ambole, Amollo] Univ Nairobi, Sch Art & Design, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ambole, Amollo] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi,"Ambole, A (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Sch Art & Design, Nairobi, Kenya.;Ambole, A (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, Nairobi, Kenya.",Lambole@uonbi.ac.ke,,,,,,,74,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1754-7075,1754-7083,,DES CULT,Des.

In its simple form, a combinatorial strategy can reduce several input parameters (configurations) of a system into a small set based on their interaction (or combination). In practice, the input configurations of software systems are subjected to constraints, especially in case of highly configurable systems. To implement this feature within a strategy, many difficulties arise for construction. While there are many combinatorial interaction testing strategies nowadays, few of them support constraints. Objective: This paper presents a new strategy, to construct combinatorial interaction test suites in the presence of constraints. Method: The design and algorithms are provided in detail. To overcome the multi-judgement criteria for an optimal solution, the multi-objective particle swarm optimisation and multithreading are used. The strategy and its associated algorithms are evaluated extensively using different benchmarks and comparisons. Results: Our results are promising as the evaluation results showed the efficiency and performance of each algorithm in the strategy. The benchmarking results also showed that the strategy can generate constrained test suites efficiently as compared to state-of-the-art strategies.

During fall, low salinity at surface generates BL in this region. It thickens to almost 80 m in winter enhanced by deepening of isothermal layer depth due to remote forcing. During winter, surface cooling lowers near-surface temperature, and thus, the subsurface BL experiences a significant temperature inversion (similar to 2.5 degrees C). This temperature inversion diffuses to distribute heat within ML and surface heating begins deep penetration of shortwave radiation through ML during spring. Hence, the ML becomes thermally well stratified, resulting in the warmest MLT. The Monin-Obukhov length attains its highest value during summer indicating wind dominance in the ML. During spring and fall, upper ocean gains heat allowing buoyancy to dominate over wind mixing. Plain language Summary The northern Bay of Bengal is well known for its fresh ocean surface due to low salinity input from rivers. This study investigates the hydrography from the temperature and salinity profiles obtained from an Argo float, which drifted for 44 months in the northern Bay of Bengal. The mixed layer depends on the local processes and isothermal layer depth depends on the remote forcing through propagating Rossby waves. Thermal inversion within thick barrier layer is observed during winter. Wind stress is the dominant forcing in setting up the mixed layer during summer and winter. The barrier layer and temperature inversion play important roles on the mixed layer temperature. The state-of-the-art models failed to reproduce the temperature inversion layer due to low vertical resolution. While this is an integrated view from a single Argo, high-frequency high-resolution sampling would be necessary to understand turbulent mixed layer processes and quantify relative roles of haline buoyancy to thermal buoyancy.","[Shee, Abhijit; Sil, Sourav; Gangopadhyay, Avijit] Indian Inst Technol Bhubaneswar, Sch Earth Ocean & Climate Sci, Bhubaneswar, India; [Gangopadhyay, Avijit] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Dartmouth, MA USA; [Gawarkiewicz, Glen] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Ravichandran, M.] Natl Ctr Polar & Ocean Res, Vasco Da Gama, Goa, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar; University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR),"Sil, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Bhubaneswar, Sch Earth Ocean & Climate Sci, Bhubaneswar, India.",souravsil@iitbbs.ac.in,"Sil, Sourav/AFK-3569-2022; Sil, Sourav/AAG-2363-2022; Ravichandran, M./AAM-1351-2020; Sil, Sourav/I-8439-2016","Gangopadhyay, Avijit/0000-0002-7412-7325; Sil, Sourav/0000-0002-6846-2071","Space Application Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Government of India [SAC/EPSA/4.19/2016]; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India [RP088]","Space Application Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Government of India; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India(Ministry of Earth Science (MoES), Government of India)","A.

The irregularities, however, of high-dimensional data often compromise the effectiveness of standard machine learning algorithms. We hereby propose the Rank- R Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), a tensor-based nonlinear learning model that imposes Canonical/Polyadic decomposition on its parameters, thereby offering two core advantages compared to typical machine learning methods. First, it handles inputs as multilinear arrays, bypassing the need for vectorization, and can thus fully exploit the structural information along every data dimension. Moreover, the number of the model's trainable parameters is substantially reduced, making it very efficient for small sample setting problems. We establish the universal approximation and learnability properties of Rank-R FNN, and we validate its performance on real-world hyperspectral datasets. Experimental evaluations show that Rank-R FNN is a computationally inexpensive alternative of ordinary FNN that achieves state-of-the-art performance on higher-order tensor data.","[Makantasis, Konstantinos] Univ Malta, Inst Digital Games, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta; [Georgogiannis, Alexandros] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Khania 73100, Greece; [Georgogiannis, Alexandros] DeepLab, Athens 11741, Greece; [Voulodimos, Athanasios] Univ West Attica, Dept Informat & Comp Engn, Aigaleo 12243, Greece; [Georgoulas, Ioannis; Doulamis, Anastasios; Doulamis, Nikolaos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens 15773, Greece",University of Malta; Technical University of Crete; University of West Attica; National Technical University of Athens,"Makantasis, K (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Inst Digital Games, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta.",konstantinos.makantasis@um.edu.mt,"Voulodimos, Athanasios/ABC-1836-2021",,Horizon 2020 Research Program through the European Union [821054]; Horizon 2020 Research Program through the project Panoptis (Development of a Decision Support System for increasing the Resilience of Transportation Infrastructure Based on Combined Use of Terrestrial and Airborne Sensors and Advanced Modelling Tools) [769129]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the TAMED project [101003397],Horizon 2020 Research Program through the European Union; Horizon 2020 Research Program through the project Panoptis (Development of a Decision Support System for increasing the Resilience of Transportation Infrastructure Based on Combined Use of Terrestrial and Airborne Sensors and Advanced Modelling Tools); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the TAMED project,"This work was supported in part by the Horizon 2020 Research Program through the European Union funded project HYPERION (Development of a Decision Support System for Improved Resilience & Sustainable Reconstruction of historic areas to cope with Climate Change & Extreme Events based on Novel Sensors and Modelling Tools) under Grant 821054, in part by the Horizon 2020 Research Program through the project Panoptis (Development of a Decision Support System for increasing the Resilience of Transportation Infrastructure Based on Combined Use of Terrestrial and Airborne Sensors and Advanced Modelling Tools) under Grant 769129, and in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the TAMED project under Grant 101003397.",,38,11,11,2,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,,,,,58609,58620,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3072973,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3072973,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,RP8CK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000641951000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main aim of this study was to determine NH3 emissions for the most common dairy farming situation in Switzerland of loose housing with an outdoor exercise area. Measurements were taken on six commercial farms, in naturally ventilated cubicle loose housing systems with solid floors and an outdoor exercise area located alongside the housing. The variation in climate over the course of a year was covered by a total of twelve measuring periods, in two out of three seasons (summer, transition period, winter) per farm. A tracer ratio method with two tracer gases (SF6, SF5CF3) was employed to determine emissions from two areas of different source intensity. A variety of accompanying parameters was used to characterise each measuring situation and to derive the relevant influencing variables. The daily average NH3 emission across all farms varied from 31 to 67 g LU-1 d(-1) in summer, from 16 to 44 g LU-1 d(-1) in the transition period, and from 6 to 23 g LU-1 d(-1) in winter (1 LU = 500 kg live weight). From a linear mixed-effects model the wind speed in the housing (p < 0.001) and the interaction of outside temperature and the urea content of the tank milk (p < 0.001) emerged as significant variables influencing NH3 emission. A model-based calculation with bootstrapped variance components was used to calculate yearly averaged emission factors for two mountain and plain regions and two wind speeds (0.3 and 0.5 m s(-1)). The model input was based on milk urea contents from commercial dairy farms and air temperatures over a five-year period. The calculated NH3 emission factors, which thus accounted for regional differences due to climatic conditions and feeding levels, ranged between 22 and 25 g LU-1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we have compared the 1986 - 1996 and 2040 - 2050 decades to describe and analyze the changes attained by several oceanographic variables in the California Current System. A richer atmosphere in CO2 leads to increased sea surface and near-surface temperatures in the model domain and to an increased stratification along the coast that, however, is not strong enough to overcome the effect of increased upwelling favorable winds. A mild oceanic cooling is forecast below the 70-m depth, in agreement with recent studies of global warming trends. Near-surface vertical velocities increase by about 30% in April, but our simulations also forecast anomalous offshore transports in most of the coastal areas. The eddy kinetic energy decreases, on an annual mean, along the California Current main path with maximum negative anomalies in winter. The upward displacement of the 26.5 isopycnal surface, especially in the northern half of our study area, leads to an increase in the concentration of nutrients in the subsurface. The agreement between some results of this forecasting study and recent published findings would suggest that the current global warming trend would persist in the study area with similar changes to those observed over the last half century.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Auad, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",guillo@ucsd.edu,"Di Lorenzo, Emanuele/E-9107-2012","Di Lorenzo, Emanuele/0000-0002-1935-7363; Miller, Arthur/0000-0003-3459-2676; Auad, Guillermo/0000-0002-6214-4443",,,,,41,53,54,0,3,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9275,2169-9291,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

By means of bibliometric and cluster analysis, and using visualising analytical tools, we show the production, main topics, authors, sources, etc. on this research area, and compare with the treatment received in economic journals. The main findings are that publications in economic history journals have increased in the last decades; cover a list of themes broader than that in economic journals; give an increasing importance to quantitative techniques; cite sources from the same area as well as from the top economic journals; and show a relative lack of appeal to neighbouring disciplines.

Continuous reactors practically applying mixed cultures have been adopted to convert both simple and complex substrates generally at steady and relatively high production rates. However, continuous hydrogen fermenters could have several constraints including low to moderate hydrogen yields and therefore, advancements are still necessary. Extensive research has been conducted to overcome the bottlenecks and as a result, dark fermentative bio-hydrogen technology was already improved via methods i.e. (i) pretreatment of the seed sludge, (ii) design/retrofitting of bioreactors, (iii) optimization of bioprocess parameters (e.g. pH, temperature, organic loading rate, hydraulic retention time, effluent recycling ratio, etc.), (iv) reduction of H2 partial pressure, (v) bioaugmentation, etc. In this review, the most particular enhancement strategies of continuous hydrogen production are discussed to provide an up to date information about the latest developments made toward more viable applications.

Five different types of WEC have already been tested under real environmental conditions in Italy, Greece, Israel and Gibraltar, with Italy being the Mediterranean country with the most deployed WECs. The main questions of the relevant studies were the ongoing trends, the examination of WECs in combination with other renewable sources, the utilising of WECs for desalination, and the prospects of wave energy in the Mediterranean islands and ports. This paper is the first comprehensive study that overviews the recent significant developments in the wave energy sector in the Mediterranean countries. The research concludes that the advances of the wave energy sector in the Mediterranean Sea are significant. However, in order to commercialise WECs and wave energy exploitation to become profitable, more development is necessary.","[Dialyna, Evangelia; Tsoutsos, Theocharis] Tech Univ Crete, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Syst Lab, Sch Chem & Environm Engn, Kounoupidiana Campus, Khania 73100, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Tsoutsos, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Syst Lab, Sch Chem & Environm Engn, Kounoupidiana Campus, Khania 73100, Greece.",edialyna@isc.tuc.gr; theocharis.tsoutsos@enveng.tuc.gr,"Tsoutsos, Theocharis D/H-6311-2019","Tsoutsos, Theocharis D/0000-0002-6411-2736",,,,,85,5,5,5,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2021,16,,,,,,4764,10.3390/en14164764,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14164764,,,18,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,UG3BS,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000689132900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diurnal wavelike variations in CO2 concentration were observed systematically through the soil profile down to 50 cm, and the patterns and amplitude of mean diurnal waves depended on soil- and environmental conditions. For moderate to high soil water contents (SWC), Soil CO2 concentrations were positively correlated with soil temperature on a diurnal basis, resulting from an exponential increase of soil respiration with temperature and a shift in thermodynamic gaseous/aqueous phase equilibria. In dry conditions, however, air-filled porosity CO2 concentrations tended to be lowest in the late afternoon and highest in the early morning, and thus negatively correlated with soil temperature. The storage Of CO2 in soil was calculated in the air-filled and in the water-filled pore fractions using Henry's law and carbonate chemistry. Storage estimates were extremely sensitive to soil pH and a parametrisation of soil pH as a function of soil water content was derived from field measurements and used in the storage calculation scheme. Instantaneous rates of soil CO2 storage change with time were negatively correlated with atmospheric friction velocity in dry and moderately wet conditions, though in very wet conditions storage changes were dominated by vertical movements of soil water. The data suggest that CO2 can accumulate in the soil during the night when transport is restricted to molecular diffusion through soil layers, and that wind-induced pressure pumping results in a gradual daytime flushing out. These findings may help account for the oft-reported u(*)-dependence of night-time eddy covariance respiration fluxes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The STANet conducts multitask learning of Nino3.4 index prediction and calendar month classification for predicted indices. In a comparison of the proposed STANet performance with the state-of-the-art model, the accuracy of the 12-month forecast lead correlation coefficient was improved by 5.8% and 13% for Nino3.4 index prediction and corresponding temporal classification, respectively. Furthermore, the spatially attentive regions for the strong El Nino events displayed spatial relationships consistent with the revealed precursor for El Nino occurrence, indicating that the proposed STANet provides good understanding of the spatiotemporal behavior of global sea surface temperature and oceanic heat content for El Nino evolution.","[Kim, Jinah; Kwon, Minho; Kim, Sung-Dae] Korea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol, Coastal Disaster Res Ctr, Pusan 49111, South Korea; [Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Ryu, Joon-Gyu] Elect & Telecommun Res Inst, Satellite Wide Area Infra Res Sect, Daejeon 34129, South Korea; [Kim, Jaeil] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Daegu 41566, South Korea",Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI); Kyungpook National University,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",jaeilkim@knu.ac.kr,,,Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology [PE99863]; Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning Evaluation [2020-0-00843]; Ministry of Science and ICT; NIPA,"Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology; Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning Evaluation; Ministry of Science and ICT(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); NIPA","This research was funded by 'A pilot development of the data driven model for ocean climate change simulation using X-AI technology', basic research program funded by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (PE99863) and Development of Low Power multiple access core technology for Global IoT Service using Cubesat, entrusted research project funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT and Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (2020-0-00843).

We use time series analysis and nonlinear system identification methods in order to assess outdoor-environment bioclimatic conditions starting from the analysis of long historical meteorological data records. We investigate and model the stochastic and deterministic properties of 117 years (1891-2007) of monthly measurements of air temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration by separating their slow and fast components of the dynamics. In particular, we reconstruct the trend behaviour at long terms by modelling its dynamics via a phase space dynamical systems approach. The long-term reconstruction method reveals that an underlying dynamical system would drive the trend behaviour of the meteorological variables and in turn of the calculated Universal Thermal Climatic Index (UTCI), as representative of bioclimatic conditions. At longer terms, the system would slowly be attracted to a limit cycle characterized by 50-60 years cycle fluctuations that is reminiscent of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Because of lack of information about long historical wind speed data we performed a sensitivity analysis of the UTCI to three constant wind speed scenarios (i.e. 0.5, 1 and 5 m/s). This methodology may be transferred to model bioclimatic conditions of nearby regions lacking of measured data but experiencing similar climatic conditions.","[Glogowski, Arkadiusz; Brys, Krystyna] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Inst Environm Protect & Dev, Pl Grunwaldzki 24, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland; [Perona, Paolo] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Perona, Paolo] Ecole Politech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Inst Environm Sci & Technol IIE, ENAC Fac, Ecol Engn Lab ECOL, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Brys, Tadeusz] Polish Geophys Soc, Wroclaw Div, Pl Grunwaldzki 24, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; University of Edinburgh,"Glogowski, A (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Inst Environm Protect & Dev, Pl Grunwaldzki 24, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland.",arkadiusz.glogowski@upwr.edu.pl; paolo.perona@epfl.ch; krystyna.brys@upwr.edu.pl; tbrys@tlen.pl,"Głogowski, Arkadiusz R/A-8806-2017","Głogowski, Arkadiusz R/0000-0002-7587-8892; Brys, Krystyna/0000-0001-6970-9649",European Social Fund under the Knowledge Education Development Operational Programme [PPI/PRO/2018/1/00004/U/001],European Social Fund under the Knowledge Education Development Operational Programme,"The paper was made thanks to The PROM ProgrammeInternational scholarship exchange of Ph.D. candidates and academic staff co-financed by the European Social Fund under the Knowledge Education Development Operational Programme PPI/PRO/2018/1/00004/U/001 and the APC was financed under the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019.",,79,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

The 37 years that passed from the moment of its accession were not characterized only by expansion periods, nor were they characterized by a rapid improvement in the economic indicators. Ireland was confronted with 2 oil crises and with a pro-cyclical fiscal expansion combined with salary increases, which had a negative impact on the economy. The budgetary consolidation, fiscal reform and moderate salaries established through a social partnership contributed to the rise in competitiveness, transforming Ireland into an attractive country for foreign direct investments. The measures taken at the national level created the necessary climate for the successful absorption of EU funds. Until the end of 1999, Ireland had absorbed 74.4% of the cohesion funds allocated and starting with 2000 the absorption rate raised to 92.1% of the amounts allocated until 2003 when Ireland didn't meet anymore the criteria for assistance through the Cohesion Fund. Ireland focused on the implementation of transport and environment infrastructure projects, on the development of human resources and the improvement of education, succeeding in the same time to attract direct foreign investments in the high-tech industry from companies that had entered the single market. Ireland can provide, even after a summary analysis of the path followed to access EU funds, an example of best practices on the pragmatic approach and coherent policy elaboration designed to attract and implement EU funds, on the prioritization and guidance of the funds towards increased efficiency and the development of a healthy macroeconomic environment, on the creation of a partnership between the state, employers, unions, farmers, etc. in order to ensure credibility and support for government's strategies.","[Coman, Amalia Nicoleta] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Hlth & Consumers, Brussels, Belgium; [Coman, Paul] Cent European Acad Sci & Art, Paris, France",,"Coman, AN (corresponding author), European Commiss, Directorate Gen Hlth & Consumers, Brussels, Belgium.",amalia_coman@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,28,,,,661,674,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000279314000028,View Full Record in Web of Science

The application of diverse archaeobotanical techniques to the different plant remains provides a complete picture of the vegetation composition and plant uses. During the early Neolithic, settlement surroundings were intensively exploited for firewood, wood raw material, timber, and plant fibers. The resources were obtained mainly from deciduous and pine forests, depending on the site localization, but also from riparian zones. The diversity of plants exploited was high, not only trees but shrubs and herbs. Evidence of deforestation has been identified in the settlement surroundings in La Draga and Cova del Sardo. The combination of plant exploitation with other agropastoral activities favored the expansion of colonizing species and enhanced biodiversity at a local scale.","[Pique, Raquel; Alcolea, Marta; Berrocal, Anna; Rodriguez-Anton, David; Herrero-Otal, Maria; Lopez-Bulto, Oriol; Obea, Laura] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, Bellaterra 08913, Spain; [Antolin, Ferran] German Archaeol Inst, Dept Nat Sci, Dol 2-6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Antolin, Ferran] Univ Basel, Integrat Prehist & Archaeol Sci, Spalenring 145, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland; [Berihuete-Azorin, Marian; Revelles, Jordi] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Berihuete-Azorin, Marian; Revelles, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili URV, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Basel; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Pique, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, Bellaterra 08913, Spain.",Raquel.pique@uab.cat; Marta.Alcolea@uab.cat; ferran.antolin@dainst.de; mberihuete@iphes.cat; Anna.Berrocal@uab.cat; David.Rodriguez.Anton1@uab.cat; Maria.Herrero@uab.cat; JosepOriol.Lopez@uab.cat; Laura.Obea@uab.cat; jrevelles@iphes.cat,"Alcolea, Marta/ABF-8623-2020; Berihuete Azorín, Marian/H-9833-2015; López-Bultó, Oriol/AAH-8732-2019; David, Rodríguez Antón/ABA-7286-2021; Antolin, Ferran/I-1489-2015; Revelles, Jordi/F-4212-2016","Alcolea, Marta/0000-0003-4280-3971; Berihuete Azorín, Marian/0000-0002-6248-1562; López-Bultó, Oriol/0000-0001-5327-1881; David, Rodríguez Antón/0000-0003-4116-2308; Pique Huerta, Raquel/0000-0002-8253-6874; Antolin, Ferran/0000-0002-0533-5788; Revelles, Jordi/0000-0003-4803-9513","Ministerio de Ciencia e, Innovacion of Spain (MICINN) [PID2019-109254GB-C21, PID2019-109254GB-C22, PCI2020-111992, HAR2015-66780-P]; Departament de Cultura (Generalitat de Catalunya) [CLT009/18/00026, CLT009/18/00050, 2006/EXCAVA00022]; AGAUR-Generalitat de Catalunya: TEDAS [2017 SGR 243]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PP00P1_170515]; Beatriu de Pinos Post-doctoral fellowship from AGAUR, Government of Catalonia [2018 BP 00272]; Juan de la Cierva-Formacion (MCINN, Spain), in the research group GAPS [2017 SGR 836, FJC2017]; MCINN in the program of Units of Excellence 'Maria de Maeztu' [CEX2019-000945-M]","Ministerio de Ciencia e, Innovacion of Spain (MICINN)(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Departament de Cultura (Generalitat de Catalunya)(Generalitat de Catalunya); AGAUR-Generalitat de Catalunya: TEDAS; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Beatriu de Pinos Post-doctoral fellowship from AGAUR, Government of Catalonia; Juan de la Cierva-Formacion (MCINN, Spain), in the research group GAPS; MCINN in the program of Units of Excellence 'Maria de Maeztu'","This research was funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e, Innovacion of Spain (MICINN), grant numbers PID2019-109254GB-C21, PID2019-109254GB-C22, PCI2020-111992 and HAR2015-66780-P.

State-of-the-art land and atmosphere models employ parameterizations to represent their subgrid heterogeneity, but the land- atmosphere coupling in ESMs typically operates on the grid scale. Communicating the information on the land surface heterogeneity with the overlying atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) remains a challenge in modeling land-atmosphere interactions. In order to account for the subgrid-scale heterogeneity in land-atmosphere coupling, we implement a new coupling scheme in the Energy Exascale Earth system model version 1 (E3SMv1) that uses adjusted surface variances and covariance of potential temperature and specific water content as the lower boundary condition for the atmosphere model. The new lower boundary condition accounts for both the variability of individual subgrid land surface patches and the inter-patch variability. The E3SMv1 singlecolumn model (SCM) simulations over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plain (SGP) site were performed to assess the impacts. We find that the new coupling parameterization increases the magnitude and diurnal cycle of the temperature variance and humidity variance in the lower ABL on non-precipitating days. The impacts are primarily attributed to subgrid inter-patch variability rather than the variability of individual patches. These effects extend vertically from the surface to several levels in the lower ABL on clear days. We also find that accounting for surface heterogeneity increases low cloud cover and liquid water path (LWP). These cloud changes are associated with the change in cloud regime indicated by the skewness of the probability density function (PDF) of the subgrid vertical velocity. In precipitating days, the inter-patch variability reduces significantly so that the impact of accounting for surface heterogeneity vanishes. These results highlight the importance of accounting for subgrid heterogeneity in land- atmosphere coupling in next-generation ESMs.","[Huang, Meng; Ma, Po-Lun; Hao, Dalei; Bisht, Gautam; Larson, Vincent E.; Leung, L.

Baker, Washington State, northwest USA and erupted a compositionally zoned (dacite-rhyolite) magma and a correlative eruptive, the Lake Tapps tephra. This tephra has previously been described, but only from the Puget Lowland of NW Washington. Here an occurrence of a Kulshan caldera correlative tephra is described from the Quaternary Palouse loess at the Washtucna site (WA-3). Site WA-3 is located in east-central Washington, similar to 340 km southeast of the Kulshan caldera and similar to 300 km east-southeast of the Lake Tapps occurrence in the Puget Lowland. Major- and trace element chemistry and location of the deposit at Washtucna within reversed polarity sediments indicates that it is not correlative with the Mesa Falls, Rockland, Bishop Ash, Lava Creek B or Huckleberry Ridge tephras. Instead the Washtucna deposit is related to the Lake Tapps tephra by fractional crystallisation, but is chemically distinct, a consequence of its eruption from a compositionally zoned magma chamber. The correlation of the Washtucna occurrence to the Kulshan caldera-forming eruption indicates that it had an eruptive volume exceeding 100 km(3), and that its tephra could provide a valuable early-Pleistocene chronostratigraphic marker in the Pacific Northwest.

This paper presents a novel contribution to the valuation of carbon sequestration services in marine ecosystems with an application to the Mediterranean Sea. We combine a state-of-the-art biogeochemical model with various estimates of the social cost of carbon emissions to provide a spatially explicit characterization of the current flow of values that are attributable to the various sequestration processes, including the biological component. Using conservative estimates of the social cost of carbon, we evaluate the carbon sequestration value flows over the entire basin to range between 127 and 1722 million (sic)/year. Values per unit area range from 135 to 1000 (sic)/km(2) year, with the exclusive economic zone of some countries acting as net carbon sources. Whereas the contribution of physical processes can be either positive or negative, also depending on the properties of incoming Atlantic water, the contribution of biological processes to the marine blue carbon sequestration is always positive, and found to range between 100 to 1500 million (sic)/year for the whole basin.

The site is located on the shores of a water reservoir and remains of human habitation are continually eroding due to constantly fluctuating water levels. Several aspects of this site are notably unique in this region, including two stone structures interpreted as floor pavements of dwelling structures and microlithic implements. These particular microliths are previously unknown in this region, but they are very similar to other assemblages in distant parts of Europe. Raw materials for lithic artifacts associated with the stone structures were obtained locally as well as from distant sources up to 300 km from the site. Ochre, faunal remains and charcoal were also recovered and analyses of these remains indicate a cold, dry climate in an almost treeless landscape. Mohelno-Plevovce represents a rare insight into human habitation of a very sparsely populated central Europe during the LGM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Previous studies of forested long-term (1000s - 100,000s of years) chronosequences suggest that surface microbial communities change with soil age. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of long-term soil microbial community dynamics, especially for non-forested ecosystems and in subsurface soil horizons. We investigated soil chemistry, aboveground plant productivity, and soil microbial communities across a grassland chronosequence (65,000-226,000 yrs old) located near Santa Cruz, CA. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) initially increased to a maximum and then decreased for the older soils. We used polar lipid fatty acids (PLFA) to investigate microbial communities including both surface (<0.1 m) and subsurface (>= 0.2 m) soil horizons. PLFAs characteristic of Gram-positive bacteria and actinobacteria increased as a fraction of the microbial community with depth while the fungal fraction decreased relative to the surface. Differences among microbial communities from each chronosequence soil were found primarily in the subsurface where older subsurface soils had smaller microbial community biomass, a higher proportion of fungi, and a different community structure than the younger subsurface soil. Subsurface microbial community shifts in biomass and community structure correlated with, and were likely driven by, decreasing soil P availability and Ca concentrations, respectively. Trends in soil chemistry as a function of soil age led to the separation of the biological (<= 1 m depth) and geochemical (>1 m) cycles in the old, slowly eroding landscape we investigated, indicating that this separation, commonly observed in tropical and subtropical ecosystems, can also occur in temperate climates. This study is the first to investigate subsurface microbial communities in a long-term chronosequence. Our results highlight connections between soil chemistry and both the aboveground and belowground parts of an ecosystem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of a plethora of models designed for GSR prediction, deep learning, representing a state-of-the-art intelligent tool, remains an attractive approach for renewable energy exploration, monitoring and forecasting. In this paper, algorithms based on deep belief networks and deep neural networks are designed to predict long-term GSR. Deep learning algorithms trained with publicly-accessible Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data are tested in Australia's solar cities to predict the monthly GSR: single hidden layer and ensemble models. The monthly-scale MODIS-derived predictors (2003-2018) are adopted, with 15 diverse feature selection approaches including a Gaussian Emulation Machine for sensitivity analysis used to select optimal MODIS-predictor variables to simulate GSR against ground-truth values. Several statistical score metrics are adopted to comprehensively verify surface GSR simulations to ascertain the practicality of deep belief and deep neural networks. In the testing phase, deep learning models generate significantly lower absolute percentage bias (<= 3%) and high Kling-Gupta efficiency (>= 97.5%) values compared to the single hidden layer and ensemble model. This study ascertains that the optimal MODIS input variables employed in GSR prediction for solar energy applications can be relatively different for diverse sites, advocating a need for feature selection prior to the modelling of GSR. The proposed deep learning approach can be adopted to identify solar energy potential proactively in locations where it is impossible to install an environmental monitoring data acquisition instrument. Hence, MODIS and other related satellite-derived predictors can be incorporated for solar energy prediction as a strategy for long-term renewable energy exploration.","[Ghimire, Sujan; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Raj, Nawin; Mi, Jianchun] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia; [Ghimire, Sujan; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Raj, Nawin; Mi, Jianchun] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia; [Mi, Jianchun] Peking Univ, Dept Energy & Resources, Coll Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; Peking University,"Ghimire, S; Deo, RC (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia.;Ghimire, S; Deo, RC (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia.",sujan.ghimire@usq.edu.au; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au; nawin.raj@usq.edu.au; jmi@pku.edu.cn,"Ghimire, Sujan/ABA-5597-2021; Raj, Nawin/AAY-2846-2020; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Ghimire, Sujan/0000-0002-7266-4442",Australian Government,Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR),The authors acknowledge MODIS satellite data obtained from NASA's GIOVANNI Repository.

The significantly developed satellite video technology makes object tracking in satellite videos possible. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based trackers have achieved satisfying performance in the visual object tracking field. However, CNN cannot be directly applied to object tracking in satellite videos due to the following two reasons. First, the feature map size generally decreases as the network layer deepens, which is unsuitable for the small targets in satellite videos. Second, CNN-based trackers commonly need extensive data to train the network parameters, while few labeled satellite videos are available. Therefore, in this paper, we design a lightweight network for the satellite video tracking task. On one hand, the network generates a response map with the same size as the input image and reserves the spatial resolution of targets. On the other hand, the network parameters are transferred from an existing network and trained with the initial annotated frame, thus no extra data are needed. To make a fair comparison between existing trackers, we further propose a simulated benchmark based on the UAV123 dataset according to the imaging characteristics of satellite videos. Experiments are conducted to compare our method with other state-of-the-art trackers on both the simulated benchmark and real satellite videos and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.","[Sui, Bing] Hunan Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Prevent & Reduct, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Meng] Jiangsu Climate Ctr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Dongdong] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Elect Sci & Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",National University of Defense Technology - China,"Sui, B (corresponding author), Hunan Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Prevent & Reduct, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.",suibing123456@126.com; moqimubai@sina.cn,,"Sui, Bing/0000-0001-7400-2242",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61902420],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 61902420).

Human emotion distribution has been regarded as an important part of emotional geography research. However, it is difficult to form a global scaled map reflecting human emotions at the same sampling density because various emotional sampling data are usually positive occurrences without absence data. In this study, a methodological framework for mapping the global geographic distribution of human emotion is proposed and applied, combining a species distribution model with physical environment factors. State-of-the-art affective computing technology is used to extract human emotions from facial expressions in Flickr photos. Various human emotions are considered as different species to form their 'habitats' and predict the suitability, termed as 'Emotional Habitat'. To our knowledge, this framework is the first method to predict emotional distribution from an ecological perspective. Different geographic distributions of seven dimensional emotions are explored and depicted, and emotional diversity and abnormality are detected at the global scale. These results confirm the effectiveness of our framework and offer new insights to understand the relationship between human emotions and the physical environment.

In Victoria, Australia, public natural forests extend over 7.2 M ha and constitute a significant and important carbon stock. Recently, a wide range of approaches to estimate carbon stocks within these forests have been developed and applied. However, there are a number of data and estimation limitations associated with these studies. In response, over the last five years, the State of Victoria has implemented a pragmatic plot-based design consisting of pre-stratified permanent observational units located on a state-wide grid. Using the ground sampling grid, we estimated aboveground and belowground carbon stocks (including soil to 0.3 m depth) in both National Parks and State Forests, across a wide range of bioregions. Estimates of carbon stocks and associated uncertainty were conducted using simple design based estimators. We detected significantly more carbon in total aboveground and belowground components in State Forests (408.9 t ha(-1), 95% confidence interval 388.8-428.9 t ha(-1)) than National Parks (267.6 t ha(-1), 251.9-283.3 t ha(-1)). We were also able to estimate forest carbon stocks (and associated uncertainty) for 21 strata that represent all of Victoria's bioregions and public tenures. It is anticipated that the lessons learnt from this study may support the discussion on planning and implementing low cost large area forest carbon stock sampling in other jurisdictions.","[Haywood, Andrew] European Forest Inst, St Pau Art Nouveau Site,St Leopold Pavil, Barcelona 08025, Spain; [Haywood, Andrew] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest Ecosyst Sci, 4 Water St, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia; [Haywood, Andrew] RMIT Univ, Sch Math & Geospatial Sci, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Stone, Christine] New South Wales Dept Ind Lands, Forest Sci, Locked Bag 5123, Parramatta, NSW 2124, Australia",University of Melbourne; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Haywood, A (corresponding author), European Forest Inst, St Pau Art Nouveau Site,St Leopold Pavil, Barcelona 08025, Spain.;Haywood, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest Ecosyst Sci, 4 Water St, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia.;Haywood, A (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Math & Geospatial Sci, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",andrew.haywood@efi.int; christine.stone@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Haywood, Andrew/E-3418-2016","Haywood, Andrew/0000-0001-9903-8276",Cooperative Research Centre Spatial Information [4.104],Cooperative Research Centre Spatial Information,The authors are grateful to the Cooperative Research Centre Spatial Information for providing funding (Project 4.104) for the costs to publish in open access.

They then predict the global distributions of these spectral niches using remote sensing and validate the predictions with metagenomic data on the distribution patterns of cyanobacterial pigments. Stretching and bending vibrations of water molecules absorb photons of specific wavelengths, a phenomenon that constrains light energy available for aquatic photosynthesis. Previous work suggested that these absorption properties of water create a series of spectral niches but the theory was still too simplified to enable prediction of the spectral niches in real aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show with a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model that the vibrational modes of the water molecule delineate five spectral niches, in the violet, blue, green, orange and red parts of the spectrum. These five niches are effectively captured by chlorophylls and phycobilin pigments of cyanobacteria and their eukaryotic descendants. Global distributions of the spectral niches are predicted by satellite remote sensing and validated with observed large-scale distribution patterns of cyanobacterial pigment types. Our findings provide an elegant explanation for the biogeographical distributions of photosynthetic pigments across the lakes and oceans of our planet.","[Holtrop, Tadzio; Biersteker, Levi; Aerts, Jeroen; van der Woerd, Hendrik Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Dept Water & Climate Risk, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Holtrop, Tadzio; Huisman, Jef; Stomp, Maayke; Biersteker, Levi] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Dept Freshwater & Marine Ecol FAME, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Grebert, Theophile; Partensky, Frederic; Garczarek, Laurence] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Res Dept,UMR 7144, Adaptat & Divers Marine Environm,Stn Biol Roscoff, Roscoff, France",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Huisman, J (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Dept Freshwater & Marine Ecol FAME, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.huisman@uva.nl,"van der Woerd, Hans J/K-9812-2013; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013; Partensky, Frédéric/AAH-1170-2021; Partensky, Frédéric/B-9194-2018","van der Woerd, Hans J/0000-0002-8901-7567; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211; Partensky, Frédéric/0000-0003-1274-4050; Partensky, Frédéric/0000-0003-1274-4050; Grebert, Theophile/0000-0003-0699-1194; Holtrop, Tadzio/0000-0002-8607-7345; Garczarek, Laurence/0000-0002-8191-8395; Biersteker, Levi/0000-0002-6466-7678","Dutch Research Council (NWO) [ALW-GO 14-06]; VENI-grant; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE02-0014-01, ANR-19-CE02-0019]",Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); VENI-grant; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This article is dedicated to the memory of our late colleagues M.

Four treatments ( null N, change from null to manuring in 1978 NM, change from manuring to null in 1978 MN, and permanent manure and mineral fertilization since 1902 M) were sampled in 2004. Soil organic carbon contents were highest for M ( 2.4%), lowest for N ( 1.7%), and similar for MN and NM ( 2.2%). Three heat flow peaks at around 354 degrees C, 430 degrees C, and 520 degrees C, which were assigned to as thermally labile and stable SOM and combustion residues from lignite, respectively, characterized DSC thermograms. DSC peak temperatures were relatively constant among treatments, but peak heights normalized to the organic C content of the soil were significantly different for labile and stable SOM. Labile C was higher for M > MN=NM=N, and stable C decreased in the order N=NM > MN=M, showing that agricultural depletion of SOM increases the share of thermally stable C. Lignite-derived C was not affected by management, suggesting a homogeneous deposition across treatments.","Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Halle, Germany",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",,,,,19,23,23,0,22,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2006,3,,,,371,374,,10.5194/bg-3-371-2006,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-3-371-2006,,,4,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,078IN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000240096200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ten healthy male subjects performed exercises wearing cotton briefs in a climate chamber controlled at an air temperature of 27 similar to 28 degrees C and a relative humidity of 50%. Following a rest for 20 min on a chair (Rest), subjects exercised on a motorised treadmill at 4 km/h walking speed for 20 min (walk) followed by a 7.2 km/h (medium run) and 12 km/h (high run) running speed for 10 min, respectively. The SCWC and TEWL were measured at pre-exercise, end-walk, end-medium run and end-high run. Skin temperatures were obtained by infrared thermograms for every 5 min. The main findings were summarized as follows: Skin temperature in chest, abdomen, under arm, upper arm, forearm, hand, ventral thigh and ventral leg were significantly lower during walk, medium & high run than at rest by 0.13 similar to 0.73, 0.36 similar to 1.78, 0.35 similar to 2.24 degrees C, respectively. Skin temperature in dorsal thigh, popliteal fossa was lower within 1 degrees C or higher by 0.11 similar to 1.28 degrees C in dorsal leg and foot during exercises than at rest. In accordance with the regions of declines of skin temperatures, SCWC and TEWL doubled and elevated four times. Exercises were rated significantly higher for perception of humidity, heat and overall discomfort than rest. We discussed how dynamic exercises induce significantly different skin temperature, SCWC and TEWL on human body, which have profound influence on subjective perception of thermal factors, humidity and discomfort. The results of this study suggested that fall in skin surface temperature during dynamic exercising were related to thermal factors, such as evaporation due to skin sweat.","[Guo, Yue-Ping; Li, Yi; Yao, Lei; Liu, Rong; Cao, Xu-Yong; Cao, Ming-Liang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",tcliyi@polyu.edu.hk; tcliyi@polyu.edu.hk,"Cao, Mingliang/J-7335-2012; LI, YI/G-4421-2012","LI, YI/0000-0002-2092-4505",,,,,22,0,0,0,10,TEXTILE BIOENGINEERING & INFORMATICS SOCIETY LTD,HONG KONG SAR,"TBIS 2010 SECRETARIAT MN104, HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV, HONG KONG SAR, 0000, PEOPLES R CHINA",1942-3438,,,TEXT BIOENG INFORM S,,,2011,,,,,350,362,,10.3993/tbis2011061,http://dx.doi.org/10.3993/tbis2011061,,,13,"Materials Science, Textiles",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science,BAQ73,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000305197600060,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of nineteen trans and gender diverse young people participated in this study; thirteen young people participated in semi-structured interviews while twelve young people took part in three arts-based workshops. In this paper, we home in on the modalities of inclusion experienced by trans and gender diverse young people as they navigated gendered classification and ordering practices in PE and school sport. Leaning on theoretical insights into the politics of inclusion for LGBTQI+ people, we demonstrate the limited effects of supporting trans and gender diverse young people via individualising methods of inclusion when PE and school-based sport are predicated so fundamentally on an intensely policed cis-heteronormative gender binary. Ultimately, the accounts of the young people in this study steer us towards the necessity to move beyond individualist modalities of inclusion and reimagine the architecture of gender at work in PE and school sport.","[Neary, Aoife; McBride, Ruari-Santiago] Univ Limerick, Sch Educ, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Neary, A (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Sch Educ, Limerick, Ireland.",aoife.neary@ul.ie,,"Neary, Aoife/0000-0003-1196-6487",Irish Research Council Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme [CLNE/2018/165],Irish Research Council Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme,This research was funded by The Irish Research Council Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme entitled CAROLINE - 'Collaborative Research Fellowships for a Responsive and Innovative Europe' [Grant number CLNE/2018/165].,,56,3,3,12,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1357-3322,1470-1243,,SPORT EDUC SOC,Sport.

These uncertainties originate from the model structure and uncertainty in model forcing fields; however, little is known about their relative importance. A thorough understanding and quantification of uncertainties is necessary to correctly interpret carbon cycle simulations and guide further model developments. This study elucidates the effects of different state-of-the-art land cover and meteorological data set options and biosphere models on simulations of gross primary productivity (GPP) over Europe. The analysis is based on (1) three different process-oriented terrestrial biosphere models (Biome-BGC, LPJ, and Orchidee) driven with the same input data and one model (Biome-BGC) driven with (2) two different meteorological data sets (ECMWF and REMO), (3) three different land cover data sets (GLC2000, MODIS, and SYNMAP), and (4) three different spatial resolutions of the land cover (0.25 degrees fractional, 0.25 degrees dominant, and 0.5 degrees dominant). We systematically investigate effects on the magnitude, spatial pattern, and interannual variation of GPP. While changing the land cover map or the spatial resolution has only little effect on the model outcomes, changing the meteorological drivers and especially the model results in substantial differences. Uncertainties of the meteorological forcings affect particularly strongly interannual variations of simulated GPP. By decomposing modeled GPP into their biophysical and ecophysiological components (absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) and radiation use efficiency (RUE), respectively) we show that differences of interannual GPP variations among models result primarily from differences of simulating RUE. Major discrepancies appear to be related to the feedback through the carbon-nitrogen interactions in one model (Biome-BGC) and water stress effects, besides the modeling of croplands. We suggest clarifying the role of nitrogen dynamics in future studies and revisiting currently applied concepts of carbon-water cycle interactions regarding the representation of canopy conductance and soil processes.","[Jung, Martin; Vetter, Mona] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Bondeau, Alberte] Postdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Zaehle, Soenke; Ciais, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas] Ctr Etud Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Ennvironm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Feser, Frauke] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Herold, Martin] Univ Jena, Dept Geog, ESA GOFC GOLD Project Off, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Jung, Martin] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; [Zaehle, Soenke; Ciais, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas] CEA, CNRS, Joint Unit, LSCE, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Max Planck Society; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Max Planck Society; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jung, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",mjung@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Bondeau, Alberte/E-9909-2012; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016; Viovy, Nicolas/S-2631-2018; Feser, Frauke/C-1605-2014; Zaehle, Sönke/C-9528-2017; Herold, Martin/F-8553-2012","Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Bondeau, Alberte/0000-0002-8729-5061; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113; Viovy, Nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; Feser, Frauke/0000-0002-0252-468X; Zaehle, Sönke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Herold, Martin/0000-0003-0246-6886; Churkina, Galina/0000-0002-5895-7425",,,,,65,124,131,1,67,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,1944-9224,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

This study aims to develop a CNN algorithm, named Deep Neural Network High Spatiotemporal Resolution Precipitation Estimation (Deep-STEP), that ingests direct satellite passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures (Tbs) at emission and scattering frequencies combined with infrared (IR) Tbs from geostationary satellites and surface information to automatically extract geospatial features related to the precipitable clouds. These features allow the end-to-end Deep-STEP algorithm to instantaneously map surface precipitation intensities with a spatial resolution of 4 km. The main advantages of Deep-STEP, as compared to current state-of-the-art techniques, are 1) it learns and estimates complex precipitation systems directly from raw measurements in near-real time, 2) it uses the automatic spatial neighborhood feature extraction approach, and 3) it fuses coarse-resolution PMW footprints with IR images to reliably retrieve surface precipitation at a high spatial resolution. We anticipate our proposed DNN algorithm to be a starting point for more sophisticated and efficient precipitation retrieval systems in terms of accuracy, fine spatial pattern detection skills, and computational costs.","[Gorooh, Vesta Afzali; Nguyen, Phu; Hsu, Kuolin; Sorooshian, Soroosh] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Henry Samueli Sch Engn, Ctr Hydrometeorol & Remote Sensing, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Asanjan, Ata Akbari] Univ Space Res Assoc, Mountain View, CA USA; [Asanjan, Ata Akbari] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Sorooshian, Soroosh] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Gorooh, VA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Henry Samueli Sch Engn, Ctr Hydrometeorol & Remote Sensing, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",vafzalig@uci.edu,"AFZALI GOROOH, VESTA/AAG-5839-2020; sorooshian, soroosh/B-3753-2008","AFZALI GOROOH, VESTA/0000-0002-7420-4650; sorooshian, soroosh/0000-0001-7774-5113","Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology [NNH19ZDA001N-FINESST]; NASA [80NSSC19K0726]; MASEEH fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-IA0000018]; California Energy Commission [300-15-005]; NOAA/NESDIS/NCDC [NA09NES4400006, 2009-1380-01]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [ST133017CQ0058]; Riverside Technology, Inc.; NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant Program (donation of Quadra P6000 GPU); University of California [4600010378 TO15 Am 22]","Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); MASEEH fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); California Energy Commission; NOAA/NESDIS/NCDC(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Riverside Technology, Inc.; NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant Program (donation of Quadra P6000 GPU); University of California(University of California System)","This research is supported by Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (NNH19ZDA001N-FINESST), NASA Grant 80NSSC19K0726, MASEEH fellowship, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE Prime Award DE-IA0000018), California Energy Commission (CEC Award 300-15-005), NOAA/NESDIS/NCDC (Prime Award NA09NES4400006 and NCSU CICS and Subaward 2009-1380-01), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (ST133017CQ0058) with Riverside Technology, Inc., NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant Program (donation of Quadra P6000 GPU), and University of California (4600010378 TO15 Am 22).

In the last three decades, we have witnessed a growing increase in plant invasions in Portugal and Spain (Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe), with very detrimental economic, social and ecological effects. Some of these species, such as the giant reed (Arundo donax L.) and the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms-Laub.), number among the world's worst weeds. We present an appraisal of this invasive alien river flora and the most problematic aquatic weeds. We review various aspects of invasion ecology, including spatial and temporal patterns of invasion, species invasiveness, species traits of invasive weeds, and relationships between human disturbance in rivers and surrounding areas and invasibility, and contextualize them in overall state-of-the-art terms.

Consequently, people have been experiencing tremendous damage to properties, infrastructures, and human casualties. Usually, floods are one of the devastating disasters from nature, but for developing nations like Bangladesh, flooding becomes worse. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flooding, the prediction of flooding sites was usually very difficult for flood management. But the artificial intelligence and advanced remote sensing techniques together could predict and identify the possible sites, which are vulnerable to flooding. The present work aimed to predict and identify the flooding sites or flood susceptible zones in the Teesta River basin by employing state-of-the-art novel ensemble machine learning algorithms. We developed ensembles of bagging with REPtree, random forest (RF), M5P, and random tree (RT) algorithms for obtaining reliable and highly accurate results. Twelve factors, which are considered as the conditioning factors, and 413 current and former flooding points were identified for flooding susceptibility modelling. The Information Gain ratio statistical technique was utilized to determine the influence of the factors for flooding. We applied receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for validation of the flood susceptible models. The Freidman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were applied together for the first time in flood susceptibility modelling to compare the models with each other. Results showed that more than 800 km(2)area was predicted as the very high flood susceptibility zones by all algorithms. The ROC curve showed that all models achieved more than 0.85 area under the curve indicating highly accurate flood models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the bagging with M5P performed superior, followed by bagging with RF, bagging with REPtree and bagging with RT. The methodology and solution-oriented results presented in this paper will assist the regional as well as local authorities and the policy-makers for mitigating the risks related to floods and also help in developing appropriate measures to avoid potential damages.

In order to evaluate the influence of a porous functional layer on the membrane performance a numerical geometry generator was implemented that allows to create arbitrary porous microstructures. The 3D OTM model includes the spatially coupled physicochemical processes i) gas diffusion in the porous functional layer, ii) oxygen exchange at the feed-side between gas phase and MIEC material, iii) oxygen ion diffusion across the membrane, iv) oxygen excorporation at the permeate-side. The performed simulation carried out for the state-of-the-art MIEC composition La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) was validated with the help of oxygen permeation measurements carried out on an asymmetric LSCF thin-film OTM in the temperature range of 750...1000 degrees C. The simulation results identified a surface exchange dominated regime for membrane thicknesses below 50 mu m. While the application of a porous functional layer on the feed side could only increase the permeation flux by around 26%, the model demonstrates the significant improvement by a factor of two (for the given conditions) that can be achieved with a functional layer on the permeate side in case of a 20 mu m thin-film membrane.

The geomagnetic indexK(p)in particular, is widely used for these purposes. Current state-of-the-art forecast models provide deterministicK(p)predictions using a variety of methods - including empirically-derived functions, physics-based models, and neural networks - but do not provide uncertainty estimates associated with the forecast. This paper provides a sample methodology to generate a 3-hour-aheadK(p)prediction with uncertainty bounds and from this provide a probabilistic geomagnetic storm forecast. Specifically, we have used a two-layered architecture to separately predict storm (K-p >= 5(-)) and non-storm cases. As solar wind-driven models are limited in their ability to predict the onset of transient-driven activity we also introduce a model variant using solar X-ray flux to assess whether simple models including proxies for solar activity can improve the predictions of geomagnetic storm activity with lead times longer than the L1-to-Earth propagation time. By comparing the performance of these models we show that including operationally-available information about solar irradiance enhances the ability of predictive models to capture the onset of geomagnetic storms and that this can be achieved while also enabling probabilistic forecasts.","[Chakraborty, Shibaji] Virginia Tech, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Morley, Steven Karl] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Space Sci & Applicat ISR 1, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Chakraborty, S (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",shibaji7@vt.edu,"Chakraborty, Shibaji/AAY-6586-2021; Morley, Steven K/A-8321-2008; Morley, Steven/AAP-5637-2021","Chakraborty, Shibaji/0000-0001-6792-0037; Morley, Steven K/0000-0001-8520-0199; ",Space Science and Applications group; Center for Space and Earth Science (CSES) at Los Alamos National Laboratory; US Department of Energy; Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program [20190262ER],Space Science and Applications group; Center for Space and Earth Science (CSES) at Los Alamos National Laboratory; US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program,"SC thanks to the Space Science and Applications group and the Center for Space and Earth Science (CSES) at Los Alamos National Laboratory for organizing and supporting the Los Alamos Space Weather Summer School.

This process has accelerated greatly since 2014 and, combined with operational adjustments related to overcapacity, has reduced the emissions of nitrogen oxides (N0x), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM). Yet the quantitative understanding of ULE benefits is poor. Using detailed emissions data from 38 units at 17 power plants, corresponding to 10 combinations of ULE technologies representative of the Chinese power sector, we show emissions shows a large spread across the various ULE technology that emissions factors for NOR, SO2, and PM are up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower after ULE retrofitting. The effectiveness in cutting combinations, providing an opportunity to choose the most efficient, economically viable technology (or a combination of technologies) in the future. The temporal variations in emissions at hourly resolution reveal the effects of power plant load on emissions, an increasingly important factor given that power plants are not operated at full capacity. These data will be useful in efforts to understand the evolving state of air quality in China and can also provide a basis for benchmarking state-of-the-art air pollution control equipment globally.","[Liu, Xiao; Gao, Xing; Yu, Weilin; Xu, Ke; Ku, Anthony Y.] Natl Inst Clean & Low Carbon Energy, Beijing 102211, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xinbin; Duan, Hongwei; Zhao, Fuming; Chen, Lilin; Gao, Shengming] Shenhua Geol Explorat Co, Shenhua Environm Remote Sensing & Monitoring Ctr, Beijing 102211, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lulu; Ni, Ruijing; Lin, Jintai] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yu] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ku, Anthony Y.] NICE Amer Res, 2091 Stierlin Ct, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA",Peking University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Ku, AY (corresponding author), Natl Inst Clean & Low Carbon Energy, Beijing 102211, Peoples R China.;Lin, JT (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Ku, AY (corresponding author), NICE Amer Res, 2091 Stierlin Ct, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.",anthonyku@nicenergy.com,"Chen, Lulu/AAV-2389-2021; Chen, Lulu/GXF-3271-2022; Lin, Jintai/A-8872-2012","Chen, Lulu/0000-0002-8929-3414; Lin, Jintai/0000-0002-2362-2940; Xu, Ke/0000-0002-6480-7546",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775115],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to Wenqiang Xu, Weidong Jiao, and Yonglong Li for helpful discussions.

These events resembled the vortex signatures detected by the previous Mars landers Pathfinder and Phoenix; however, the MSL observations contained fewer pressure drops greater than 1.5 Pa and none greater than 3.0 Pa. Apparently, these vortices were generally not lifting dust as only one probable dust devil has been observed visually by MSL. The obvious explanation for this is the smaller number of strong vortices with large central pressure drops since according to Arvidson et al. [2014] ample dust seems to be present on the surface. The annual variation in the number of detected convective vortices followed approximately the variation in Dust Devil Activity (DDA) predicted by the MarsWRF numerical climate model. This result does not prove, however, that the amount of dust lifted by dust devils would depend linearly on DDA, as is assumed in several numerical models of the Martian atmosphere, since dust devils are only the most intense fraction of all convective vortices on Mars, and the amount of dust that can be lifted by a dust devil depends on its central pressure drop. Sol-to-sol variations in the number of vortices were usually small. However, on 1 Martian solar day a sudden increase in vortex activity, related to a dust storm front, was detected.","[Kahanpaa, H.; Schmidt, W.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Kahanpaa, H.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Espoo, Finland; [Newman, C.] Ashima Res Inc, Pasadena, CA USA; [Moores, J.] York Univ, Earth & Space Sci & Engn, N York, ON, Canada; [Zorzano, M. -P.; Navarro, S.; Lepinette, A.] CSIC INTA, Ctr Astrobiol, Madrid, Spain; [Zorzano, M. -P.; Martin-Torres, J.] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, Lulea, Sweden; [Martin-Torres, J.; Valentin-Serrano, P.] CSIC UGR, Inst Andaluz Ciencias Tierra, Granada, Spain; [Cantor, B.] Malin Space Sci Syst, San Diego, CA USA; [Lemmon, M.

The accurate and timely prediction of SEPs is of interest to the scientific community as well as mission designers, operators, and industrial partners due to the threat SEPs pose to satellites, spacecrafts, and crewed missions. In this work, we present a methodology for the prediction of SEPs from the soft X-rays of solar flares associated with SEPs that were measured in 1 AU. We use an expansive dataset covering 25 years of solar activity, 1988-2013, which includes thousands of flares and more than two hundred identified and catalogued SEPs. Neural networks are employed as the predictors in the model, providing probabilities for the occurrence or not of a SEP, which are converted to yes/no predictions. The neural networks are designed using current and state-of-the-art tools integrating recent advances in the machine learning field. The results of the methodology are extensively evaluated and validated using all the available data, and it is shown that we achieve very good levels of accuracy with correct SEP occurrence prediction higher than 85% and correct no-SEP predictions higher than 92%. Finally, we discuss further work towards potential improvements and the applicability of our model in real-life conditions.","[Aminalragia-Giamini, Sigiava; Tsigkanos, Antonis; Sandberg, Ingmar; Papadimitriou, Constantinos] Space Applicat & Res Consultancy SPARC, Athens 10551, Greece; [Aminalragia-Giamini, Sigiava; Papadimitriou, Constantinos; Daglis, Ioannis A.] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens NKUA, Dept Phys, Athens 15772, Greece; [Raptis, Savvas] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Div Space & Plasma Phys, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Anastasiadis, Anastasios; Papaioannou, Athanasios] Inst Astron Astrophys Space Applicat & Remote Sen, Natl Observ Athens, Athens 15236, Greece; [Jiggens, Piers] European Space Agcy ESTEC ESA, European Res & Technol Ctr, NL-2200 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Aran, Angels] Univ Barcelona UB IEEC, Inst Ciencies Cosmos ICCUB, Dept Fis Quant & Astrofis, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Daglis, Ioannis A.] Hellen Space Ctr, Athens 15231, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Royal Institute of Technology; National Observatory of Athens; European Space Agency; Mesnac; Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya (IEEC); University of Barcelona,"Aminalragia-Giamini, S (corresponding author), Space Applicat & Res Consultancy SPARC, Athens 10551, Greece.;Aminalragia-Giamini, S (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens NKUA, Dept Phys, Athens 15772, Greece.",sagiamini@sparc.gr,"Raptis, Savvas/AAZ-9063-2020; Papaioannou, Athanasios/K-7065-2013; Anastasiadis, Anastasios/G-8917-2011; Sandberg, Ingmar/C-6053-2014; Papadimitriou, Constantinos/M-4061-2013; Daglis, Ioannis/L-6100-2013","Raptis, Savvas/0000-0002-4381-3197; Papaioannou, Athanasios/0000-0002-9479-8644; Anastasiadis, Anastasios/0000-0002-5162-8821; Sandberg, Ingmar/0000-0001-9716-608X; Aminalragia-Giamini, Sigiava/0000-0003-1162-5842; Papadimitriou, Constantinos/0000-0002-5191-0149; Daglis, Ioannis/0000-0002-0764-3442; Tsigkanos, Antonis/0000-0001-5017-3784",European Space Agency (ESA) [4000120480/17/NL/LF/hh],European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission),"This work was partially supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) under contract 4000120480/17/NL/LF/hh, Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) Advanced Warning System (SAWS).

Numerical experiments were conducted for the recent anomalously cold (2014-2015) and warm (2015-2016) winters that were accompanied by high and low ice coverage over the lakes, respectively. The results of numerical experiments showed that snow cover on the ice, which is the manifestation of winter precipitation, reduced the total ice volume (or mean ice thickness) in all of the Great Lakes, shortened the ice duration, and allowed earlier warming of water surface. The reduced ice volume was due to the thermal insulation of snow cover. The surface albedo was also increased by snow cover, but its impact on the delay the melting of ice was overcome by the thermal insulation effect. During major snowstorms, snowfall over the open lake caused notable cooling of the water surface due to latent heat absorption. Overall, the sensible heat flux from rain in spring and summer was found to have negligible impacts on the water surface temperature. Although uncertainties remain in overlake precipitation estimates and model's representation of snow on the ice, this study demonstrated that winter precipitation, particularly snowfall on the ice and water surfaces, is an important contributing factor in Great Lakes ice production and thermal conditions from late fall to spring. Plain Language Summary Snow and rain impact on ice cover and water temperature in large lakes were studied using a computational model for an example of the Laurentian Great Lakes. It was found that snow cover increased the reflection of solar radiation but at the same time prevented lake ice from the growing, resulting in less formation of ice and slightly earlier melting. The earlier ice melting also allowed earlier warming of the water surface in spring. Major snowstorms caused slight cooling in the water surface temperature because snowflakes absorbed heat when it touched the water surface to melt. On the other hand, warmer rain barely changed the water surface temperature during summer. Key Points Precipitation impacts on Great Lakes ice cover and water temperature were evaluated using a coupled ice-hydrodynamic model The model results showed that snow cover on the ice reduced the net production of ice, which resulted in earlier decay of ice cover The model results showed that snowfall cooled the water surface notably through latent heat absorption during storms","[Fujisaki-Manome, A.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fujisaki-Manome, A.] Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Anderson, E.

This was achieved by examining the phylogeographic patterns in a widely distributed Tasmanian endemic reptile, Niveoscincus ocellatus. 204 individuals from 29 populations across the distributional range of N. ocellatus were surveyed for variation at two mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND4), and two nuclear genes (beta-globin, RPS8). Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using a range of methods (maximum parsimony, Bayesian inference and haplotype networks), and the demographic histories of populations were assessed (AMOVA, Tajima's D, Fu's Fs, mismatch distributions, extended Bayesian skyline plots, and relaxed random walk analyses). Results: There was a high degree of mitochondrial haplotype diversity (96 unique haplotypes) and phylogeographic structure, where spatially distinct groups were associated with Tasmania's Northeast and a large area covering Southeast and Central Tasmania. Phylogeographic structure was also present within each major group, but the degree varied regionally, being highest in the Northeast. Only the Southeastern group had a signature of demographic expansion, occurring during the Pleistocene but post-dating the Last Glacial Maximum. In contrast, nuclear DNA had low levels of variation and a lack of phylogeographic structure, and further loci should be surveyed to corroborate the mitochondrial inferences. Conclusions: The phylogeographic patterns of N. ocellatus indicate Pleistocene range and demographic expansion in N. ocellatus, particularly in the Southeast and Central areas of Tasmania. Expansion in Central and Southeastern areas appears to have been more recent in both demographic and spatial contexts, than in Northeast Tasmania, which is consistent with inferences for other taxa of greater stability and persistence in Northeast Tasmania during the Last Glacial Maximum. These phylogeographic patterns indicate contrasting demographic histories of populations in close proximity to areas directly affected by glaciers in the Southern Hemisphere during the LGM.","[Cliff, H.

The first session addressed the topic of working with space weather service providers now and in the future, the user perspective. The second session provided the service perspective, addressing experiences in forecasting development and operations. Presentations in both sessions provided an overview of international efforts on these topics, and panel discussion topics arising in the first session were used as a basis for panel discussion in the second session. Discussion topics included experiences during the September 2017 space weather events, cross domain impacts, timeliness of notifications, and provision of effective user education. Users highlighted that a severe space weather event did not necessarily lead to severe impacts for each individual user across the different sectors. Service providers were generally confident that timely and reliable information could be provided during severe and extreme events, although stressed that more research and funding were required in this relatively new field of operational space weather forecasting, to ensure continuation of capabilities and further development of services, in particular improved forecasting targeting user needs. Here a summary of the sessions is provided followed by a commentary on the current state-of-the-art and potential next steps towards improvement of services.","[Bingham, Suzy; Thorn, Peter] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3QS, Devon, England; [Murray, Sophie A.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Murray, Sophie A.] Dublin Inst Adv Studies, Sch Cosm Phys, Dublin D02 XF86, Ireland; [Guerrero, Antonio] Univ Alcala, Madrid 28801, Spain; [Glover, Alexi] European Space Agcy, European Space Operat Ctr, D-64293 Darmstadt, Germany",Met Office - UK; Trinity College Dublin; Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; Universidad de Alcala; European Space Agency,"Bingham, S (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter EX1 3QS, Devon, England.",suzy.bingham@metoffice.gov.uk,"Guerrero, Antonio/Q-6006-2019","Guerrero, Antonio/0000-0002-7056-7753; Murray, Sophie/0000-0002-9378-5315; Bingham, Suzy/0000-0002-6977-0885",Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-17-1-039],"Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR))","The authors would like to thank the contributors to the ESWW15 plenary sessions: J.

Models are mostly successful in simulating the observed AO structure and the corresponding surface temperature variability. It is found that while AO exhibits a large positive trend, especially during the autumn season with a relatively smaller trend during the winter and spring seasons. In all seasons the interannual variance in AO remains the same for both scenarios. These features in the time-series leads to two distinct patterns of temperature variability. One is the polar amplification pattern due to the long-term anthropogenic forcing, which is much larger in its amplitude. Another is related to the natural variability of the AO, which is confined over the land surface and is marked by a dipole pattern of temperature between the Eurasian continent and Greenland. It is argued that the gradual trend in the AO is not a result of enhanced natural variability of the AO dynamics itself, but rather a result of the large anthropogenic forced linear trend projected onto the mean climatological state of the Arctic region. Distinguishing these two patterns of warming is crucial for detecting the signal of future global warming trend over the Eurasian continent and other regions.","[Hori, Masatake E.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Nohara, Daisuke] APEC Climate Ctr, Pusan, South Korea; [Tanaka, Hiroshi L.] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",Nagoya University; University of Tsukuba,"Hori, ME (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",mhori@hyarc.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Nohara, Daisuke/CAF-2257-2022","Nohara, Daisuke/0000-0002-8046-7377",,,,,24,8,9,0,13,METEOROLOGICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"C/O JAPAN METEOROLOGICAL AGENCY 1-3-4 OTE-MACHI, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100-0004, JAPAN",0026-1165,2186-9057,,J METEOROL SOC JPN,J.

The environmental impacts of reuse have, however, received little attention-the benefits typically assumed rather than understood-and consequently the overall effects remain unclear. In this article, we structure the current work on the topic, reviewing the potential benefits and pitfalls described in the literature and providing a framework for future research. Many products' use-phase energy requirements are decreasing. The relative importance of the embodied impacts from initial production is therefore growing and the prominence of reuse as an abatement strategy is likely to increase in the future. Many examples are found in the literature of beneficial reuse of standardized, unpowered products and components, and repairing an item is always found to be less energy intensive than new production. However, reusing a product does not guarantee an environmental benefit. Attention must be paid to restoring and upgrading old product efficiencies, minimizing overspecification in the new application, and considering whether more efficient, new products exist that would be more suitable. Cheap, reused goods can allow many consumers access to products they would otherwise have been unable to afford. Though socially valuable, these sales, which may help minimize landfill in the short term, can represent additional consumption rather than a net environmental benefit compared to the status quo.","[Cooper, Daniel R.; Gutowski, Timothy G.] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room 35-234, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Cooper, DR (corresponding author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room 35-234, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",drcooper@mit.edu,,,,,,,147,114,115,5,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The TOA correction is based on radiative transfer. The analysis of the first 3 years of AIRS radiances verifies the absolute calibration at 2616 cm(-1) to better than 200 mK, with better than 16 mK/yr stability. The AIRS radiometric calibration uses an internal full aperture wedge blackbody with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable prelaunch calibration coefficients. The calibration coefficients have been unchanged since launch. The analysis uses very tight cloud filtering, which selects about 7000 cloud-free tropical ocean spectra per day, about 0.5% of the data. The absolute accuracy and stability of the radiometry demonstrated at 2616 cm(-1) are direct consequences of the implementation of AIRS as a thermally controlled, cooled grating-array spectrometer and meticulous attention to details. Comparable radiometric performance is inferred from the AIRS design for all 2378 channels. AIRS performance sets the benchmark for what can be achieved with a state-of-the-art hyperspectral radiometer from polar orbit and what is expected from future hyperspectral sounders. AIRS was launched into a 705 km altitude polar orbit on NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) Aqua spacecraft on 4 May 2002. AIRS covers the 3.7-15.4 micron region of the thermal infrared spectrum with a spectral resolution of nu/Delta nu = 1200 and has returned 3.7 million spectra of the upwelling radiance each day since the start of routine data gathering in September 2002.","CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Aumann, HH (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",aumann@jpl.nasa.gov,,,,,,,19,72,73,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

In ISOBAR ground-based flux and profile observations are combined with boundary layer remote sensing methods and the extensive usage of different unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). During February 2017 and 2018 we carried out two major field campaigns over the sea ice of the northern Baltic Sea, close to the Finnish island of Hailuoto at 65 degrees N. In total 14 intensive observational periods (IOPs) resulted in extensive SBL datasets with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, which will form the basis for various numerical modeling experiments. First results from the campaigns indicate numerous very stable boundary layer (VSBL) cases, characterized by strong stratification, weak winds, and clear skies, and give detailed insight in the temporal evolution and vertical structure of the entire SBL. The SBL is subject to rapid changes in its vertical structure, responding to a variety of different processes. In particular, we study cases involving a shear instability associated with a low-level jet, a rapid strong cooling event observed a few meters above ground, and a strong wave-breaking event that triggers intensive near-surface turbulence. Furthermore, we use observations from one IOP to validate three different atmospheric models. The unique finescale observations resulting from the ISOBAR observational approach will aid future research activities, focusing on a better understanding of the SBL and its implementation in numerical models.","[Kral, Stephan T.; Reuder, Joachim; Haualand, Kristine F.; Maronga, Bjorn; Jonassen, Marius O.; Baserud, Line; Jenkins, Alastair D.; Seidl, Andrew W.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Kral, Stephan T.; Reuder, Joachim; Haualand, Kristine F.; Baserud, Line; Seidl, Andrew W.] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Vihma, Timo; Suomi, Irene; Urbancic, Gabin H.; Ajosenpaa, Hada; Kouznetsov, Rostislav] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Urbancic, Gabin H.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Greene, Brian R.; Chilson, Phillip B.] Univ Oklahoma, Adv Radar Res Ctr, Sch Meteorol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Greene, Brian R.; Chilson, Phillip B.; Pillar-Little, Elizabeth A.] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Autonomous Sensing & Sampling, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Steeneveld, Gert-Jan; Holtslag, Albert A.

Forensics analysis; Image anonymity; Image forgery; Photo response non uniformity; Wavelet,METADATA; TRACES,"The increased diffusion of digital images generated by mobile devices through social networks, personal and professional communications, etc. is self-evident. This creates potential problems because some of these images may be used as supporting evidence for different criminal cases. In this paper, algorithms are proposed based on sensor noise and wavelet transforms which can alter the information which is usually employed to find the source of an image, and forge it so that it could point to a different, unrelated device. In the state of art we will show that there are already some algorithms capable of carrying out these manipulations, but they generally need much more and more complex data than our proposal. They also generally need physical access to the camera whose generated images you want to tamper. Our proposal algorithm to destruct the image identifiable data, only needs the picture which will be anonymized. Also, our proposal to forge the image identifiable data only needs a set of photos from the attacker camera, and the picture to be tampered. In particular, it does not need access to the camera that will be falsely linked to the picture. These scenarios are the most common and realistic. The algorithms proposed will help to strengthen existing techniques and develop new forensic approaches for mobile image source identification that will be more robust against attacks.

We illustrate the tool with an uncertainty propagation example in environmental modelling, specifically in the urban water domain. The functionalities of the class setup and the methods and functions MC. setup, MC. sim, MC. analysis and Agg.t are explained, which are used for setting up, running and analysing Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation simulations, and for spatio-temporal aggregation. We also show how the package can be used to model and predict variables that vary in space and time by using a spatio-temporal variogram model and space-time ordinary kriging. stUPscales takes uncertainty characterisation and propagation a step further by including temporal and spatio-temporal auto- and cross-correlation, resulting in more realistic (spatio-)temporal series of environmental variables. Due to its modularity, the package allows the implementation of additional methods and functions for spatio-temporal disaggregation of model inputs and outputs, when linking models across multiple space-time scales.","[Torres-Matallana, Jairo Arturo; Leopold, Ulrich] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat ERIN, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Torres-Matallana, Jairo Arturo; Heuvelink, Gerard B.

We explored studies that addressed options to mitigate GHG emissions in the animal production chain and concluded that most studies focused on production systems in developed countries and on a single GHG. They did not account for the complex interrelated effects on other GHGs or their relation with other aspects of sustainability, such as eutrophication, animal welfare, land use or food security. Current decisions on GHG mitigation in animal production, therefore, are hindered by the complexity and uncertainty of the combined effect of GHG mitigation options on climate change and their relation with other aspects of sustainability. There is an urgent need to integrate simulation models at animal, crop and farm level with a consequential life cycle sustainability assessment to gain insight into the multidimensional and sometimes conflicting consequences of GHG mitigation options.","[de Boer, I.

Although Brazil stands out worldwide in terms of hydroelectric power generation, the use of PHSP in the country is practically nonexistent. Considering the advancement of variable renewable sources in the Brazilian electrical mix, and the need to provide flexibility to the national electrical system, several official documents cite PHSP as an important alternative for the expansion of the Brazilian electrical system. This article presents the state of the art of PHSP and its use, in order to create a theoretical basis for future research on the subject, also providing theoretical support for Brazilian energy planning. The review includes a global panorama on the use of PHSP in the world, the technical and projective foundations on this type of technology, its benefits, and disadvantages, in addition to the new configurations and possible layouts for the construction of pumped hydro storage plants. Finally, the challenges and trends for the dissemination of PHSP technology are addressed.","[Nogueira Vilanova, Mateus Ricardo] Sao Paulo State Univ Unesp, Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Av Eng Francisco Jose Longo 777, BR-12245000 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Flores, Alessandro Thiessen] Sao Paulo State Univ Unesp, Sch Engn, Mech Engn Postgrad Programme, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Perrella Balestieri, Jose Antonio] Sao Paulo State Univ Unesp, Sch Engn, Dept Energy, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista,"Vilanova, MRN (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ Unesp, Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Av Eng Francisco Jose Longo 777, BR-12245000 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",mateus.vilanova@unesp.br; alessandro.thiesen@gmail.com,"Vilanova, Mateus Ricardo Nogueira/AAC-8991-2020; Balestieri, José A Perrella/B-7520-2008","Vilanova, Mateus Ricardo Nogueira/0000-0002-3768-523X; Balestieri, José A Perrella/0000-0003-0762-0854",,,,,109,7,7,28,83,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1678-5878,1806-3691,,J BRAZ SOC MECH SCI,J.

Bottomup approaches have been encouraged to enhance sustainability agenda. Assessment methods have been developed to ensure an incessant decrease in carbon footprint of buildings. It has long been discussed that many of such assessment methods systematically lack dedicated criteria to assess building beyond its physical boundaries. This paper focuses on Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) and attempts to map it against LEED and CASBEE with an aim to encourage assessment beyond physical boundaries of a building and into its immediate context and surrounding environment. A critical review of the latest literature was conducted to establish the general concepts and principles behind the CSH's method of assessment in comparison with CASBEE and LEED. Following this, differences, positive and negative aspects of the three assessment method were established through in-depth review of their official documents and by cross-referencing the different components, methodologies and assessment criteria of each. This led to a comparative analysis using a critical evaluation of findings of The Building Environmental Quality Evaluation for Sustainability through Time (BEQUEST), The European Sustainable Development Strategy (ESDS) and The Freiburg Charter (FC). Expert interviews were conducted to consolidate the findings of this study. This added technical in-depth expert opinions to the preliminary findings of this research and helped pave the way for providing practical suggestions for possible areas of improvement for the CSH.

In the Arctic Ocean, these depositional systems are experiencing rapid changes that could significantly impact biogeochemical cycling. In this study, we investigate whether continental margin sediments north of Svalbard represent a source or sink of Fe and Mn to the water column and how climate change might alter these biogeochemical cycles. Our results highlight that sediments on the Yermak Plateau and Sofia Basin exhibit accumulations of Fe and Mn phases compared to average shale. Conversely, sediments from the Barents Sea slope exhibit lower enrichments of Fe and Mn compared to average shale, with the exception of enriched, near-surface sediment layers. Pore waters from these slope sites provide evidence for Fe and Mn reduction and diffusion of Fe and Mn into near surface sediments, which are susceptible to physical or biogeochemical remobilization. These regional patterns are best explained by the spatial distribution of sea ice coverage and labile organic carbon fluxes to the seafloor. As sea ice continues to retreat and the Yermak Plateau becomes seasonally ice-free, productivity is expected to increase, which would increase the flux of carbon to the sediments, thereby increasing oxidant demand, and the reduction of Fe and Mn mineral phases. Our results suggest that as sea ice continues to retreat, the Yermak Plateau and other Arctic continental margins could become sources of Fe and Mn to Arctic bottom waters.","[Tessin, Allyson] Kent State Univ, Dept Geol, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Tessin, Allyson; Marz, Christian] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Blais, Marie-Amelie] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Brumsack, Hans-Juergen; Schnetger, Bernhard] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Oldenburg, Germany; [Matthiessen, Jens] Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [O'Regan, Matt] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Stockholm, Sweden","University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; University of Leeds; Laval University; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Stockholm University","Tessin, A (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Geol, Kent, OH 44242 USA.;Tessin, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",atessin@kent.edu,"Brumsack, Hans-Juergen/O-7942-2016","Brumsack, Hans-Juergen/0000-0002-5549-5018; Tessin, Allyson/0000-0001-8657-8484; Blais, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-7649-1964; Matthiessen, Jens/0000-0002-6952-2494; O'Regan, Matt/0000-0002-6046-1488; Schnetger, Bernhard/0000-0003-1638-3977","TRANSSIZ cruise (Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone) [PS92, AWI_PS92_00]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant [709175]",TRANSSIZ cruise (Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant,The TRANSSIZ cruise (Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone; PS92; Grant AWI_PS92_00) was initiated and co-organized by the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) network.

The extent to which the vanishing abundant maritime glaciers buffer the declining precipitation-runoff remains unclear. Here, with a state-of-the-art enthalpy-based distributed cryosphere-hydrology model and first-hand hydrometeorology observations at Motuo (latest accessible Chinese county), we carefully examine the Yarlung Zangbo basin along Himalayas. We find that during 1998-2019, the rising downstream runoff (lower Nuxia; +6.40 x 10(8) m(3)/yr) offsets the dropping upstream runoff (upper Nuxia; -6.89 x 10(8) m(3)/yr); however, only the marginal contribution from the vanishing eastern-Himalaya and Nyainqentanglha glaciers. During 1998-2019, dry upstream illustrates limited glacier melt (15.7 mm/yr) with dominated snow melt (78.8 mm/yr); while much larger at humid downstream (144.8 mm/yr for glacier melt and 219.1 mm/yr for snow melt). From 1981 to 2019, we observe glacier-to-snow melt transition in both upstream and downstream due to glacier degradation and growing nonmonsoon-season precipitation.","[Wang, Yuanwei; Wang, Lei; Zhou, Jing; Yao, Tandong; Yang, Wei; Zhong, Xiaoyang; Liu, Ruishun; Luo, Lun; Ye, Qinghua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanwei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanwei; Wang, Lei; Yao, Tandong; Zhong, Xiaoyang; Liu, Ruishun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zhidan] Minist Water Resources, Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ningsheng; Ding, Haitao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS","Wang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wanglei@itpcas.ac.cn,"Wang, Lei/B-3113-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-7201-8715; Wang, Yuanwei/0000-0001-7394-799X; Liu, Ruishun/0000-0003-4969-6849; Zhou, Jing/0000-0003-4846-8334","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91747201, 92047301]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK020604]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060202]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 91747201 and 92047301), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (2019QZKK020604), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20060202), and The Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST.",,61,4,6,20,43,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

However, these different targets need to be integrated to create a unified, synergistic, and balanced restoration approach. This should be done by combining state-of-the-art knowledge from natural and social sciences to create manageable units of restoration that consider both the temporal and multiple spatial scales of ecosystems, legislative units, and policy agendas. Only by considering these aspects combined can we accomplish more cost-efficient restoration resulting in resilient ecosystems that provide a wealth of ecosystem services and the possibility for sustainable economic development in the future. We propose a novel conceptual framework that will yield more effective ecosystem restoration: the Operational Restoration Unit. This is based on scale-dependent restoration actions that can adhere easily to the relevant environmental legislation, encompass the spatial and temporal resilience of aquatic ecosystems, and consider the sum of human pressures acting on water bodies. This opens up possibilities for an effective integration of the restoration agenda into the delivery of major policy objectives of economic growth, regional development, and human security.

State-of-the-art crop growth models are powerful tools to assess the response of crops to altered environmental conditions and cultivation practices. In this paper, the process-based, object-oriented and generic DANUBIA crop growth model is presented. To evaluate the performance of the model, a validation analysis is carried out by comparing modelled data with various field measurements of sugar beet, spring barley, maize, winter wheat and potato crops. Model performance statistics show that crop growth is efficiently simulated. The closest agreement between measured and modelled biomass and leaf area index is achieved for sugar beet and winter wheat. Additionally, the response of the model to changed nitrogen availability caused by cultivation practices is analysed and reveals good results. The results suggest that the model is a suitable tool for numerically assessing the consequences of Global Change on biomass production, water and nitrogen demand, taking into account the complex interplay of water, carbon and nitrogen fluxes in agro-ecosystems.

The intention of this project was to achieve fuels of diesel, kerosene and gasoline quality from liquid phase pyrolysis oil (LPP oil). The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) was altered between 0.5 h(-1) and 3 h-1. The LHSV was higher than those reported for state-of-the-art HDO processes. The LPP oil was derived from the bioCRACK pilot plant in the OMV refinery in Vienna/Schwechat, which was operated by BDI - BioEnergy International GmbH. After HDO, separation of the upgraded hydrocarbon fraction from the aqueous carrier was achieved. About 50% of the biogenous carbon was transferred into the liquid hydrocarbon product phase, and the residual amount was transferred into the gas phase. Comparably slow catalyst aging by coke formation was attributed to the high water content of LPP oil. During HDO, a fuel of almost gasoline and diesel quality was produced. The H/C ratio was between 1.7 and 2 with a residual oxygen content of 0.0 wt% to 1.2 wt%. The boiling range of the hydrocarbon product phase was between those of gasoline and diesel. In GC-MS analysis, mainly saturated alkanes were found.","[Treusch, K.; Schwaiger, N.; Schlackl, K.; Nagl, R.; Rollett, A.; Schadler, M.; Hammerschlag, B.; Ausserleitner, J.; Huber, A.; Siebenhofer, M.] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Chem Engn & Environm Technol, Graz, Austria; [Treusch, K.; Schwaiger, N.; Pucher, P.] BDI BioEnergy Int GmbH, Raaba Grambach, Austria",Graz University of Technology,"Schwaiger, N (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Chem Engn & Environm Technol, Graz, Austria.;Schwaiger, N (corresponding author), BDI BioEnergy Int GmbH, Raaba Grambach, Austria.",nikolaus.schwaiger@tugraz.at,,"Schwaiger, Nikolaus/0000-0003-4720-2518",Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"This work was funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the scope of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund.

Shallow to relatively deep lacustrine deposits and alluvial plain deposits, magnetostratigraphically calibrated, hold malacofaunas, ostracofaunas, and carpological remains, as well as a pollen record. Palaeocarpological remains widely originated from the local (azonal) vegetation of waterlogged environments. Nonetheless, some taxa show transitional morphology between possibly extinct Pliocene-Pleistocene forms and living taxa. The pollen record highlights a conifer-dominated forest phase, indicating a temperate-wet interglacial period, well aligned inside the schemes for the same latitudinal band. The abundance of tree taxa currently absent from the Italian peninsula points to pre-Jaramillo late early Pleistocene biostratigraphical characters, here compared to other sections from central Italy, and contributes to a better definition of modes and timing of their disappearance in southern Europe. Malacofaunas and ostracods, still with late early Pleistocene features, together with Charophyte, mark repeated fluctuations in energy, temperature, and chemical composition of water. The overall record identifies an incipient diachronous cooling trend, for the first time recognized in southern Europe.","[Bizzarri, Roberto; Baldanza, Angela] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Fis & Geol, Via A Pascoli Snc, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Corrado, Paolo; Magri, Donatella] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, Ple A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Martinetto, Edoardo] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, Turin, Italy; [Esu, Daniela] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Ple A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Caprai, Valentina] Via XXV Aprile 14, I-52044 Camucia Di Cortona, AR, Italy; [Colacicchi, Roberto] Via Sabotino 5, I-06034 Foligno, PG, Italy; [Napoleone, Giovanni; Albianelli, Andrea] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via G La Pira, Florence, Italy",University of Perugia; Sapienza University Rome; University of Turin; Sapienza University Rome; University of Florence,"Baldanza, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Fis & Geol, Via A Pascoli Snc, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",angela.baldanza@unipg.it,"Magri, Donatella/E-8885-2011; Bizzarri, Roberto/AAC-6739-2021","Magri, Donatella/0000-0001-7254-593X; Bizzarri, Roberto/0000-0002-0698-9070; Baldanza, Angela/0000-0002-1731-7544",,,,,95,4,4,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0033-5894,1096-0287,,QUATERNARY RES,Quat.

However, gases dissolved in the effluent of these reactors, CH(4)and H2S in some instances, are a major drawback. These dissolved gases can be emitted into the atmosphere downstream of the anaerobic reactors, resulting in odour nuisance and, in the case of H2S, corrosion, while in the case of CH4, increasing greenhouse gas emissions with a significant loss of potentially recoverable energy. In this sense, this study aims to provide a critical review of the recent efforts to control CH(4)and H2S dissolved in UASB reactor effluents, with a focus on the different available techniques. Different desorption techniques have been tested for the removal/recovery of dissolved CH(4)and H2S: diffused aeration, simplified desorption chamber, packed desorption chamber, closed downflow hanging sponge reactor, membrane contactor, and vacuum desorption chamber. Other recent publications addressing the oxidation of these compounds in biological posttreatments with simultaneous nitrification/denitrification of ammonia were also discussed. Additionally, the rationale of CH(4)recovery was determined by energy balance and carbon footprint approaches, and the H2S removal was examined by modelling its emission and atmospheric dispersion.","[Centeno-Mora, Erick; Fonseca, Paula Rafaela; Andreao, Willian Lemker; de Souza, Claudio Leite; de Lemos Chernicharo, Carlos] Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Centeno-Mora, Erick] Univ Costa Rica UCR, Sch Civil Engn, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Brandt, Emanuel Manfred Freire] Fed Univ Juiz de Fora UFJF, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Juiz De Fora, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidad Costa Rica; Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora,"Centeno-Mora, E (corresponding author), Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.;Centeno-Mora, E (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica UCR, Sch Civil Engn, San Jose, Costa Rica.",erick.centenomora@ucr.ac.cr,,"Andreao, Willian/0000-0002-3327-1777","Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Estacoes de Tratamento de Esgoto Sustentaveis -INCT ETEs Sustentaveis; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPES [001]; University of Costa Rica; Program Estudantes-Convenio de PosGraduacao -PEC-PG, from CAPES/CNPq/MRE-Brasil","Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Estacoes de Tratamento de Esgoto Sustentaveis -INCT ETEs Sustentaveis; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); University of Costa Rica; Program Estudantes-Convenio de PosGraduacao -PEC-PG, from CAPES/CNPq/MRE-Brasil","The authors received financial support from the following institutions: Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Estacoes de Tratamento de Esgoto Sustentaveis -INCT ETEs Sustentaveis; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPES - Finance Code 001.; E.

However, developing models with these characteristics remains challenging. Here, we present a dataset corresponding to a renowned tectonic entity in the Swiss Alps - the Nappe de Morcles - that does achieve these criteria. Locations of lithological interfaces and formation orientations were first extracted from existing sources. Then, using state-of-the-art algorithms, the interfaces were interpolated. Finally, an iterative process of evaluation and re-interpolation was undertaken. The geology was satisfactorily reproduced; modelled interfaces correspond well with the input data, and the estimated volumes seem plausible. Overall, 18 formations, including their associated secondary folds and selected faults, are represented at 10 m resolution. Numerous environmental investigations in the study area could benefit from the dataset; indeed, it is already informing integrated hydrological (snow/surface-water/ groundwater) simulations.

We specifically focus on water-related low-cost sensor networks, and conceptualize them as socio-technical systems that can address resource management challenges and opportunities at three scales of resolution: (1) technologies, (2) users and scenarios, and (3) society and communities. Building this argument, first we identify a general structure for building low-cost sensor networks by assembling technical components across configuration levels. Second, we identify four application categories, namely operational monitoring, scientific research, system optimization, and community development, each of which has different technical and nontechnical configurations that determine how, where, by whom, and for what purpose low-cost sensor networks are used. Third, we discuss the governance factors (e.g., stakeholders and users, networks sustainability and maintenance, application scenarios, and integrated design) and emerging technical opportunities that we argue need to be considered to maximize the added value and long-term societal impact of the next generation of sensor network applications. We conclude that consideration of the full range of socio-technical issues is essential to realize the full potential of sensor network technologies for society and the environment.","[Mao, Feng; Khamis, Kieran; Clark, Julian; Krause, Stefan; Hannah, David M.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Buytaert, Wouter; Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Buytaert, Wouter; Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.] Reg Initiat Hydrol Monitoring Andean Ecosyst, Lima, Peru",University of Birmingham; Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Mao, F (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",MaoF1@cardiff.ac.uk,"Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022; Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F./H-8323-2019; Hannah, David M./B-9221-2015","Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F./0000-0002-4990-8429; Hannah, David M./0000-0003-1714-1240; Krause, Stefan/0000-0003-2521-2248; Mao, Feng/0000-0002-5889-1825","United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) - United Kingdom Economic and Social Research Council - United Kingdom Department for International Development [NE/K010239/1]; NERC [NE/P000452/1]; DFID - Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program [NE/P000452/1]; European Union [734317]; NERC [NE/K010239/1, NE/P00038X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) - United Kingdom Economic and Social Research Council - United Kingdom Department for International Development; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); DFID - Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program; European Union(European Commission); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We acknowledge the support from United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) - United Kingdom Economic and Social Research Council - United Kingdom Department for International Development, Grant/Award Number: project NE/K010239/1 (Mountain-EVO); NERC and DFID - Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program, Grant/Award Number: project NE/P000452/1 (Landslide EVO); and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 734317 (HiFreq).

The impacts of IAS are expected to rise with continued globalization, land use modification, and climate change. Developing effective strategies to deal with IAS requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, in which scientists work co-operatively with social scientists and policy-makers. Higher education can contribute to this process by training professionals to balance the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of the IAS problem. We examined the extent of such training in Canada by reviewing undergraduate and graduate university curricula at all 94 member institutions of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada for IAS content. We found that degree and diploma programs focusing on IAS issues are lacking at Canadian post-secondary institutions. Furthermore, few courses are devoted solely to 1AS, and those that are typically adopt an ecological perspective. We argue that the absence of interdisciplinary university curricula on IAS in Canada negatively affects our ability to respond to this growing global challenge. We present several international educational programs on IAS as case studies on how to better integrate training on invasive species into universitycurricula in Canada.","[Smith, Andrea L.; Bazely, Dawn R.] York Univ, Inst Res & Innovat Sustainabil, 349 York Lanes 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Bazely, Dawn R.; Yan, Norman D.] York Univ, Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Smith, AL (corresponding author), York Univ, Inst Res & Innovat Sustainabil, 349 York Lanes 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",geckoals@yorku.ca,,,Government of Ontario's Ministry of Research and Innovation and York University,Government of Ontario's Ministry of Research and Innovation and York University,"We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of John Lindsay (Brandon University); Danielle Wood (Dalhousie University); Peter Williams (Landcare Research New Zealand); Sarah Davies (Stellenbosch University); lmogen Bassett (University of Auckland); Stephanie Chang (University of British Columbia); Carole Horn (University California-Davis); Mike Braysher, Stephen Dalla Costa and Thomas Heinsohn (University of Canberra); Theresa Burg (University of Lethbridge); Ginna Anderson (University of Notre Dame); Art Freeden and Brenda Janzen (University of Northern British Columbia) and Brendon Larson (University of Waterloo).

The scheme employs a quasi-steady-state approximation of the cloud droplet growth equation (QDGE) to efficiently simulate aerosol activation, the vertical profile of supersaturation, and the activated cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) near the cloud base. The calculated maximum supersaturation values using the QDGE scheme were compared with multiple parcel model simulations under various aerosol and environmental conditions. The differences are all below 0.18 %, indicating good performance and accuracy of the QDGE scheme. We evaluated the QDGE scheme by specifying observed environmental thermodynamic variables and aerosol information from 31 cloud cases as input and comparing the simulated CDNC with cloud observations. The average of mean relative error ((MRE) over bar) of the simulated CDNC for cloud cases in each campaign ranges from 17.30 % in Brazil to 25.90 % in China, indicating that the QDGE scheme successfully reproduces observed variations in CDNC over a wide range of different meteorological conditions and aerosol regimes. Additionally, we carried out an error analysis by calculating the maximum information coefficient (MIC) between the MRE and input variables for the individual campaigns and all cloud cases. MIC values were then sorted by aerosol properties, pollution level, environmental humidity, and dynamic condition according to their relative importance to MRE.

However, the energy saving potential of green roofs depends on several aspects, such as the climate characteristics or the building loads. For this reason, the authors have been working on ways to modify the thermodynamic behavior of green roofs through passive low energy systems operating according to rules based on the relationships between the indoor and outdoor temperatures. This paper discusses the improvements in indoor thermal comfort which can be obtained by adopting water-to-air heat exchangers and indirect evaporative and radiant cooling strategies in buildings with green roofs. The study specifically looks at the effect of combining a simple evaporative/radiant system that cools the water pond where the water-to-air heat exchange occurs. Ad-hoc built test cells were investigated in southern California for over a year. Overall, the water-to-air heat exchangers proved to cool the indoor air in the test cells by almost 10 degrees C when the exterior temperatures were above 35 degrees C. In this system, the heat from the interior of the cells that could not be absorbed by the green roof, was transferred to the coupled water sink, and then dissipated into the atmosphere. This study shows that the benefits of the water-to-air heat exchange and of the evaporative cooling system are promising, while the water consumption is limited. Finally, the experimental investigation summarizes the benefits of combining green roofs and evaporative and radiant cooling of a water-to-air heat exchanger as a solution for building cooling and proposes simple equations to anticipate their temperature cooling effects.

The increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been suggested to be a leading contributor to global climate change. To slow the increase, reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions are necessary. Large emission point sources, such as fossil-fuel-based power generation facilities, are the first targets for these reductions. A benchmark, mature technology for the separation of dilute CO2 from gas streams is via absorption with aqueous amines. However, the use of solid adsorbents is now being widely considered as an alternative, potentially less-energy-intensive separation technology. This Review describes the CO2 adsorption behavior of several different classes of solid carbon dioxide adsorbents, including zeolites, activated carbons, calcium oxides, hydrotalcites, organic-inorganic hybrids, and metal-organic frameworks. These adsorbents are evaluated in terms of their equilibrium CO2 capacities as well as other important parameters such as adsorption-desorption kinetics, operating windows, stability, and regenerability. The scope of currently available CO2 adsorbents and their critical properties that will ultimately affect their incorporation into large-scale separation processes is presented.","[Choi, Sunho; Drese, Jeffrey H.; Jones, Christopher W.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Choi, S (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, 311 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",cjones@chbe.gatech.edu,"Choi, Sunho/AAK-1512-2020","Drese, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5529-9279",National Energy Technology Laboratory; Institute of Paper Science and Technology; Camille & Henry Dreyfus Postdoctoral Program in Environmental Chemistry,National Energy Technology Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Institute of Paper Science and Technology; Camille & Henry Dreyfus Postdoctoral Program in Environmental Chemistry,"Dr. Sunho Choi and Jeffrey H.

The present standard chemical method for soil analysis by dry combustion (DC) is destructive, and comprehensive sampling is labor intensive and time consuming. These, among other factors, are contributing to the development of new methods for soil analysis. These include a near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS). These technologies overcome many of the state-of-the-art DC method's shortcomings and offer advances that it cannot. While NIR and MIR measure C bonds, the other two new methods, like DC, are more specific in measuring C and other elements based on chemical, atomic, and nuclear reactions. In addition to their fundamentally different physical principles, these approaches vastly differ in the volumes they typically sample: LIBS, 10(-9) m(3); DC, 10(-7) m(3); NIR and MIR, 10(-6) m(3); and INS, about 0.3 m(3). Thus, extra care is needed when comparing the findings from any two of these methods. Also, the high heterogeneity of the soil matrix, the nonuniformity of C distribution, and the presence of coarse fragments, particularly in forested ecosystems, further compound the difficulties in making direct comparisons. We investigated the implications of these differences when correlating any two of these methods and reviewed the processes of comparing a volumetric measurement against a point measurement. We also conducted a detailed comparison of the INS method with the standard DC test. We found that the total (soil organic matter and roots) measured by the INS correlated better than its components with the DC analyses( r(2) = 0.97, P = 10(-7)). The samples for DC analysis were taken from excavations of 40- by 40- by 40-cm plots, in 5- and 10-cm layers.","[Wielopolski, Lucian] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm Sci Dep, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, So Inst Forest Ecosyst Biol, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Zhang, Yuen] SUNY Stony Brook, Dep Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Wielopolski, L (corresponding author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm Sci Dep, Bldg 490D, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",lwielo@bnl.gov,,,U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-98CH10886],U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),Special thanks go to Dr. F.

Compared to the core digital reading room, they can make wise judgments on the retrieval and use of information assets. The implementation of succeeding value management based on the latest technological tools is required for learning to provide knowledge services and fulfil its role as convergence is capable of reacting to varied data needs. The major obstacles to digital libraries are lack of planning and software, import restrictions on equipment, inadequately skilled staff, lack of standards, and a refusal to cooperate. This paper introduces the Eye Movement Technology (EMT) for the intelligent information service system of a smart library (SL) based on virtual reality (VR) strengths as an automated library management system for cost savings and increased output. EMT technology that can identify a person's appearance and monitor something to look at in real-time is recognized as wearable technology. Visual field position and the gaze vectors for each eye are converted into a data stream that includes the focus origin. Most of the library's operations can be managed by librarians; in a word, this system allows them to keep track of all of their books' transactions. The research in EMT-SL technology in the intelligent library system has developed to the point that a wider audience can use it. As a result, eye-tracking in reading rooms and information science research are expected to rise in the future; with the advancement of VR, the computer-generated modelling of images is experienced through special electrical devices, and people can be visible in different climates using traditional VR and augmented reality.","[Su, Xiao] Xijing Univ, Sch Design & Art, Xian 710000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Nan] Shaanxi Prov Canc Hosp, Mammary Dept, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xijing University,"Chen, N (corresponding author), Shaanxi Prov Canc Hosp, Mammary Dept, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",18092119861@163.com; chennanfighting@stu.xjtu.edu.cn,,,School-Level Scientific Research Project of Xijing University [XJ210214]; Xi'an Science and Technology Bureau Project: 3D digital Reconstruction and Virtual Reality Technology and the Role of 3D Printing in Breast Surgery [20YXYJ005(7)],School-Level Scientific Research Project of Xijing University; Xi'an Science and Technology Bureau Project: 3D digital Reconstruction and Virtual Reality Technology and the Role of 3D Printing in Breast Surgery,This work was supported by the School-Level Scientific Research Project of Xijing University: Research on the Design of Contemporary University Smart Library Based on VR Virtual Reality Technology-Taking Xi'an University Library as an Example (project no: XJ210214) and Xi'an Science and Technology Bureau Project: 3D digital Reconstruction and Virtual Reality Technology and the Role of 3D Printing in Breast Surgery (project no: 20YXYJ005(7)).,,31,0,0,15,15,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1058-9244,1875-919X,,SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH,Sci.

Winter rainfall amounts to one-third of annual rainfall, whereby light rain from warm clouds dominates. Daily rain occurrence and rain intensity during RICO largely differ among the satellite climatologies. TMPA best captures the frequent light rain events, only missing 7% of days on which the S-Pol radar detects rain, whereas HOAPS-C misses 33% and GPCP 1DD misses 56%. Algorithm constraints mainly cause these differences. In HOAPS-C also few available passive microwave (PMW) sensor overpasses limit its performance. TMPA outperforms HOAPS-C when only comparing nonmissing time steps, yet HOAPS-C can detect rain for S-Pol rain-covered areas down to 2%. In GPCP 1DD's algorithm, the underestimated rain occurrence derived from PMW scanners is linked to the overestimated rain intensity, being constrained by the GPCP monthly satellite-gauge combination, whereby IR sensors determine the timing. Algorithm improvements in version 1.2 increased the rain occurrence by 50% relative to version 1.1. In version 7 of TMPA, algorithm corrections in PMW sounder data largely improved the rain detection relative to version 6. TMPA best represents light rain in the North Atlantic trades, followed by HOAPS-C and GPCP 1DD.","[Burdanowitz, Joerg; Nuijens, Louise; Stevens, Bjorn] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Klepp, Christian] Univ Hamburg, Climate Syst Anal & Predict, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg,"Burdanowitz, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",joerg.burdanowitz@mpimet.mpg.de,"Stevens, Bjorn/A-1757-2013","Stevens, Bjorn/0000-0003-3795-0475; Burdanowitz, Joerg/0000-0002-0540-4034",,,,,50,13,13,0,19,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

An emerging view on fisheries management emphasizes the need to manage fisheries as complex social-ecological systems. Yet, our understanding of the outcomes of fisheries management from a social-ecological perspective is limited in comparison to that provided by either the biophysical or the social perspective alone. In the Baltic Sea, management interventions focused on ecosystem recovery contributed to unintended changes from 1996 to 2009 in the fishing strategy diversity practiced by Swedish fishers. We evaluate how the changes in strategy diversification affected the capacity of Swedish fishers to adapt to future ecosystem changes. To do this, we constructed and analyzed social-ecological fisheries networks. Our analysis confirmed the previously reported development of a narrower combination of fishing strategies among large-scale fishers, parallel with a diversification in small-scale fishers' strategies. However, the results demonstrated that switching fishing strategies has, in fact, increased in magnitude, and the fishers were more equally distributed in different fishing strategies in 2009 than in 1996. Further, we detected a development toward lower ecological dependency between fishing strategies within the community, although the strategies remained connected through ecological interactions. In conclusion, our analysis of the social-ecological interdependencies suggests that the previously reported changes in the fishing strategy diversity increased the adaptability of the Swedish Baltic Sea fishers to changing ecological conditions. On the other hand, the changes may have made the Baltic Sea more vulnerable to poor management. This empirical study emphasizes the importance of a social-ecological approach on fisheries research and management. Our results show that appreciating the complexity and changing nature of fisher behavior is crucial when assessing fisheries management outcomes, and when designing policies that aim to maintain adaptability in the uncertain and dynamic fish industry.","[Yletyinen, Johanna] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Yletyinen, Johanna; Blenckner, Thorsten; Bodin, Orjan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Uppsala, Sweden",University of Canterbury; Stockholm University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Yletyinen, J (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch, New Zealand.;Yletyinen, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Bodin, Örjan/A-5098-2010; Yletyinen, Johanna/ABC-5785-2020; Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas/N-6535-2017","Bodin, Örjan/0000-0002-8218-1153; Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas/0000-0002-3201-9262",Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS [185]; EU; Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden); MISTRA; Swedish Research Council; Formas,Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS; EU(European Commission); Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden)(Swedish Research Council Formas); MISTRA; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"We thank Jens Olsson for his contribution to coastal fishes' predator-prey interactions, and Wiebren Boonstra, Jason Tylianakis, Roger Pech, and Audrey Lustig for valuable comments on the earlier versions of the manuscript.

With the accumulation of high-resolution (HR) remote sensing data and emerging of new satellite sensors, HR observation of urban areas has become increasingly possible, which provides us with more elaborate urban information. However, the strong heterogeneity in the spectral and spatial domain of HR imagery brings great challenges to urban remote sensing. In recent years, numerous approaches were proposed to deal with HR image interpretation over complex urban scenes, including a series of features from low level to high level, as well as state-of-the-art methods depicting not only the urban extent, but also the intra-urban variations. In this paper, we aim to summarize the major advances in HR urban remote sensing from the aspects of feature representation and information extraction. Moreover, the future trends are discussed from the perspectives of methodology, urban structure and pattern characterization, big data challenge, and global mapping.","[Gong, Jianya; Huang, Xin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chun; Huang, Xin] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Huang, X (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Liu, C; Huang, X (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liuchun919@whu.edu.cn; xhuang@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771360, 41842035]; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2017CFA029]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0501403]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [JCYJ20180306170645080]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41771360 & 41842035), the National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals, the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2017CFA029), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB0501403), and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (Grant No. JCYJ20180306170645080).",,121,23,24,15,124,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7313,1869-1897,,SCI CHINA EARTH SCI,Sci.

This led to the release of contaminants, including highly toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF). This study re-examines a composite soil sample collected shortly after the fire using state-of-the-art FT-ICR (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance) and GC x GC-TOF (comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. The FT-ICR experiments led to the identification of approximately 150 molecular formulas, corresponding to chlorinated and mixed chloro/bromo compounds. The majority of these are halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (halo-PAHs), including highly substituted (e.g., C14HCl9 and C16HCl9) and high molecular weight (e.g., C28H12Cl4) Cl-PAHs that have not been reported previously in environmental samples. Complementary GC x GC-TOF experiments resolved individual halo-PAHs, some of which were confirmed with available standards. The concentrations of the most abundant halo-PAH groups, C14H8Cl2 (22 mu g/g) and C16H8Cl2 (20 mu g/g) are much higher than reported dioxin values and comparable to the corresponding PAH groups C14H10 (12 mu g/g) and C16H10 (19 mu g/g). The high abundance of the halo-PAHs identified in this study highlights the need for further investigation into their environmental occurrence and risk.","[Fernando, Sujan; Jobst, Karl J.; McCarry, Brian E.] McMaster Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Jobst, Karl J.; Taguchi, Vince Y.; Helm, Paul A.; Reiner, Eric J.] Ontario Minist Environm & Climate Change, Lab Serv Branch, Toronto, ON M9P 3V6, Canada; [Reiner, Eric J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada",McMaster University; University of Toronto,"Jobst, KJ (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada.",Karl.Jobst@Ontario.ca,"Helm, Paul/ABC-1534-2021; Reiner, Eric/A-4094-2017","Helm, Paul/0000-0002-7462-4217; Reiner, Eric/0000-0002-5349-2139; Jobst, Karl/0000-0002-7687-6629",,,,,35,47,52,4,109,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

There are multiple drivers including rising coastal water levels, more intense hydrologic inputs, shoaling groundwater and urbanization. Accurate coastal flood event prediction poses numerous challenges: representing boundary conditions, depicting terrain and hydraulic infrastructure, integrating spatially and temporally variable overtopping flows, routing overland flows and incorporating hydrologic signals. Tremendous advances in geospatial data quality, numerical modeling and overtopping estimation have significantly improved flood prediction; however, risk assessments do not typically consider the co-occurrence of multiple flooding pathways. Compound flooding refers to the combined effects of marine and hydrologic processes. Alternatively, multiple flooding source-receptor pathways (e.g., groundwater-surface water, overtopping-overflow, surface-sewer flow) may simultaneously amplify coastal hazard and vulnerability. Currently, there is no integrated framework considering compound and multi-pathway flooding processes in a unified approach. State-of-the-art urban coastal flood modeling methods and research directions critical to developing an integrated framework for explicitly resolving multiple flooding pathways are presented.","[Gallien, Timu W.; Kalligeris, Nikos; Delisle, Marie-Pierre C.; Tang, Bo-Xiang; Lucey, Joseph T.

The skip connections concatenate all the features that are generated at the same level from the previous paths to the inputs of the convolutional layers in both paths of the second U-Net in a densely connected manner. We implement two versions of the model with different number of filters at each level of each U-Net by maximising the Dice similarity between the predicted liver region and that of the ground truth.

Early research shows theoretical benefits in terms of exergy efficiency over other technologies. Pilot projects indicate that the concept delivers good performance if heating and cooling demands are diverse. However, the operation of these networks is not yet optimized and there is no quantification of the benefits over other technologies in various scenarios. Moreover, there is a lack of, understanding of how to integrate and control multiple distributed heat and cold sources in such networks. Therefore, this paper develops a control concept based on a temperature set point optimization and agent-based control which allows the modular integration of an arbitrary number of sources and consumers. Afterwards, the concept is applied to two scenarios representing neighborhoods in San Francisco and Cologne with different heating and cooling demands and boundary conditions. The performance of the system is then compared to other state-of-the-art heating and cooling solutions using dynamic simulations with Modelica. The results show that bidirectional low temperature networks without optimization produce 26% less emissions in the San Francisco scenario and 63% in the Cologne scenario in comparison to the other heating and cooling solutions. Savings, of energy costs are 46% and 27%, and reductions of primary energy consumption 52% and 72%, respectively. The presented operation optimization leads to electricity use reductions of 13% and 41% when compared to networks with free-floating temperature control and the results indicate further potential for improvement. The study demonstrates the advantage of low temperature networks in different situations and introduces a control concept that is extendable for real implementation.","[Buenning, Felix; Wetter, Michael] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buenning, Felix; Fuchs, Marcus; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Blds & Indoor Climate, Aachen, Germany",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; E-ON; RWTH Aachen University,"Bunning, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",felix.buenning@rwth-aachen.de,"Bünning, Felix/AAH-3973-2019; Wetter, Michael/ABD-7533-2021","Bünning, Felix/0000-0002-8699-5955; Wetter, Michael/0000-0002-7043-0802","Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Building Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through its Thematic Network ACalNet","Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Building Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through its Thematic Network ACalNet(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","This research was supported by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Building Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.; We gratefully acknowledge the financial support for Felix Bunning from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through its Thematic Network ACalNet.",,63,76,77,2,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

This research utilizes the powerful evolutionary optimisation algorithm, covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, as a means of training neural networks to predict short term power demand, wind power generation and carbon dioxide intensity levels in Ireland over a two month period. The network is trained over one month and then tested over the following month. A neural network trained with covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy performs very competitively when compared to other state of the art prediction methods when forecasting Ireland's energy needs, providing fast convergence, more accurate predictions and robust performance. The covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy trained network also gives accurate predictions when predicting multiple time steps into the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

NO. 1022; PLANKTONIC-FORAMINIFERA; TROPICAL PACIFIC; WARM POOL; ICE-AGE; MG/CA PALEOTHERMOMETRY; INDIAN-OCEAN,"Sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) reflect global climate effects such as the El Nino - Southern Oscillation phenomenon. However, reconstructions of past changes in the WPWP from the geologic record vary depending on the specific proxy record used. Here we develop a multiproxy record of the last deglaciation from a radiocarbon-dated sediment core (MD97-2138) retrieved in the heart of the WPWP. SST reconstructions for the past 30,000 years based on planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca (Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer), alkenone unsaturation index, and foraminiferal transfer functions differ notably. Mg/Ca-based SST estimates from the surface dwelling species G. ruber in MD97-2138 indicate a larger surface cooling (3 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) than inferred from Mg/Ca ratios in G. sacculifer (2.3 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C), statistical transfer functions based on planktonic foraminiferal species assemblages, and Uk(37)' (1 degrees-2 degrees C). These estimates are consistent with estimates from other WPWP cores, thereby suggesting that the discrepancy is due to proxy compatibility rather than differences in cores qualitity. Postdepositional dissolution above the lysocline might have altered the Mg/Ca-based temperature estimates in our site, but this effect is insufficient to resolve discrepancies between Mg/Ca in G. ruber and the other proxies. We suggest that the lower estimates obtained from Mg/Ca in G. sacculifer, faunal transfer functions, and Uk(37)' might reflect subsurface temperature changes rather than strict surface estimates. Accounting for potential artefacts, including dissolution and bioturbation, we suggest that the glacial WPWP SST was about 2.5 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C cooler than during the Holocene, whereas the subsurface/upper thermocline temperature change was only about 1.8 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C. Interpreting variations in delta O-18(SW) in terms of salinity changes suggests a possibly slight decrease in surface salinity at the site of MD97-2138 during the LGM. Though LGM freshening in MD97-2138 is not robust to postdeposition dissolution effects, this inferred freshening appears to be a general feature of the western equatorial Pacific.","Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Aix Marseille Univ Europole Mediterraneen Arbois, CEREGE, CNRS, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Oregon State University,"de Garidel-Thoron, T (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",garidel@cerege.fr,"Beaufort, Luc/AAH-5305-2021; de Garidel-Thoron, Thibault/B-1204-2008; Beaufort, Luc/ABG-2289-2021; Sonzogni, Corinne/AAG-5816-2019; Bard, Edouard/G-7717-2014","de Garidel-Thoron, Thibault/0000-0001-8983-9571; Beaufort, Luc/0000-0001-6055-9373; ",,,,,89,66,66,1,40,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0883-8305,1944-9186,,PALEOCEANOGRAPHY,Paleoceanography,26-Jul,2007,3,,,,,,PA3204,10.1029/2006PA001269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006PA001269,,,18,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Oceanography; Paleontology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Oceanography; Paleontology,195QP,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,12/21/22,WOS:000248427000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has a unique oxygen-deficient crystal structure which provides it an outstanding electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance similar to ceramic materials. High electrical conductivity and ability to sustain in adverse media make these phases a point of attention for researchers in energy storage and environmental remediation applications. The Magneli phase-based reactive electroconductive membranes (REM) and electrodes have demonstrated the electrochemical oxidation of pollutants in the water in flow-through and flow by configuration. Additionally, it has also shown its potential for visible light photochemical degradation as well. This review attempts to summarize state of the art in various Magneli phases materials synthesis routes and their electrochemical and photochemical ability for environmental application. The manuscript introduces the Magneli phase, its crystal structure, and catalytic properties, followed by the recent development in synthesis methods from diverse titanium sources, notably TiO(2 )through thermal reduction. The various fabrication methods for Magneli phase-base REMs and electrodes have also been summarized. Furthermore, the article discussed the environmental remediations via electrochemical and photo-chemical advanced oxidation processes. Additionally, the hybrid technology with REMs and electrodes is used to counter membrane biofouling and develop electrochemical sensing devices for the pollutants. The Magneli phase materials have a bright future for both electrochemical and photochemical advanced oxidation of emerging contaminants in water and wastewater treatment.","[Kumar, Ashish; Barbhuiya, Najmul H.; Singh, Swatantra P.] Indian Inst Technol, Environm Sci & Engn Dept ESED, Mumbai 400076, India; [Singh, Swatantra P.] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Res Nanotechnol & Sci CRNTS, Mumbai 400076, India; [Singh, Swatantra P.] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai 400076, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Singh, SP (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Environm Sci & Engn Dept ESED, Mumbai 400076, India.",swatantra@iitb.ac.in,,"Kumar, Ashish/0000-0003-3118-6381; Haque, Najmul/0000-0001-9699-4756",Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB); Department of Science and Technology (DST); Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB),Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB); Department of Science and Technology (DST)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB),"We are grateful for the support from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) , Department of Science and Technology (DST) , and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) for their support for this work.",,140,2,2,28,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0045-6535,1879-1298,,CHEMOSPHERE,Chemosphere,NOV,2022,,2,,,,,135878,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135878,,,19,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5A2TM,35932919,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000862744300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, due to large fluctuations among LDI processes during each laser shot, accurate calibration of the mass-to-charge ratio for high-resolution SPAMS (HR-SPAMS) spectra is challenging. Here we developed an automatic linear calibration method to improve the accuracy of mass-to-charge (m/z) measurement for single atmospheric aerosol particles. Laboratory-generated sea spray aerosol and atmospheric ambient aerosol were tested. After the calibration, the fluctuation ranges of the reference ions' (e.g., Pb+ and SO4+) m/z reaches +/- 0.018 for sea spray aerosol and +/- 0.024 for ambient aerosol in average mass spectra. With such m/z accuracy, the HR-SPAMS spectra of sea spray aerosol can easily identify elemental compositions of organic peaks, such as C-x, CxHy and CxHyOz. While the chemical compositions of ambient aerosols are more complicated, CxHy, CxHyOz, and CNO peaks can also be identified based on their accurate mass. With the improved resolution, the time series of peaks with small m/z differences can be separated and measured. In addition, it is also found that applying high-resolution data with enhanced mass calibration can significantly affect particle classification (identification) using the ART-2a algorithm, which classify particles based on similarities among single-particle mass spectra.","[Zhu, Shengqiang; Wang, Shurong; Liu, Yaxi; Lu, Xiaohui; Chen, Hong; Wang, Lin; Chen, Jianmin; Yang, Xin; Wang, Xiaofei] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Atmospher Particle Pollut & Prev, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Li, Lei; Li, Mei; Zhou, Zhen] Jinan Univ, Inst Mass Spectrometer & Atmospher Environm, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lin; Chen, Jianmin; Yang, Xin; Wang, Xiaofei] Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xin] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Jinan University; Southern University of Science & Technology,"Yang, X; Wang, XF (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Atmospher Particle Pollut & Prev, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Yang, X; Wang, XF (corresponding author), Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.;Yang, X (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",yangxin@fudan.edu.cn; xiaofeiwang@fudan.edu.cn,"Chen, Jianmin/M-8575-2019; Wang, Lin/E-8546-2010; LI, Mei/ABF-8792-2021","Chen, Jianmin/0000-0001-5859-3070; Wang, Lin/0000-0002-4905-3432; LI, Mei/0000-0002-8811-5077; Yang, Xin/0000-0002-9173-1188","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41827804, 41775150, 21906024, 91544224]; Shanghai Natural Science Foundation [19ZR1404000]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai),"This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 41827804, 41775150, 21906024 and 91544224) and the Shanghai Natural Science Foundation (grant no. 19ZR1404000).",,33,2,2,6,26,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1867-1381,1867-8548,,ATMOS MEAS TECH,Atmos.

Attempts to date these speleothems by the Th/U method have proved unsuccessful with some age reversals for SC4 due to multiple sources of non-authigenic Th. This method has also resulted in imprecise ages for WM7 because of low U concentrations (<10 ppb) and consequently very low levels of authigenic Th-230 relative even to the very low levels of detrital Th-230 present. Here, we present an alternative method for reliable dating of these young speleothems using radiocarbon. Approximately 100 carbonate samples from SC4 and WM7 were analysed for C-14 by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The AMS results indicate that bomb C-14 was evident in the youngest parts of both stalagmites. Two different approaches were used to estimate dead carbon fraction (DCF) values for these stalagmites for the pre-bomb period. For SC4, the DCF values were estimated based on the timing of C-14 dates for that period determined by high-resolution delta O-18 recorded in the speleothem, and the timing of the onset of bomb C-14. For WM7, a maximum range of pre-bomb DCF was determined. Chronologies of these speleothems were built based on a dense sequence of DCF-corrected ages using three different age-depth models: Clam (Classical method), and Bacon and OxCal (Bayesian statistical approach). Good agreement between these age-depth models were observed indicating that the top 170 mm of SC4 and the top 50 mm of WM7 grew during the past 550-750 years and 1360-1740 years, respectively.

Our hypothesis was that the turbulent transport by coherent structures is the main pathway for carrying detectable sub-canopy respiration signals through the canopy. The study extends previously published work by incorporating state-of-the-art wavelet decomposition techniques for the detection of coherent structures. Further, we investigated spatial and temporal variability of the respiration signal and coherent exchange at multiple heights, for three mature forest sites with varying canopy and terrain properties for one summer month. A connection between the coherent structures and identified sub-canopy respiration signal was clearly determined. Although not always visible in signals collected above the canopy, certain cases showed a clear link between conditionally sampled respiration events and coherent structures. The dominant time scales of the coherent structure ejection phase (20-30 s), relative timing of maximum coincidence between respiration events and the coherent structure ejection phase (at approximately -10 s from detection) and vertical transport upward through the canopy were shown to be consistent in time, across measurement heights and across the different forest sites. Best results were observed for an open canopy pine site. We conclude that the presented method is likely to be applicable at more open rather than dense (closed) canopies. The results provided a confirmation of the connection between below- and above-canopy scalar time series, and may help the development or refinement of direct methods for the determination of component fluxes from observations above the canopy.","[Zeeman, Matthias J.; Thomas, Christoph K.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Eugster, Werner] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Oregon State University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Zeeman, MJ (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",matthias.zeeman@alumni.ethz.ch; chthomas@coas.oregonstate.edu,"Thomas, Christoph K/I-5751-2012; Zeeman, Matthias/N-8713-2019; Zeeman, Matthias J/E-4604-2011; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010","Thomas, Christoph K/0000-0003-2277-6013; Zeeman, Matthias/0000-0001-9186-2519; Zeeman, Matthias J/0000-0001-9186-2519; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741",Swiss National Science Foundation [PBEZP2-127819]; Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy [DE-FG02-06ER64318]; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS 0955444]; Directorate For Geosciences [0955444] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Office of Science (BER) U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The valuable comments of the three reviewers are greatly appreciated.

The technology is seen by many as the next step in the development of fossil fuel heating systems. It can considerably increase the energy efficiency and usage of renewable energy sources while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with current state-of-the-art. With expected net decarbonisation of gas grid by increasing biogas production and development of power-to-gas concepts, the FSHP, especially gas-fired heat pumps, may further gain in importance. Presently, vapour compression heat pumps are dominating the heat pump market. However, in gas and/or oil dominating heating markets, FSHP can rapidly improve the carbon footprint of heating systems, especially in the retrofit segment which makes around three quarters of the overall heating market. A number of products are offered by different manufacturers with more expected to enter the market in the short to mid-term period. Still, there are several challenges the technology is currently facing, both technical and non-technical. The paper provides results of a comprehensive simulation study of the future German energy system with emphasis on the role of gas-fired heat pumps (GHP) as part of the solution to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It gives an overview of current market products and on-going development work.

Cyanobacteria are one of the main biological components in freshwater ecosystems and they may proliferate in nutrients rich ecosystems causing severe impacts at different levels. Therefore, several methods have been applied to control cyanobacterial proliferation, including physical, chemical and biological strategies. However, the application of those methods is generally not very efficient. Research on an eco-friendly alternative leading to the isolation of new bioactive compounds with strong impacts against harmful cyanobacteria is a need in the field of water environment protection. Thus, this paper aims to give an overview of harmful cyanobacterial blooms and reviews the state of the art of studying the activities of biological compounds obtained from plants, seaweeds and microorganisms in the cyanobacterial bloom control.","[Zerrifi, Soukaina El Amrani; Mugani, Richard; Redouane, El Mahdi; Oudra, Brahim] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia Marrakech, Phycol Biotechnol & Environm Toxicol Res Unit, Biodivers & Climate Change Lab, Av Prince My Abdellah,POB 2390, Marrakech 40000, Morocco; [El Khalloufi, Fatima] Sultan Moulay Slimane Univ, Fac Khouribga FPK, Lab Chem Modeling & Environm Polydisciplinary, PB 145, Khouribga 25000, Morocco; [Campos, Alexandre; Vasconcelos, Vitor] CIIMAR, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, Av Gen Norton de Matos S-N, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Vitor] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rua Do Campo Alegre, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal",Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; Sultan Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Vasconcelos, V (corresponding author), CIIMAR, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, Av Gen Norton de Matos S-N, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal.;Vasconcelos, V (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rua Do Campo Alegre, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal.",soukainaelamranizerrifi@gmail.com; redouane.elmandii@gmail.com; elkhalloufi.f@gmail.com; acampos@ciimar.up.pt; vmvascon@fc.up.pt; oudra@uca.ac.ma,"Campos, Alexandre/AGP-3558-2022; Vasconcelos, Vitor/A-8933-2008; Khalloufi, Fatima El/AFQ-6993-2022; Redouane, El Mahdi/AAP-8368-2021; MUGANI, Richard/E-8220-2019","Campos, Alexandre/0000-0003-4621-885X; Vasconcelos, Vitor/0000-0003-3585-2417; EL KHALLOUFI, Fatima/0000-0002-2922-8020; Redouane, El Mahdi/0000-0001-8020-7607","projects TOXI-CROP - H2020 program MSCA-RISE-2018 [823860]; FCT [UIDB/04423/2020, UIDP/04423/2020]",projects TOXI-CROP - H2020 program MSCA-RISE-2018; FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),This study was supported by the projects TOXI-CROP (823860) funded by the H2020 program MSCA-RISE-2018 and by FCT UIDB/04423/2020 and UIDP/04423/2020.,,171,7,7,10,66,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0302-8933,1432-072X,,ARCH MICROBIOL,Arch.

This provides a promising framework to facilitate detailed investigations of surface instabilities and movements on large scales with high temporal resolution, but also poses substantial processing challenges because of storage and computation requirements. Methods are needed to efficiently detect short term changes in dynamic environments. Approaches considering pair-wise processing of a series of consecutive scenes to retain maximum temporal resolution in conjunction with time series analyses are required. Here we present OSARIS, the Open Source SAR Investigation System, as a framework to process large stacks of S1 data on high-performance computing clusters. Based on Generic Mapping Tools SAR, shell scripts, and the workload manager Slurm, OSARIS provides an open and modular framework combining parallelization of high-performance C programs, flexible processing schemes, convenient configuration, and generation of geocoded stacks of analysis-ready base data, including amplitude, phase, coherence, and unwrapped interferograms. Time series analyses can be conducted by applying automated modules to the data stacks. The capabilities of OSARIS are demonstrated in a case study from the northwestern Tien Shan, Central Asia. After merging of slices, a total of 80 scene pairs were processed from 174 total input scenes. The coherence time series exhibits pronounced seasonal variability, with relatively high coherence values prevailing during the summer months in the nival zone. As an example of a time series analysis module, we present OSARIS' Unstable Coherence Metric which identifies pixels affected by significant drops from high to low coherence values. Measurements of motion provided by LOSD measurements require careful evaluation because interferometric phase unwrapping is prone to errors. Here, OSARIS provides a series of modules to detect and mask unwrapping errors, correct for atmospheric disturbances, an remove large-scale trends. Wall clock processing time for the case study (area similar to 9,000 km(2)) was similar to 12 h 4 min on a machine with 400 cores and 2 TB RAM. In total, similar to 12 d 10 h 44 min (similar to 96%) were saved through parallelization. A comparison of selected OSARIS datasets to results from two state-of-the-art SAR processing suites, ISCE and SNAP, shows that OSARIS provides products of competitive quality despite its high level of automatization. OSARIS thus facilitates efficient S1-based region-wide investigations of surface movement events over multiple years.","[Loibl, David; Schneider, Christoph] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Climate Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Bookhagen, Bodo] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Geol Remote Sensing, Potsdam, Germany; [Valade, Sebastien] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Comp Engn & Microelect, Comp Vis & Remote Sensing, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Potsdam; Technical University of Berlin,"Loibl, D (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Climate Geog, Berlin, Germany.",david.loibl@geo.hu-berlin.de,"; Loibl, David/G-4722-2012","Valade, Sebastien/0000-0002-6687-7302; Loibl, David/0000-0002-7583-999X",Geo.X; Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam [SO-087-Geo.X],Geo.X; Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam,"This work was conducted within the scope of the project MOdel-and Remote Sensing-based Analysis of glacier-related NAtural hazards in the Tien Shan mountains (MORSANAT), funded by Geo.X.

We found that the TC frequency during the late-season (October to December), not in the peak season (July to September), makes 2010 a record low year; the next lowest year is 1998. Specifically, four TCs were observed over the South China Sea (SCS) in the late-season of 1998, but no TCs occurred over the SCS in the same season during 2010. The genesis potential index is used to help diagnose changes in environmental conditions for TC genesis frequency. Results indicate that the decreased low-level vorticity makes the largest contribution to the decreased TC formation over the SCS. The second largest contribution comes from the enhanced vertical wind shear, with relatively small contributions from the negative anomaly in potential intensity and reduction in midlevel relative humidity. These observational results are consistent with numerical simulations using a state of the art model from the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI-AGCM 3.2 Model). Numerical experiments show that the unfavorable conditions for sharply decreased TC formation during the late-season over the SCS in 2010 mainly results from the sea surface temperature anomaly over the western North Pacific basin. This effect is partly offset by the sea surface temperature anomaly in the South Indian Ocean and Northern Indian Ocean basins.","[Zhao, Haikun; Hsu, Pang-Chi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Pacific Typhoon Res Ctr,Minist Educ,CDRC ESMC, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chu, Pao-Shin] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Murakami, Hiroyuki] Princeton Univ, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Murakami, Hiroyuki] Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Zhao, HK (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Pacific Typhoon Res Ctr,Minist Educ,CDRC ESMC, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhk2004y@gmail.com,"Zhao, Haikun/ABE-3656-2021; Murakami, Hiroyuki/L-5745-2015","Zhao, Haikun/0000-0002-1771-1461; Murakami, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1816-3452","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41305050, 41275093, 41475091]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB430103, 2015CB452803]; project of the specially appointed professorship of Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); NSFC [41375100]; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Province, China [BK20140046]; Research Project of Chinese Ministry of Education [213014A]; SOUSEI program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); project of the specially appointed professorship of Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Research Project of Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); SOUSEI program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan","The TC data are available from the JTWC (http://jtwccdn.appspot.com/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/wpindex.php), the environmental variables data from NCEP/NCAR (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.derived.surface.html), and SST data from NOAA (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.html).

It is a fundamental and frequently used operation of a coupler. Most versions of state-of-the-art couplers currently use an implementation based on the point-to-point (P2P) communication of the message passing interface (MPI) (referred to as P2P implementation hereafter). In this paper, we reveal the drawbacks of the P2P implementation when the parallel decompositions of the sender and the receiver are different, including low communication bandwidth due to small message size, variable and high number of MPI messages, as well as network contention. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a butterfly implementation for data transfer. Although the butterfly implementation outperforms the P2P implementation in many cases, it degrades the performance when the sender and the receiver have similar parallel decompositions or when the number of processes used for running models is small. To ensure data transfer with optimal performance, we design and implement an adaptive data transfer library that combines the advantages of both butterfly implementation and P2P implementation. As the adaptive data transfer library automatically uses the best implementation for data transfer, it outperforms the P2P implementation in many cases while it does not decrease the performance in any cases. Now, the adaptive data transfer library is open to the public and has been imported into the C-Coupler1 coupler for performance improvement of data transfer. We believe that other couplers can also benefit from this.","[Zhang, Cheng; Liu, Li; Yang, Guangwen; Li, Ruizhe; Wang, Bin] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci CESS, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Cheng; Yang, Guangwen; Li, Ruizhe] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li; Yang, Guangwen; Wang, Bin] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies JCGCS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Liu, L; Yang, GW (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci CESS, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, GW (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liu, L; Yang, GW (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Global Change Studies JCGCS, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuli-cess@tsinghua.edu.cn; ygw@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wang, Bin/D-9724-2012; Wang, Bin/P-9121-2014","Wang, Bin/0000-0002-3133-7197; Wang, Bin/0000-0001-7374-3786",Natural Science Foundation of China [41275098]; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China [2013CB956603]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20131089356],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program,"This work is supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41275098), the National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China (no. 2013CB956603), and the Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program (no. 20131089356).",,33,0,0,1,9,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Seasonal summer drying is extensive in these systems and might alter interactions between these consumers and stream benthic communities. Electrical exclusion of consumers was used to examine changes in the effects of fish and crayfish on algal abundance, sediment deposition, sediment organic matter content (as ash-free dry mass [AFDM]) and invertebrate density on tiles during stream drying. Replicate paired exclusion/exposed treatments were placed in 8 pools for two 30-d periods in June and August 2006 during an extended period of stream drying. Consumer exclusion increased algal chlorophyll a 1.5X, sediment organic matter content 2.3X, sediment dry mass 3.4X, and chironomid density 21 X relative to levels on exposed tiles. Exclusion effects were greater in August than in June, but effects were not evident in all pools. In June, the strength of consumer effects on chlorophyll a was positively related to % canopy cover, whereas effects on dry mass were positively related to crayfish density, fish predator presence, and % canopy cover but negatively related to depth. In August, the strength of consumer effects on chlorophyll a was positively related to fish predator presence and effects on AFDM were positively related to stoneroller density. These results demonstrate the importance of environmental context when determining how fish and crayfish influence stream functioning and suggest that mechanisms that generate heterogeneity in streams deserve greater attention, especially because disturbances, such as stream drying, are predicted to intensify with climate change.","[Ludlam, John P.; Magoulick, Daniel D.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Ludlam, JP (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",jludlam@uark.edu; danmag@uark.edu,"Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020","Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957; Ludlam, John/0000-0003-1883-9181",University of Arkansas; Arkansas Game and Fish Commission,University of Arkansas; Arkansas Game and Fish Commission,"This research was supported by a Causey Grant in Aid from the University of Arkansas, and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

An overview of the physics and phenomenology of the wildfires as it relates to power grids is presented, and the logic for the proposed 3LD framework is discussed. The reviewed literature based on the 3LD theme includes the most relevant and emerging research work on wildfire prevention as the first line of defense, wildfire mitigation and proactive response as the second line of defense, and wildfire recovery preparedness as the third line of defense.

In particular, the extent to which low molecular weight organic acids, such as oxalate, influence geochemical reactions has been widely studied. Although the effects of organic acids are diverse, there is strong evidence that organic acids accelerate the dissolution of some minerals. However, the influence of organic acids at the field-scale and over the timescales of soil development has not been evaluated in detail. In this study, a reactive-transport model of soil chemical weathering and pedogenic development was used to quantify the extent to which organic acid cycling controls mineral dissolution rates and long-term patterns of chemical weathering. Specifically, oxalic acid was added to simulations of soil development to investigate a well-studied chronosequence of soils near Santa Cruz, CA. The model formulation includes organic acid input, transport, decomposition, organic-metal aqueous complexation and mineral surface complexation in various combinations. Results suggest that although organic acid reactions accelerate mineral dissolution rates near the soil surface, the net response is an overall decrease in chemical weathering. Model results demonstrate the importance of organic acid input concentrations, fluid flow, decomposition and secondary mineral precipitation rates on the evolution of mineral weathering fronts. In particular, model soil profile evolution is sensitive to kaolinite precipitation and oxalate decomposition rates. The soil profile-scale modeling presented here provides insights into the influence of organic carbon cycling on soil weathering and pedogenesis and supports the need for further field-scale measurements of the flux and speciation of reactive organic compounds.

However, how these changes have shaped the present-day patterns of high diversity and complex distribution are still poorly understood. In this study, we use integrative approaches by estimating phylogenetic relationships, divergence time, and current and past niche suitability for the Bornean endemic land snail genus Everettia to provide additional insight into the evolutionary history of this genus in northern Borneo in the light of the geological vicariance events and climatic fluctuations in the Pleistocene. Our results show that northern Borneo Everettia species belong to two deeply divergent lineages: one contains the species that inhabit high elevation at the central mountain range, while the other contains lowland species. Species diversification in these lineages has taken place before the Pliocene. Climate changes during the Pleistocene did not play a significant role in species diversification but could have shaped contemporary species distribution patterns. Our results also show that the species-rich highland habitats have acted as interglacial refugia for highland species. This study of a relatively sedentary invertebrate supports and enhances the growing understanding of the evolutionary history of Borneo. Species diversification in Everettia is caused by geological vicariance events between the early Miocene and the Pliocene, and the distribution patterns were subsequently determined by climatic fluctuations in the Pleistocene.","[Liew, Thor-Seng; Schilthuizen, Menno] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Inst Trop Biol & Conservat, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Marzuki, Mohammad Effendi; Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Inst Biodivers & Environm Conservat, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Schilthuizen, Menno; Vermeulen, Jaap J.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Schilthuizen, Menno] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol Leiden, Leiden, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Jaap J.] JK Art & Sci, Leiden, Netherlands",Universiti Malaysia Sabah; University of Malaysia Sarawak; Naturalis Biodiversity Center; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Liew, TS (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Inst Trop Biol & Conservat, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.",thorsengliew@gmail.com,"Liew, Thor-Seng/AHC-0363-2022; Schilthuizen, Menno/B-5156-2009","Liew, Thor-Seng/0000-0002-9437-5924; Schilthuizen, Menno/0000-0001-6229-0347; Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan/0000-0001-5513-6237",Martin Fellowship 2008 from `Naturalis' to Thor-Seng Liew; Universiti Malaysia Sabah Research Grant [GKP0011-STWN-2016]; Universiti Malaysia Sarawak Research Grant [GL/F07/UMS/02/2017],Martin Fellowship 2008 from `Naturalis' to Thor-Seng Liew; Universiti Malaysia Sabah Research Grant; Universiti Malaysia Sarawak Research Grant,"Y This study was supported financially by a Martin Fellowship 2008 from `Naturalis' to Thor-Seng Liew; Universiti Malaysia Sabah Research Grant (GKP0011-STWN-2016); Universiti Malaysia Sarawak Research Grant (GL/F07/UMS/02/2017).

The nanoporous networks contribute to gas storage and migration. Due to the prosperity of shale gas exploration and exploitation, nanopores become a hot spot of nanogeosciences. This paper reviews recent advances on nanopores of organic-rich shales, including nanopore detection techniques, pore classification, pore structures, pore system evolution, and its adsorption and migration features. The state-of-the-art techniques have been used to achieve nanopore geometry, morphology, structural and matter compositions. Basing on pore morphology, location, origination and host compositions, numerous pore classification rules were built. Different pore types show diverse pore size distribution features. Shales consist predominantly of micropores and mesopores, which have enormous specific surface area. Fine nanopores are dominated by organic matter hosted pores. Furthermore, the mechanisms of pore system evolution were discussed focusing on the effects of organic maturation. The coupling of multiple processes and the multi-stages of diagenesis and OM maturation make the relationships between R-o and porosity/OM porosity poor. Systematic pore evolution process remains unclear. The behaviors of gas molecules in nanopores are different from those of macroscopic. Several mechanisms enhance gas adsorption capacity, and multiple flow regimes occur in different scales. Researches of gas adsorption and migration in nanopores make sense for shale gas exploration and exploitation.","[Qi, Yu; Zhu, Hongjian] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Computat Geodynam, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Qi, Yu; Ju, Yiwen; Zhu, Hongjian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jia, Tianrang] Henan Polytech Univ, Inst Gas Geol, Jiaozuo 454003, Peoples R China; [Cai, Jianchao] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Henan Polytechnic University; China University of Geosciences","Ju, YW (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",,"Qi, Yu/J-5495-2019; Cai, Jianchao/B-7047-2012","Cai, Jianchao/0000-0003-2950-888X; Qi, Yu/0000-0001-8753-0837","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41530315, 41372213]; National Science and Technology Major Project of China [2016ZX05066003, 2016ZX05066006]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05030100]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Major Project of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41530315, 41372213), the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (Grant Nos. 2016ZX05066003, 2016ZX05066006), and the Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA05030100).",,134,9,9,1,32,AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,VALENCIA,"26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA",1533-4880,1533-4899,,J NANOSCI NANOTECHNO,J.

The authors conducted composite analyses of several meteorological variables after identifying developing and non-developing tropical disturbances from June to October of the period 2000 to 2009. Compared to the non-developing disturbances, increased LHF underlying the developing disturbances enhances boundary-layer specific humidity. The secondary circulation then transports more boundary-layer moisture inward and upward and, thus, induces a stronger moist core in the middle troposphere. Accordingly, the air in the core region ascends following a warmer moist adiabat than that in the environment and results in a stronger upper-level warm core, which is associated with a stronger near-surface tangential wind based on the thermal wind balance. This enlarges the magnitude and negative radial gradient of LHF and, thereby, further increases boundary-layer specific humidity. A tropical depression forms when the near-surface tangential wind increases to a certain extent as a result of the continuing positive feedback between near-surface wind and LHF. The results suggest an important role of wind-driven LHF in TC genesis over the WNP.","[Gao, Si; Jia, Shengbin; Wan, Yanyu; Li, Tim; Shen, Xinyong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Si; Jia, Shengbin; Wan, Yanyu; Li, Tim; Shen, Xinyong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Si; Jia, Shengbin; Wan, Yanyu; Li, Tim; Shen, Xinyong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Zhai, Shunan] Guangxi Meteorol Observ, Nanning 530022, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Shen, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Shen, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Shen, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sigao@nuist.edu.cn; jiashengbin2019@163.com; yanyuw@andrew.cmu.edu; timli@hawaii.edu; zhaishn@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; shenxy@nuist.edu.cn,"Gao, Si/D-7619-2015","Gao, Si/0000-0003-3036-6508","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41575078, 41630423, 41530427]; China National 973 Project [2015CB453200]; U.S. Naval Research Laboratory [N00173-16-1-G906]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China National 973 Project(National Basic Research Program of China); U.S. Naval Research Laboratory; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41575078, 41630423, 41530427), the China National 973 Project (2015CB453200), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (N00173-16-1-G906), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,59,8,10,1,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

We examine the cause of the SWE and assess the short-term predictability of such an event, using the state-of-the-art Polar Weather Research and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model. The simulation results, initialized at 0000UTC 6 January 2013, the day prior to the occurrence of the SWE, produce the most accurate representation of the SWE in terms of strength (approximate to 94% of the peak wind speed). Both model results and observational records reveal that the SWE is mainly caused by the approach of a deep depression with the central pressure of 950hPa. On top of this synoptic configuration, a particular shape of topography of the AP plays a non-negligible role for further intensification of the wind at KSJ. As the cyclone approaches the AP, the sea-level pressure becomes lower and is deformed around the AP due to the topography, driving southeasterly winds traversing the AP. The continuous flow overriding the AP generates a downslope windstorm at the lee side of the AP. The windstorm effect driven by the deformation of sea-level pressure by the topography of the AP is not properly represented in the coarser-resolution (27km) model domain compared with higher (3 and 9km) resolutions. We conclude that the SWE at KSJ on 7 January 2013 is caused by the combined effect of a synoptic-scale low-pressure system with local topography of the AP.","[Kwon, Hataek; Park, Sang-Jong; Lee, Solji; Choi, Taejin; Kim, Seong-Joong] Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Polar Climate Sci, Incheon, South Korea; [Kim, Baek-Min] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Environm Atmospher Sci, Busan, South Korea",Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI); Pukyong National University,"Kim, SJ (corresponding author), Korea Polar Res Inst, 26 Songdomirae Ro, Incheon 21990, South Korea.",seongjkim@kopri.re.kr,"Park, Sang-Jong/B-7049-2011","Park, Sang-Jong/0000-0002-6944-6962; Kim, Seong-joong/0000-0002-6232-8082",Korea Polar Research Institute [PE19010],Korea Polar Research Institute(Korea Polar Research Institute of Marine Research Placement (KOPRI)),"Korea Polar Research Institute, PE19010.",,34,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

Deep convection is nearly always organized around the scale of these depressions. In the maintenance of the monsoon depression the generation of eddy kinetic energy on the scale of the monsoon depression is largely governed by the in scale covariance of heating and temperature and of vertical velocity and temperature over the region of the monsoon depression. There are normally about 6-8 monsoon depressions during a summer monsoon season. Recent years 2009, 2010 and 2011 saw very few (around 1, 0 and 1 per season respectively). The best numerical models such as those from ECMWF and US (GFS) carried many false alarms in their 3-5 day forecasts, more like 6-8 disturbances. Even in recent years with fewer observed monsoon depressions a much larger number of depressions is noted in ECMWF forecasts. These are fairly comprehensive models that carry vast data sets (surface and satellite based), detailed data assimilation, and are run at very high resolutions. The monsoon depression is well resolved by these respective horizontal resolutions in these models (at 15 and 35 km). These models carry complete and detailed physical parameterizations. The false alarms in their forecasts leads us to suggest that some additional important ingredient may be missing in these current best state of the art models. This paper addresses the effects of pollution for the enhancement of cloud condensation nuclei and the resulting disruption of the organization of convection in monsoon depressions. Our specific studies make use of a high resolution mesoscale model (WRF/CHEM) to explore the impacts of the first and second aerosol indirect effects proposed by Twomey and Albrecht. We have conducted preliminary studies including examination of the evolution of radar reflectivity (computed inversely from the model hydrometeors) for normal and enhanced CCN effects (arising from enhanced monsoon pollution). The time lapse histories show a major disruption in the organization of convection of the monsoon depressions on the time scale of a week to 10 days in these enhanced CCN scenarios.","[Krishnamurti, T.

This location is characterized by a relatively small amount of precipitation ( annual average of 450 mm), with approximately half being in the form of snow. During the observational periods, precipitation was produced within multilayered cloud systems with heights ranging up to 10 km, and instances of light snow were associated with either low (<2.5 km) or high ( up to 10 km) clouds. Precipitation over the observational periods was typically produced in banded structures, was sometimes reduced because of subcloud evaporation or sublimation, and in the winter was often in the form of individual crystals. A state-of-the-art weather forecasting model was often poor at simulating some of the critical features of the precipitation events, such as cloud top height and precipitation amount. In addition, it was shown that with the sensitive CloudSat radar, similar to 17% of overpasses will be associated with the occurrence of detectable precipitation at Fort Simpson, but with the less sensitive Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) radar, much of the precipitation will be undetected.","McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; York Univ, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; Meteorol Serv Canada, King City, ON L7B 1A3, Canada; McMaster Univ, Commun Res Lab, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; Meteorol Serv Canada, Edmonton, AB T6B 2X3, Canada; Ontario Minist Environm, Environm Monitoring & Reporting Branch, Toronto, ON M9P 3V6, Canada",McGill University; York University - Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; McMaster University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada,"Stewart, RE (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 805 Sherbrook St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",ronald.stewart@mcgill.ca,,"Kochtubajda, Bohdan/0000-0001-6967-575X",,,,,24,12,12,1,5,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

To investigate these effects on the species composition of a subalpine Geo-Montani-Nardetum pasture, 180 turf monoliths were exposed for seven years to five N loads (0, +5, +10, +25, +50 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) in combination with three O-3 levels (ambient, 1.2 or 1.6x ambient concentration) in a free-air fumigation experiment at 2000 m a.s.l. in the Central Alps. Aboveground biomass of grasses, forbs, sedges, and legumes, as well as individual species abundance was recorded annually. N addition caused strong changes in community composition and slightly reduced Shannon diversity: Sedges (Carex sempervirens and Carex ornithopoda) tripled their fractional biomass at the expense of legumes (Trifolium alpinum), grasses (Agrostis capillaris, Briza media, Festuca spp.), and forbs, the latter of which responded inconsistently. Compositional changes were significant with +5 kg ha(-1) y(-1); at all levels of N, however, changes ceased after 5 years. Elevated O-3 and the combined O-3 x N exposure had no effect on functional group productivity. Overall the results reveal high N sensitivity of the subalpine grassland, but low sensitivity to O-3,O- singly or in combination with N.

The sedimentary core from Lake Kushu, Rebun Island, provides the first high-resolution palaeoclimate record from northern Japan. In order for this regionally significant archive to be synchronised to other records, and to generate a more detailed Holocene tephra lattice for East Asia, we present the first cryptotephra stratigraphy for northern Japan using the Kushu RK12 core. The detailed RK12 tephrostratigraphy integrates local and far-travelled tephras originating from Japan, Russia, China/North Korea and most likely Indonesia. Five key cryptotephra layers have been identified, precisely dated and correlated to the specific eruptions or the source region (B-Tm tephra - Changbaishan volcano; SH#12 tephra - Shiveluch volcano; Ko-g tephra - Komagatake volcano; Ma-f similar to j tephra - Mashu volcano and RK12-0819 tephra with possible Indonesian origin). These tephra horizons are very widely dispersed, providing opportunities to synchronise distant palaeoclimate records from the polar region, through high northern latitudes to the tropics, which facilitate interregional comparison of palaeoclimate and environmental data. In addition, a number of the geochemically analysed horizons contain other minor numbers of compositionally distinct glass, which can also be grouped and correlated to their source volcanoes. These minor analyses are of interest since they provide new insight into regional tephra dispersal (e.g., ash dispersal potential of Aira and Towada), and could suggest that there are other potential eruptions that have yet to be identified in the geological record (e.g., potential Changbaishan eruptions). The integrated Lake Kushu cryptotephra record extends the ash dispersal of several key tephra horizons in the region. The presence of the Shiveluch SH#12 tephra in Lake Kushu (ca. 1900 km away), documents the first example of a Russian tephra reaching the Japanese Archipelago. Furthermore, glass compositions suggest that the core could preserve an eruption event derived from Indonesia, highlighting the future possibility to significantly extend and interlink the tephra lattice across the entirety of Asia. This is an essential step for the understanding of how climate changes propagate over large geographical areas. Indeed, several of these tephra markers coincide with significant ecological changes reflected in the pollen proxy record at Lake Kushu. Using this high-resolution palaeoenvironmental record, we however find no significant ecological impact following the large late Holocene Millennium Eruption from Changbaishan, China/North Korea.

Condensed water becomes aggressive for soluble rocks and corrodes the walls. This process is particularly active close to cave entrances in high thermal gradient zones where external air enters caves. Condensation appears to be important where bat colonies are also present. Bat metabolism and guano decomposition release heat, vapour, and acids. Hence, bat colonies contribute to the increase of condensation-corrosion, especially by providing permanent moisture and chemical aggressiveness. Corrosive air convections produce rounded morphologies, such as ceiling channels, cupolas, and corroded older flowstones. This process has been overlooked in previous research, since related morphologies were often confused with those produced by early phreatic flow. Kyrenia Range in Cyprus has a semi-arid climate. All the studied caves developed along open-fractures. They are located both in recrystallized carbonates (limestone and dolostone, such as Smoky and Pigeons Caves), or in gypsum (First Day and Angry Bat Caves). We also studied a maze cave that acted as a spring in gypsum that initially developed under phreatic conditions, followed by an epiphreatic phase that allowed the development of notches (Fig Tree Cave, also named Incirli Show Cave). Due to the semi-arid climate, external air is very dry in summer, thus condensation seems to occur mainly in winter, when cave atmosphere instability allows large air exchanges between caves and surface atmosphere. In summer, evaporation prevails, allowing the development of popcorn lines in carbonate caves and massive gypsum crusts, stalagmites, and sidewalk rims in gypsum caves. However, the presence of a bat colony in a semi-confined chamber in Smoky Cave is probably the origin of the permanent moisture, also during the dry season, leading to a strong development of condensation-corrosion features such as ceiling cupolas, and possibly to the permanent activity of flowstones. In addition, we detected high concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and radon (Rn) in Fig Tree Cave, possibly related to the activity of the neighbouring overthrust. Based on the five studied caves in the Kyrenia Range and surroundings, the open-fracture caves in carbonates and gypsum have not undergone the typical initial phreatic stage, but have formed in a short time during Pleistocene as a result of the fast uplift of the range and were later reshaped by condensation-corrosion morphologies. Some gypsum caves may have formed entirely by this latter process, after initial minor fracture development. Cyprus is an outstanding area for studying the condensation-corrosion in caves, since a phreatic origin can be ruled out for most of the rounded morphologies.","[Cailhol, Didier] Univ Savoy Mt Blanc, CNRS, EDYTEM, 5 Bd Mer Caspienne, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Audra, Philippe] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, PolytechLab, EA 7498, 930 Route Colles, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Nehme, Carole] Univ Rouen, CNRS, UMR 6266, IDEES, 7 Rue Thomas Becket, F-76781 Mont St Aignan, France; [Nader, Fadi Henri] IFP Energies Nouvelles, Union Int Speleol, 1 & 4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Garasic, Mladen] Univ Zagreb, Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Trg Nikole Subica Zrinskog 11, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Heresanu, Vasile] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, CINaM, Campus Luminy,Case 913, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Gucel, Salih] Near East Univ, Environm Res Ctr, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Charalambidou, Iris] Univ Nicosia, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Life & Hlth Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Satterfield, Lauren] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cheng, Hai] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Qujiang Campus,28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Edwards, R.

The new CRTM ice cloud model is derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 ice cloud habit model, which represents ice particles as severely roughened hexagonal ice column aggregates with a gamma size distribution. The single-scattering properties of the new ice particle model are derived from a state-of-the-art ice optical property library and are constructed as look-up tables for rapid CRTM computations. Various sensitivity studies concerning instrument-specific applications and simulations are performed to validate CRTM against satellite observations. In particular, radiances in a spectral region covering the infrared wavelengths are simulated. Comparisons of brightness temperatures between CRTM simulations and observations (from MODIS, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) show that the new ice cloud optical property look-up table substantially enhances the performance of the CRTM under ice cloud conditions.","[Yi, Bingqi; Yang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Liu, Quanhua] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liu, Quanhua; van Delst, Paul; Boukabara, Sid-Ahmed] Joint Ctr Satellite Data Assimilat, College Pk, MD USA; [Weng, Fuzhong] NOAA, NESDIS, STAR, College Pk, MD USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Yi, BQ (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",bingqi.yi@outlook.com,"Liu, Quanhua/B-6608-2008; Yang, Ping/B-4590-2011; Weng, Fuzhong/F-5633-2010; Yi, Bingqi/E-4076-2012","Liu, Quanhua/0000-0002-3616-351X; Yang, Ping/0000-0001-6803-9903; Weng, Fuzhong/0000-0003-0150-2179; Yi, Bingqi/0000-0002-1437-8376",NOAA [NA15NES4400003],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This study is supported by NOAA grant NA15NES4400003.

The UIPS evaluation system developed in this study offers the possibility of calculating a fair value of UIPS and providing recommendations for improving university-industry (U-I) partnerships.

However, there has been less systematic reflection on the research conducted so far, its scope or contribution, nor what it might mean for the future of the concept. To provide insights, this paper presents the results of a systematic and comprehensive review of 155 peer-reviewed articles published across eight databases between January 2008 and December 2019. The aim is firstly to review the current state of the art in the energy justice literature and, secondly, to present findings that support novel recommendations with the potential to enhance the impact of energy justice research, including applications in the economic and planning policy sectors. Critically, our study demonstrates that the literature lacks diversity in its author basis and research design. By contrast, conceptual frameworks and the geographies and technologies of global energy injustice are proliferating. These results illustrate that energy justice has power and agency as a tool. It can act as a protagonist in energy research, provoking researchers to remain reflexively normative and active in identifying injustices and vulnerabilities, and it can act as a promising progenitor, creating new research methods and themes.","[Jenkins, Kirsten E.

However, there are no meteorological observatories in the mountain area over 4800m. Ten simple automatic meteorological systems were set on a south facing mountain slope from 4300m to 5530m in the central part of the TP. The observation shows an uniform lapse rate about 0.69 degrees C/100m along the slope, in summertime. The lapse rate is a little bit greater than that of averaged over the TP. However, there is a very lower lapse rate about 0.09 degrees C/100m at lower portion of slope (below 4800m) and a relatively larger lapse rate about 0.9 degrees C/100m at higher portion of the slope in wintertime. Due to strong radiation cooling based on lower humidity and cold air run-off from a higher mountain region into the valley or basin by a local circulation, the air temperature in the valley or basin becomes lower and lower during night in wintertime. This process occurred and a temperature inversion layer exited almost every day during wintertime. The temperature inversion was formed around sunset (before 20: 00 BST, local time is about 2 hours earlier) and developed gradually until next morning. Inversion layer reached to 5100m at about 8: 00 BST and disappeared rapidly after sunrise. The averaged lapse rate for the TP (calculated by using thirty years (1950-1080) mean air temperature of 85 stations) is 0.57 degrees C/100m in July and 0.56 degrees C/100m in January. Our observation shows a greater lapse rate about 0.69 degrees C/100m along the slope in July. This may be the effect of higher temperature between 4400m to 4800m. Our observed lapse rate in winter was completely different from the average due to the existence of temperature inversion. The YSA's (Yamada Science and Art) A2C atmospheric modeling solution (NEW HOTMAC model) is used for illustrating this local circulation. The HOTMAC Model gives very clear result that the local circulation in the mountain has an effect on the vertical profile of air temperature in wintertime. On the other hand, The TP has been considered to be one of the most ecologically fragile and sensitive ecosystems on the earth. Grassland occupies about 50% of the Tibetan Plateau and distribute even to 5200m a.s.l. in high mountain region. An over three times increasing in livestock production in the Tibetan Plateau has occurred since 1978. Historical meteorological data showed that the elevation of air temperature on the Tibetan Plateau is greater than for the whole China and East Asia within the same period. In our observation site, vegetation cover as well as species number and root biomass in the lower part of the slope below 4600m is much lower than that around 5000m. The decrease of species number, vegetation cover and root biomass may be related to the grazing pressure. These may have had effect on the temperature distribution in our observation results such as increasing air temperature in lower part of the slope. Therefore, the lapse rate is a little bit greater than the average in summertime. Meteorological observatories' data on the TP is not ideal for assessing meteorological characteristics in high mountain regions, especially for wintertime. Human activities (mainly grazing) may have great effect on the temperature distribution. Long-term meteorological observation and ecological investigation in high mountain region will be very important in high mountain regions in the future.","[Du, M.; Kawashima, S.; Yonemura, S.] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Dept Agrometeorol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yamada, T.] Yamada Sci & Art Corp, Santa Fe, NM USA; [Zhang, X.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Y.; Gu, S.] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Y.] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences (NIAES) Japan; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan","Du, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Dept Agrometeorol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",dumy@affrc.go.jp,"Du, Mingyuan/O-9951-2018; Du, Mingyuan/AAE-3019-2020; Tang, Yanhong/B-1699-2010","Du, Mingyuan/0000-0003-0373-1661; Du, Mingyuan/0000-0003-0373-1661; Tang, Yanhong/0000-0001-7207-1965",,,,,14,14,17,0,7,MODELLING & SIMULATION SOC AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND INC,CHRISTCHURCH,"MSSANZ, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,2146,2152,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUQ25,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290030702029,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed the capacity of the models to predict the evolution of the dust cloud with lead times of up to 72aEuro-h using observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and dust surface concentrations from a ground-based measurement network. In addition, the predicted vertical dust distribution was evaluated with vertical extinction profiles from the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). To assess the diversity in forecast capability among the models, the analysis was extended to wind field (both surface and profile), synoptic conditions, emissions and deposition fluxes. Models predict the onset and evolution of the AOD for all analysed lead times. On average, differences among the models are larger than differences among lead times for each individual model. In spite of large differences in emission and deposition, the models present comparable skill for AOD. In general, models are better in predicting AOD than near-surface dust concentration over the Iberian Peninsula. Models tend to underestimate the long-range transport towards northern Europe. Our analysis suggests that this is partly due to difficulties in simulating the vertical distribution dust and horizontal wind. Differences in the size distribution and wet scavenging efficiency may also account for model diversity in long-range transport.","[Huneeus, N.] UPMC, CNRS, IPSL, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Paris, France; [Huneeus, N.] Univ Chile, Dept Geophys, Santiago, Chile; [Huneeus, N.] Univ Chile, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Santiago, Chile; [Basart, S.; Baldasano, J.

Avoiding extinction in rapidly changing environments often depends upon a species' capacity to adapt in the face of extreme selective pressures. Here, we employed exon capture and high-throughput next-generation sequencing to investigate the mechanisms underlying population structure and adaptive genetic variation in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), an iconic Australian marsupial that represents a unique conservation challenge because it is not uniformly threatened across its range. An examination of 250 specimens representing 91 wild source locations revealed that five major genetic clusters currently exist on a continental scale. The initial divergence of these clusters appears to have been concordant with the Mid-Brunhes Transition (similar to 430 to 300 kya), a major climatic reorganisation that increased the amplitude of Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. While signatures of polygenic selection and environmental adaptation were detected, strong evidence for repeated, climate-associated range contractions and demographic bottleneck events suggests that geographically isolated refugia may have played a more significant role in the survival of the koala through the Pleistocene glaciation than in situ adaptation. Consequently, the conservation of genome-wide genetic variation must be aligned with the protection of core koala habitat to increase the resilience of vulnerable populations to accelerating anthropogenic threats. Finally, we propose that the five major genetic clusters identified in this study should be accounted for in future koala conservation efforts (e.g., guiding translocations), as existing management divisions in the states of Queensland and New South Wales do not reflect historic or contemporary population structure.","[Lott, Matthew J.; Wright, Belinda R.; Neaves, Linda E.; Frankham, Greta J.; Dennison, Siobhan; Eldridge, Mark D.

The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has been gaining momentum since 2015, being a significant driver for sustainable development and a successful catalyst to tackle critical global challenges. This review paper summarizes the most relevant food Industry 4.0 technologies including, among others, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and blockchain) and other technological advances (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems). Moreover, insights into the new food trends (such as 3D printed foods) that have emerged as a result of the Industry 4.0 technological revolution will also be discussed in Part II of this work. The Industry 4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and led to substantial consequences for the environment, economics, and human health. Despite the importance of each of the technologies mentioned above, ground-breaking sustainable solutions could only emerge by combining many technologies simultaneously. The Food Industry 4.0 era has been characterized by new challenges, opportunities, and trends that have reshaped current strategies and prospects for food production and consumption patterns, paving the way for the move toward Industry 5.0.","[Hassoun, Abdo] Sustainable AgriFoodtech Innovat & Res SAFIR, Arras, France; [Hassoun, Abdo] Syrian Acad Expertise SAE, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Ait-Kaddour, Abderrahmane] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, VetAgro Sup, UMRF, Aurillac, France; [Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M.] CSIR, Pretoria, South Africa; [Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Elect & Elect Engn Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Rathod, Nikheel Bhojraj] Postgrad Inst Postharvest Management, Dept Postharvest Management Meat Poultry & Fish, Raigad, Maharashtra, India; [Bader, Farah] Saudi Goody Prod Mkt Co Ltd, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Barba, Francisco J.] Univ Valencia, Nutr & Bromatol Area, Fac Pharm, Dept Prevent Med & Publ Hlth Food Sci Toxicol & F, Valencia, Spain; [Biancolillo, Alessandra] Univ Aquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Laquila, Italy; [Cropotova, Janna] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci Alesund, Alesund, Norway; [Galanakis, Charis M.] Galanakis Labs, Res & Innovat Dept, Khania, Greece; [Galanakis, Charis M.] ISEKI Food Assoc, Food Waste Recovery Grp, Vienna, Austria; [Jambrak, Anet Rezek] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Zagreb, Croatia; [Lorenzo, Jose M.] Ctr Tecnol Carne Galicia, Orense, Spain; [Lorenzo, Jose M.] Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Ourense, Area Tecnol Alimentos, Orense, Spain; [Mage, Ingrid] Nofima Norwegian Inst Food, Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, As, Norway; [Ozogul, Fatih] Cukurova Univ, Fac Fisheries, Dept Seafood Proc Technol, Adana, Turkey; [Regenstein, Joe] Cornell Univ, Dept Food Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); VetAgro Sup; Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; University of Johannesburg; University of Valencia; University of L'Aquila; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Zagreb; Universidade de Vigo; Nofima; Cukurova University; Cornell University,"Hassoun, A (corresponding author), Sustainable AgriFoodtech Innovat & Res SAFIR, Arras, France.;Hassoun, A (corresponding author), Syrian Acad Expertise SAE, Gaziantep, Turkey.",a.hassoun@saf-ir.com,"Lorenzo, Jose Manuel/K-6375-2014; Hassoun, Abdo/GNM-9800-2022; Cropotova, Janna/H-6978-2018; Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan/S-2253-2017; Barba, Francisco Jose/L-6596-2014","Lorenzo, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-7725-9294; Cropotova, Janna/0000-0002-4938-2674; GALANAKIS, CHARIS/0000-0001-5194-0818; Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan/0000-0002-6413-3924; Barba, Francisco Jose/0000-0002-5630-3989; HASSOUN, ABDO/0000-0002-3059-292X; Rezek Jambrak, Anet/0000-0001-7676-6465; Rathod, Nikheel/0000-0003-1561-5924",,,,,150,15,15,87,172,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1040-8398,1549-7852,,CRIT REV FOOD SCI,Crit.

Study Focus: We use a large-scale hydrological and nutrient transport model (E-HYPE) to model basin-wide impacts of measure scenarios on the Baltic Sea, where eutrophication is a critical issue for the marine ecosystem. We constructed measure scenarios based on stakeholder acceptance, established in workshops in different regions around the Baltic. These measures include local stream reach to catchment scale measures aiming to reduce nutrient transport into the stream network (buffer strips, stormwater ponds) and measures aiming to reduce regional nutrient source releases (fertiliser leaching rates, rural household emissions). New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Nutrient load reductions are often needed to reduce eutrophication and improve overall surface water quality in fresh-water and enclosed bays and seas, where dilution is limited and load emissions have long residence times. To reduce riverine nutrient loads, remediation measures are necessary, e.g. establishment of buffer strips or improved wastewater treatment. Such measures are, however, typically not designed to target nutrient load reductions at sea outlets, but rather focus on local improvements. Here, we show that measures, notwithstanding other meliorating ecosystem benefits, must include reductions in load emissions across large basin areas to impact integrated net loads into coastal sea basins, because reduction measures that only target nutrient delivery to the stream network typically cannot be implemented in a significant enough proportion of the total drainage area of large coastal river basins. Our impact scenarios show BSDB-wide nutrient reductions of up to 9 % for nitrogen and phosphorus compared to a reference scenario, if load emissions are reduced in the scenario assumptions.","[Capell, Rene; Bartosova, Alena; Arheimer, Berit] SMHI, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Tonderski, Karin] Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden; [Pedersen, Soren Marcus] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zilans, Andis] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Linkoping University; University of Copenhagen; University of Latvia,"Capell, R (corresponding author), SMHI, Norrkoping, Sweden.",rene.capell@smhi.se; alena.bartosova@smhi.se; karin.tonderski@liu.se; berit.arheimer@smhi.se; marcus@ifro.ku.dk; azilans@hotmail.com,,"Tonderski, Karin/0000-0002-0722-6083","BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) from Innovation Fund Denmark; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvardsverket); Polish National Centre for Research and Development; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR); Latvian Ministry of Education and Science; Projekttradger Julich; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS); Academy of Finland; BONUS project 'Mediating integrated actions for sustainable ecosystems services in a changing climate (MIRACLE) '; BONUS project 'Reducing nutrientloadings from agricultural soils to the Baltic Sea via groundwater and streams (SOILS2SEA) '","BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) from Innovation Fund Denmark; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvardsverket); Polish National Centre for Research and Development; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Latvian Ministry of Education and Science(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science); Projekttradger Julich(Helmholtz Association); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); BONUS project 'Mediating integrated actions for sustainable ecosystems services in a changing climate (MIRACLE) '; BONUS project 'Reducing nutrientloadings from agricultural soils to the Baltic Sea via groundwater and streams (SOILS2SEA) '","The study was performed at the SMHI Hydrological Research unit, building on previous work.

Guava is the most nutritious of all edible fruits. High pectin contents make guava suitable for jelly making. Guava has antidiarrheal, antibacterial, antiamoebic and antispasmodic activities. High concentrations of several vitamins, dietary fiber, carotenoids, lectins, saponins, tannins, phenols, triterpenes, and flavonoids altogether make guava therapeutically an important fruit. Ascorbic acid in guava fruit far exceeds that in citrus. Consumption of guava fruit is reported to lower blood cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension and some cardiac problems. Due to high quercetin contents, guava leaves are used to develop a phytomedicine for diarrhea. Since guava plant is susceptible to frost, genetic improvement to enhance cold hardiness of guava germplasm is necessary for adapting and cultivating it in temperate climates. Efficient and reliable biotechnology using in vitro plant regeneration amenable to genetic transformation will ensure cold hardiness enhancement in guava. Development of biotechnology protocols for morphogenesis and somatic embryogenesis along with production of edible quality guava fruits and their nutritional analysis has been achieved using various tissue explants from mature guava trees growing at Fort Valley State University. For guava micropropagation, we have developed and germinated 'synseeds' from somatic embryos.

This work presents a preliminary evaluation of the role and contribution of biogas as a sustainable energy source towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Methods: This work summarizes the common feedstock and impurities in the biogas as well as the advantages and disadvantages of biogas compared with fossil fuels. Challenges and barriers associated with biogas production in developing and developed countries were elaborated and connected with SDGs. Finally, the relation between the circular economy, biogas, and related SDGs was presented. Significant findings: The biogas has been found to have direct impacts and contributions to 12 out of the 17 SDGs. The main contributions of the biogas come from its ability to increase renewable energy, reduce climate change, enhance the waste management process, and create jobs. A set of 58 indicators was provided as a guideline for the stakeholders within the biogas industry to extend the benefits of the biogas toward the achievement of the SDGs and minimize any possible trade-off. The results of this work will help the different players within the biogas industry to form policy to ensure that biogas contribution to the SDGs is maximized.

The current perspective focuses on the critical issues that need to be addressed to achieve the ultimate goal of an all-solid-state LLZO-based battery that delivers safety, durability, and pack-level performance characteristics that are unobtainable with state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. This perspective complements existing reviews of solid/solid interfaces with more emphasis on understanding numerous homo- and heteroionic interfaces in a pure oxide-based SSB and the various phenomena that accompany the evolution of the chemical, electrochemical, structural, morphological, and mechanical properties of those interfaces during processing and operation.

New state of the art solar and netload day ahead forecast models were developed and applied to real data. These strategies consist of: (1) Improving the accuracy of PV and net load power forecast and enlarging the footprint of the controlled grid area; (2) Transforming unconstrained PV plants into flexible PV plants: remotely controlled PV plants that can be proactively curtailed and work with cost-optimized Battery Energy Storage Systems. We demonstrate that the first strategy can effectively limit the imbalance impact when integrating a large share of PV generation, reducing imbalance volumes and costs, both at current and future solar penetration levels. We further demonstrate that the second strategy can entirely eliminate the imbalance impact of PV penetration, hence providing operational certainty to the TSO. Indeed, we show how flexible PV plants can be cost-optimally sized to set the imbalance volume at a desired target value regardless of PV installed capacity, hence allowing massive solar penetration. Finally, we show that the cost of implementing these strategies is less than the current cost of handling such imbalance impacts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This is partly because of the novel assimilation of observed precipitation, state-of-the-art land surface scheme, and higher spatial resolution. NARR is evaluated in terms of the terrestrial water budget and its depiction of drought at monthly to annual time scales against two offline land surface model [Noah v2.7.1 and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)] simulations and observation-based runoff estimates over the continental United States for 1979-2003. An earlier version of the Noah model forms the land component of NARR and so the offline simulation provides an opportunity to diagnose NARR land surface variables independently of atmospheric feedbacks. The VIC model has been calibrated against measured streamflow and so provides a reasonable estimate of large-scale evapotranspiration. Despite similar precipitation, there are large differences in the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff. Relative to VIC, NARR and Noah annual evapotranspiration is biased high by 28% and 24%, respectively, and the runoff ratios are 50% and 40% lower. This is confirmed by comparison with observation-based runoff estimates from 1130 small, relatively unmanaged basins across the continental United States. The overestimation of evapotranspiration by NARR is largely attributed to the evapotranspiration component of the Noah model, whereas other factors such as atmospheric forcings or biases induced by precipitation assimilation into NARR play only a minor role. A combination of differences in the parameterization of evapotranspiration and in particular low stomatal resistance values in NARR, the seasonality of vegetation characteristics, the near-surface radiation and meteorology, and the representation of soil moisture dynamics, including high infiltration rates and the relative coupling of soil moisture with baseflow in NARR, are responsible for the differences in the water budgets. Large-scale drought as quantified by soil moisture percentiles covaries closely over the continental United States between the three datasets, despite large differences in the seasonal water budgets. However, there are large regional differences, especially in the eastern United States where the VIC model shows higher variability in drought dynamics. This is mostly due to increased frequency of completely dry conditions in NARR that result from differences in soil depth, higher evapotranspiration, early snowmelt, and early peak runoff. In the western United States, differences in the precipitation forcing contribute to large discrepancies between NARR and Noah/VIC simulations in the representation of the early 2000s drought.","[Sheffield, Justin; Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Livneh, Ben] Univ Washington, Dept Civil Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Princeton University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Sheffield, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",justin@princeton.edu,"Livneh, Ben/I-2939-2015","Livneh, Ben/0000-0001-5445-2473; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630; Wood, Eric/0000-0001-7037-9675",NOAA [NA08OAR4310579],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),NARR data downloaded from the NOAA National Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/).

Much of the currently available knowledge is based on controlled laboratory experiments, large scale surveys and manipulative studies in which one perturbation, for example drought, is applied under a range of conditions. Until now, emphasis has been on spatial replication of experimental units and the quantification of variation in soil microbial community structure, and its correlation to ecosystem-level variables such as gas fluxes. But microbial communities naturally fluctuate over time, their response to perturbations is temporal, and they generally experience multiple perturbations simultaneously and/or in a variable sequence, such as spells of drought alternating with flooding events. Furthermore, variation in the soil microbial community in response to perturbations may not directly reflect the overall expression of functions of a microbial community. Here, we identify three experimental challenges that we refer to as the variance, locality and structure challenge. We briefly synthesise the state of the art around these three challenges to open a discussion on the many experimental issues ecologists face when measuring the effects of perturbations on the structure and functions of soil microbial communities in time and space. We propose experimental, sampling and modelling strategies that can help resolve the experimental challenges discussed in this paper.","[Caruso, Tancredi] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England",University College Dublin; University of Manchester,"Caruso, T (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",tancredi.caruso@ucd.ie,,"Caruso, Tancredi/0000-0002-3607-9609","NERC Soil Security programme [NE/M017028/1, NE/P013708/1, NE/M017036/1]",NERC Soil Security programme,We thank the guest editors Carlos Barreto and Zoe Lindo for soliciting this paper.

Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project's impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.","[Gerasopoulos, Evangelos; Bailey, Jennifer; Athanasopoulou, Eleni; Speyer, Orestis] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens 15236, Greece; [Gerasopoulos, Evangelos] Navarino Environm Observ, Navarino Dunes 24001, Messenia, Greece; [Kocman, David] Jozef Stefan Inst, Dept Environm Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Raudner, Astrid] Italian Inst Environm Protect & Res, Dept Geol Survey Italy, Ispra, Italy; [Tsouni, Alexia; Kontoes, Haris] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Astron Astrophys Space Applicat & Remote Sen, GR-15236 Athens, Greece; [Johansson, Christer] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atmospher Sci Unit, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Georgiadis, Charalampos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Univ Box 465, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Matthias, Volker] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Environm Chem, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Kussul, Nataliia] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Space Res Inst, Kiev, Ukraine; [Aquilino, Mariella] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Atmospher Pollut Res IIA, Interateneo Phys Dept, Via Amendola 173, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Paasonen, Pauli] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res INAR Phys, Helsinki, Finland",National Observatory of Athens; Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Jozef Stefan Institute; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); National Observatory of Athens; Stockholm University; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Max Planck Society; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR); University of Helsinki,"Gerasopoulos, E (corresponding author), Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens 15236, Greece.",egera@noa.gr,"Paasonen, Pauli/M-2972-2013; Aquilino, Mariella/AAQ-2500-2021; Johansson, Christer/C-6451-2011","Paasonen, Pauli/0000-0002-4625-9590; Aquilino, Mariella/0000-0002-4292-0329; Johansson, Christer/0000-0002-8459-9852; Bailey, Jennifer/0000-0003-3379-4938","EU [689443]; Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation (NSRF) [MIS 5021516]; European Union (European Regional Development Fund); European Regional Development Fund of the European Union; Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH CREATE INNOVATE [T1EDK-00242-EMISSION]; European Union [820852]; Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) [P1-0143]; Stockholm city council program Smart city 2018, Sweden; Academy of Finland through the Atmosphere and Climate Competence Center (ACCC) [337549]","EU(European Commission); Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation (NSRF); European Union (European Regional Development Fund)(European Commission); European Regional Development Fund of the European Union; Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH CREATE INNOVATE; European Union(European Commission); Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Stockholm city council program Smart city 2018, Sweden; Academy of Finland through the Atmosphere and Climate Competence Center (ACCC)","This work was funded by ERA-PLANET (www.era-planet.eu), transnational project SMURBS (www.smurbs.eu) (Grant Agreement No. 689443) under the EU Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.

In the case that the causes of image blur are various and complicated, a Gaussian degradation model is employed to approximate the composite effect. The model in the frequency domain is deduced which yields a representation with the same small support as the Point Spread Function (PSF). An approximate regularized deconvolution filter is proposed. The regularization term of the deconvolution filter is defined as a function relevant to the equivalent image power spectrum. All the computations to derive the deconvolution filter are implemented in the same support as the PSF. By this method, large matrix manipulation is avoided and remote sensing images can be filtered one at a time, without memory limitations. Meanwhile the method increases computational efficiency, which is most important for large scale satellite images. A case study was conducted for a Chinese small earth observation satellite HJ imagery. The deblurring result proves that this method successfully restores fine image detail, particularly for line features. Various measurements of the image quality show that the algorithm is comparable with other state-of-the-art methods and has advantages for image contrast and edge strength. The computation efficiency increases by about 8-37% for images with sample sizes from 256 to 1000, and will increase more for larger image sizes.

In the last decades, a significant increase in landslide frequency took place, in concomitance to climate change and the expansion of urbanized areas. Remote sensing techniques represent a powerful tool for landslide investigation: applications are traditionally divided into three main classes, although this subdivision has some limitations and borders are sometimes fuzzy. The first class comprehends techniques for landslide recognition, i.e., the mapping of past or active slope failures. The second regards landslide monitoring, which entails both ground deformation measurement and the analysis of any other changes along time (e. g., land use, vegetation cover). The third class groups methods for landslide hazard analysis and forecasting. The aim of this paper is to give an overview on the applications of remote-sensing techniques for the three categories of landslide investigations, focusing on the achievements of the last decade, being that previous studies have already been exhaustively reviewed in the existing literature.

The most important green roof abilities, which appear as a key feature in urban catchments are the ability of rainwater detention and retention and reduction in energy consumption. This paper aims to provide an overview of the effects of the application of the green roof strategy on the quality of runoff water and the reduction of energy consumption. The components of a green roof are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of different types of green roofs are assessed. In addition, the origins and concentrations of the main pollutants are discussed, moreover environmental cost-benefits of green roofs are also considered. In addition, the main factors that affect the quality of green roof runoff water, e.g., plant species, fertilization, pH, growth media as well as how green roofs could reduce energy consumption are discussed. Green roofs are considered as sustainable approach for runoff management with achieved aesthetical values and in combination with energy saving on heating/cooling. Hence, green roof causes a sufficient decrease in energy consumption and consequently in the related energy costs. It can help to improve the micro climate around the buildings and save money and also improve water quality. Therefore, green roofs may turn into a profitable investment. Some recommendations for future study also are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While this approach performs considerably well for sequenced organisms, direct inference of peptide sequences from tandem mass spectra, i.e., de novo peptide sequencing, oftentimes is the only way to obtain information when protein databases are absent. However, available algorithms suffer from drawbacks such as lack of validation and often high rates of false positive hits (FP). Here we present a simple method of combining results from commonly available de novo peptide sequencing algorithms, which in conjunction with minor tweaks in data acquisition ensues lower empirical FDR compared to the analysis using single algorithms. Results were validated using state-of-the art database search algorithms as well specifically synthesized reference peptides. Thus, we could increase the number of PSMs meeting a stringent FDR of 5% more than 3-fold compared to the single best de novo sequencing algorithm alone, accounting for an average of 11 120 PSMs (combined) instead of 3476 PSMs (alone) in triplicate 2 h LC-MS runs of tryptic HeLa digestion.","[Blank-Landeshammer, Bernhard; Kollipara, Laxmikanth; Biss, Karsten; Malchow, Sebastian; Shuvaev, Konstantin; Zahedi, Rene P.; Sickmann, Albert] ISAS eV, Leibniz Inst Analyt Wissensch, D-44139 Dortmund, Germany; [Pfenninger, Markus] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Pfenninger, Markus] Goethe Univ, Dept Mol Ecol, Inst Ecol Evolut & Div, Fac Biol Sci, Max von Laue Str 9, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Sickmann, Albert] Ruhr Univ Bochum, MPC, Med Fak, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Sickmann, Albert] Univ Aberdeen, Coll Phys Sci, Dept Chem, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland",Dortmund University of Technology; Leibniz Institut fur Analytische Wissenschaften (ISAS); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Goethe University Frankfurt; Ruhr University Bochum; University of Aberdeen,"Sickmann, A (corresponding author), ISAS eV, Leibniz Inst Analyt Wissensch, D-44139 Dortmund, Germany.;Sickmann, A (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, MPC, Med Fak, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.;Sickmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Coll Phys Sci, Dept Chem, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland.",sickmann@isas.de,"Sickmann, Albert/A-1010-2011; Zahedi, Rene/HGU-5710-2022; Zahedi, Rene/A-9148-2012","Sickmann, Albert/0000-0002-2388-5265; Zahedi, Rene/0000-0002-4960-5460; Laxmikanth, Kollipara/0000-0002-2673-0488","Leibniz-Competition Fund [SAW-2014-ISAS-2-D]; Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen; Regierende Burgermeister von Berlin - inkl.

Consequently, the choice of the optimal solvent is an important task in chemical process design. Because of the vast number of potential solvents, experimental testing of all candidates is infeasible. To explore the design space of possible reaction solvents, computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) methods have been developed. However, state-of-the-art CAMD methods for reaction solvent design consider usually only a limited molecular design space and rely on simplified models fitted to experimental data to predict solvent performance. To overcome these limitations, we here propose Rx-COSMO-CAIVID as the method for the design of reaction solvents. Rx-COSMO-CAMD combines CAMD using the genetic optimization algorithm LEA3D with sound prediction of reaction kinetics based on transition-state theory and advanced quantum chemical methods. Thereby, no experimental data are required. The predictions are shown to be computationally efficient and not limited to certain structural groups. Thus, large and diverse molecular design spaces can be explored. To demonstrate the proposed Rx-COSMO-CAMD method, we successfully design solvents, enhancing the reaction kinetics of a Menschutkin reaction and a chain propagation reaction for the production of polymers and microgels. The method is shown to identify promising solvents for significant enhancement of reaction rates. Rx-COSMO-CAMD is therefore a powerful, fully predictive tool for the identification of optimal reaction solvents.","[Gertig, Christoph; Kroeger, Leif; Fleitmann, Lorenz; Scheffczyk, Jan; Bardow, Andre; Leonhard, Kai] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Bardow, Andre] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Leonhard, K (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",kai.leonhard@ltt.rwth-aachen.de,"; Bardow, Andre/C-5446-2009","Leonhard, Kai/0000-0001-6231-6957; Bardow, Andre/0000-0002-3831-0691","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [SFB 985]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Project Carbon2Polymers [03EK30442C]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy-Exzellenzcluster 2186 The Fuel Science Center [390919832]; RWTH Aachen University [rwth0083, rwth0284]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Project Carbon2Polymers; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy-Exzellenzcluster 2186 The Fuel Science Center(German Research Foundation (DFG)); RWTH Aachen University","L.K. and K.L. gratefully acknowledge financial support from the SFB 985 Functional Microgels and Microgel Systems of Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within project B4 and C.G. and A.B. from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Project Carbon2Polymers (03EK30442C).

Chlorophyll content is an important indicator of a plant's growth status. In this study, we analyzed the hyperspectral reflectance of normal and freeze stressed leaves of winter wheat using a spectro-radiometer in a laboratory. The response of the chlorophyll spectra of plants under freeze stress was analyzed to predict the severity of freeze injury. A continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was conducted in conjunction with a correlation analysis, which generated a correlation scalogram that summarized the correlation between the chlorophyll content (SPAD value) and wavelet power at different wavelengths and decomposition scales. A linear regression model was established to relate the SPAD values and wavelet power coefficients. The results indicated that the most sensitive wavelet feature (region E: 553 nm, scale 5, R-2 = 0.8332) was located near the strong pigment absorption bands, and the model based on this feature could estimate the SPAD value with a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.7444, RMSE = 7.359). The data revealed that the chlorophyll content of leaves under different low temperatures treatments could be accurately estimated using CWT. Also, this emerging spectral analytical approach can be applied to other complex datasets, including a broad range of species, and may be adapted to estimate basic leaf biochemical elements, such as nitrogen, cellulose, and lignin.

In this work, we use a non-linear deep learning-based feature reduction scheme for the discovery of skilful predictors for monsoon rainfall with climatic variables from various regions of the globe. We use a stacked autoencoder network along with two advanced machine learning techniques to forecast the Indian summer monsoon. We show that the predictors such as the sea surface temperature and zonal wind can predict the Indian summer monsoon one month ahead, whereas the sea level pressure can predict ten months before the season. Further, we also show that the predictors derived from a combination of climatic variables can outperform the predictors derived from an individual variable. The stacked autoencoder model with combined predictors of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure can predict the monsoon (June-September) two months ahead with a 2.8% error. The accuracy of the identified predictors is found to be superior to the state-of-the-art predictions of the Indian monsoon. (C) 2020 International Institute of Forecasters.

The existing tide gauge record is extensive, going back to 1871, but it is affected by the superposition of multidecadal swings and short-term fluctuations, including both natural and manmade forcing factors. A biological proxy, i.e. the green algae belt reported on paintings made with the help of a camera obscura by the Venetian painters Canaletto and Bellotto (eighteenth century) and Veronese (sixteenth century), helps us to go back to 1571. This paper presents an exceptionally long series (i.e. 664 years) and adds a novel proxy: the submersion of water stairs of the historic palaces facing the Grand Canal. Originally, the bottom step of the water stairs was built in relation to the sea level and the slippery algae belt, while today, the water stairs are mostly submerged. An underwater survey of 78 water stairs has provided new data about the RSL since 1350. The results show that RSL in Venice was always rising at an increasingly fast rate. By subtracting local land subsidence (LLS) from RSL, absolute (eustatic) sea level (ASL) has been calculated. For both RSL and ASL, the apparent acceleration is +0.0030 +/- 0.0004 mm year(-2). This figure becomes unstable when the record length is reduced. A discussion is made about the interpolation functions, i.e. the second-order polynomial and the exponential that provide almost the same best-fit over the common period. The RSL and ASL trend lines and the possibility of turning points are also discussed and compared with other scholarly studies. A eustatic turning point is suggested for the mid fifteenth century, consistent with the literature. However, the comparison between scholarly papers is difficult due to geographic and geological differences between sites and record durations.","[Camuffo, Dario; Bertolin, Chiara; Schenal, Patrizia] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Padua, Italy; [Bertolin, Chiara] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Fac Architecture & Fine Art, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Camuffo, D (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Padua, Italy.",d.camuffo@isac.cnr.it,"Camuffo, Dario/AAU-3695-2020; Muñoz-Tuñon, Casiana/AAA-9309-2019","Camuffo, Dario/0000-0002-1087-5797; Muñoz-Tuñon, Casiana/0000-0001-8876-4563",EU [226973],EU(European Commission),"The authors are especially grateful to the Frogmen Team of the Italian National Police, Venice, who made the underwater measurements concerning the monumental stairs in the Grand Canal.

Adult mosquito sampling was conducted seasonally in May and August 2002 in a 3 by 3-km(2) area, and in November 2002 and February 2003 in an expanded 4 by 4-km(2) area in Kakamega District, western Kenya. Anopheles gambiae Giles was the predominant malaria vector species, constituting 84.6% of the specimens, whereas Anophels funestus Giles constituted 15.4% of the vector populations. An. gambiae abundance increased by six- to eigbt-fold in the long rainy season over the dry seasons, but An. funestus abundance peaked 3 mo after the long rainy season. For both species, the coefficient of variation was larger than 1, suggesting that the distribution of mosquito adults was aggregated. Mosquito clustering occurred in houses < 400 m from a valley bottom. The negative binomial distribution was accepted in one sample period (August 2002) for An. gambiae and in two sampling periods (May and August 2002) for Art. funestus. Taylor's power law analyses indicated that An. gambiae distribution was more aggregated in the wet seasons than in the dry seasons, whereas the degree of aggregation of An. funestus was similar in all four seasons. The minimum number of houses required to estimate anopheline female abundance within the commonly acceptable precision level (0.2) should be 17 houses per km(2) for An, gambiae and 42 houses per km(2) for An.finiestus.

Our fieldwork and interviews in Ambovombe subprefecture in Androy addressed land use, agropastoralism, livelihood, institutions and their moral basis. Our analysis points to the interdependence of cultural practices and ecosystem services: sacred forests, crop pollination, subsistence farming, cattle economy and societal transition and purification rituals. We posit a social-ancestral contract that works as a moral attractor structuring and sustaining the agropastoral ecosystem services system. The contract between living and nonliving clan members underpins the cultural practices and rituals that regulate the vulnerable agropastoral system. We conclude that the well-being values of the inhabitants of the south of Madagascar depend upon moralities that lend legitimacy and stability to the management of the social-ecological processes that precondition ecosystem services production. Neither ecosystem nor culture delivers ecosystem services to society. Ecosystem services are generated by an interdependent social-ecological system in which knowledge, practice, and beliefs coevolve: culture is a key factor in their generation and persistence. The study suggests these are significant interdependences to consider in dynamic analyses of ecosystem service production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This review article considers the volatile and non-volatile elements of particulate matter emissions from aircraft engines, their characteristics and quantification and identifies gaps in knowledge. The current state of the art emission inventory methods and dispersion modelling approaches are reviewed and areas for improvement and research needs are identified. Quantification of engine non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) is improving as measured certification data for the landing and take-off cycle are becoming available. Further work is needed: to better estimate nvPM emissions during the full-flight; to estimate non-regulated (smaller) engines; and to better estimate the emissions and evolution of volatile particles (vPM) in the aircraft exhaust plume. Dispersion modelling improvements are also needed to better address vPM. As the emissions inventory data for both vPM and nvPM from aircraft sources improve, better estimates of the contribution of aircraft engine emissions to ambient particulate concentrations will be possible.","[Owen, Bethan; Christie, Simon; Lim, Ling] Manchester Metropolitan Univ MMU, Fac Sci & Engn, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Anet, Julien G.; Edebeli, Jacinta] Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Ctr Aviat, Sch Engn, CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Bertier, Nicolas] Univ Toulouse, ONERA DMPE, F-31055 Toulouse, France; [Cremaschi, Michele] ENVISA SAS, 62 Rue Montorgueil, F-75002 Paris, France; [Dellaert, Stijn; Kuenen, Jeroen] Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res TNO, Dept Climate Air & Sustainabil, Princetonlaan 6, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Janicke, Ulf] Janicke Consulting JC, Hermann Hoch Weg 1, D-88662 Uberlingen, Germany; [Terrenoire, Etienne] Univ Paris Saclay, ONERA, DMPE, F-91123 Palaiseau, France",Manchester Metropolitan University; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Universite de Toulouse; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; National Office for Aerospace Studies & Research (ONERA); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Owen, B (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ MMU, Fac Sci & Engn, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",b.owen@mmu.ac.uk; anet@zhaw.ch; nicolas.bertier@onera.fr; s.christie@mmu.ac.uk; michele.cremaschi@env-isa.com; stijn.dellaert@tno.nl; edeb@zhaw.ch; uj@janicke.de; jeroen.kuenen@tno.nl; l.lim@mmu.ac.uk; etienne.terrenoire@onera.fr,,"Bertier, Nicolas/0000-0003-3692-6297; Lim, Ling/0000-0002-6435-9683; , Jacinta/0000-0003-2465-1783; Christie, Simon/0000-0003-2631-5425",RAPTOR H2020-EU.3.4.5.10 Clean Sky 2 Joint undertaking under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [863969],RAPTOR H2020-EU.3.4.5.10 Clean Sky 2 Joint undertaking under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,This research was funded by RAPTOR H2020-EU.3.4.5.10 Clean Sky 2 Joint undertaking under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant agreement ID: 863969).,,87,2,2,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2022,8,,,,,,1230,10.3390/atmos13081230,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13081230,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4D3RL,,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000847061300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The temporal dynamic of SOC after LUC is especially important in temperate systems with a long reaction time. On the basis of 95 compiled studies covering 322 sites in the temperate zone, carbon response functions (CRFs) were derived to model the temporal dynamic of SOC after five different LUC types (mean soil depth of 30 +/- 6 cm). Grassland establishment caused a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128 +/- 23% and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116 +/- 54%, 100 years after LUC (mean +/- 95% confidence interval). No new equilibrium was reached within 120 years. In contrast, there was no SOC sink following afforestation of grasslands and 75% of all observations showed SOC losses, even after 100 years. Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0.38 +/- 0.04 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in afforestations adding up to 38 +/- 4 Mg ha-1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (-32 +/- 20%) and grassland conversion to cropland (-36 +/- 5%), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively. The change rate of SOC increased with temperature and precipitation but decreased with soil depth and clay content. Subsoil SOC changes followed the trend of the topsoil SOC changes but were smaller (25 +/- 5% of the total SOC changes) and with a high uncertainty due to a limited number of datasets. As a simple and robust model approach, the developed CRFs provide an easily applicable tool to estimate SOC stock changes after LUC to improve greenhouse gas reporting in the framework of UNFCCC.","[Poeplau, Christopher; Don, Axel] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Agr Climate Res, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Vesterdal, Lars] KVL, Horsholm, Denmark; [Leifeld, Jens] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Zurich, Switzerland; [Van Wesemael, Bas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, Jena, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Copenhagen; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Universite Catholique Louvain; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Don, A (corresponding author), Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Agr Climate Res, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",axel.don@vti.bund.de,"Van+Wesemael, Bas/Y-2444-2019; Don, Axel/A-1618-2009; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014","Don, Axel/0000-0001-7046-3332; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Poeplau, Christopher/0000-0003-3108-8810; van Wesemael, Bas/0000-0003-4007-0241",COST Action [639]; FP7 project GHG-Europe [244122],COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); FP7 project GHG-Europe,We thank the COST Action 639 'Burn Out' and FP7 project GHG-Europe (Grant No. 244122) for financial support.,,61,511,533,13,494,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Results show that top-down emissions derived in several recent studies exhibit similar uncertainty as bottom-up inventories in some regions for certain species and even less in the case of Chinese CO emissions. In general, the largest discrepancies are found outside of regions such as the United States, Europe, and Japan where the most accurate and detailed information on emissions is available. In some regions such as China, which has recently undergone dynamical economic growth and changes in air quality regulations, the top-down estimates better capture recent emission trends than global bottom-up inventories. These results show the potential of top-down estimates to complement bottom-up inventories and to aide in the development of emission scenarios, particularly in regions where global inventories lack the necessary up-to-date and accurate information regarding regional activity data and emission factors such as Africa and India. Areas of future work aimed at quantifying and reducing uncertainty are also highlighted. A regional comparison of recent CO and NO(x)trends in the five SSPs indicate that SSP126, a strong pollution control scenario, best represents the trends from the top-down and regional bottom-up inventories in the United States, Europe, and China, while SSP460, a low-pollution control scenario, lies closest to actual trends in West Africa. This analysis can be useful for air quality forecasting and near-future pollution control/mitigation policy studies.","[Elguindi, N.; Granier, C.; Liousse, C.; Solmon, F.] Univ Toulouse, Lab Aerol, CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Granier, C.] Univ Colorado, NOAA, ESRL, CSD CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Stavrakou, T.; Bauwens, M.; Mueller, J-F] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron, Div Atmospher Composit, Brussels, Belgium; [Darras, S.] Observ Midi Pyrenees, Toulouse, France; [Cao, H.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn ME, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Chen, C.; Dubovik, O.] Univ Lille, UMR8518, Lab Opt Atmospher LOA, CNRS, Lille, France; [Chen, C.] Univ Lille, Remote Sensing Dev, GRASP SAS, Lille, France; [van der Gon, H.

In the German food processing industry, the state-of-the-art technologies in the utility supply structure are a gas fired steam boiler for steam generation and ammonia chillers for chilled water generation. Low investment costs and its durability are attractive for industrial production sites. But, given the ongoing energy transition to renewable energy, opportunities to reduce emissions will become increasingly important. There are other energy supply options, such as Combined Heat and Power and Heat Pumps, that need to compete against the conventional energy supply systems. In the short-term, countries with presently high electricity Grid Emissions Factors (GEF) such as Germany and the USA, the use of decentralised CHP results in savings of primary energy and emissions. This option is less attractive for countries with already low GEF such as Norway. It is also less attractive in the long-term for countries like Germany as the on-going energy transition towards renewables is anticipated to decrease the current GEF by 50% in 2030. In these cases of low GEF, HP solutions provide the lowest emissions and highest primary energy efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The utilization rate of heating and air conditioning equipment for dwellings in poor rural areas is very low, and the buildings operate in natural ventilation mode all year round. Since the existing research on energy-saving retrofit is aimed at air-conditioned buildings, the research methods and results are not applicable to rural dwellings. This paper proposes a set of energy-saving retrofit evaluation methods suitable for natural ventilation buildings and applies it to the research on energy-saving retrofit of rural dwellings in cold climate regions of China. The specific process is as follows: First, this paper analyzed the current situation using field research and established a typical building model. Second, the DesignBuilder software was used to simulate all 725 schemes. Subsequently, the three main retrofit measures (replacing the external insulation windows, setting the external wall insulation layer and setting the roof insulation layer) were analyzed separately, and the optimal parameters of each retrofit measure were obtained. Finally, the entropy weight method was used to perform a multi-objective optimization analysis on all retrofit plans. The results show that 6+12A+6-mm insulating glass windows + 50-mm external wall insulation + 90-mm roof insulation is the optimal energy-saving reconstruction scheme. Compared with the benchmark building, the energy-saving rate of the optimal scheme is increased by 23.81%, and the annual adaptive thermal discomfort degree-hours are decreased by 13.17%.","[Cao, Wen; Yang, Lin; Wu, Weidong] Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Architecture, Bengbu 233100, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qinyi] Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Management, Bengbu 233100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lihua] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Art, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China",Anhui Science & Technology University; Anhui Science & Technology University; Hefei University of Technology,"Cao, W (corresponding author), Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Architecture, Bengbu 233100, Peoples R China.",caowenzqy@163.com; yl3495566786@163.com; zqy2010tc@163.com; clh6593@163.com; wwd18205@foxmail.com,,"Cao, Wen/0000-0002-9810-3723",Anhui Province Natural Science Foundation [2008085ME177]; National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Project of China [202010879077]; Natural Science Key Research Project of Anhui Education Department [KJ2019A0802],Anhui Province Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Project of China; Natural Science Key Research Project of Anhui Education Department,"This research was funded by Anhui Province Natural Science Foundation, grant number 2008085ME177, National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Project of China, grant number 202010879077 and Natural Science Key Research Project of Anhui Education Department, grant number KJ2019A0802.",,66,4,4,23,53,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2021,10,,,,,,5350,10.3390/su13105350,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13105350,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ST5YA,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000662517300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The observation-based budget was computed from semi-continuous micrometeorological fluxes over a time period of 16 months and using a process-based gap-filling procedure. The data for emission peak events following the application of cattle slurry and for background exchange were analysed separately to distinguish short-term perturbations from longer-term ecosystem functioning. A canopy compensation point model of background exchange is parameterised on the basis of measured data and applied for the purposes of gap-filling. The data show that, outside fertilisation events, grassland behaves as a net sink for atmospheric NH(3) with an annual dry deposition flux of -3.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), although small NH(3) emissions by the canopy were measured in dry daytime conditions. The median Gamma(s) ratio in the apoplast (=[NH(4)(+)]/[H(+)]) estimated from micrometeorological measurements was 620, equivalent to a stomatal compensation point of 1.3 mu g NH(3) m(-3) at 15 degrees C. Non-stomatal resistance to deposition R(w) was shown to increase with temperature and decrease with surface relative humidity, and R(w) values were among the highest published for European grasslands, consistent with a relatively high ratio of NH(3) to acid gases in the boundary layer at this site. Since the gross annual NH(3) emission by slurry spreading was of the order of +20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), the fertilised grassland was a net NH(3) source of +17 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). A comparison with the few other measurement-based budget values from the literature reveals considerable variability, demonstrating both the influence of soil, climate, management and grassland type on the NH(3) budget and the difficulty of scaling up to the national level.","[Flechard, C.

The issues of energy-saving, transmission efficiency, and security were gradually highlighted. Compressed sensing (CS) helps to simultaneously solve those three problems in the communication of intelligent networks. In CS, fewer samples are required to reconstruct sparse or compressible signals, which breaks the restrict condition of a traditional Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Here, we give an overview of recent CS studies, along the issues of sensing models, reconstruction algorithms, and their applications. First, we introduce several common sensing methods for CS, like sparse dictionary sensing, block-compressed sensing, and chaotic compressed sensing. We also present several state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms of CS, including the convex optimization, greedy, and Bayesian algorithms. Lastly, we offer recommendation for broad CS applications, such as data compression, image processing, cryptography, and the reconstruction of complex networks. We discuss works related to CS technology and some CS essentials.","[Li, Lixiang; Fang, Yuan; Liu, Liwei; Peng, Haipeng; Yang, Yixian] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Informat Secur Ctr, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Li, Lixiang] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, 2001 Century Ave, Jiaozuo 454003, Henan, Peoples R China; [Kurths, Juergen] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Yang, Yixian] Guizhou Univ, Guizhou Prov Key Lab Publ Big Data, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Henan Polytechnic University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Guizhou University,"Li, LX (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Informat Secur Ctr, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.;Li, LX (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, 2001 Century Ave, Jiaozuo 454003, Henan, Peoples R China.",lixiang@bupt.edu.cn; fangyuan@bupt.edu.cn; liuliwei@bupt.edu.cn; penghaipeng@bupt.edu.cn; kurths@pik-potsdam.de; yxyang@bupt.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972051, 61771071, 61932005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 61972051, 61771071 and 61932005.",,90,14,14,29,110,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

As a country highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture, Rwanda is vulnerable to rainfall variability. Observational data show that there are two rainy seasons in Rwanda, i.e., the long rainy season and the short rainy season. This study mainly focuses on the dominant intraseasonal rainfall mode during the long rainy season (February-May), and evaluates the forecast skill for the intraseasonal variability (ISV) over Rwanda and its surrounding regions in a state-of-the-art dynamic model. During the long rainy season, observational results reveal that the dominant intraseasonal rainfall mode in Rwanda exhibits a significant variability on the 10-25-day time scale. One-point-correlation analysis further unveils that the 10-25-day intraseasonal rainfall variability in Rwanda co-varies with that in its adjacent areas, indicating that the overall 10-25-day rainfall variability in Rwanda and its adjacent regions (8 degrees S-3 degrees N, 29 degrees-37 degrees E) should be considered collectively when studying the dominant intraseasonal rainfall variability in Rwanda. Composite results show that the development of the 10-25-day rainfall variability is associated with the anomalous westerly wind in Rwanda and its surrounding regions, which may trace back to a pair of westward-propagating equatorial Rossby waves. Based on the observational findings, an ISO_rainfall_index and an ISO_wind_index are proposed for quantitatively evaluating the forecast skill. The ECMWF model has a comparable skill in predicting the wind index and the rainfall index, with both indices showing a skill of 18 days.","[Zhou, Xuan; Chen, Lin; Umuhoza, Janet; Cheng, Yifeng; Wang, Lu; Wang, Ran] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ KLME,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xuan; Chen, Lin; Umuhoza, Janet; Cheng, Yifeng; Wang, Lu; Wang, Ran] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Umuhoza, Janet] Rwanda Meteorol Agcy, Kigali, Rwanda",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Chen, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ KLME,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Chen, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",chenlin@nuist.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC1510004]; LASG Open Project,National Key Research and Development Program of China; LASG Open Project,This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2019YFC1510004] and the LASG Open Project.,,25,1,1,1,5,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

The results of the research, presented in this paper, are formulated on the basis of the data collected and analysed in this manner. Contribution - Investigating strengths and weaknesses and analysing the image of a destination are the first steps in the creation of a tourist destination brand. Complementary advantages, nature, climate, geographical position, monuments, are no longer enough. A tourist destination not managing its quality development is left to its own resources, and faces the threat of losing its attributes in the future. This paper illustrates the process of quality management of a destination on the example of Pozega-Slavonia County, the goal of which is to define the standard and criteria of quality, named regionally Zlatna Slavonia (Golden Slavonia). The interconnectedness of the offer, information, the development of the destination product, the offer of local products, and a systematic and continued education are goals in establishing integral quality management system of a tourist destination.","[Birkic, Drazenka; Grgic, Paula] Karlovac Univ Appl Sci, Karlovac, Croatia; [Podoljak, Silvija] Pozega Tourist Board, Pozega, Croatia",,"Birkic, D (corresponding author), Karlovac Univ Appl Sci, Karlovac, Croatia.",dbirkic@vuka.hr; silvija.podoljak@gmail.com; grgic.paula@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2020,,,,,74,89,,,,,,16,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BS5EP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000728402200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social, cognitive, and political scientists' work on these phenomena has focused on two main aspects: Individuals' (and by extension societies') vulnerability to misinformation; Factors and interventions that can increase individuals' (and societies') resistance to misinformation. In this article, we offer a critical review of the psychological research pertaining to these two aspects. Drawing on this review, we highlight an emerging tension in the relevant literature. Indeed, the current state of the art of the political misinformation literature reflects the combined operation of two opposing psychological constructs: excess gullibility on the one hand and excess vigilance on the other. We argue that this conceptualization is important in both advancing theories of individuals' and societies' vulnerability to misinformation and in designing prospective research programs. We conclude with proposing what, in our view, are the most promising avenues for future research in the field.","[Pantazi, Myrto; Hale, Scott] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Klein, Olivier] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",University of Oxford; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Pantazi, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 41 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England.",myrto.pantazi@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,285,1,1,7,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0162-895X,1467-9221,,POLIT PSYCHOL,Polit.

Here, we present a new record from the site of Al-Rabyah, in the Jubbah basin (southern Nefud desert, Saudi Arabia), where a sequence of fossiliferous lacustrine and palustrine deposits containing an archaeological assemblage is preserved. Sedimentological and palaeoenvironmental investigations, both at Al-Rabyah and elsewhere in the Jubbah area, indicate phases of humid conditions, during which shallow lakes developed in the basin, separated by drier periods. At Al-Rabyah, the end of a Terminal Pleistocene phase of lake expansion has been dated to similar to 12.2 ka using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), with a mid-Holocene humid phase dated to after similar to 6.6 ka. Palaeoecological reconstructions based primarily on non-marine molluscs and ostracods from the younger lacustrine deposits indicate a relatively shallow body of freshwater surrounded by moist, well-vegetated environments. A lithic assemblage characterized by bladelets and geometric microliths was excavated from sediments attributed to a drier climatic phase dated to similar to 10.1 ka. The lithic artefact types exhibit similarities to Epipalaeolithic industries of the Levant, and their occurrence well beyond the 'core region' of such assemblages (and at a significantly later date) has important implications for understanding interactions between Levantine and Arabian populations during the Terminal Pleistocene Early Holocene. We suggest that the presence of foraging populations in the southern Nefud during periods of drier climate is due to the prolonged presence of a freshwater oasis in the Jubbah Basin during the Terminal Pleistocene Early Holocene, which enabled them to subsist in the region when neighbouring areas of northern Arabia and the Levant were increasingly hostile.

While, the energy performance factors are rarely considered in the function scheme decision of urban complex in the recent preprogramming process. Optimizing the building area ratio scheme of urban complex is the key link to improve the comprehensive energy utilization efficiency. This paper proposes an approach to optimize building area ratio scheme of urban complex from energy performance perspective by energy simulation, scenario analysis and demand side management methods, and provides a data set of rankings of urban complex function combination schemes by evaluating the performance of energy load leveling and the degree of load stability of each building area ratio scheme in different climatic conditions, respectively. The results indicate that: 1) the different building area ratios notably affect the integrated operating energy performance of urban complexes with a maximum evaluation indexes difference of more than 85%; 2) the evaluating and optimizing results of the building area ratio schemes show broadly similarity in different climate conditions; 3) the optimal building area ratio scheme of urban complex is usually with less shopping mall (0 - 10%), more residence (more than 35%), and floating ratio of office and hotel (0 - 35%). The main findings of this study provide a quantitative basis for the architectural pre-programming and function scheme decision-making of urban complex by demand-side energy management to improve the energy efficiency, so as to guarantee the energy supply security.","[Zhuang, Ran] Hunan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Engn Management, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Difei] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuan] Hunan Acad Bldg Res, Changsha 410011, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Zhuang, R (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Engn Management, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China.",zryfanni8866@hotmail.com,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

In this paper we present the state of the art of the plankton turnover at the Permo-Triassic and we review more precisely the pattern of extinction and recovery of radiolarians during such period, because at that time, plankton was essentially represented by radiolarians. At a global scale the end-Permian to early Triassic period is marked by several strong extinctions in the marine realm, and in the radiolarians they occur progressively as exemplified by two orders of radiolarians: Albaillelaria and Latentifistularia. Nevertheless, this period is marked by a tremendous post-crisis diversification in both at family and generic level, more than extinction; an actualized revision of the diversity at the family level is also offered in our review. At a moderate scale (i.e. genera and in a region) the modifications appear impressive while at specific and regional domain the message is not so clear, one can wonder if some crisis manifestation results from a taxonomic accident or from preservative conditions. In fact, strangely enough more the number of studies is, more the diversity is high, and oppositely less they are, more the provincialism is evoked.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Cadiz, Fac Ciencias Mar, Puerto Real 11510, Spain; Paleontoloski Inst Ivana Rakovca ZRC SAZU, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Universidad de Cadiz; Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA),"De Wever, P (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, 43 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",pdewever@mnhn.fr; lodogher@uca.es; spela@zrc-sazu.si,"O'Dogherty, Luis/M-7664-2013","O'Dogherty, Luis/0000-0001-7229-2370; Gorican, Spela/0000-0001-8598-4691",,,,,87,19,21,0,8,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"VIADUKSTRASSE 40-44, PO BOX 133, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0012-9402,,,ECLOGAE GEOL HELV,Eclogae Geol.

Possible artefacts from thermal oxidation with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on BC quantification of C-rich deposits were inferred by choosing three sites from a second peatland with no historical record of waste disposal as a reference (Seebodenalp). All sites were under grassland at time of sampling, but were partially cropped in the past at Witzwil. Mean BC contents in topsoils of Witzwil ranged from 10.7 to 91.5 (0-30 cm) and from 0.44 to 51.3 (30-140 cm) mg BC g(-1) soil, corresponding to BC/OC ratios of 0.04 to 0.3 (topsoil) and 0.02 to 0.18 (deeper soil). At three sites of Seebodenalp, BC was below the detection limit of 0.4 mg g(-1) organic soil, indicating negligible formation of BC during thermal oxidation of peat. (13)C NMR spectra corroborated the high BC contents at Witzwil. The data support a considerable vertical transport of BC given that soils were ploughed not deeper than 30 cm since abandonment of waste application about 50 years ago. The total amount of BC in the Witzwil profiles ranged from 3.2 to 7.5 kg BC m(-2), with 21 to 69 percent of it stemming from below the former ploughing depth. Under the premise of negligible rates of BC consumption since abandonment of waste application, minimum BC transport rates in these peats are 0.6 to 1.2 cm a(-1). The high mobility of BC might be explained by high macropore volumes in combination with occasional water saturation. By means of DSC peak temperatures, different types of BC could be distinguished, with deeper horizons containing BC of higher thermal stability. Application of combustion residues likely involved a mixture of various BC types, of which thermally more stable ones, most likely soots, were preferentially transported downwards.","Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; Bern Univ Appl Sci, Swiss Coll Agr, Zollikofen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",,,,,20,53,61,3,56,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2007,3,,,,425,432,,10.5194/bg-4-425-2007,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-4-425-2007,,,8,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,183KR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000247572200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, forecast of a severe precipitation event that occurred over the eastern central coast of Peninsular Malaysia was attempted using the state-of-the-art Florida State University (FSU) Global and Regional Spectral Models. The sensitivity of parameterized convection in these models on precipitation forecast skill is studied using two different parameterization schemes for cumulus convection (the Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert scheme and the modified Kuo scheme). Low precipitation threshold of rainfall less than 2 mm day(-1) was successfully predicted by both versions of the FSU model. However, the convection schemes lacked skill in predicting the correct placement of the area and amount for the high precipitation threshold greater than 40 mm day(-1). Further evaluation of the predictive skills showed that the Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert scheme was a consistently better predictor of rainfall due to its low bias and lower root mean square errors (RMSEs) compared to the modified Kuo parameterization scheme.","[Mahmud, Mastura] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Earth Observat Ctr, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kumar, T.

It reviews the state of the art of current body of literature about the application of DSF technologies in order to provide guidelines to optimise such designs in naturally ventilated buildings. Three groups of parameters are identified as having significant impact on the DSF performance: the 'facade' parameters, which comprise the features of the cavity and the external layer of the facade; the 'building' parameters, which are those related to the physical configurations of the building; and the 'site' parameters, which are related to the effects of the outdoor environmental conditions on the building and the DSF behaviours. For each group of parameters, a comprehensive table is compiled summarizing the main findings of the studies that directly and indirectly contribute to the understanding and implementation of such technology. Guidelines established for the design of naturally ventilated buildings indicated potential application of DSF for improving the indoor thermal comfort even in warmer regions. However, further investigations expanding the analysis beyond the cavity are needed in order to evaluate the influence of the DSF on the thermal comfort in the user space. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rich geological records of Quaternary glaciations are preserved in this area. However, the glacial history in the Chinese Altai has hardly been investigated. This study aims to rebuild the regional glacial history in the Kanas Valley of the Chinese Altai. We present 14 electron spin resonance (ESR) ages and 3 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from glacial landforms. By integrating with ages from previous studies, five major glacial, advances are identified during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages (MIS) 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2, with ages of 167.0 +/- 16.0-123.0 +/- 18.0 ka, 97.0 +/- 19.0-78.0 +/- 7.0 ka, 76.0 +/- 16.0-73.1 +/- 6.6 ka, 52.1 +/- 7.8-34.4 +/- 4.2 ka, and 28.0 +/- 3.3-16.1 +/- 1.5 ka respectively. The glacial advance during MIS 5 is the local Last Glacial Maximum, and glaciers became successively more restricted from MIS 5 to MIS 2. In addition, the extensive MIS 3 glacial advance in the Chinese Altai contrasts with the absence of MIS 3 glacial advance in the Mongolia Altai. These glacial patterns reflect that precipitation brought by the westerlies might play a primary role on driving glacial advances during the Last Glacial in the Chinese Altai. This glacial chronology is in reasonable agreement with existing glacial chronologies from other parts of the Altai, Tian Shan and Pamir, indicating similar climate controls on the patterns of Quaternary glaciation across Central Asia Highlands.","[Yang, Jianqiang; Xu, Xiangke] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yixin; Cui, Zhijiu] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Heigang] Beijing Union Univ, Coll Art & Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Peking University; Beijing Union University","Chen, YX (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",chenyixin@pku.edu.cn,"xu, xiangke/V-4782-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [40701017, 40801006, 41101003, 41230743]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 40701017, 40801006, 41101003 and 41230743).

The mechanisms of continental late Pleistocene megafaunal extinction, however, are still fiercely contested. Potential factors contributing to their demise include climatic change, human impact, or some combination. On the Australian mainland, 90% of the megafauna became extinct by approximate to 46 thousand years (ka) ago, soon after the first archaeological evidence for human colonization of the continent. Yet, on the neighboring island of Tasmania (which was connected to the mainland when sea levels were lower), megafaunal extinction appears to have taken place before the initial human arrival between 43 and 40 ka, which would seem to exonerate people as a contributing factor in the extirpation of the island megafauna. Age estimates for the last megafauna, however, are poorly constrained. Here, we show, by direct dating of fossil remains and their associated sediments, that some Tasmanian megafauna survived until at least 41 ka (i.e., after their extinction on the Australian mainland) and thus overlapped with humans. Furthermore, a vegetation record for Tasmania spanning the last 130 ka shows that no significant regional climatic or environmental change occurred between 43 and 37 ka, when a land bridge existed between Tasmania and the mainland. Our results are consistent with a model of human-induced extinction for the Tasmanian megafauna, most probably driven by hunting, and they reaffirm the value of islands adjacent to continental landmasses as tests of competing hypotheses for late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions.","[Turney, Chris S.

We use a rights-based access control policy for in-vehicle functionalities similar to the case of a file allocation table of a contemporary OS, in which read, write or execute operations can be performed over various vehicle functions. Further, to assure the appropriate security, we develop a protocol suite using identity-based cryptography and we rely on group signatures which preserve the anonymity of group members thus assuring privacy and traceability. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation with modern smartphones, aftermarket Android head-units and test computational feasibility on a real-world in-vehicle controller. Our implementation relies on state-of-the-art cryptography, including traditional building blocks and more modern pairing-friendly curves, which facilitate the adoption of group signatures and identity-based cryptography in automotive-based scenarios.","[Groza, Bogdan; Andreica, Tudor; Berdich, Adriana; Murvay, Pal-Stefan; Gurban, Eugen Horatiu] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Fac Automat & Comp, Timisoara 300223, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Groza, B (corresponding author), Politehn Univ Timisoara, Fac Automat & Comp, Timisoara 300223, Romania.",bogdan.groza@aut.upt.ro,"Murvay, Pal-Stefan/ABH-1230-2021; Berdich, Adriana/GQO-9912-2022; Groza, Bogdan/ABG-8077-2021","Berdich, Adriana/0000-0002-7646-7825; Murvay, Pal-Stefan/0000-0002-0330-4523; Groza, Bogdan/0000-0003-3078-3635; Gurban, Eugen Horatiu/0000-0002-8580-9372","Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III [PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-1317]; Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation [10PFE/16.10.2018]","Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization - Romania)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, under Project PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-1317, within PNCDI III, and in part by the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, under Project 10PFE/16.10.2018, PERFORM-TECH-UPT (The increasing of the institutional performance of the Polytechnic University of Timi<SUP>3</SUP>oara by strengthening the research, development and technological transfer capacity in the ~eld of Energy, Environment and Climate Change, within Program 1-Development of the National System of Research and Development, Subprogram 1.2-Institutional Performance-Institutional Development Projects-Excellence Funding Projects in RDI, PNCDI III).",,65,2,2,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,,,,,119105,119122,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003574,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MP1OY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000551982000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our method achieves accuracy competitive with deep neural networks at orders of magnitude lower computational cost, scales globally, delivers label super-resolution predictions, and facilitates characterizations of uncertainty. Since image encodings are shared across tasks, they can be centrally computed and distributed to unlimited researchers, who need only fit a linear regression to their own ground truth data in order to achieve state-of-the-art SIML performance.

Recent progress in molecular marker technology, molecular cytogenetic techniques, and in genome knowledge has greatly enhanced the ability of chromosome engineering to contribute breeder-friendly germplasm, even in the case of durum wheat, considered more sensitive to genome manipulations than bread wheat. Using finely tuned chromosome engineering, stable incorporation into durum has been achieved for various alien segments containing genes for disease resistance, quality attributes, and even yield-related traits, both separately and in combination.

The cognitive radio (CR) technology is developed to solve the spectrum issue, while multiple description coding (MDC) is one of the promising source coding techniques to alleviate packet loss problems and exploit the benefit of path diversity. The source information was split into several descriptions in MDC, then transmitted over a network with multiple paths. The quality of the received data increases with the number of descriptions received at the receiver. In this paper, the proposed system comprises of relay-assisted cognitive radio network using the MDC technique for video transmission. In the simulations, the outage performance of the MDC scheme over two networks, which were relay-assisted network and non-relay network, were compared. Then, the outage probability was used to estimate the video quality, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the received video. The results obtained show the benefits of the relay assisted networks by 9% improvement on average outage performance over the non-relay network. Furthermore, the video performance improved by an average of 9% in PSNR compared to the non-relay system.","[Ibrahim, N. K.; Sali, A.; Ibrahim, N.

The devices deployed to monitor the precipitation fields are traditionally networks of rain gauges distributed throughout the territory, along with weather radars and satellite remote sensors operating in the optical or infrared band, none of which, however, are suitable for full compliance to all of the requirements cited above. More recently, a different approach to rain rate estimation techniques has been proposed and investigated, based on the measurement of the attenuation induced by rain on signals of pre-existing radio networks either in terrestrial links, e.g., the backhaul connections in cellular networks, or in satellite-to-earth links and, among the latter, notably those between geostationary broadcast satellites and domestic subscriber terminals in the Ku and Ka bands. Knowledge of the above rain-induced attenuation permits the retrieval of the corresponding rain intensity provided that a number of meteorological and geometric parameters are known and ultimately permits estimating the rain rate locally at the receiver site. In this survey paper, we specifically focus on such a type of opportunistic systems for rain field monitoring, which appear very promising in view of the wide diffusion over the territory of low-cost domestic terminals for the reception of satellite signals, prospectively allowing for a considerable geographical capillarity in the distribution of sensors, at least in more densely populated areas. The purpose of the paper is to present a broad albeit synthetic overview of the numerous issues inherent in the above rain monitoring approach, along with a number of solutions and algorithms proposed in the literature in recent years, and ultimately to provide an exhaustive account of the current state of the art. Initially, the main relevant aspects of the satellite link are reviewed, including those related to satellite dynamics, frequency bands, signal formats, propagation channel and radio link geometry, all of which have a role in rainfall rate estimation algorithms. We discuss the impact of all these factors on rain estimation accuracy while also highlighting the substantial differences inherent in this approach in comparison with traditional rain monitoring techniques. We also review the basic formulas relating rain rate intensity to a variation of the received signal level or of the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive literature survey of the main research issues for the aforementioned scenario and provide a brief outline of the algorithms proposed for their solution, highlighting their points of strength and weakness.

This spread pattern of EA-WNPSM changes is induced by the spread of sea surface temperature changes in the equatorial western Pacific, and can be further traced back to an apparent discrepancy among the state-of-the-art models in simulating the tropical Pacific rainfall. An air-sea coupling processes involved with summer background circulation contribute to this robust spread pattern of EA-WNPSM changes. We can constrain the EA-WNPSM rainfall changes based on the current-future relationship and observation that there should be more rainfall increase in North China and the Korean Peninsula and less increase in South China, the Indochina Peninsula and WNP, relative to previous multi-model ensemble projections.","[Zhou, Shijie; Huang, Ping; Huang, Gang; Hu, Kaiming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ping; Hu, Kaiming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ping; Huang, Gang; Hu, Kaiming] JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shijie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Huang, P; Huang, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Huang, G (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.;Huang, P; Huang, G (corresponding author), JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",huangping@mail.iap.ac.co; hg@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Zhou, ShiJie/0000-0001-7761-2345","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0606703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975116, 41722504, 41831175]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2016074]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant 2019YFA0606703), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41975116, 41722504 and 41831175), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2016074), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,49,8,8,8,16,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The field investigation, spatial analysis, statistics and comparative study on the traditional villages and vernacular dwellings in Hainan volcanic areas were performed. Based on the theory of ecological adaptability, the layout of traditional villages and the types, distribution and differences of vernacular dwellings in Hainan volcanic areas were studied from the perspective of village layout structure, architectural space form and construction mode. It is found that the natural environment, architectural functions, customs, national culture and other aspects are the fundamental reasons for the formation and differences of buildings. The ecological adaptation process of traditional villages includes not only the adaptation of external topography, climate conditions and natural resources, but also the ecological adaptation of internal built environment. Meanwhile, the evolution of traditional villages is closely related to social-ecological adaptation. In addition, the ecological concept and technical experience of the traditional villages in Hainan volcanic areas in adapting to the natural environment and social environment were summarized.

Previous sea ice classification studies have rarely involved multifrequency altimeter data. In this article, benefiting from the dual-frequency observation capability of the Chinese HY-2B altimeter, differences between waveform features of C- and Ku-band radar altimeter over different types of sea ice were investigated and analyzed for the first time. To validate and evaluate the sea ice classification capability of different feature combinations of the different bands, we extracted 14 features from the waveforms of C- and Ku-band HY-2B altimeter data acquired between December 2019 and April 2020. Our experiments demonstrated that the C- and Ku-band radar waveforms are sensitive to sea ice type, and that sea ice type classification could be improved by combining Ku- and C-band data. This work also proposed a sea ice classification methodology using C- and Ku-band altimeter waveforms. Comparison with results from previous studies indicated that the overall accuracy of the proposed method (up to 93.45%) is much higher than that of existing state-of-the-art methods.","[Zhang, Xi; Zhu, Yixun; Zhang, Jie; Meng, Junmin; Fan, Chenqing; Liu, Genwang; Bao, Meng] Minist Nat Resources China, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xi; Zhang, Jie; Meng, Junmin; Fan, Chenqing; Liu, Genwang; Bao, Meng] Minist Nat Resources China, Technol Innovat Ctr Ocean Telemetry, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yixun] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qimao; Shi, Lijian] Natl Satellite Ocean Applicat Serv, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qimao; Shi, Lijian] Key Lab Space Ocean Remote Sensing & Applicat, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Meijie] Qingdao Univ, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Shandong University of Science & Technology; National Satellite Ocean Application Service; Qingdao University,"Zhang, X (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources China, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources China, Technol Innovat Ctr Ocean Telemetry, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.",schuman.zhang@gmail.com; 446747917@qq.com; zhangjie@fio.org.cn; qmwang@mail.nsoas.org.cn; shilj@mail.nsoas.org.cn; mengjm@fio.org.cn; fanchenqing@fio.org.cn; liu_meijie@163.com; liugenwang@fio.org.cn; baomeng@fio.org.cn,"陈清, 范/AAG-6907-2022; 陈清, 范/AEZ-3733-2022",,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1407203]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [41976173]; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [ZR2019MD016]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China; European Space Agency [577889],"National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFC1407203, in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 41976173, in part by the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant ZR2019MD016, Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the European Space Agency through the Dragon-5 Program under Grant 577889.

This data fragmentation is inherited from instrument failures, sparse measurement protocols, or unfavourable conditions (e. g. clouds or vegetation thickness in case of remote-sensing data). Missing values are problematic as they may cause analytic biases and often inhibit advanced statistical analyses. Hence, gapfilling is an undesired but necessary task in Earth System sciences. State-of-the-art gapfilling algorithms based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) exploit the information contained in periodic temporal patterns to fill gaps in the observations. Here we propose an extension of this method in order to additionally consider the spatial processes and patterns underlying most geoscientific datasets. The latter has been made possible by including a recently developed 2-D-SSA approach. Using both artificial and real-world test data, we show that simultaneously exploiting spatial and temporal patterns improves the gapfilling substantially. We outperform conventional approaches particularly for large and systematically recurring gaps. The new method is reasonably fast and can be applied with a minimum of a priori assumptions regarding the structure of the data and the distribution of gaps. The algorithm is available as a ready-to-use open source software package.","[von Buttlar, J.; Zscheischler, J.; Mahecha, M.

We discuss how these technologies can adhere to modern standards of data curation and transparency, their implications for citizen science, and their potential for integration among different monitoring programmes and technologies.

However, inappropriate design, construction, and operation control may lead to issues like low efficiency and high investment, and even the opposite technical effects. In this paper, a comprehensive uncertainty and variable ranking analysis is numerically conducted to explore the influence mechanism of twelve risk variables on three types and five thermal performance indexes under summer conditions. The uncertainty analysis results showed that the correct application of HTB could significantly reduce the heat gain that needs to be handled by the traditional air-conditioning system and even have the technical effect of auxiliary cooling if the variables are appropriately selected. The comprehensive influences of water temperature, room temperature, charging duration, and thermal conductivity of the HTB layer were in the first 1/3 range. Among them, the first two variables were identified as the two most influential variables, and they had a significant mutual restriction relationship in all other four indexes except for the exterior surface cold loss. The recommended charging duration was not less than eight hours in practical application, and the HTB layer with a higher thermal conductivity value but less than 3.3 W/(m center dot degrees C) was suggested. Besides, the climate zone was no longer the most influential variable affecting the mean radiant temperature of the interior surface due to the combined effects of HTB and static thermal insulation measures. In addition, pipe spacing should preferably be selected between 100 and 250 mm to help form a continuous thermal buffer zone inside the building envelope.","[Chen, Sarula] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Bldg Energy Efficiency Control & Eva, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sarula; Chang, Tianxin] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang] Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sarula; Yang, Yang] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Anhui Acad Terr Space Planning & Ecol, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China",Anhui Jianzhu University; Anhui Jianzhu University; Hefei University of Technology; Anhui Jianzhu University,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China.;Yang, Y (corresponding author), Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Anhui Acad Terr Space Planning & Ecol, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China.",yangyang2017@tju.edu.cn,,,"Open Project Program of Engineering Research Center of Building Energy Efficiency Control and Evaluation, Ministry of Education [AHJZNX202103]; Youth Fund of Anhui Natural Science Foundation [2208085QE163, 2108085QE241]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JZ2022HGTA0336, JZ2022HGQA0173]; Natural Science Research Program of Anhui Colleges [KJ2020A0462]; Scientific Research and Cultivation Project of Anhui Jianzhu University [2021XMK04]; Open Project Program of Anhui Academy of Territory Space Planning and Ecology [GTY2021202]","Open Project Program of Engineering Research Center of Building Energy Efficiency Control and Evaluation, Ministry of Education; Youth Fund of Anhui Natural Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Natural Science Research Program of Anhui Colleges; Scientific Research and Cultivation Project of Anhui Jianzhu University; Open Project Program of Anhui Academy of Territory Space Planning and Ecology","This study is co-sponsored by the Open Project Program of Engineering Research Center of Building Energy Efficiency Control and Evaluation, Ministry of Education (No. AHJZNX202103), Youth Fund of Anhui Natural Science Foundation (No. 2208085QE163, No. 2108085QE241), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JZ2022HGTA0336, No. JZ2022HGQA0173), Natural Science Research Program of Anhui Colleges (No. KJ2020A0462), Scientific Research and Cultivation Project of Anhui Jianzhu University (No. 2021XMK04), and Open Project Program of Anhui Academy of Territory Space Planning and Ecology (No. GTY2021202).",,46,0,0,12,12,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1996-3599,1996-8744,,BUILD SIMUL-CHINA,Build.

However, the artificial release oscillations in the source term estimate remain a funda-mental challenge and may deliver misleading information, because of the unavoidable model biases and observation uncertainties. We propose a new method that removes oscillations while recovering the release details. This method explicitly corrects the model biases using the joint correction model and compensates the observation uncertainties through non-smooth competing priors that involve two rival functions. The new priors better model the unsteady feature of the radionuclide releases and distinguish the true releases from oscillations, enabling release-preserving oscillation removal. We extend the projected alternating minimization algorithm for an efficient solution. The method achieves oscillation-free and nearly perfect profiles for real releases of the Perfluoro-Methyl-Cyclo-Hexane on continental and regional scales, and the radionuclide 41Ar on a local scale, outperforming state-of-the-art and very recent methods. The sensitivities to model inputs and key parameters are also investigated. Robust performance is exhibited under emissions of both radioactive and non-radioactive substances, different meteorological inputs and numbers of observations, paving the way for identifying dy-namic atmospheric radionuclide releases at multiple scales, especially when the release status is unknown.","[Fang, Sheng; Dong, Xinwen; Zhuang, Shuhan; Xu, Yuhan; Ye, Xuan; Xiong, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Nucl & New Energy Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Nucl Energy Technol, Key Lab Adv Reactor Engn & Safety,Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhijie] China Inst Radiat Protect, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China; [Chai, Tianfeng] NOAA, Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, NOAA Air Resources Lab ARL, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Chai, Tianfeng] Univ Maryland, Cooperat Inst Climate & Satellites, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Zhao, Yungang] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Nucl Sci & Technol, Key Lab Beam Technol, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yungang] CTBT Beijing Natl Data Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yungang] Beijing Radionuclide Lab, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Li] CMA Earth Syst Modeling & Predict Ctr CEMC, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Beijing Normal University,"Ye, X; Xiong, W (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Nucl & New Energy Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Nucl Energy Technol, Key Lab Adv Reactor Engn & Safety,Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",yexuan@tsinghua.edu.cn; xwthu@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [11875037]; International Atomic Energy Agency [CRP9053],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Atomic Energy Agency(International Atomic Energy Agency),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 11875037] and International Atomic Energy Agency (TC project number CRP9053) .

Vegetation fires emit carbon monoxide ( CO), which because of its medium lifetime is an excellent tracer of tropospheric transport. CO is also one of the few tropospheric trace gases currently observed from satellite, and this provides long-term global measurements. In this paper, we use the 5-year CO data record from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument to examine the interannual variability of the SH CO loading and show how this relates to climate conditions which determine the intensity of fire sources. The MOPITT observations show an annual austral springtime peak in the SH zonal CO loading each year with dry season biomass burning emissions in South America, southern Africa, the maritime continent, and northwestern Australia. Although fires in southern Africa and South America typically produce the greatest amount of CO, the most significant interannual variation is due to varying fire activity and emissions from the maritime continent and northern Australia. We find that this variation in turn correlates well with the El Nino - Southern Oscillation precipitation index. Between 2000 and 2005, emissions were greatest in late 2002, and an inverse modeling of the MOPITT data using the Model of Ozone Research in the Troposphere (MOZART) chemical transport model estimates the Southeast Asia regional fire source for the year August 2002 to September 2003 to be 52 Tg CO. Comparison of the MOPITT retrievals and NOAA surface network measurements indicate that the latter do not fully capture the interannual variability or the seasonal range of the CO zonal average concentration because of biases associated with atmospheric and geographic sampling.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Global Monitoring Div, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1AS, Canada",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Toronto,"Edwards, DP (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",edwards@ucar.edu; gabrielle.petron@noaa.gov; paul.c.novelli@noaa.gov; emmons@ucar.edu; gille@ucar.edu; james.drummond@utoronto.ca,"Emmons, Louisa K/R-8922-2016; Petron, Gabrielle/AAN-5133-2020; Pfister, Gabriele/A-9349-2008; Drummond, James R/O-7467-2014","Emmons, Louisa K/0000-0003-2325-6212; Petron, Gabrielle/0000-0002-7458-5852; ",,,,,35,61,63,0,13,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The timing of dispersal is associated with the occurrence of pluvial periods during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 (ca. 130-74 ka), after which arid conditions between ca. 74 and 10.5 ka are thought to have restricted further migration and range expansion within the Arabian interior. Whilst a number of records indicate that this phase of aridity was punctuated by an increase in monsoon strength during MIS 3, uncertainties regarding the precision of terrestrial records and suitability of marine archives as records of precipitation, mean that the occurrence of this pluvial remains debated. Here we present evidence from a series of relict lake deposits within southeastern Arabia, which formed at the onset of MIS 3 (ca. 61-58 ka). At this time, the incursion of monsoon rainfall into the Arabian interior activated a network of channels associated with an alluvial fan system along the western flanks of the Hajar Mountains, leading to lake formation. Multiproxy evidence indicates that precipitation increases intermittently recharged fluvial systems within the region, leading to lake expansion in distal fan zones. Conversely, decreased precipitation led to reduced channel flow, lake contraction and a shift to saline conditions. These findings are in contrast to the many other palaeoclimatic records from Arabia, which suggest that during MIS 3, the latitudinal position of the monsoon was substantially further south and did not penetrate the peninsula. Additionally, the occurrence of increased rainfall at this time challenges the notion that the climate of Arabia following MIS 5 was too harsh to permit the further range expansion of indigenous communities.

Four tephra layers were identified in each of the short sediment sequences and characterised using individual glass-shard tephra chemistry to determine provenance. Bulk sediment geochemistry and diatom assemblages were analysed to understand the impact of the tephra deposits on the lake ecosystems. Age-depth models for the cores were established by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating. Tephra deposits in Laguna Gemelas Este were dated to AD 1986-1998, 1943-1968, 1927-1955, and 1849-1892, and the tephra deposits in Laguna Verde were dated to AD 1940-1970, 1888-1934, 1871-1920, and 1536-1669, the latter interval determined by extrapolation. All tephras had similar geochemical composition and originated from volcanoes in the northern Austral Volcanic Zone. Tephra units were attributed to known historical eruptions and all but one, most likely, were from Lautaro Volcano (49 degrees 01 ' S; 73 degrees 33 ' W). The age of the youngest tephra (AD 1986-1998) from Laguna Gemelas Este points to Viedma Volcano (49 degrees 22 ' S; 73 degrees 19 ' W) as a possible source. Volcanic eruptions had a larger impact on Laguna Verde than on Laguna Gemelas Este, as expressed by changes in delta N-15 values and diatom communities during tephra deposition. These shifts are explained by perturbations of the nitrogen cycle in the lake, associated with shifts in lacustrine primary production. Primary producers may have been affected by increased water turbidity caused by the ash fall, and consequently, used less nitrogen. Diatom assemblages in Laguna Verde showed marked reductions in numbers of planktonic/tychoplanktonic taxa, in favour of epiphytic/benthic diatom taxa, when tephra was deposited. This contrasts with Laguna Gemelas Este, in which epiphytic/benthic diatom species were generally more abundant and decreases in abundances of planktonic/tychoplanktonic taxa were not as strongly linked to tephra layers as in Laguna Verde. At Laguna Gemelas Este, flatter relief, greater fetch and/or drier climate may have contributed to generally less ecosystem variability, resulting in seemingly less environmental response to volcanic eruptions than in Laguna Verde.","[Mayr, Christoph; Meier, Wolfgang J-H] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Mayr, Christoph] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geo & Umweltwissensch, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mayr, Christoph] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Smith, Rebecca E.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, 1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Lujan Garcia, M.; Maidana, Nora, I] UBA, IBBEA, CONICET, DBBE,Lab Diatomeas Continentales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Massaferro, Julieta] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CENAC APN, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Luecke, Andreas; Wissel, Holger] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geowissensch, IBG 3 Agrosphare, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Dubois, Nathalie] EAWAG, Dept Surface Waters Res & Management, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Zolitschka, Bernd] Univ Bremen, Inst Geog, GEOPOLAR, Celsiusstr 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Munich; University of Munich; University of Oxford; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Bremen,"Mayr, C (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",christoph.mayr@fau.de,"Garcia, Maria Lujan/ABE-3783-2021","Garcia, Maria Lujan/0000-0002-2658-2753; Smith, Rebecca/0000-0001-8614-5291; Mayr, Christoph/0000-0001-9002-9963; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808",BMBF [01DN16025]; cooperative project BMBF/MINCYT [AL15/03]; NERC [NE/L002621/1],BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); cooperative project BMBF/MINCYT; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"CM and JM acknowledge funding by BMBF (01DN16025) and cooperative project BMBF/MINCYT (AL15/03).

These fugitive aerosols may be bioaerosols, generated by the patient themselves through cough or sneeze, or they may be therapeutic medical aerosols, generated by therapeutic medical aerosol generators with the intent of delivery to a specific patient's respiratory tract. This review focus' on therapeutic aerosols in the intensive care unit (ICU) only, those typically generated by nebulisers. In the intensive care environment, patients are generally in receipt of ventilatory support, and the literature suggests that these different support interventions influence fugitive therapeutic medical aerosol emissions in a variety of ways. Predominant ventilatory support interventions include, but are not limited to, invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), and supplemental oxygen delivery in spontaneously breathing patients. Further, factors such as nebuliser type, patient interface, patient breathing pattern, nebuliser position in the patient breathing circuit and medication formulation characteristics also have been shown to exert influence on aerosol concentrations and distance from the source. Here we present the state of the art knowledge in this, as yet, poorly described field of research, and identify the key risks, and subsequently, opportunities to mitigate the risks of unintended exposure of both patients and bystanders during and for periods following the administration of therapeutic aerosols.","[O'Toole, Ciarrai; McGrath, James A.; Byrne, Miriam A.] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Phys, Galway, Ireland; [O'Toole, Ciarrai; McGrath, James A.; Byrne, Miriam A.] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst Ctr Climate & Air Pollut Studies, Galway, Ireland; [Joyce, Mary; O'Sullivan, Andrew; MacLoughlin, Ronan] Aerogen, IDA Business Pk, Galway H91 HE94, Ireland; [MacLoughlin, Ronan] Royal Coll Surg, Sch Pharm & Biomol Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [MacLoughlin, Ronan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Dublin, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Trinity College Dublin,"MacLoughlin, R (corresponding author), Aerogen, IDA Business Pk, Galway H91 HE94, Ireland.",rmacloughlin@aerogen.com,"MacLoughlin, Ronan J/G-3530-2013","MacLoughlin, Ronan J/0000-0002-3164-1607; O'Toole, Ciarrai/0000-0002-4045-8572",Irish Research Council under the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Programme [GOIPG/2018/1968],Irish Research Council under the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Programme,This work represents research funded by the Irish Research Council under the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Programme-GOIPG/2018/1968.,,39,7,8,0,5,AME PUBL CO,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2305-5839,2305-5847,,ANN TRANSL MED,ANN.

The objective of this study is to infer the relationships between patterns in OCO-2 observations and environmental drivers (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and therefore inform a process understanding of carbon fluxes using OCO-2. We use a multiple regression and inverse model, and the regression coefficients quantify the relationships between observations from OCO-2 and environmental driver datasets within individual years for 20152018 and within seven global biomes. We subsequently compare these inferences to the relationships estimated from 15 terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) that participated in the TRENDY model inter-comparison. Using OCO-2, we are able to quantify only a limited number of relationships between patterns in atmospheric CO2 observations and patterns in environmental driver datasets (i.e., 10 out of the 42 relationships examined). We further find that the ensemble of TBMs exhibits a large spread in the relationships with these key environmental driver datasets. The largest uncertainty in the models is in the relationship with precipitation, particularly in the tropics, with smaller uncertainties for temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Using observations from OCO-2, we find that precipitation is associated with increased CO2 uptake in all tropical biomes, a result that agrees with half of the TBMs. By contrast, the relationships that we infer from OCO-2 for temperature and PAR are similar to the ensemble mean of the TBMs, though the results differ from many individual TBMs. These results point to the limitations of current space-based observations for inferring environmental relationships but also indicate the potential to help inform key relationships that are very uncertain in state-of-the-art TBMs.","[Chen, Zichong; Miller, Scot M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Liu, Junjie] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Henze, Daven K.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Huntzinger, Deborah N.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Wells, Kelley C.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN USA; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Joetzjer, Emilie] CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech Meteo France 3589, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31100 Toulouse, France; [Bastrikov, Vladislav] CEA CNRS UVSQ, CE Orme Merisiers, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Goll, Daniel S.] Univ Paris Saclay, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Haverd, Vanessa] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kato, Etsushi] Inst Appl Energy IAE, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1050003, Japan; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys Phys Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Lombardozzi, Danica L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Terr Sci Sect, Climate & Global Dynam, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [McGuire, Patrick C.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Melton, Joe R.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Nabel, Julia E.

However, less attention has been paid to the fact that stored resources also determine tissue nutritional quality and may have direct consequences for the success of herbivores and pathogens. Here, we investigated whether stored resources differed between two hosts of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, 1902): lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex. Loudon), a common host, and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelmann), a more naive host that grows at higher altitudes. Phloem and sapwood were sampled in small-and large-diameter trees at two elevations, and nitrogen, phosphorus, nonstructural carbohydrates, and lipids were measured. We found that concentrations of stored resources increased with elevation and tree diameter for both species and that whitebark pine had thicker phloem than lodgepole pine. Overall, stored resources were higher in whitebark pine such that small-diameter whitebark pine trees often had resource concentrations higher than large-diameter lodgepole pines. These results suggest that whitebark pine is of higher nutritional quality than lodgepole pine, which could have implications for the current expansion of mountain pine beetles into higher altitude and latitude forests in response to climate warming.","[Lahr, Eleanor C.; Sala, Anna] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Lahr, EC (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.",eleanorlahr@gmail.com,,,"USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station [08-JV-262]; Fire Science Laboratory, USDA Rocky Mountain Research Station; National Science Foundation (NSF); Montana Institute on Ecosystems NSF EPSCoR program [EPS-1101342]","USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Fire Science Laboratory, USDA Rocky Mountain Research Station; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Montana Institute on Ecosystems NSF EPSCoR program","This research was supported, in part, by the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (08-JV-262 to A.S.), and we thank Bob Keane (Fire Science Laboratory, USDA Rocky Mountain Research Station) for facilitating financial support.

The consequences of these phenomena on the solar-terrestrial environment and on Space Weather are nowadays clearly recognized, even if not yet fully understood. In order to shed light on the mechanisms that are at the basis of the Space Weather, it is necessary to investigate the sequence of phenomena starting in the solar atmosphere and developing across the outer layers of the Sun and along the path from the Sun to the Earth. This goal can be reached by a combined multi-disciplinary, multi-instrument, multi-wavelength study of these phenomena, starting with the very first manifestation of solar active region formation and evolution, followed by explosive phenomena (i.e., flares, erupting prominences, coronal mass ejections), and ending with the interaction of plasma magnetized clouds expelled from the Sun with the interplanetary magnetic field and medium. This wide field of research constitutes one of the main aims of COST Action ES0803: Developing Space Weather products and services in Europe. In particular, one of the tasks of this COST Action was to investigate the Progress in Scientific Understanding of Space Weather. In this paper we review the state of the art of our comprehension of some phenomena that, in the scenario outlined above, might have a role on Space Weather, focusing on the researches, thematic reviews, and main results obtained during the COST Action ES0803.","[Zuccarello, Francesca] Univ Catania, Sez Astrofis, Dipartimento Fis & Astron, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Balmaceda, Laura; Lopez, Fernando M.] ICATE CONICET, Inst Ciencias Astron Tierra & Espacio, San Juan, Argentina; [Cessateur, Gael] World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observ, Davos, Switzerland; [Cremades, Hebe] Univ Tecnol Nacl, Fac Reg Mendoza CONICET, Mendoza, Argentina; [Guglielmino, Salvatore L.; Romano, Paolo] INAF Osservatorio Astrofis Catania, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Lilensten, Jean] UJF Grenoble CNRS INSU 1, IPAG, UMR 5274, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [de Wit, Thierry Dudok; Kretzschmar, Matthieu] LPC2E CNRS UMR 7328, F-45071 Orleans 2, France; [de Wit, Thierry Dudok; Kretzschmar, Matthieu] Univ Orleans, F-45071 Orleans 2, France; [Mierla, Marilena; Parenti, Susanna; Rodriguez, Luciano; West, Matt] Royal Observ Belgium, Solar Terr Ctr Excellence SIDC, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Mierla, Marilena] Romanian Acad, Inst Geodynam, Bucharest 020032 37, Romania; [Mierla, Marilena] Univ Bucharest, Fac Phys, Res Ctr Atom Phys & Astrophys, Magurele Ilfov 077125, Romania; [Pomoell, Jens; Vainio, Rami] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Srivastava, Nandita] Udaipur Solar Observ, Phys Res Lab, Udaipur 313001, India; [Zuccarello, Francesco P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Math Plasma Astrophys, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","University of Catania; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Istituto Nazionale Astrofisica (INAF); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Planetologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble (IPAG); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans; Romanian Academy of Sciences; University of Bucharest; University of Helsinki; Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India; KU Leuven","Zuccarello, F (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Sez Astrofis, Dipartimento Fis & Astron, Via S Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",francesca.zuccarello@oact.inaf.it,"López, Fernando Marcelo/ABC-9907-2021; Guglielmino, Salvo L./H-3388-2012; Vainio, Rami/A-5590-2009; Romano, Paolo/L-7264-2017; Zuccarello, Francesca/AAE-6330-2021; Zuccarello, Francesca/R-1834-2016; Dudok de Wit, Thierry/O-6478-2014","López, Fernando Marcelo/0000-0002-2047-6327; Guglielmino, Salvo L./0000-0002-1837-2262; Vainio, Rami/0000-0002-3298-2067; Romano, Paolo/0000-0001-7066-6674; Zuccarello, Francesca/0000-0003-1853-2550; Pomoell, Jens/0000-0003-1175-7124; Dudok de Wit, Thierry/0000-0002-4401-0943; Balmaceda, Laura/0000-0003-1162-5498","European Community [218816, 228319]; European COST-ES0803 project; German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG [Ts 17/2-1]; CONICET; COST Action ES0803 fellowship at ROB; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office; European Union [263252 COMESEP]; Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) under the PRIN-INAF; University of Catania; European Commission [284461]; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO)","European Community(European Commission); European COST-ES0803 project; German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); COST Action ES0803 fellowship at ROB; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); European Union(European Commission); Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) under the PRIN-INAF; University of Catania; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office)","This study received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007/2013) under the Grant Agreement No. 218816 (SOTERIA Project, www.soteria-space.eu) and under the Grant Agreement No. 228319 (Europlanet Research Infrastructure, www.europlanet-ri.eu).

The TSI value is relevant and has great importance in engineering and scientific research in energy. In this study, a review has been done to study the TSI and SC concepts. A reevaluation of the TSI and SC is undertaken to consider state of the art. The effect of three different TSI values concerning different locations is studied for estimating global radiation with the Angstrom-Pre-scott (A-P) formulation over Spain. New seasonal A-P coefficient sets are developed for Spain. The good performance for all the 29 stations and seasons and the slight differences observed for the different TSI values employed ensure global solar radiation (GSR) accuracy with the A-P model. The results highlight the local and seasonal A-P coefficient calibration relevance instead of using a single general pair of calibration coefficients. Based on the TSI study, we recommended calculations of solar radiation models to adopt the TSI value equal to 1361 W m(-2). The revised TSI is lower than the previous values proposed. Therefore, it is highly recommended to review the value and concept of TSI.

Six temporal storm clusters of different storm chronologies were formulated using three storms observed during the 2013/2014 winter. The storm power values of these three events nearly halve from the first to second event and from the second to third event. Cross-shore profile evolution was simulated in response to the tide, surge and wave forcing during these storms. The model was first calibrated against the available post-storm survey profiles. Cumulative impacts of beach/dune erosion during each storm cluster were simulated by using the post-storm profile of an event as the pre-storm profile for each subsequent event. For the largest event the water levels caused noticeable retreat of the dune toe due to the high water elevation. For the other events the greatest evolution occurs over the bar formations (erosion) and within the corresponding troughs (deposition) of the upper-beach profile. The sequence of events impacting the size of this ridge-runnel feature is important as it consequently changes the resilience of the system to the most extreme event that causes dune retreat. The highest erosion during each single storm event was always observed when that storm initialised the storm cluster. The most severe storm always resulted in the most erosion during each cluster, no matter when it occurred within the chronology, although the erosion volume due to this storm was reduced when it was not the primary event. The greatest cumulative cluster erosion occurred with increasing storm severity; however, the variability in cumulative cluster impact over a beach/dune cross section due to storm chronology is minimal. Initial storm impact can act to enhance or reduce the system resilience to subsequent impact, but overall the cumulative impact is controlled by the magnitude and number of the storms. This model application provides inter-survey information about morphological response to repeated storm impact. This will inform local managers of the potential beach response and dune vulnerability to variable storm configurations.","[Dissanayake, P.; Karunarathna, H.] Univ Coll Swansea, Coll Engn, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Brown, J.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England",Swansea University; NERC National Oceanography Centre,"Dissanayake, P (corresponding author), Univ Coll Swansea, Coll Engn, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",p.k.dissanayake@swansea.ac.uk,"Karunarathna, Harshinie/L-6945-2015; Dissanayake, Pushpa/AAY-3616-2021","Karunarathna, Harshinie/0000-0002-9087-3811; Dissanayake, Pushpa/0000-0003-2159-9940; Brown, Jennifer/0000-0002-3894-4651",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K013513/1]; Ensemble Estimation of Flood Risk in a Changing Climate project - British Council through their Global Innovation Initiative; EPSRC [EP/K013513/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K013513/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [noc010012] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Ensemble Estimation of Flood Risk in a Changing Climate project - British Council through their Global Innovation Initiative; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The work presented in this paper was carried out under the project FloodMEMORY (Multi-Event Modelling Of Risk and recoverY) funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the grant number EP/K013513/1.

NBS are discussed here at three different levels: (i) green building materials, including biocomposites with plant-based aggregates; (ii) green building systems, employed for the greening of buildings by incorporating vegetation in their envelope; and (iii) green building sites, emphasizing the value of vegetated open spaces and water-sensitive urban design. After introducing the central concepts of NBS and CE as they are manifested in the built environment, we examine the impacts of urban development and the historical use of materials, systems and sites which can offer solutions to these problems. In the central section of the paper we present a series of case studies illustrating the development and implementation of such solutions in recent years. Finally, in a brief critical analysis we look at the ecosystem services and disservices provided by NBS in the built environment, and examine the policy instruments which can be leveraged to promote them in the most effective manner - facilitating the future transition to fully circular cities.","[Pearlmutter, David] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Theochari, Dimitra] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl MSB Landschaftsarchitekt, Stournari & Patis 42 35, Athina 10682, Greece; [Nehls, Thomas] Inst Ecol Tech Univ, Ctr Innovat & Sci Bldg Greening CIBG, Chair Ecohydrol, Berlin, Germany; [Pinho, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, cE3c Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal; [Piro, Patrizia] Univ Calabria, Dept Civil Engn, Calabria, Italy; [Korolova, Alisa] Riga Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Riga, Latvia; [Papaefthimiou, Spiros] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Iraklion, Greece; [Garcia Mateo, Mari Carmen] MCG Res & Innovat Sustainabil Architecture Urban, Barcelona, Spain; [Calheiros, Cristina] Univ Porto, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMA, Porto, Portugal; [Zluwa, Irene; Pitha, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Inst Soil Bioengn & Landscape Construct, Vienna, Austria; [Schosseler, Paul] PositiveImpaKT Solarwind Windhof, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Florentin, Yaakov; Ouannou, Shahar] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Gal, Erez] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Struct Engn, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Aicher, Andreas] Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Bauhaus Inst Infrastruct Solut, Urban Water Management & Sanitat, Weimar, Germany; [Arnold, Killian] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Engn & Architecture, Luzern, Switzerland; [Igondova, Erika] Municipal Capital City Bratislava, Dept Urban Planning, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Pucher, Bernhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Inst Sanit Engn & Water Pollut Control, Vienna, Austria","Ben Gurion University; National Technical University of Athens; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Calabria; Riga Technical University; Technical University of Crete; Universidade do Porto; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Pearlmutter, D (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog, Beer Sheva, Israel.",davidp@bgu.ac.il,"Pearlmutter, David/F-1379-2012; Pucher, Bernhard/GMW-5829-2022; Calheiros, Cristina/A-1151-2011; Pinho, Pedro/D-1232-2010","Calheiros, Cristina/0000-0003-3159-3497; Piro, Patrizia/0000-0002-9202-6544; Pinho, Pedro/0000-0001-5571-9619; Garcia Mateo, Maria Carmen/0000-0002-7807-8380","COST Action [CA17133]; EU Horizon 2020 Programme; Italian National Operational Program 'Enterprise and Competitiveness' 2014-2020 ERDF -I AXIS `Innovation' -Action 1.1.3 `Support for the economic enhancement of innovation through experimentation and the adoption of innovative solutions in processes, produ; Italian Operational Project (PON) -Research and Competitiveness for the convergence regions 2007/2013 -I Axis `Support to structural changes' operative objective 4.1.1.1.

This framework is tested against an activity in two secondary schools in western Nepal. While the purpose of this activity is to generate locally relevant knowledge on the physical processes behind natural hazards, we concentrate here on its implementation, i.e., to obtain a better understanding of the dynamic of the activity and to learn how it should be implemented. We determined the social capital of secondary schools as a gateway to the local community: they provide a unique setting to bring different stakeholders together. We find that co-designing a teaching programme is an effective means of both complementing local curricula and ensuring continued buy-in of local stakeholders (i.e., teachers). Student engagement depends on the local relevance of teaching materials, with more holistic or global concepts, such as climate change of lesser importance. Our activity focused on rainfall, including student-led data collection. These rainfall data provide a very good fit to co-located rain gauge data, with an average difference on weekly readings of 11.8%, reducing to 8.3% when averaged over all student readings. The autonomous development of student-organized science clubs suggested that our original framework underestimated students' capacity to apply knowledge elsewhere creatively. These clubs may be used to obtain participant feedback to improve and tailor future activities. Quantitative assessment of long-term sustainability remains challenging, due in part to high levels of student turnover. We suggest that integrating scientists wherever possible within a school or local community has a direct and positive result on participant retention.","[Paul, Jonathan D.; Sah, Neeraj; Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Paul, Jonathan D.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, London, England; [Cieslik, Katarzyna] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Shakya, Puja; Parajuli, Binod Prasad] Pract Act Consulting South Asia, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Paudel, Saugat] United Nations Educ Sci & Cultural Org UNESCO, Paris, France; [Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci, Publ Adm & Policy, Wageningen, Netherlands",Imperial College London; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Cambridge; Wageningen University & Research,"Paul, JD (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England.;Paul, JD (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, London, England.",jonathan.paul@rhul.ac.uk,"Cieslik, Katarzyna/GXF-9020-2022; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022","Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Cieslik, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8240-0117","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Department for International Development (DfID) [NE/P000452/1]; NERC [NE/P000452/1, 2104361] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Department for International Development (DfID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),We acknowledge funding from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and Department for International Development (DfID) under contract NE/P000452/1 (Landslide EVO project).,,36,5,5,5,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

In this study, the central city of Zhengzhou, a central city in central China, was selected as the study area and the excessive demand for six ecosystem services, namely, air purification, flood regulation, heat regulation, hydrological regulation, CO2 sequestration and recreational services, was quantitatively evaluated. The entropy method was used to calculate the weights of various ecosystem services, and spatial overlay analysis was performed to obtain the comprehensive ecosystem service excessive demand. Finally, bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore the response of population density to comprehensive excessive demand for ESs. The results of this study indicate that: (1) The most prevalent need is for more CO2 regulation service throughout the study area. (2) Except for hydrological regulation service, the spatial distribution of the remaining highly excessive ecosystem service demands are mostly concentrated in old neighborhoods. (3) Of the six excessively demanded economic services, rainwater regulation obtained the greatest weight, reflecting the poor urban infrastructure configuration for countering the rapidly increasing threat of flooding caused by climate change in the city. (4) The comprehensive ecosystem service excessive demand results show that there are eight priority green infrastructure implementation blocks in the central city of Zhengzhou. (5) There were three agglomeration types between population density and comprehensive excessive demand for ESs: high-high type, low-high type and low-low type. The spatial distribution characteristics of population density and comprehensive ES demand are positively correlated. The results of this study could help to provide information for decision making when delineating the priority areas and types of green infrastructure implementation in developing cities.","[Wang, Dongmeng; Hu, Yongge; Tang, Puxia; Liu, Chang; Jiao, Jie; Kong, Dezheng; Lei, Yakai; Liu, Yiping] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Dept Landscape Architecture, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Kong, Weihan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Jiao, Jie] China Fortune Land Dev Co Ltd, Tower A,Gateway Plaza,18 Xiaguangli, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China; [Kovacs, Krisztina Filepne] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture Urban Planning & Gard, 29-43 Villanyi Ut, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary",Henan Agricultural University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Liu, YP (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Dept Landscape Architecture, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",dongmengwang@stu.henau.edu.cn; huyonggec@gmail.com; puxiatang@126.com; lunaliu0124@163.com; kongweihan@graduate.utm.my; guihuashi_jiaojie@126.com; filepne.kovacs.krisztina@uni-mate.hu; kdzhenau@henau.edu.cn; lykfjyl@163.com; lyphenau@henau.edu.cn,"Filepné Kovács, Krisztina/GXS-0572-2022","yongge, hu/0000-0002-9624-8574; Wang, Dongmeng/0000-0002-4178-9103; Liu, Chang/0000-0002-7085-7849",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31600579],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The National Natural Science Foundation of China Projects (31600579).,,39,1,1,28,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The interlinks among these organisms are dynamic, and this is the key to the management of forests ecosystems. Appropriate manipulation of forest dynamics allows the forest manager to produce timber and/or other commodities and environmental values obtainable from the forest. In this context, gaps in our knowledge of the management of boreal forests are closely related to our understanding of how boreal forest function in their natural state and to what extent their natural structure can be modified through management. Management of the boreal forests has mainly been developed with the aim of optimising timber production with only little concern for the other commodities and services obtainable from forest ecosystems and how to apply and combine different management actions operations in order to optimise forest production in terms of multi-goal management. In many parts of Europe, including the parts containing boreal forests, forest resources have substantially increased since the 1950s. Consequently, the age structure of forests would shift to being less optimal for forestry. Over Europe, increasing forest growth and accumulation of biomass in the forests appears to be unavoidable if the current trend in forestry and forest-based industries continues. Furthermore, the boreal forests in the European North art: expected to experience profound changes due to the elevation of temperature by 2-4 degrees C during the next 100 years with concurrent increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon. Temperature elevation will most probably promote forest growth and lead to changes in the tree-species composition. On the other hand, forests contain of a huge amount of carbon removed temporarily from the global carbon cycle and thereby from the atmosphere. To maintain and improve the capacity of the boreal forests in the European North to sequestrate carbon requires an appropriate balance between old-growth forests (capacity to store) and younger forests (capacity to sequestrate).

The ESA does this in part by requiring the designation of habitat within each listed species' range considered Critical to their recovery. Critics have argued that critical habitat (CH) designation creates Significant economic costs while contributing little to species recovery. Here we examine the effects of CH designation on land cover change. We find that the rate of change from 1992 to 2011 in developed (urban and residential) and agricultural land in CH areas was not significantly different compared to similar lands without CH designation, but still subject to ESA regulations. Although CH designation on average does not affect overall rates of land cover change, CH designation did slightly modify the impact of land cover change drivers. Generally, variation in land prices played a larger role in land cover decisions Within CH areas than in similar areas without CH designation. These trends suggest that developers may require a greater than typical expected return to development in CH areas to compensate for the higher risk of regulatory scrutiny. Ultimately, out results bring into question the very rationale for the CH regulation. If it is for the most part not affecting land cover choices, is CH helping species recover?

This work evaluates the physiological responses to incremental dosage of inorganic nitrogen (ammonium or nitrate) in Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis, two Antarctic vascular plants. Nitrogen fertilization increased shoot biomass, specially leaf number and leaf area in both species, however, D. antarctica biomass increased 6.5 fold with ammonium and 4.0 fold with nitrate; meanwhile C. quitensis biomass increased 1.6 and 1.8 fold with each nitrogen source, respectively, in both cases respect to control plants with only basal nitrogen supply. Apparent recovery efficiency of nitrogen or uptake efficiency exhibited strong differences among the two species. D. antarctica showed a 12% recovery for ammonium and 5% for nitrate, while C. quitensis was less efficient (4% and 3%, respectively). These results are also consistent with higher nitrogen use efficiency (higher biomass production and carbon assimilation by unit of nitrogen) in D. antarctica than in C. quitensis. This study contributes additional evidence about how interspecific differences between nitrogen use efficiencies of these vascular Antarctic plants may explain the faster population spread experienced by D. antarctica than C. quitensis in Antarctica.","[Rabert, Claudia; Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Lab Fisiol & Biol Mol Vegetal, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Reyes-Diaz, Marjorie; Alberdi, Miren] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Quim & Recursos Nat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Rabert, Claudia; Reyes-Diaz, Marjorie; Bravo, Leon A.; Alberdi, Miren] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechno, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Corcuera, Luis J.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de Concepcion,"Alberdi, M (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Quim & Recursos Nat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile.;Alberdi, M (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechno, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile.",miren.alberdi@ufrontera.cl,"Bravo, Leon/H-9251-2018; Bravo, León/AAO-8437-2020","Bravo, Leon/0000-0003-4705-4842; Bravo, León/0000-0003-4705-4842; Rabert, Claudia/0000-0001-8179-9245",Associative Research Program of CONICYT [CONICYT-PIA ART-1102]; INACH [AN-02-12],Associative Research Program of CONICYT; INACH,"This research was funded by The Associative Research Program of CONICYT (CONICYT-PIA ART-1102), INACH (AN-02-12).

While we are sympathetic to these ideas, we see an inherent tension between the discursive goals of academic scholarship and the everyday political world beyond it. Political discourse makes productive use of signifiers for which multiple meanings already exist, and gains power by exploiting their ambiguity. Academic discourse, on the other hand, seeks to clarify meanings through definitions and carefully delimited empirics in order to elucidate new ideas. We argue that the recognition and appreciation of these divergent discursive goals can serve efforts to make geographic scholarship more widely relevant if scholars make academic contributions iteratively parallel to political ones, rather than attempting to blend the two as a simultaneous practice. Scholarship that works to produce and utilise analytical terms of art within scholarly discourses to more accurately describe political processes can enable new critiques and the imagination of new political possibilities that are difficult to conceptualise from within everyday political discourses. The most strategic way for a scholar to make a political intervention, however, is to frame the suggestion within existing political discourses. Therefore, contributions in each discourse serve specific, unique purposes. The two discourses can also usefully play off of each other. When new political practices arise in the everyday political realm, new research projects can usefully evaluate their impacts to inform further suggestions for political interventions. We elucidate these ideas in three principles to guide an academic praxis of iterative parallelism for scholars interested in making political impacts alongside their scholarship.","[Williams, Olivia R.; Pierce, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Williams, OR (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ow09@my.fsu.edu,,"Williams, Olivia/0000-0003-4545-6354",,,,,38,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,JUN,2016,2,,,,222,228,,10.1111/area.12258,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12258,,,7,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,DV2TM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000382774400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we apply a state-of-the-art physical model for the upper atmosphere of the Archean Earth to study the effects of different atmospheric CO2/N-2 mixing ratios and solar activity levels on the escape of the atmosphere to space. We find that unless CO2 was a major constituent of the atmosphere during the Archean eon, enhanced heating of the thermosphere by the Sun's strong X-ray and ultraviolet radiation would have caused rapid escape to space. We derive lower limits on the atmospheric CO2 abundance of approximately 40% at 3.8billion years ago, which is likely enough to counteract the faint young Sun and keep the Earth from being completely frozen. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Sun was most likely born as a slow to moderate rotating young G-star to prevent rapid escape, putting essential constraints on the Sun's activity evolution throughout the solar system's history. In case that there were yet unknown cooling mechanisms present in the Archean atmosphere, this could reduce our CO2 stability limits, and it would allow a more active Sun.

The UHI of Brussels was estimated using both ground-based weather stations and remote sensing imagery combined with a land surface scheme that includes a state-of-the-art urban parameterization, the Town Energy Balance scheme. Analysis of urban warming based on the remote sensing method reveals that the urban bias on minimum air temperature is rising at a higher rate, 2.5 times (2.85 ground-based observed) more, than on maximum temperature, with a linear trend of 0.15 degrees C (0.19 degrees C ground-based observed) and 0.06 degrees C (0.06 degrees C ground-based observed) per decade respectively. The summer-mean urban bias on the mean air temperature is 0.8 degrees C (0.9 degrees C ground-based observed). The results based on remote sensing imagery are compatible with estimates of urban warming based on weather stations. Therefore, the technique presented in this work is a useful tool in estimating the urban heat island contamination in long time series, countering the drawbacks of an ground-observational approach.","[Hamdi, R.; Van de Vyver, H.] Royal Meteorol Inst, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium",Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium,"Hamdi, R (corresponding author), Royal Meteorol Inst, 3 Ave Circulaire, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.",rafiq.hamdi@oma.be,"hamdi, Rafiq/AAA-5719-2022","Van de Vyver, Hans/0000-0001-7142-4693",,,,,33,10,10,0,1,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1992-0628,1992-0636,,ADV SCI RES,Adv.

Single entrance caves double the access impact of each visitor. Visitors in tourist caves have direct physical effects such as the introduction of concrete and steel structures; transport of mud, dust, and nutrients; installation of lights and the exhalation of water vapour and carbon dioxide into the air. Indirect physical effects include alteration of the microclimate, both through physical modifications that change the ventilation regime and through the presence of visitors leading to changes in temperature, humidity and CO2, within the cave environment. Anthropomorphic changes to cave physical environments to aid access or to reduce backtracking can have adverse effects on the internal microclimate of cave systems with subsequent changes to the cave environment affecting the quality of decorations and cave art and the diversity of cave fauna. Although often stated that caves operate at or near a constant temperature, closer examination indicates that cave temperatures are neither static nor constant. The degree of variation depends largely on the structure and physical characteristics of the cave. Air temperature and humidity gradients between the inside and outside cave environment can result in air density differences, which create airflow. which will in turn affect the cave microclimate. As part of the development of a management framework for King Solomons Cave, Tasmania, a study of the microclimate was carried out on behalf of Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service. Analysis of the variables showed significant differences in air temperature within each site and between sites. These differences range from 4 degrees C variation at one site to 0 degrees C at another site. The data were used to model potential airflow between the cave and the external environment. Results indicate that part of the cave is dominated by airflow between the chimney and the cave entrance leading to microclimatic fluctuations, while stable climatic conditions occur at the end of the cave. Future management strategies that propose a passage from the chamber to the surface via the current end zone would create a potential for airflow induced microclimatic change, leading to a change in both the temperature and moisture regimes, necessitating the construction of an airtight double door system.

The purpose of this study was to test whether it is possible to determine the geographical area of wax collection and of the origin of the wooden support of the artefact, using the pollen imprint of plants and their related spatial ranges. Palynological analyses allowed the identification of 184 pollen grains belonging to 33 taxa. The reconstructed vegetation represents dry to humid meadows and pastures (e.g. Artemisia, Apiaceae, Campanula type, Poacaeae, Thalictrum, Asteroideae), wet areas (e.g. Alnus glutinosa type, Salix), woods or forests (e.g. Acer, Tilia, Picea, Castanea), shrublands (Ericaceae, Corylus) and arable fields or gardens (e.g. Cerealia type, Urtica, Plantago major). The Evangelistary cover has been attributed to the Ottonian art, developed especially in Germany, Eastern France and Northern Italy. On the basis of the palynological evidence from the beeswax, we can restrict the provenance area. A Northern Italian or Southern Prealpine origin seems likely since Castanea sativa was much more frequent south than north of the Alps. This geographic origin is corroborated by the material used for the support, made of Juglans regia (walnut), frequently planted in the region at that time. Moreover, the technique used to produce the wooden plate was widespread in Italy during the High Medieval period. The palynological evidence points to a very open, deeply human-affected environment, possibly around a city or a larger village in which the apiary was located. Inferences of this nature cannot be provided by other approaches such as wood or leather analyses; we thus conclude that palynology can provide unique insights into the origin of cultural treasures.","[Martinelli, Elisa] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Sci & Alta Tecnol, Via Valleggio 11, I-22100 Como, Italy; [Martinelli, Elisa; Castelletti, Lanfredo] Musei Civ Como, Lab Archeobiol, Como, Italy; [Castelletti, Lanfredo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Arte Archeol & Storia, Milan, Italy; [Oberli, Florencia; Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Oberli, Florencia; Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Maggioni, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Scuola Specializzaz Beni Stor Artist, Milan, Italy",University of Insubria; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Bern; University of Bern; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Martinelli, E (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Sci & Alta Tecnol, Via Valleggio 11, I-22100 Como, Italy.",elisa.martinelli@uninsubria.it,"Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013","Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144",Universita degli Studi dell'Insubria - Dipartimento di Scienza e Alta Tecnologia,Universita degli Studi dell'Insubria - Dipartimento di Scienza e Alta Tecnologia,"The investigations were part of a PhD project supported by a grant from Universita degli Studi dell'Insubria - Dipartimento di Scienza e Alta Tecnologia to EM.

It sets out most successful techniques across habitats and suggestions of better metrics to assess their success. Improvements in restoration approach are outlined, with a particular focus on selective breeding, using recent advancements in genetics. Furthermore, the assessment of ecosystem services, as a metric to determine restoration success on a spatiotemporal scale, is addressed in this article. As the concept of ecosystem services is more tangible for a nonscientific audience, evaluating restoration success in this manner has the potential to greatly contribute to raising awareness of environmental issues and to implement socioeconomic policies. Moreover, habitat-based restoration has been proven to be an effective tool to address the issue of ecosystem service sustainability and poverty alleviation. Appropriate conservation management, prior to the implementation of restoration activities, is crucial to create an environment in which restoration efforts are likely to succeed.","[Basconi, Laura] Ca Foscari Univ, Venice, Italy; [Cadier, Charles; Guerrero-Limon, Gustavo] UPV, MER Consortium, Bilbao, Spain; [Guerrero-Limon, Gustavo] Univ Liege, Ulg, Liege, Belgium",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Liege,"Basconi, L (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ, Venice, Italy.;Cadier, C; Guerrero-Limon, G (corresponding author), UPV, MER Consortium, Bilbao, Spain.;Guerrero-Limon, G (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Ulg, Liege, Belgium.",956409@stud.unive.it; c.cadier@griffith.edu.au; g.guerrero@doct.uliege.be,"Cadier, Charles/ABE-2263-2021","Cadier, Charles/0000-0001-7688-2036",,,,,169,18,19,4,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-20389-4; 978-3-030-20388-7,,,,2020,,,,,83,99,,10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_5,,,17,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,BQ2MU,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000582468900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study is to validate the observational and simulated sea-ice drift for the Laptev Sea Shelf region with in situ measurements from the winter of 2007/08. Several satellite remote-sensing data sets are first compared to mooring measurements and afterwards to the sea-ice drift simulated by the coupled sea-ice-ocean model. The different satellite products have a correlation to the in situ data ranging from 0.56 to 0.86. The correlations of sea-ice direction or individual drift vector components between the in situ data and the observations are high, about 0.8. Similar correlations are achieved by the model simulations. The sea-ice drift speed derived from the model and from some satellite products have only moderate correlations of about 0.6 to the in situ record. The standard errors for the satellite products and model simulations drift components are similar to the errors of the satellite products in the central Arctic and are about 0.03 m/s. The fast-ice parameterization implementation in the model was also successfully tested for its influence on the sea-ice drift. In contrast to the satellite products, the model drift simulations have a full temporal and spatial coverage and results are reliable enough to use as sea-ice drift estimates on the Laptev Sea Shelf.","[Rozman, Polona; Krumpen, Thomas; Gerdes, Ruediger; Koeberle, Cornelia] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine & Res, DE-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Hoelemann, Jens A.] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, DE-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lavergne, Thomas] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, NO-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Adams, Susanne] Univ Trier, Dept Environm Meteorol, DE-54286 Trier, Germany; [Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Spatial Oceanog Lab, FR-29280 Plouzane, France","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Universitat Trier; Ifremer","Rozman, P (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine & Res, Bussestr 24, DE-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",polona.rozman@awi.de,"Hoelemann, Jens/N-3608-2016; Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny/L-4153-2015; Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny/AAE-9430-2019; Krumpen, Thomas/D-5163-2011","Hoelemann, Jens/0000-0001-5102-4086; Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny/0000-0001-7819-7665; Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny/0000-0001-7819-7665; Krumpen, Thomas/0000-0001-6234-8756; Lavergne, Thomas/0000-0002-9498-4551","German Ministry for Education and Research [03G0639A]; Slovenian Academy of Science and Art; Municipality of Ljubljana, Slovenia; Otto Schmidt Laboratory for Polar and Marine Research, St. Petersburg, Russia","German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Slovenian Academy of Science and Art; Municipality of Ljubljana, Slovenia; Otto Schmidt Laboratory for Polar and Marine Research, St. Petersburg, Russia","This research was conducted as part of the German Ministry for Education and Research project Laptev Sea System (grant no. 03G0639A).

The case of the Ferlo area in Senegal,PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pastoralism; Diversification; Mobility; Security; Settlements,CATTLE; EAST,"Reducing vulnerability to hazards is a major challenge for pastoral settlements in the dry lands of sub-Saharan Africa. Accumulation of a stock of living animals is a major means of livelihood security that pastoralists use to cope with their constraints, amongst which is high environmental variability. Diversification and long-distance mobility are other means of livelihood security, implying specific family organization. We analysed the combination of these means in ensuring the livelihood security of 508 familial settlements in the rural community of Ferlo, Tessekre (Senegal). At least 40% of the settlements surveyed were small pastoral families, composed of one or two households with small herds (less than 50 cows and 50 sheep). Herds were the major means of livelihood security, but due to lack of a sufficient labour and other assets, the situation of these impoverished families was very precarious. In 28% of the settlements, families combined livestock, crops and non-farming activities as livelihood means. The remaining 32% of the settlements were pastoral settlements supported by large cattle herds and, in many cases, the production of Aid el Kebir rams (for the major Muslim religious event). Non-farming activities were also present in these settlements with large herds, especially activities in the livestock trade. Diversification can reinforce the function of herds as savings accounts and might also enable the pastoralists to invest in livestock activities. There were three groups of settlements based on the characterization of livelihood security strategies used by pastoral herders. Over time, pastoralists have to utilize several means of security to cope with climatic shocks such as droughts, and familial events such as the death of the familial chief. Family organization (dispersal or grouping), diversification and mobility are important means used to recover after major losses of animals.","[Manoli, Claire] Grp ESA, Anim Prod Dept, 55 Rue Rabelais, F-49007 Angers, France; [Ancey, Veronique] CIRAD, UMR ART Dev, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Corniaux, Christian] CIRAD, UMR SELMET, PPZS, Dakar, Senegal; [Ickowicz, Alexandre] CIRAD, UMR SELMET, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Dedieu, Benoit] INRA, SAD Div, Ctr Clermont Theix, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France; [Moulin, Charles Henri] Montpellier SupAgro, UMR SELMET, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Ecole Superieure d'Agriculture d'Angers (ESA); CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Manoli, C (corresponding author), Grp ESA, Anim Prod Dept, 55 Rue Rabelais, F-49007 Angers, France.",c.manoli@groupe-esa.com,,,'Livestock Climate and Society' project (ECLIS) [ANR-AA-VULNS-003],'Livestock Climate and Society' project (ECLIS),"This work has been funded by and conducted within the 'Livestock Climate and Society' project (ECLIS, ANR-AA-VULNS-003).

Several studies investigated the influence of individual parameters in the UHI phenomenon, on the other hand, an exhaustive study that quantifies the influence of each parameter in the resulting UHI is missing in the related literature. This paper proposes a new index aimed at quantifying the hazard of the absolute maximum UHI intensity in urban districts during the Summer season by taking all the parameters influencing the phenomenon into account. In addition, for the first time, the influence of each parameter has been quantified. City albedo and the presence of greenery represent the most important characteristics with an influence of 29% and 21%. Population density, width of streets, canyon orientation and building height has a medium influence of 12%, 10%, 9% and 8% respectively. The remaining parameters have an overall influence of 11%. These results are achieved by exploiting three synergistically related techniques: the Analytic Hierarchy Processes to analyse the parameters involved in the UHI phenomenon; a state-of-the-art technique to acquire a large set of data; and an optimization procedure involving a involving a Jackknife resampling approach to calibrate the index by exploiting the effective UHI intensity measured in a total of 41 urban districts and 35 European Cities.","[Sangiorgio, Valentino; Fiorito, Francesco] Politecn Bari, DICATECH, Via Edoardo Orabona 4, Bari, Italy; [Fiorito, Francesco; Santamouris, Mattheos] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, High Performance Architecture, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Politecnico di Bari; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Sangiorgio, V (corresponding author), Politecn Bari, DICATECH, Via Edoardo Orabona 4, Bari, Italy.",valentino.sangiorgio@poliba.it,"Sangiorgio, Valentino/AAL-6779-2021; Fiorito, Francesco/J-6353-2016; Mat, Santamouris/AAP-2836-2021","Sangiorgio, Valentino/0000-0002-7534-3177; Fiorito, Francesco/0000-0002-4554-738X; ",,,,,55,20,21,3,12,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,21-Oct,2020,1,,,,,,17913,10.1038/s41598-020-75018-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75018-4,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,OL2CG,33087829,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000585147800019,View Full Record in Web of Science

This literature-based review is done by searching the relevant papers on machine learning for COVID-19 from the databases of SCOPUS, Academia, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ResearchGate. This research attempts to discuss the significance of machine learning in resolving the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. This paper studied how machine learning algorithms and methods can be employed to fight the COVID-19 virus and the pandemic. It further discusses the primary machine learning methods that are helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. We further identified and discussed algorithms used in machine learning and their significant applications. Machine learning is a useful technique, and this can be witnessed in various areas to identify the existing drugs, which also seems advantageous for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This learning algorithm creates interferences out of unlabeled input datasets, which can be applied to analyze the unlabeled data as an input resource for COVID-19. It provides accurate and useful features rather than a traditional explicitly calculation-based method. Further, this technique is beneficial to predict the risk in healthcare during this COVID-19 crisis. Machine learning also analyses the risk factors as per age, social habits, location, and climate.","[Kushwaha, Shashi; Bagha, Ashok Kumar] Dr BR Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India; [Bahl, Shashi] IK Gujral Punjab Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Hoshiarpur Campus, Hoshiarpur 146001, India; [Parmar, Kulwinder Singh] IK Gujral Punjab Tech Univ, Dept Math Sci, Hoshiarpur Campus, Hoshiarpur 146001, India; [Javaid, Mohd; Haleem, Abid] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi 110025, India; [Singh, Ravi Pratap] Dr BR Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Dept Ind & Prod Engn, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar; I.

Historically, it has been regarded as comparatively resistant to various types of degradation in comparison to other plant components. However, studies of modern biogeochemical processes affecting organic carbon have demonstrated significant degradation and alteration of lignin as it is transported through the terrestrial biosphere, including phase changes from particulate to dissolved organic matter, mineral binding and decay due to biotic and abiotic processes. The literature of such topics is vast, however it is not particularly useful to Quaternary research without a comprehensive review to link our understanding of modern processes involving lignin to Quaternary environments. This review will outline the current state of the art in lignin phenol research that is relevant to the Quaternary scientist, and highlight the potential future applications for this important biomarker for vegetation change and terrestrial organic carbon cycling.

The main emphasis should be placed on the substitution of fossil fuels with agricultural by-products and other organic materials. Especially, the utilisation of fresh grass or grass silage of extensively cultivated farm land has great potential as an energy feedstock, as in agriculture this bio-resource is currently considered a waste material and is neither economically nor ecologically utilised in an efficient way. Additionally, the lawn-clippings, which are accumulating as communal and private waste could be used for energy production since many local authorities have problems with utilising this gramineous waste. Thus, for anaerobic digestion big amounts of grass biomass and lawn substrates are available from farmers and landscape conservation. In order to evaluate the suitability of this material for biogas plants in the first place, a detailed inventory needs to be conducted. This was exemplarily done for the Hamburg District Bergedorf (155 km(2)). The result shows that approximately 10,000 Mg/a of grass and lawn clippings could theoretically be made available. By laboratory investigations, in batch tests, the theoretical biogas potentials of selected grass and lawn substrates were determined. A statement about the suitability of the substrates for anaerobic digestion is made in this paper. The biogas potentials are between 325 and 720 standardized l per kg organic dry matter (l/kg ODM), depending on the sampling location, mowing time, grass species etc. For example, the biogas potentials for clippings from the dikes were in a range comparable with corn silage between 420 and 700 l/kg ODM. Additionally, the problem of seasonal accumulation of grass biomass including the influence of storage on the initial material is considered in this paper.","[Oldenburg, S.; Westphal, L.; Koerner, I.] Hamburg Univ Technol, Hamburg, Germany",Hamburg University of Technology,"Oldenburg, S (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Technol, Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1755-8336,,978-1-78466-036-9; 978-1-78466-034-5,WIT T STATE ART SCI,,,2015,,,,,1,13,,,,,,13,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Energy & Fuels,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,BG0WA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000386535700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study brings out the importance of probabilistic rainfall predictions for extreme heavy rainfall events. The study reveals that large-scale moisture convergence plays a significant role in the extreme rain of August 2018 and 2019. The extreme rainfall of August is associated with a westward-propagating barotropic Rossby wave. The study also demonstrates that ensemble forecasts of extreme rain by the state-of-the-art prediction systems of GFS, IFS, and NCUM are skillful for longer lead times compared to deterministic models and, therefore, can provide better early warnings to the society. During August 2018 and 2019 the southern state of India, Kerala, received unprecedented heavy rainfall, which led to widespread flooding. We aim to characterize the convective nature of these events and the large-scale atmospheric forcing, while exploring their predictability by three state-of-the-art global prediction systems: the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-based India Meteorological Department (IMD) operational Global Forecast System (GFS), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS), and the Unified Model-based NCUM being run at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF). Satellite, radar, and lightning observations suggest that these rain events were dominated by cumulus congestus and shallow convection with strong zonal flow leading to orographically enhanced rainfall over the Ghats mountain range; sporadic deep convection was also present during the 2019 event. A moisture budget analyses using the fifth major global reanalysis produced by ECMWF (ERA5) and forecast output revealed significantly increased moisture convergence below 800 hPa during the main rain events compared to August climatology. The total column-integrated precipitable water tendency, however, is found to be small throughout the month of August, indicating a balance between moisture convergence and drying by precipitation. By applying a Rossby wave filter to the rainfall anomalies it is shown that the large-scale moisture convergence is associated with westward-propagating barotropic Rossby waves over Kerala, leading to increased predictability of these events, especially for 2019. Evaluation of the deterministic and ensemble rainfall predictions revealed systematic rainfall differences over the Ghats mountains and the coastline. The ensemble predictions were more skillful than the deterministic forecasts, as they were able to predict rainfall anomalies (greater than three standard deviations from climatology) beyond day 5 for August 2019 and up to day 3 for 2018.","[Mukhopadhyay, Parthasarathi; Krishna, R.

As seaborne trade grows, the maritime sector is exploring the applicability of alternative powering options and ways to implement new technologies to increase safety and efficiency. Autonomous ships have recently generally been presented as more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than conventional manned ships. This paper deals with the feasibility of autonomous ro-ro passenger ships combined with the application of alternative power options, where the Croatian short-sea shipping sector is taken as an illustrative example. An analysis is conducted for heavy fuel oil, marine diesel oil, liquefied natural gas, methanol, electricity, and fossil and renewable hydrogen for three different ships operating on short, medium, and relatively long routes. For the ship lifetime of 20 years, through five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), the environmental and economic impact of the considered options is evaluated and the potential for their autonomous application is investigated. Taking into account the contrasts between conventional and autonomous ships, the differences in the costs for autonomous ship are outlined, and the KPIs of conventional and autonomous ro-ro passenger ships are compared. The results indicate that from an environmental and economic point of view, methanol and electricity-powered ships are the best option for all three routes. Regarding autonomous shipping, the ecological and economic benefits are obvious for all the considered power options and ships, except for the renewable hydrogen-powered ship operating on the longest route.","[Jovanovic, Ivana; Vladimir, Nikola; Percic, Maja; Korican, Marija] Univ Zagreb, Fac Mech Engn & Naval Architecture, Ivana Lucica 5, Zagreb 10002, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering & Naval Architecture,"Vladimir, N (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Mech Engn & Naval Architecture, Ivana Lucica 5, Zagreb 10002, Croatia.",nikola.vladimir@fsb.hr,,"Jovanovic, Ivana/0000-0002-7029-2526",Croatian Science Foundation under the project Green Modular Passenger Vessel for Mediterranean (GRiMM) [UIP-2017-05-1253]; Croatian Science Foundation,Croatian Science Foundation under the project Green Modular Passenger Vessel for Mediterranean (GRiMM); Croatian Science Foundation,"This research was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project Green Modular Passenger Vessel for Mediterranean (GRiMM), (Project No. UIP-2017-05-1253).

Based on a review of recent literature, this work provides a summary of the key environmental benefits of PCPs, in terms of stormwater runoff reduction, underground water quality improvement, heat-island effect mitigation, traffic noise reduction, and skid resistance improvement. The hydraulic performance of PCPs is determined by its mix design, pavement design, construction practice, and service environment. In general, it is difficult to simultaneously optimize the mechanical and durability properties and infiltration performance of PCPs. New technologies need to be developed to help improve the durability of PCPs without significantly increasing its maintenance requirements or sacrificing its infiltration properties. Freeze/thaw damage, deicer impacts, and clogging phenomenon still create bottleneck problems for the implementation of PCPs. The durability of PCPs in cold climates is governed by many factors, and advances could be made at many stages of its life cycle. Challenges remain in quantitative characterization of permeable concrete materials and in establishing quantitative relationships between physicochemical characteristics and performance of permeable concrete. Modeling and advanced characterization are expected to greatly advance the PCP technology.

It is often seen as a way of exercising the economic power in certain countries, and even as neocolonialism. Yet, the era of a globalizing and heavy interdependent world economy, especially in poorer countries, pushes the governments to invest in promoting the attraction of the FDI. The investors from their side chose the places where they assess to do business easier and generate more profit. Apart from the countries competing to provide better investment climate, the companies also compete with each other to seize the opportunity where to invest. Their decisions to invest are mainly based on favorable business environment of the hosting country. Rent-seeking behavior is generally believed to be a strategic deterrent of considerable FDI. However, this becomes an opportunity for certain investors to move in. Having realized this, instead of rent-seeking behavior, the bulk of FDI in Kosovo is occurring through joint ventures between local and foreign companies. Although in absolute terms this falls short in attracting less FDI than in the neighboring countries, it has some advantages in balancing the interests between local and foreign investors. One of these is that the foreign investor is not free to repatriate its full share of profit back to its own country or company headquarters, thus the money stays within the country where it was invested and circulates into the economy. How long this process may go and whether it can be competed or superseded by other forms of FDI, this paper comes with an assessment and recommendations on their perspective through three case studies: i) a telecommunication and internet provider company (IPKO), a bank (TEB), and a franchise (AB Lindex).","[Rrustemi, Visar] Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Pristina, Kosovo",,"Rrustemi, V (corresponding author), Univ Pristina, Fac Econ, Pristina, Kosovo.",visar.rrustemi@uni-pr.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,ISTANBUL KULTUR UNIV,ISTANBUL,"ATAKOY CAMPUS, BAKIRKOY, ISTANBUL, 34156, TURKEY",2146-5193,,,TURK ONLINE J DES AR,Turk.

The case study community includes eight low-impact, ecological, low carbon flats, one additional flat and four houses; occupied from 2010. The community was developed by United Welsh Housing Association and received a grant from the UK Government Department of Energy and Climate Change midway through construction, enabling eight flats to be upgraded to level four of the code for sustainable homes so incorporate ecological materials and systems. All the units use exhaust air source heat pumps (EASHPs) to provide their hot water and space heating needs; a system that has been reported to have significant costs for some housing association tenants across the UK. The project discussed in this paper builds upon earlier research undertaken by the same housing association led by the first author of this paper, which followed a 12 month detailed environmental and energy performance monitoring period, that indicated EASHPs could provide comfortable internal conditions at low monthly and annual costs [1]. Interim results from the first winter's (2013/14) monitoring at the Abertridwr project indicate that heating (space and water) are not excessive for a flat occupied by two adults and a house occupied by three adults and one child. Yet, there are potential issues of occupancy energy-use strategies disguising overall actual building performance as a function of problems for the designed building fabric and installed energy strategies. The monitoring continues until August 2014, when 12 months analysis will be undertaken before final reporting in September 2014. This paper will be of interest to academics, designers, contractors, environmental engineers and building owners. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Littlewood, J. R.; Davies, G.

This article aims to present the state-of-the-art on the use of the specific enthalpy of air as an indicator of heat stress in livestock animals. As a starting point, conceptual considerations were made about the connection between homoeothermic animals and the environment. Variables for heat stress evaluation based on psychrometric air properties are then described, including dry bulb temperature and relative humidity, which are often used microclimate variables, and the specific enthalpy of dry air, which acts as a thermal comfort index. Final considerations highlight the recent history of the use of specific enthalpy of air equations as indicators of heat stress in livestock animals, with the intention of better understanding the relationship between animals and the environment. As a conclusion, the specific enthalpy of air is recommended as an indicator in the assessment of livestock housing conditions as, unlike other indices, it is based on thermodynamic air properties and not on linear regressions.","[de Castro Junior, Sergio Luis; da Silva, Iran Jose Oliveira] Univ Sao Paulo, Livestock Environm Res Grp NUPEA, Dept Biosyst Engn LEB, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Ave Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"de Castro, SL (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Livestock Environm Res Grp NUPEA, Dept Biosyst Engn LEB, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr ESALQ, Ave Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",sergio.castro@usp.br; iranoliveira@usp.br,"; Oliveira Silva, Iran/C-5378-2013","de Castro Junior, Sergio Luis/0000-0002-1125-0430; Oliveira Silva, Iran/0000-0002-4416-8433",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Capes,Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Capes.,,137,8,8,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

Photo-catalytic coatings are also useful to reduce air pollutants. Many studies related to these topics have been carried out during the past few years, although the lighting implication of reflective coatings have hardly been explored. To investigate these aspects, reflective coatings were applied on portions of a road and intensely analyzed in a laboratory and on the field. The applied cool coatings were found to have much higher solar and lighting reflectance than the existing road, which lead to lower surface temperatures up to 9 degrees C. Non-significant variations of chromaticity coordinates were measured under different lighting conditions. However, these materials showed a relevant variation of directional properties depending on the lighting and observation conditions with respect to conventional pavements. The optical behavior of these materials affects the uniformity of visions for drivers and requires ad-hoc installation of light sources. On the other hand, potential energy savings of up to 75% were calculated for the artificial lighting of a reference road.","[Rossi, Giuseppe; Iacomussi, Paola] INRIM, Ist Nazl Ric Metrol, Str Cacce 91, I-10135 Turin, Italy; [Zinzi, Michele] ENEA, Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainable Econ D, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy",Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM); Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Iacomussi, P (corresponding author), INRIM, Ist Nazl Ric Metrol, Str Cacce 91, I-10135 Turin, Italy.",g.rossi@inrim.it; p.iacomussi@inrim.it; michele.zinzi@enea.it,,"Iacomussi, Paola/0000-0001-7781-1133",Italian Ministry of Economic Development; EMPIR program [16NRM02]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy); EMPIR program; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program","Part of this work was funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development in the framework of the Program RSE-Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico.

The aim of this article is to assess the general performance of the on-line coupling of the regional model COSMO to the global model ECHAM5. The cases are characterised by intense weather systems in Central Europe: a cold front passage in March 2010, a convective frontal event in July 2007, and the high impact winter storm Kyrill in January 2007. Simulations are performed with the new on-line-coupled model system and compared to classical, off-line COSMO hindcast simulations driven by ECMWF analyses. Precipitation observations from rain gauges and ECMWF analysis fields are used as reference, and both qualitative and quantitative measures are used to characterise the quality of the various simulations. It is shown that, not surprisingly, simulations with a shorter lead time generally produce more accurate simulations. Irrespective of lead time, the accuracy of the on-line and off-line COSMO simulations are comparable for the three cases. This result indicates that the new global and regional model system MECO(n) is able to simulate key mid-latitude weather systems, including cyclones, fronts, and convective precipitation, as accurately as present-day state-of-the-art regional weather prediction models in standard off-line configuration. Therefore, MECO(n) will be applied to simulate atmospheric chemistry exploring the model's full capabilities during meteorologically challenging conditions.","[Hofmann, C.] Univ Bonn, Inst Meteorol, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Hofmann, C.; Kerkweg, A.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys Atmosphare, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Wernli, H.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Joeckel, P.] Inst Phys Atmosphare, Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany",University of Bonn; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; ETH Zurich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Hofmann, C (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Meteorol, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",hofmach@uni-mainz.de,"Kerkweg, Astrid/AAE-9829-2019; Kerkweg, Astrid/AAV-9050-2020; Jöckel, Patrick/C-3687-2009; Wernli, Heini/F-1099-2016","Kerkweg, Astrid/0000-0002-8378-3498; Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394; Wernli, Heini/0000-0001-9674-4837","German Science Foundation (DFG) [WE 2943/4-1]; DWD; Max Planck-Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Meteorological Institute, University Bonn, Germany; CheSS by the DEISA (Distributed European Infrastructure for Supercomputer Applications) Extreme Computing Initiative (DECI); EU [RI-031513, RI-222919]","German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DWD; Max Planck-Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany; Meteorological Institute, University Bonn, Germany; CheSS by the DEISA (Distributed European Infrastructure for Supercomputer Applications) Extreme Computing Initiative (DECI); EU(European Commission)","This work was funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) within the project MACCHIATO (WE 2943/4-1).

Air pollutants emitted from exhaust gases of rice husk incineration lead to environmental damage, not only because of the influence on global environment and climate, when released into the atmosphere, but also on human health due to local air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively utilize waste rice husk and straw to reduce air pollutants. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand on the utilization of unused biomass instead of fossil oil fuel in combustors for farming-greenhouses' heating during the winter season. The increasing demand will increase the running costs. In general, since these combustors are small in size, there is a lack of regulations or laws (e. g. The Air Pollution Control Act and The Waste Disposal and Public Cleaning Law) in operation for their air pollution control. So far, small size combustors are characterized by their simplicity of structure and low costs. However, they emit visible black carbon ( elemental carbon) due to their poor combustion performance. In this study, the possibility of the substitution of fossil fuel by waste rice husk and rice straw is investigated in laboratory model combustion experiments. The emission behavior of harmful air pollutants emitted from rice husk and straw combustion is evaluated by measuring carbonaceous and ionic composition of suspended particulate matter in the exhaust gases. From the analytical results, particulate mass concentrations were found reduced substantially at high temperature combustion. From the results of this study, it can be suggested that stable combustion performance under suitable conditions is needed in order to control less air pollutants emitted from biomass fuel although small size combustors are still not regulated.","[Wang, Q.; Itoh, S.; Itoh, K.; Apaer, P.; Chen, Q.; Niida, D.; Mitsumura, N.; Animesh, S.; Sekiguchi, K.; Endo, T.] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Saitama, Japan",Saitama University,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Saitama, Japan.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1755-8336,,978-1-78466-036-9; 978-1-78466-034-5,WIT T STATE ART SCI,,,2015,,,,,55,65,,,,,,11,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,BG0WA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000386535700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Limited studies assessing integrated daily residential exposure to just one particle size fraction, ultrafine particles, show that the contribution of indoor sources ranged from 19% to 76%. This indicates a strong dependence on resident activities, source events and site specificity, and highlights the importance of indoor sources for total personal exposure. Further, it was assessed that 10-30% of the total burden of disease from particulate matter exposure was due to indoor-generated particles, signifying that indoor environments are likely to be a dominant environmental factor affecting human health. However, due to challenges associated with conducting epidemiological assessments, the role of indoor-generated particles has not been fully acknowledged, and improved exposure/risk assessment methods are still needed, together with a serious focus on exposure control.","[Morawska, L.; Buonanno, G.; Jayaratne, E.

Within this framework, this paper proposes a methodology of building a national inventory of potentially contaminated sites, which is based on activities of environmental relevance to the subsurface, i.e. soil and groundwater. As a next step, a screening system was developed, capable of estimating pollution potential of each site, for variable amount of available site-specific data. Depending on the nature of site data (actual or estimated) and the screening outcome, a site can be (i) delisted, (ii) assigned to an inactive list of potentially contaminated sites (iii) recommended for further desktop study and site visit or, (iv) recommended for both further study and in situ sampling. The advantage of the proposed approach is the identification of potentially contaminated sites on the basis of financial records linking activities with enterprises, which are more readily accessible compared with environmental records. The feasibility of transitioning from activities to sites has been demonstrated elsewhere. The present paper describes how data gaps are addressed by the site screening methodology with the aid of an application to a randomly selected real site in Greece.","[Pitsaki, K.; Boura, F.; Pantazidou, M.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Div Geotech Engn, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Boura, F.] Minist Environm Energy & Climate Change, Div Environm Planning, Water Management Sect, Athens 11251, Greece; [Katsiri, A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Div Water Resources & Environm Engn, Zografos 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Pantazidou, M (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Div Geotech Engn, 9 Iroon Polytechniou Str, Zografos 15780, Greece.",mpanta@central.ntua.gr,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,9,GLOBAL NETWORK ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,ATHENS,"30 VOULGAROKTONOU STR, ATHENS, GR 114 72, GREECE",1790-7632,,,GLOBAL NEST J,Glob.

To understand how leadership is conceptualized and analyzed in the environmental sciences and to discover what this research says about leadership outcomes, we conducted a review of environmental leadership research over the last 10 years. We found that much of the environmental leadership literature focuses on a few key individuals and desirable leadership competencies. The literature also reports that leadership is one of the most important of a number of factors contributing to effective environmental governance. Only a subset of the literature highlights interacting sources of leadership, disaggregates leadership outcomes, or evaluates leadership processes in detail. We argue that the literature on environmental leadership is highly normative. Leadership is typically depicted as an unequivocal good, and its importance is often asserted rather than tested. We trace how leadership studies in the management sciences are evolving and argue that, taking into account the state of the art in environmental leadership research, more critical approaches to leadership research in environmental science can be developed.","[Evans, Louisa S.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Evans, Louisa S.; Hicks, Christina C.; Cohen, Philippa J.; Mills, David J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Hicks, Christina C.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cohen, Philippa J.; Mills, David J.] WorldFish, Bayan Lepas, Malaysia; [Case, Peter; Prideaux, Murray] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Case, Peter] Univ W England, Sch Business, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Exeter; James Cook University; Stanford University; CGIAR; Worldfish; James Cook University; University of Bristol; University of West England,"Evans, LS (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",,"Hicks, Christina/M-6182-2015; Mills, David/GXF-1821-2022; Case, Peter/C-2797-2013","Hicks, Christina/0000-0002-7399-4603; Case, Peter/0000-0003-1214-8371; Mills, David/0000-0003-0181-843X; Cohen, Philippa/0000-0002-9987-1943; Prideaux, Murray/0000-0003-0929-233X",Collaboration Across Boundaries grant from James Cook University; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research grant [FIS/2012/074]; CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems,Collaboration Across Boundaries grant from James Cook University; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research grant(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems(CGIAR),This work was funded by a Collaboration Across Boundaries grant from James Cook University.

To evaluate the useful energy demand for space heating purposes from an energy economics perspective norm-based bottom-up models are applied that capture the energy-related characteristics of buildings. As electricity demand per household attributed to appliances and lighting has increased substantially in the EU27 during the last two decades (+50 %), the question arises whether the static norm-based approach is underestimating the contribution of internal heat gains to covering useful energy demand. To analyze the impact of dynamic internal heat gains in the residential sector, a bottom-up vintage model is applied that covers the EU27 building stock with a country-specific typology. This means the internal heat gains are time-dependent and heat dissipation is distinguished by appliances, lighting and residents. The analysis consists of two explorative scenarios for the residential building stock of EU27 until 2050. A reference scenario represents the static norm-based modelling of internal heat gains while the second scenario considers their dynamic development. The study reveals that the norm-based approach underestimates the contribution of internal heat gains to covering thermal heat demand. Comparing the countries throughout the EU27 climate zones indicates that on average the static and the dynamic share of internal heat gains differ in a range from 20-70 % by 2050. Especially in the case of nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB), e.g. with 30 kWh/m(2)*a useful energy demand, the internal heat gains are about 10-15 % higher using the dynamic approach compared to the norm-based approach.

However, close scrutiny of the few available tree-ring chronologies and radiocarbon-dated sequences composing the IntCal13 C-14 calibration curve indicates significant weakness in C-14 calibration across key periods of the LGIT. Here, we present a decadally resolved atmospheric C-14 record derived from New Zealand kauri spanning the Lateglacial from similar to 13,100-11,365 cal BP. Two floating kauri C-14 time series, curve-matched to IntCal13, serve as a C-14 backbone through the Younger Dryas. The floating Northern Hemisphere (NH) C-14 data sets derived from the YD-B and Central European Lateglacial Master tree-ring series are matched against the new kauri data, forming a robust NH C-14 time series to similar to 14,200 cal BP. Our results show that IntCal13 is questionable from similar to 12,200-11,900 cal BP and the similar to 10,400 BP C-14 plateau is approximately 5 decades too short. The new kauri record and repositioned NH pine C-14 series offer a refinement of the international 14C calibration curves IntCal13 and SHCal13, providing increased confidence in the correlation of global paleorecords.","[Hogg, Alan] Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Lab, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Southon, John; Noronha, Alexandra] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Turney, Chris; Palmer, Jonathan] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk; Staff, Richard] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Fenwick, Pavla] Gondwana Tree Ring Lab, POB 14, Canterbury 7546, New Zealand; [Boswijk, Gretel] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Buntgen, Ulf; Reinig, Frederick] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Friedrich, Michael; Kromer, Bernd] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, INF 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Friedrich, Michael] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Bot, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Helle, Gerhard] GFZ German Res Ctr GeoSci, Dendrochronol Lab, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Hughen, Konrad] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jones, Richard] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Reynard, Linda] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wacker, Lukas] HPK, Lab Ion Beam Phys, H29,Otto Stern Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Waikato; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Oxford; University of Auckland; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University Hohenheim; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Exeter; Harvard University","Hogg, A (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Lab, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand.;Southon, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",alan.hogg@waikato.ac.nz; jsouthon@uci.edu,"Hogg, Alan/M-8427-2014; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/A-3277-2012; Reynard, Linda M./AFQ-9581-2022; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/AAQ-2227-2021; Turney, Chris S M/P-8701-2018; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Palmer, Jonathan G/J-7834-2012","Hogg, Alan/0000-0002-4001-9027; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Reynard, Linda M./0000-0001-5732-1532; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Turney, Chris S M/0000-0001-6733-0993; Palmer, Jonathan G/0000-0002-6665-4483; Boswijk, Gretel/0000-0003-3583-7575; Friedrich, Michael/0000-0003-1614-0959; Staff, Richard/0000-0002-8634-014X; Helle, Gerhard/0000-0001-9988-6638","Ministry for Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) [PROP-20224-SFK-UOA]; Royal Society of New Zealand grant; Australian Research Council [FL100100195, DP0664898]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H009922/1, NE/I007660/1, NER/A/S/2001/01037, NE/H007865/1]; NERC [NE/H007865/1, NE/H009922/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Ministry for Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE); Royal Society of New Zealand grant(Royal Society of New Zealand); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank Mr A Crawford who owns Towai Farm for access to the site and Mr N Parker for providing the wood.

Yet, state-of-the-art models exhibit significant biases in their representation of the complex ocean-sea ice interactions taking place in the MIZ. Here, we present the development of a new coupled sea ice-ocean wave model. This setup allows us to investigate some of the key processes at play in the MIZ. In particular, our coupling enables us to account for the wave radiation stress resulting from the wave attenuation by sea ice and the sea ice lateral melt resulting from the wave-induced sea ice fragmentation. We find that, locally in the MIZ, the ocean surface waves can affect the sea ice drift and melt, resulting in significant changes in sea ice concentration and thickness as well as sea surface temperature and salinity. Our results highlight the need to include wave-sea ice processes in models used to forecast sea ice conditions on short timescales. Our results also suggest that the coupling between waves and sea ice would ultimately need to be investigated in a more complex system, allowing for interactions with the ocean and the atmosphere.","[Boutin, Guillaume; Lique, Camille; Ardhuin, Fabrice; Talandier, Claude; Accensi, Mickael; Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, IUEM, IFREMER, CNRS,IRD,Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, Brest, France; [Rousset, Clement] Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN IPSL, CNRS IRD UPMC MNHN, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Boutin, G (corresponding author), Univ Bretagne Occidentale, IUEM, IFREMER, CNRS,IRD,Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale, Brest, France.",boutinguillaume87@gmail.com,"Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny/L-4153-2015; Boutin, Guillaume/A-8773-2019; Lique, Camille/L-5543-2015; Ardhuin, Fabrice/A-1364-2011; Accensi, Mickael/L-4002-2015","Girard-Ardhuin, Fanny/0000-0001-7819-7665; Boutin, Guillaume/0000-0002-1689-9351; Lique, Camille/0000-0002-8357-4928; Ardhuin, Fabrice/0000-0002-9309-9681; Accensi, Mickael/0000-0003-1125-7568","DGA; ANR [ANR-14-CE01-0012 MIMOSA, ANR-10-LABX-19-01]; EU-FP7 [SWARP 607476]; ONR [N0001416WX01117]; CMEMS (grant project ArcticMix); CMEMS (grant project WIzARd)",DGA; ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); EU-FP7(European Commission); ONR(Office of Naval Research); CMEMS (grant project ArcticMix); CMEMS (grant project WIzARd),"This research has been supported by the DGA, the ANR (grant nos.

A renewed global research effort is being made to formulate and improve nonhydrostatic models. In this paper, the status of numerical atmospheric modelling research in South Africa is briefly reviewed. We then report on the development of a new, nonhydrostatic atmospheric model at the University of Pretoria. The dynamic kernel of the model is based on a novel, split semi-Lagrangian formulation of a set of quasi-elastic equations in a terrain-following vertical coordinate based on the full pressure field. The main features of the model dynamics and numerics are discussed, and it is noted that the governing equation set presented here has not been applied in atmospheric modelling before. The model may be used to perform state-of-the-art research in numerical model development, for instance, for the derivation of new equation sets, numerical techniques and vertical coordinate systems. The model's ability to simulate highly nonlinear and nonhydrostatic flow is illustrated by means of a convective bubble experiment, where an updraft interacts with vertical shear of the horizontal wind. This experiment illustrates the potential of the new model to be used in the study of thunderstorm dynamics.","Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; CSIRO Marine Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia",University of Pretoria; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Engelbrecht, FA (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",francois.engelbrecht@up.ac.za,"McGregor, John L/C-6646-2012",,,,,,74,9,9,0,3,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Analysis were performed on fine (4-11 mu m) and coarse (63-90 mu m) quartz extracts using the single aliquot regenerative (SAR) optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating protocol. Laboratory generated SAR dose response curves in the high dose range (5 kGy for fine quartz and 2 kGy for coarse quartz) were investigated by employing a test dose of either 17 or 170 Gy. The results confirm the previously reported different saturation characteristics of the two quartz fractions, with no evident dependency of the equivalent dose (D-e) on the size of the test dose. The OSL SAR ages are discussed and compared to the previously obtained results on quartz and feldspars. The previous reports regarding the chronological discrepancy between the two quartz fractions are confirmed. However, while previous investigations on other sites concluded that this discrepancy appears only above equivalent doses of about 100 Gy, here fine grain quartz ages underestimate coarse quartz ages starting with equivalent doses as low as around 50 Gy.","[Groza-Sacaciu, Stefana-M.; Timar-Gabor, Alida] Babes Bolyai Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Bionanosci, Cluj Napoca 400271, Romania; [Groza-Sacaciu, Stefana-M.; Timar-Gabor, Alida] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Cluj Napoca 400294, Romania; [Panaiotu, Cristian] Univ Bucharest, Fac Phys, Magurele 077125, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; University of Bucharest,"Timar-Gabor, A (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Inst Bionanosci, Cluj Napoca 400271, Romania.;Timar-Gabor, A (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Cluj Napoca 400294, Romania.",smgroza@yahoo.com; cristian.panaiotu@gmail.com; alida.timar@ubbcluj.ro,"Panaiotu, Cristian George/C-7599-2009","Panaiotu, Cristian George/0000-0001-9332-8926; Timar-Gabor, Alida/0000-0003-4799-3866",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ERC-2015-STG [678106],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ERC-2015-STG(European Research Council (ERC)),This research was funded the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ERC-2015-STG (Grant Agreement No. 678106).,,69,8,9,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2409-9279,,METHOD PROTOCOL,Methods Protoc.,MAR,2020,1,,,,,,19,10.3390/mps3010019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mps3010019,,,23,Biochemical Research Methods,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,UU7KR,32121026,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000698975300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

This results in potentially defective forecasts of synoptic-scale dynamics in regions of high MCS activity. Here, we quantify this error by comparing simulations performed with a very large-domain, convection-permitting NWP model to two operational global NWP models relying on parameterized convection. We use one month's worth of daily forecasts over Western Africa and focus on land regions only. The convection-permitting model matches remarkably well the statistics of westward-propagating MCSs compared to observations, while the convection-parameterizing NWP models misrepresent them. The difference in the representation of MCSs in the different models leads to measurably different synoptic-scale forecast evolution as visible in the wind fields at both 850 and 650 hPa, resulting in forecast differences compared to the operational global NWP models. This is quantified by computing the correlation between the differences and the number of MCSs: the larger the number of MCSs, the larger the difference. This fits the expectation from theory on MCS-mean flow interaction. Here, we show that this effect is strong enough to affect daily limited-area forecasts on very large domains.","[Peters, Karsten; Hohenegger, Cathy] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Klocke, Daniel] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany; [Peters, Karsten] Deutsch Klimarechenzentrum GmbH DKRZ, Bundesstr 45a, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Peters, K (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",peters@dkrz.de,"Peters-von Gehlen, Karsten/A-3164-2012","Peters-von Gehlen, Karsten/0000-0003-0158-2957; Klocke, Daniel/0000-0001-7405-013X",BMVI(Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure),BMVI(Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure),"This research was carried out in the Hans Ertel Center for Weather Research (HErZ).

Because very few literature on the usage of moss in green roof implementation is available, this paper introduces the thermal performance of Sunagoke (Racomitrium Canescens) moss green roof in addressing urban heat island effect. In addition, the insights of evaporation cooling on Sunagoke moss are also discussed. The experiments were performed inside the Artificial Climate Chamber with the ambient temperature and humidity set to 30 C and 70% RH, respectively, to simulate a typical summer environment in Japan. The effects of convection heat transfer by means of wind velocity and irradiance were tested on a dry Sunagoke model house, a moist Sunagoke model house, and a control model house. By altering the wind velocity from 0 to 3 m/s, the convection heat was found to dominate the entire heat transfer in dry roof surfaces that lack evaporation (dry Sunagoke and control model house). In contrast, for the whole heat transfer process, the latent heat of moist Sunagoke green roof governed and diverted 70% by no-wind convection and 91% by wind-induced convection. The latent and convection heat of moist Sunagoke green roof were clarified to have inverse correlation to each other, and the diversion rose upon reaching wind-induced convection state. In terms of normalised temperature differences, the influences of the roof and atmosphere were balanced on dry Sunagoke moss in wind-induced convection, as the temperature ratios were close to 1. However, on moist Sunagoke moss, the evaporation consumed most of the heat, hence, the temperature ratio was lower than the other two model houses. The ratio further diminished near 0 in wind-induced convection. Nevertheless, the effects of wind velocity above 2 m/s were clarified identical, since no significant changes were found in the convection heat transfer coefficient, surface temperature, conduction heat flux, and interior temperature afterwards.

Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals.

While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems.

However, defining the reference state is challenging due to a wide range of uncertainties related to natural variability and measurement error in data, as well as ecological understanding. This study propose a novel probabilistic approach combining historical monitoring data and ecological understanding to estimate the uncertainty associated with the boundary value of an ecological indicator between good and poor environmental states. Bayesian inference is used to estimate the epistemic uncertainty about the true state of an indicator variable during an historical reference period. This approach replaces the traditional boundary value with probability distribution, indicating the uncertainty about the boundary between environmental states providing a transparent safety margin associated with the risk of misclassification of the indicator's state. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to a time-series of an ecological status indicator, 'Abundance of coastal key fish species', included in HELCOM's Baltic Sea regional status assessment. We suggest that acknowledgement of the uncertainty behind the final classification leads to more transparent and better-informed decision-making processes.","[Laurila-Pant, Mirka] Univ Helsinki, Fisheries & Environm Management Grp, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Viikinkaari 2, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Mantyniemi, Samu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latolcartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Ostman, Orjan; Olsson, Jens] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Skolgatan 6, S-74242 Oregrund, Sweden; [Uusitalo, Laura] Finnish Environm Inst, Programme Environm Informat, Latokartanonkaari 11, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Lehikoinen, Annukka] Univ Helsinki, Kotka Maritime Res Ctr, Fisheries & Environm Management Grp, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Keskuskatu 10, Kotka 48100, Finland",University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Helsinki,"Laurila-Pant, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fisheries & Environm Management Grp, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Viikinkaari 2, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mirka.laurila-pant@helsinki.fi,,"Ostman, Orjan/0000-0002-1930-0148; Lehikoinen, Annukka/0000-0001-8210-5778; Uusitalo, Laura/0000-0002-5143-5253","University of Helsinki's DENVI Doctoral program; project Creative adaptation to wicked socio environmental disruptions (WISE) - Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [312625]; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management projects [1121-208, 1411-19, 00735-20]; Quantitative Fish and Fisheries Ecology at SLU",University of Helsinki's DENVI Doctoral program; project Creative adaptation to wicked socio environmental disruptions (WISE) - Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management projects; Quantitative Fish and Fisheries Ecology at SLU,"The work of M.L-P. have been supported by the University of Helsinki's DENVI Doctoral program.

These infectious illnesses are emerging or resurging as a result of several factors, such as changes in climate, in public health and demography policy, as well as the spread of resistance to insecticide and drug, and genetic changes in pathogens. Integrated prevention strategies must be developed and implemented in endemic disease areas to reverse the trend of emergent/resurgent water- and vector-borne diseases. With this perspective porphyrins and their analogues, that have been shown to act as very efficient photosensitising agents against a broad number of microbial pathogens (bacteria, fungi, protozoa) and parasitic animals, could represent an important tool for the prevention and control of these pathologies. The application of photosensitised processes can be exploited to address environmental problems of high significance, including the decontamination of waste waters, the disinfection of fish-farming tanks and the control of populations of noxious insects. Such diversified applications take advantage of the availability of a truly large number of porphyrin derivatives with chemical structures which can be tailored to comply with the physical and chemical properties, as well as the biological features of several milieus. In addition, the property typical of porphyrins to absorb essentially all the wavelengths in the sun emission spectrum allows the promotion of processes largely based on natural resources with significant energy saving and low impact on the ecosystems.","[Coppellotti, O.; Fabris, C.; Soncin, M.; Magaraggia, M.; Camerin, M.; Jori, G.; Guidolin, L.] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Coppellotti, O (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via U Bassi 58-B, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",olimpia.coppellotti@unipd.it,,,,,,,110,17,17,0,51,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",0929-8673,1875-533X,,CURR MED CHEM,Curr.

Such prediction is a high priority research challenge, specifically in highly urbanized areas like Mumbai, India, which is extremely prone to urban flooding. Here, we attempt to develop an algorithm based on a machine learning technique, support vector machine (SVM), to predict extreme rainfall with a lead time of 6-48 h in Mumbai, using mesoscale (20-200 km) and synoptic scale (200-2,000 km) weather patterns. The underlying hypothesis behind this algorithm is that the weather patterns before (6-48 h) extreme events are significantly different from those of normal weather days. The present algorithm attempts to identify those specific patterns for extreme events and applies SVM-based classifiers for extreme rainfall classification and prediction. Here, we develop the anomaly frequency method (AFM), where the predictors (and their patterns) for SVM are identified with the frequency of high anomaly values of weather variables at different pressure levels, which are present before extreme events, but absent for non-extreme conditions. We observe that weather patterns before the extreme rainfall events during nighttime (1800 to 0600Z) is different from those during daytime (0600 to 1800Z) and, accordingly, we develop a two-phase support vector classifier for extreme prediction. Though there are false alarms associated with this prediction method, the model predicts all the extreme events well in advance. The performance is compared with the state-of-the-art statistical technique fingerprinting approach and is observed to be better in terms of false alarm and prediction.","[Nayak, Munir Ahmad; Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Nayak, Munir Ahmad] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Cornell University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",subimal@civil.iitb.ac.in,"Nayak, Munir/J-6543-2014","Ghosh, Subimal/0000-0002-5722-1440","Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India [23/INCOH-66/2011-RD/2066-2076]","Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India(Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation)","The authors sincerely thank the anonymous reviewer for reviewing the manuscript and providing critical comments to improve this.

This paper reviews current retrofit methodologies with a focus on the contrast between data-driven approaches that utilize measured building data, acquired through either 1) on-site sensor deployment or 2) from pre-aggregated national repositories of building data. Differentiating between 1) bottom-up approaches that can be divided into white-, grey- and black-box modelling, and 2) top-down approaches that utilize analytical methods of clustering and regression, this paper presents the state-of-the-art in current building retrofit methodologies; outlines their strengths and weaknesses; briefly highlights the challenges in their implementation and concludes by identifying a hybrid approach - of lean in-situ measurements supplemented by modelling for verification - as a potential strategy to develop and implement more robust retrofit methodologies for the building stock.","[Deb, C.; Schlueter, A.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Technol Architecture, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Deb, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Technol Architecture, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Zurich, Switzerland.",deb@arch.ethz.ch,"Schlueter, Arno/CAF-1531-2022","Schlueter, Arno/0000-0003-4999-2218; Deb, Chirag/0000-0001-9634-6441",,,,,99,28,28,8,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Through a new, compulsory subject of Informatics and ICT, the aim is to develop digital literacy across all school subjects, and computational thinking. Computational thinking will be implemented in the curriculum of pre-primary, primary, lower and upper secondary schools, and in teacher education at all faculties of education in the Czech Republic. To ensure readiness for the implementation of the new subject, it has been necessary to prepare and develop a set of learning materials for pupils and teaching guidelines for teachers. These textbooks focus on robotics, programming (Scratch, Python), and theoretical concepts from Informatics. This paper describes a qualitative study aimed at identifying key factors influencing lower secondary pupils' success in completing some activities related to programming in Scratch. Data were gathered from the feedback of five teachers and 121 pupils at five lower secondary schools, and from the researchers' observation reports from school visits. The key findings of the study showed that pupils' success programming in Scratch depends on their motivation to the theme of the Scratch activity, a positive climate in the learning environment, peer collaboration, and freedom in ways to learn new concepts and to find solutions to given problems. Programming in Scratch is promising in developing pupils' creativity and decision-making in problem-solving. Additionally, a stress-free, non-threatening, learning environment, where the teacher appreciates the enthusiasm, thinking process and effort of pupils to find an original solution has a positive influence on their success.","[Cernochova, Miroslava] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Educ, Magdaleny Rettigove 4, Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Selcuk, Hasan] Univ Latvia, Fac Educ Psychol & Art, Imantas 7 Linija 1, Riga, Latvia; [Cerny, Ondrej] Gymnazium Sos Dr V Smejkala, Stavbaru 5, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; University of Latvia,"Cernochova, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Educ, Magdaleny Rettigove 4, Prague 1, Czech Republic.",miroslava.cernochova@pedf.cuni.cz,"Selcuk, Hasan/GQQ-5483-2022; Cernochova, Miroslava/A-1825-2017","Selcuk, Hasan/0000-0001-8098-1088; Cernochova, Miroslava/0000-0003-1836-6978; Cerny, Ondrej/0000-0002-5335-5169",PROGRES Q17 P.riprava u.citele a u.citelska profese v kontextu v.edy a vyzkumu,PROGRES Q17 P.riprava u.citele a u.citelska profese v kontextu v.edy a vyzkumu,This study is a result of the research funded by the PROGRES Q17 P.riprava u.citele a u.citelska profese v kontextu v.edy a vyzkumu.,,19,0,0,4,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-63212-0; 978-3-030-63211-3,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2020,,,,,119,129,,10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_10,,,11,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BS8UQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000777626400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The use of longer and complex operative chains, with centripetal and recurrent knapping, adapted to different raw materials, created long useful edges, converging in a functional distal end. How and why these handaxes vary has been the subject of intense debates. Britain provides a clearly defined region at the edge of the hominin occupied world for discussing variation in Acheulean assemblages. The environmental changes from MIS 15 to MIS 11 are significant in understanding population change, with probable breaks in evidence during MIS 14 and MIS 12, followed by several sites during the long stable climate of MIS11c. In this latter period, different Acheulean technological expressions appear to coexist in Britain. This paper draws together different studies, combining technology and geometric morphometrics to analyze handaxes from six British sites: Brandon Fields, Boxgrove (Q1B), High Lodge, Hitchin, Swanscombe (UMG), and Elveden. Compared to the earlier Acheulean of MIS 15, the assemblages of MIS 13 show increased standardization and the use of soft hammer percussion for thinning mid-sections and butts of tools, or sharpening tips through tranchet removals. Although there is regional population discontinuity through MIS12 there is no evidence of a marked change in technology after this glacial period.

From MIS11 there appear to be distinctive localized traditions of manufacture, which suggest that a recognition of place and territories had developed by this time.

The biomass consists mainly of residual forest biomass derived from forestry operations and wood waste from industrial processes, in particular paper and pulp industry. Its quality and composition is influenced by the presence of moisture and inert fragments, the latter being incorporated during collection or as a consequence of adherence to the biomass prior to collection. This variability presents difficulties for the thermal power plants; besides being an additional operational cost, the presence of large amounts of water and inerts in biomass used as a fuel, can result in problems related to the instability of the combustion and the accumulation of ash or rock that have to be removed and discarded. The objective of this paper is to review the main parameters that influence the quality of biomass, while analysing the current state-of-the-art power generation from the biomass sector in Portugal, as a new contribution to earlier studies.","[Nunes, L.

Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys, and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, state-of-the-art reanalyses, and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization, and other structural biases. The resulting 95% uncertainties are near 0.05 degrees C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15 degrees C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date) and conclude with 86% likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).","[Lenssen, Nathan J.

To drive this transition, the deployment of innovative energy technologies is necessary and required. Thermal energy storage has a prominent role to play in this context as it can help us manage the demand and generation of energy that are currently out of phase. Even though there exist many valuable review contents in the literature addressing various heat storage methods separately, the need for a concise and comprehensive source of information to present related ideas and applications is still sensed. The overall aim of the present review paper after introducing the thermal energy storage materials and working procedure is to investigate significant research contributions focusing on, and linking both practical applications and scientific aspects of the problem. Articles reporting original, cutting-edge research with experimental, theoretical, and numerical findings unraveling pertinent aspects of novel thermal energy storage systems are considered. Furthermore, their design, characterization, optimization considerations, and integration challenges have been addressed in a multi scale manner from component to system level to present a broader standpoint in this field of science. Ultimately, short-term and long-term thermal energy storage processes have been discussed as well as the capability of thermal energy storage technology in the thermal management of batteries and high-heat-flux electronic devices has been revealed.","[Sadeghi, Gholamabbas] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol ET, Dept Thermal & Fluid Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Sadeghi, G (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol ET, Dept Thermal & Fluid Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",g.sadeghi@utwente.nl,,,,,,,354,15,15,40,63,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8297,2405-8289,,ENERGY STORAGE MATER,Energy Storage Mater.,APR,2022,,,,,192,222,,10.1016/j.ensm.2022.01.017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2022.01.017,,,31,"Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,0O5MS,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000783570800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For compliance it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the possible spread, fate and impacts of any leaked CO2, and also the ability to detect and quantify any leakage. Over the past decade, a number of field scale CO2 release experiments have been conducted around the world to address many of the uncertainties regarding the characteristics of near-surface expression of CO2 in terms of the impact and quantitation of CO2 leaks. In these experiments, either free phase or dissolved CO2 is injected and released into the shallow subsurface so as to artificially simulate a CO2 leak into the near-surface environment. The experiments differ in a number of ways, from the geological conditions, surface environments, injection rates and experimental set-up-including the injection and monitoring strategy. These experiments have provided abundant information to aid in the development of our scientific understanding of environmental impacts of CO2 while assessing state of the art monitoring techniques. We have collated a global dataset of field-scale shallow controlled release experiments that have released CO2 at depths shallower than 25 m. The dataset includes 14 different field experiment locations, of which nine intended to release CO2 to surface, and the remaining sites intended for CO2 to remain in the shallow subsurface. Several release experiments have been conducted at half of these sites, and so in total, 42 different CO2 release tests have taken place at the 14 sites we examine. These experiments and their results are scrutinised to establish: (i) the range of experimental approaches and environments explored to date (such as the environment, subsurface conditions, injection strategy and whether gaseous or dissolved CO2 were injected and in what quantities); (ii) the range of CO2 injection and surface release rates at these experiments; (iii) the collective learnings about the surface and subsurface manifestation of the CO2 release, the spread and fate of the CO2, rates of CO2 flux to surface, and methods of measuring these; (iv) how successfully current approaches can detect and quantify CO2. This allows us to highlight where uncertainties remain and identify knowledge gaps that future experiments should seek to address. We also draw on the collective experiences to identify common issues or complications, and so recommend best practice' guidelines for experiment design and reporting at future CO2 release experiments.(C) 2017 The Authors.

Especially in wetland mapping, studies have relied largely on vegetation indices and hyperspectral data to capture vegetation attributes. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of a concurrently acquired very high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral and lidar data set at the peak of aquatic vegetation growth in a nature reserve at Lake Balaton, Hungary. The aim was to examine to what degree the different remote-sensing information sources (i.e. visible and near-infrared hyperspectral, vegetation indices and lidar) are contributing to an accurate aquatic vegetation map. The results indicate that de-noised hyperspectral information in the visible and very near-infrared bands (400-1000nm) is performing most accurately. Inclusion of lidar information, hyperspectral infrared bands (1000-2500nm), or extracted vegetation indices does not improve the classification accuracy.

Increased aeration and subsequent oxidation following drainage causes peatlands to lose carbon and leads to a relative increase in the concentration of inorganic compounds. To infer carbon losses as a result of drainage, we studied four sites in Central Europe with different drainage states and land-use histories. We used differences in ash content of both catotelm peat and near-surface layers as well as the results of soil carbon inventories. The method yielded reasonable results, at least for two drained sites, where the mean loss rates varied between 0.14 and 0.49 kg C m(-2) a(-1). Comparison with a pristine bog showed that a relative increase of ash content is not unique to drained sites and that previous land management also affected natural peatlands with concomitant losses similar in magnitude to their drained counterparts. Rehabilitation of a previously drained site dissipated the original ash peak profile. In conclusion, the method is suitable for predicting carbon losses from ombrotrophic bogs under certain conditions but in countries with a long-lasting tradition of anthropogenic interference it is impossible to attribute drainage as the only factor governing relative increases in ash content in ombrotrophic peatlands.","[Leifeld, Jens] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gubler, Lena] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Gruenig, Andreas] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Agr Landscapes & Biodivers Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",,,,,27,22,23,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2011,2-Jan,,,,349,361,,10.1007/s11104-010-0649-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0649-y,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,735XY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000288455300027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The content includes review of the watershed hydrological models (data-driven model, conceptual model, and distributed model), review of the model calibration methods (manual calibration, single-objective automatic calibration, multi-objective automatic calibration, objective function, termination criterion, and data utilized for calibration), and review of the parallel computing accelerated model calibration (multi-node computer cluster, multi-core CPU, many-core GPU, and heterogeneous parallel computing). Recent development and the state-of-the-art are also analyzed. Three conclusions can be drawn: (1) Nowadays, different types of hydrological models have their own application fields and perform very well. Distributed hydrological model becomes the development direction and has a good future. (2) Computer aided automatic hydrological model calibration method has become the mainstream. Single-objective optimization method such as SCE-UA and multi-objective optimization method such as NSGA-II are very suitable to the model parameter calibration. (3) Heterogeneous parallel computing technology is the most powerful acceleration method for the hydrological model parameter calibration. However, researches about the acceleration of SCE-UA and NSGA-II based on heterogeneous parallel computing technique is rare and should be focused in the future.","[Kan, Guangyuan; He, Xiaoyan; Li, Jiren;

The model was used for a two-year period as well as for a more detailed study using 3 summer and winter months. In addition sensitivity tests using finer horizontal and vertical resolution in the boundary layer and using different physics schemes were performed. Temperature and incoming short- and long-wave radiation were skillfully simulated, with lower agreement between measured and modelled wind speed. Increased vertical resolution improved the frequency distributions of the wind speed and the temperature. The choice of different physics schemes only slightly changed the model results. The polar-optimized microphysics scheme outperformed a slightly simpler microphysics scheme, but the two alternative and more sophisticated PBL schemes improved the model score.

Yet the Neolithic Era brought several major changes in the history of humanity, these transformations being reflected in the housing paradigm, which goes through a spectacular metamorphosis. The transition from the status of nomad hunter-gatherer to that of sedentary animal breeder / farmer generated the appearance of stable settlements and the evolution from free-shape structures to rectangular planes. Changes in trade generated counting and recording systems, which led to a new fundamental change: the transition from pre-history to history, due to the recording of information. After approximately 3 million years of slow evolution, in just 1000 years, after the last ice age, the history of humanity starts moving at a significantly greater pace. In order to study these changes as manifested in architecture, we started from the premise that, due to the insufficiency and inconsistency of the data found, the current method of architectural recasting is based on an approximate transmission of the archeological data regarding locations and traces of structures, to sketchers of uncertain qualification, who draw up axonometric projections or decomposed perspectives with unclear size references. We understand the need to facilitate spatial perception, but scientific rigor requires a systematic approach. Thus, we started the study by drawing up a new method of architectural recasting, in two stages: 1- Systematic data recording by means of 6 sheets with data on geography, climate, technology, economy, society, culture. 2- Interdisciplinary analysis of data in a team comprised of archaeologist, architect, structure engineer; establishment of a stable structural system and geometrically correct representation of the architectural volume by means of a set of drawings that cover all planes, characteristic sections and facades on a scale of 1: 50, and an axonometric projection of 1: 100. The method was tested by analytic application on a Neolithic structure, by publication in specialized magazines and presentation during international conferences, and was completed subsequent to a consistent feedback of the academic community interested in the subject, by the addition of a textual description datasheet to the graphic language that is specific to architecture. With this method, sets of 3 architectural recasts from the Vinca Neolithic culture and the local cultures in the Romanian Banat were systematically drawn up, which allowed for the establishment of local typologies. This paper establishes the first regional typologies by starting with a set of 3 local typologies from the same culture - the Uivar, Parta and Foeni sites. We found the transition from an architectural form of parallelepipedic mono-block with a two-escarpment roof for the Uivar-Parta sites, to a mono-block with a portico on the short side in the case of Foeni, which foreshadows the megaron plane.","[Popovici-Donici, Mihai-Corneliu] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Popovici-Donici, MC (corresponding author), Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania.",mihai.donici@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,INT ORGANIZATION CENTER ACAD RESEARCH,ISTANBUL,"YUNUS EMRE CAD AKASYA SK NO 22, UGUR MUMCU, ISTANBUL, KARTAL 00000, TURKEY",,,978-605-64453-9-2,,,,2017,,,,,767,774,,,,,,8,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI1HB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000405856200100,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent success with dynamical forecasts predicting the winter NAO at lead times of a few months has the potential to deliver great socioeconomic impacts. Here, a linear regression model is found to provide skillful predictions of the winter NAO based on a limited number of statistical predictors. Identified predictors include El Nino, Arctic sea ice, Atlantic SSTs, and tropical rainfall. These statistical models can show significant skill when used to make out-of-sample forecasts, and the method is extended to produce probabilistic predictions of the winter NAO. The statistical hindcasts can achieve similar levels of skill to state-of-the-art dynamical forecast models, although out-of-sample predictions are less skillful, albeit over a small period. Forecasts over a longer out-of-sample period suggest there is true skill in the statistical models, comparable with that of dynamical forecasting models. They can be used both to help evaluate and to offer insight into the sources of predictability and limitations of dynamical models.","[Hall, Richard J.; Hanna, Edward] Univ Lincoln, Sch Geog, Lincoln, England; [Hall, Richard J.; Hanna, Edward] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Ctr Water & Planetary Hlth, Lincoln, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Jones, Julie M.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Erdelyi, Robert] Univ Sheffield, Solar Phys & Space Plasma Res Ctr, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Lincoln; University of Lincoln; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Hall, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Sch Geog, Lincoln, England.;Hall, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Ctr Water & Planetary Hlth, Lincoln, England.",rihall@lincoln.ac.uk,"erdelyi, robertus/AAQ-3262-2020; Hanna, Edward/W-5927-2019","erdelyi, robertus/0000-0003-3439-4127; Hanna, Edward/0000-0002-8683-182X; Jones, Julie/0000-0003-2892-8647","Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme [GA1101]; University of Sheffield Project Sunshine; NSF, Hungary (OTKA) [K83133]","Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme; University of Sheffield Project Sunshine; NSF, Hungary (OTKA)(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA))","AAS was supported by the Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme (GA1101).

The electric power sectors in China and India is dominated by coal-fired power plants, whereas fuel oil and natural gas are the key fossil fuels in Mexico. Spurred by economic development and population growth, demand for electricity in these countries is expected to continue to rise. Meeting this increased demand will have a significant impact on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). While available portfolio of generation and mitigation technologies may not suffice to arrest the growth of emissions, it can help reduce the rate of emissions growth. To achieve significant reductions, multiple approaches are required, such as reducing demand by adopting end-use efficiency improvement measures, accelerating the deployment of renewable and nuclear power, and adopting cleaner more efficient generation technologies. Retrofitting the existing fleet to meet strengthened environmental standards, and accelerated fleet-turnover, coupled with adoption of state-of-the-art high efficiency generation technologies, such as supercritical and ultra-supercritical boilers and advanced combined-cycle gas turbines, should play an important role in meeting the increasing demand with the least amount of GHG emissions. In parallel, significant R&D efforts will have to be undertaken to adapt off-the-shelf generation technologies to suit local needs. In the medium to long term, developed countries will need to provide financial and technical support for these countries and partner with them to develop, design, demonstrate, and deploy technologies for capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide.","[Vijay, Samudra] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, Air Pollut Prevent & Control Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Vijay, Samudra] Sam Analyt Solut LLC, Morrisville, NC 27560 USA; [Chikkatur, Ananth] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chikkatur, Ananth] ICF Int, Fairfax, VA 22031 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; Harvard University,"Vijay, S (corresponding author), US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, Air Pollut Prevent & Control Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",sam@samanalyticsolutions.com; ap_chikkatur@yahoo.com,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1574-0919,,978-90-481-3152-5,ADV GLOB CHANGE RES,Adv.

J,"Peraica, A",,,,"Peraica, Ana",,,"Photographocene: The past, present and future in the photography of the environment",PHILOSOPHY OF PHOTOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,photography; Photographocene; Anthropocene; environmental photography; pollution; archive,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ART,"Photography has an important place in picturing and documenting environmental changes, especially when they occur in distant areas, or are inaccessible from ground level and/or imperceptible to the naked eye due to their scale. As the invention of photographic technology was officially registered only 55 years after the invention of the steam engine (which is commonly taken as the starting point of the Anthropocene era), most subsequent transformations of the environment have been well documented. One needs to distinguish the time of human changes to the environment, the Anthropocene, from images of the era this term names, which are the way humans learn of their own environmental deeds. Such images may be dependent, yet they are also distinct insofar as they influence the perception as well as the production of the Anthropocene itself, framed by limits of the static, fractioned, subjectivized and perspectival medium of photography. In this vein, the article risks proposing yet another in a long series of neologisms that aim to define the unstable or extreme times we live in: the Photographocene. The Photographocene marks various phases of the human relationship to the environment in which photographs have documented, directly communicated and announced impending environmental processes directly caused by human actions. Yet, this is also an era marked by photographic images of the environment that report but also pollute our relationship to the environment by forming an alternate reality. Thus, this concept enables one to articulate the role that images have in our understanding of the past-present-future human impact on the environment.","[Peraica, Ana] Danube Univ Krems, Dept Image Sci, Dr Karl Dorrek Str 30, A-3500 Krems An Der Donau, Austria",Danube University Krems,"Peraica, A (corresponding author), Danube Univ Krems, Dept Image Sci, Dr Karl Dorrek Str 30, A-3500 Krems An Der Donau, Austria.",ana.peraica@ext.donau-uni.ac.at,"Peraica, Ana/A-1108-2014","Peraica, Ana/0000-0002-4949-6145",,,,,50,0,0,1,5,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2040-3682,2040-3690,,PHILOS PHOTOGR,PHILOS.

Adopting a systematic approach, this study reviews the available literature concerning the impacts of soil and water fluoride pollution on the safety and productivity of food and feed crops at a global scale, with the aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. The analyses of literature highlighted that food and feed crops exposed to soil and water fluoride pollution may reach concentrations of fluoride potentially harmful to human health. Nevertheless, despite the efforts already made to assess the crop fluoride accumulation in contaminated areas of India and China, the present study brings to light the lack of knowledge still existing on this issue for some regions strongly affected by environmental fluoride contamination such as the East African Rift Valley. Concerning the impacts of fluoride on cultivated crops, many authors observed that fluoride can produce toxic effects on plants leading to oxidative stress, reduction in chlorophyll content, alterations in the levels of proline, betaine, soluble sugars, nitrogen and macro and micronutrients. However, the appearance of symptoms such as visible injuries, reduced root and shoot length and yield decline was not always observed, also at high levels of fluoride exposure, and in some cases, the biomass production was even stimulated by increasing fluoride doses.

This model is characterised by a horizontal resolution of 1/12 degrees and a multi-nutrient and multi-plankton framework and can reproduce the main physical and biogeochemical processes from the seasonal (and its inter-annual modulation) to the sub-weekly scales. The corroboration shows that the MITgcm-BFM hindcast exhibits good and consistent performance when simulating the basin-wide gradients of temperature, salinity and nutrients and the seasonal cycles of physical and phytoplankton dynamics, including the deep chlorophyll maximum and the primary production at the basin and sub-basin scales for the period of 1994-2012. Novel statistical metrics show that the seasonal variability equals approximately 50% of the spatio-temporal sub-domain mean for the surface temperature and is higher than 150% for nutrients and chlorophyll. Nevertheless, the high-frequency (sub-weekly) variability is not negligible and is approximately equal to the inter-annual modulation of the seasonal variability, i.e., 3% of the spatio-temporal mean for the temperature and 30% or greater for nutrients and chlorophyll. Moreover, the high-frequency variability exhibits a decreasing southward gradient in the Mediterranean basin, similar to the seasonal variability. A further analysis based on the wavelet method and performed at different Mediterranean sites highlights the significant power that is associated with sub-weekly periods, which adds to the annual and semi-annual patterns, confirming the importance of the high frequency scale of variability in the biogeochemistry of the basin.","[Di Biagio, Valeria; Cossarini, Gianpiero; Salon, Stefano; Lazzari, Paolo; Querin, Stefano; Solidoro, Cosimo] Ist Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale OGS, Dept Oceanog, I-34010 Sgonico, TS, Italy; [Sannino, Gianmaria] Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainabl, Climate Modelling Lab, Rome, Italy",Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Di Biagio, V (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale OGS, Dept Oceanog, I-34010 Sgonico, TS, Italy.",vdibiagio@inogs.it,"Cossarini, Gianpiero/AAV-5489-2020; Di Biagio, Valeria/AAD-1598-2022; Salon, Stefano/AGI-3626-2022; Querin, Stefano/AAC-6149-2022; Salon, Stefano/AAV-5682-2020; Sannino, Gianmaria/AAL-8402-2021","Cossarini, Gianpiero/0000-0001-7803-8568; Salon, Stefano/0000-0003-1233-8271; Querin, Stefano/0000-0002-4658-860X; Salon, Stefano/0000-0003-1233-8271; Lazzari, Paolo/0000-0001-6819-4612; Sannino, Gianmaria/0000-0002-3985-9432; solidoro, cosimo/0000-0003-2354-4302; DI BIAGIO, Valeria/0000-0002-6160-1825","OGS; CINECA under the HPC-TRES program [2016-04]; CINECA award under the ISCRA initiative [HP10CPBEJO, HP10C5FMRK, HP10COFIJC]","OGS(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); CINECA under the HPC-TRES program; CINECA award under the ISCRA initiative(CINECA, Italy)","This work was partially sponsored by OGS and CINECA under the HPC-TRES program award number 2016-04.

Nature-based solutions aim to utilize green infrastructure to improve people's health and wellbeing. The design of urban environments must embrace the individual ideals of citizens and stakeholders which can only be achieved if effective methods of communication, involvement, and feedback are ensured. Such a procedure creates trust during its implementation, helping to take ownership and stewardship of processes and sites. This systematic literature review explores the current state of the art regarding citizen and stakeholder participation in nature-based solutions (NBS). The search on the SCOPUS database identified 142 papers in total that met the inclusion criteria. The participation analysis was separated in two areas: (a) analysis of perceptions, preferences, and perspectives of citizens and stakeholders, and (b) analysis of the participation process, including challenges and opportunities, motivations, methods and frameworks, and collaborative governance. The results revealed that stakeholder and citizen participation or collaboration in nature-based solutions is increasingly recognized as promising; however, research in several related domains is still lacking.","[Ferreira, Vera; Panagopoulos, Thomas] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Tourism Sustainabil & Well Being, Campus Gambelas, P-8000 Faro, Portugal; [Barreira, Ana Paula] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Campus Gambelas, P-8000 Faro, Portugal; [Loures, Luis] Polytech Inst Portalegre IPP, Res Ctr Endogenous Resource Valorizat, P-7300110 Portalegre, Portugal; [Antunes, Dulce] Univ Algarve, FCT, Mediterranean Inst Agr Environm & Dev, Campus Gambelas, P-8000 Faro, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve,"Ferreira, V; Panagopoulos, T (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Tourism Sustainabil & Well Being, Campus Gambelas, P-8000 Faro, Portugal.",vlferreira@ualg.pt; aprodrig@ualg.pt; lcloures@ipportalegre.pt; mantunes@ualg.pt; tpanago@ualg.pt,"Barreira, Ana Paula Catarino/N-7034-2015; Ferreira, Vera/AAV-6616-2021; Panagopoulos, Thomas/A-3048-2012; Antunes, Maria Dulce/A-4683-2012","Barreira, Ana Paula Catarino/0000-0001-5816-3361; Ferreira, Vera/0000-0001-5688-1298; Panagopoulos, Thomas/0000-0002-8073-2097; Antunes, Maria Dulce/0000-0002-8913-6136; Loures, Luis/0000-0002-6611-3417",Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [PTDC/GES-URB/31928/2017],Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),"This research was funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), grant number PTDC/GES-URB/31928/2017.",,158,67,67,25,122,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Jan,2020,2,,,,,,640,10.3390/su12020640,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12020640,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KQ3KE,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000516824600198,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mixed-forest management lacks systematic procedures to forecast the impact of silvicultural actions. The main objective of the present work is to review current knowledge and forest model developments that can be applied to mixed forests. Material and methods: Primary research literature was reviewed to determine the state of the art for modelling tree species mixtures, focusing mainly on temperate forests. Main results: The essential principles for predicting stand growth in mixed forests were identified. Forest model applicability in mixtures was analysed. Input data, main model components, output and viewers were presented. Finally, model evaluation procedures and some of the main model platforms were described. Research highlights: Responses to environmental changes and management activities in mixed forests can differ from pure stands. For greater insight into mixed-forest dynamics and ecology, forest scientists and practitioners need new theoretical frameworks, different approaches and innovative solutions for sustainable forest management in the context of environmental and social changes.","[Bravo, Felipe; del Rio, Miren; Bravo-Oviedo, Andres] Univ Valladolid, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Valladolid, Spain; [Bravo, Felipe; del Rio, Miren; Bravo-Oviedo, Andres] INIA, Madrid, Spain; [Bravo, Felipe] Univ Valladollid, Dept Prod Vegetal & Recursos Forestales, ETS Ingn Agr, Palencia, Spain; [Fabrika, Marek] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management & Geodesy, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Ammer, Christian] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Abt Waldbau & WaldKol Gemassigten Zonen, Gottingen, Germany; [Barreiro, Susana; Fonseca, Teresa] Univ Lisbon, Forest Res Ctr, Sch Agr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Barreiro, Susana] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bielak, Kamil] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Silviculture, Warsaw, Poland; [Coll, Lluis] Univ Lleida, Ctr Ciencia & Tecnol Forestal Catalunya CTFC, Dept Engn Agroforestal, ETSEA, Solsona, Spain; [Fonseca, Teresa] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Dept Forest Sci & Landscape Arquitecture, Vila Real, Portugal; [Kangur, Ahto] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Forest Management, Tartu, Estonia; [Lof, Magnus] Inst Sydsvensk Skogsvetenskap SLU, Alnarp, Sweden; [Pach, Maciej] Univ Agr, Inst Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Dept Silviculture, Krakow, Poland; [Pretzsch, Hans; Roetzer, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Munich, Germany; [Stojanovic, Dejan] Univ Novi Sad, Inst Lowland Forestry & Environm, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Schuler, Laura] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Peric, Sanja; Dodan, Martina] Croatian Forest Res Inst, Jastrebarsko, Croatia; [del Rio, Miren; Bravo-Oviedo, Andres] INIA, Forest Res Ctr INIA CIFOR, Madrid, Spain; [Bravo-Oviedo, Andres] CSIC, Spanish Natl Res Council MNCN, Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid, Spain; [Merganicova, Katarina] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Universidad de Valladolid; Technical University Zvolen; University of Gottingen; Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; Wageningen University & Research; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Universitat de Lleida; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Estonian University of Life Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Agricultural University Krakow; Technical University of Munich; University of Novi Sad; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Croatian Forest Research Institute; Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bravo, F (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Valladolid, Spain.;Bravo, F (corresponding author), INIA, Madrid, Spain.;Bravo, F (corresponding author), Univ Valladollid, Dept Prod Vegetal & Recursos Forestales, ETS Ingn Agr, Palencia, Spain.",fbravo@pvs.uva.es,"Stojanovic, Dejan/AAW-4912-2021; Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019; Bravo, Felipe/C-5073-2009; Bravo-Oviedo, Andrés/T-3878-2019; Pach, Maciej/R-5286-2016; Đodan, Martina/C-7410-2019; Ammer, Christian/ABG-4629-2020; Coll, Lluís/E-8724-2015; del Río, Miren/F-2196-2013; Ammer, Christian/ABG-7360-2020; Fabrika, Marek/AAC-4857-2019; de Jesus Fidalgo Fonseca, Teresa/M-6613-2013; Kangur, Ahto/E-4570-2011; Barreiro, Susana/I-5673-2012","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Bravo, Felipe/0000-0001-7348-6695; Bravo-Oviedo, Andrés/0000-0001-7036-7041; Pach, Maciej/0000-0002-9833-867X; Đodan, Martina/0000-0001-9871-1975; Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135; Coll, Lluís/0000-0002-8035-5949; del Río, Miren/0000-0001-7496-3713; de Jesus Fidalgo Fonseca, Teresa/0000-0001-6269-3605; Kangur, Ahto/0000-0002-2381-5806; Stojanovic, Dejan/0000-0003-2967-2049; Barreiro, Susana/0000-0003-0174-854X","COST Action (COST Association, European Comission) [FP1206 EuMIXFOR]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0480-12, APVV-15-0265]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL-2014-51964-C2-1-K]","COST Action (COST Association, European Comission); Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","COST Action FP1206 EuMIXFOR (COST Association, European Comission), APVV-0480-12 and APVV-15-0265 (Slovak Research and Development Agency) and AGL-2014-51964-C2-1-K (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness),",,187,18,18,7,48,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION & TECNOLOGIA AGRARIA & ALIMENTARIA-INIA-CSIC,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,2171-9845,,FOREST SYST,For.

In 2014, the first Passivhaus dwelling in Latin America was built, and since then, other buildings have followed this approach. However, there is little published data on thermal comfort in Passivhaus certified dwellings in non-European countries. No previous study has evaluated the thermal comfort in Passivhaus buildings in Latin America. This work aims to assess the annual overheating of the first Passivhaus dwelling in Mexico City following the Passivhaus, static (CIBSE Guide A, Passivhaus, Mexican standards) and dynamic (Adaptive approach - CIBSE TM52) methodologies to assess overheating. Indoor temperature and relative humidity were measured over one-year at 5-min intervals. Temperatures above 25 degrees C were observed in the bedroom during 7.53% of the year, the living room (8.03%) and the kitchen (8.20%). There was a significant daily temperature variation in the kitchen (4.15 degrees C) and living room (6 degrees C). Overheating was observed through the CIBSE Guide A static criteria in the bedroom and kitchen. The Adaptive and Passivhaus criteria suggested no overheating. Passivhaus overheating criteria sets indoor temperatures as acceptable. Occupant perception of thermal comfort matched the Adaptive and Passivhaus criteria results. While the results presented here cannot be generalised, they could be used to help improve the design and performance of Passivhaus certified dwellings in similar climates'. The results highlight the potential for Passivhaus dwellings to provide comfortable indoor environments while minimising energy consumption in Latin American countries.","[Moreno-Rangel, Alejandro; Sharpe, Tim; McGill, Grainne; Musau, Filbert] Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Environm Architecture Res Unit, 167 Renfrew St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Renfrew, Scotland; [Moreno-Rangel, Alejandro] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Inst Contemporary Arts, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Sharpe, Tim; McGill, Grainne] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture, 75 Montrose St, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow School of Art; Lancaster University; University of Strathclyde,"Moreno-Rangel, A (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Inst Contemporary Arts, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",a.morenorangel@lancaster.ac.uk; tim.sharpe@strath.ac.uk; grainne.mcgill@strath.ac.uk; f.musau@gsa.ac.uk,,"Moreno-Rangel, Alejandro/0000-0001-6405-4233; Sharpe, Tim/0000-0002-4275-5351; McGill, Grainne/0000-0002-8716-9567","CONACyT; Research England Expanding, Excellence in England (E3); AirBoxLab (Foobot)","CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Research England Expanding, Excellence in England (E3)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); AirBoxLab (Foobot)","This research was partially funded by CONACyT through a PhD grant.

In Italy, then, from the results of monitoring of Indicazioni Nazionali (art. 1, c. 4 DPR 89/2009) published on 4/2/2012 [1], shows that in 76% of schools (4,436 detection attended educational institutions between all institutions and educational circles totaling 60,084 classes) the most popular teaching mode is the lesson. The choice to create an experimental work to verify the influence of Cooperative Learning on learners ' performance [2] resulted from these considerations and, above all, by the high number of early school leavers (in the past year, were over 434 thousand) mainly related to educational failure (lived both as unsatisfactory results in terms of performance rather than lack of interest towards the activities and modalities for the structuring of the same). With the survey, it was decided to examine whether, in practice, speaking about the organization of teaching you can improve the performance of students. The aim of the research was to provide answers to the following question: is it possible to obtain an improvement of student learning by fostering cooperative learning through the use of the interactive whiteboard (LIM)? In the research have been involved 62 students (13 years old) attending the third class of the first grade of secondary school. The experimental path was done in about two months and the results have corroborated the initial hypothesis. Cooperative work and the use of digital technologies affect positively pupils school performance, on individual and group responsibility, on the development of social skills; it provides a good climate for individual student's learning. With this experimentation we have also been able to verify how the communication between the students, as result of a negotiation and progressive and continuous sharing, is greatly improved. This is an aspect that should be supported in every educational context. The communicative relationship that is established was the fundamental and decisive characteristic to achieve our goals. Cooperative learning is more than just working in groups: students must be interdependent, interact each other, be individually accountable, and use interpersonal skills. In order to obtain best learning results it is essential to intervene on the organization of the educational setting and relational dynamics. According to the research, cooperative learning can greatly enhance learning, but not in all circumstances. Teachers need training and practice in using cooperative learning in an effective way.","[Marzano, A.; Tammaro, R.; Notti, A.

They found an important lag in several countries, including Colombia. According to many scholars, a clear regulatory framework is of the utmost importance for integrated coastal management; however, the hurdles to reaching this goal have been poorly analyzed. This article aims to illustrate the challenges and barriers to legislate on coastal and marine issues in Colombia. The methodology and analysis used in this study can serve as an example to other Latin American countries. We combined comparative, documentary, and analytical research techniques to describe the current Latin American state-of-the-art legal framework. Additionally, from 16,224 gazettes (official records of the Congress of Colombia) we identified 80 bills concerning coastal and marine activities for a period of 17 years. However, only 2.1% of those bills addressed marine or coastal issues from the perspective of planning and management procedures. Instead the majority focused on social uses and economic activities. This research identified the difficulties that could be faced by a country in regulating its coast from an integrated perspective. These findings could support future procedures to approve coastal laws in Latin America and other countries on the world.","[Botero, Camilo M.] Univ Sergio Arboleda, Sch Law, Santa Marta 050022, Colombia; [Milanes, Celene B.] Univ Costa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, GeMarc & GESSA Res Grp, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia; [Cuker, Benjamin] Hampton Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Hampton, VA 23668 USA; [Anfuso, Giorgio] Univ Cadiz, Fac Ciencias Mar & Ambientales, Dept Ciencias Tierra, Puerto Real 11510, Spain",University Sergio Arboleda; Universidad de la Costa; Hampton University; Universidad de Cadiz,"Milanes, CB (corresponding author), Univ Costa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, GeMarc & GESSA Res Grp, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia.;Anfuso, G (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Fac Ciencias Mar & Ambientales, Dept Ciencias Tierra, Puerto Real 11510, Spain.",playascol@gmail.com; cmilanes1@cuc.edu.co; benjamin.cuker@hamptonu.edu; giorgio.anfuso@uca.es,"Batista, Celene Milanés/B-8690-2019; Anfuso, Giorgio/C-3844-2017","Batista, Celene Milanés/0000-0003-2560-8859; Cuker, Benjamin/0000-0002-8024-9628; Anfuso, Giorgio/0000-0002-7266-2842; Botero, Camilo M./0000-0001-6886-8920",Sergio Arboleda University within the IV internal research announcement La Sergio 4.0; Universidad de la Costa [INV.110601-007-12],Sergio Arboleda University within the IV internal research announcement La Sergio 4.0; Universidad de la Costa,"Partial financial support for this research was provided to the first author from Sergio Arboleda University within the IV internal research announcement La Sergio 4.0.

In such a latent variable model, one needs to estimate the intractable likelihood of the (hydro)geological parameters given the geophysical data. The pseudo-marginal (PM) method is an adaptation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in which an unbiased approximation of this likelihood is obtained by Monte Carlo averaging over samples from, in this setting, the noisy petrophysical relationship linking (hydro)geological and geophysical properties. To make the method practical in data-rich geophysical settings with low noise levels, we demonstrate that the Monte Carlo sampling must rely on importance sampling distributions that well approximate the posterior distribution of petrophysical scatter around the sampled (hydro)geological parameter field. To achieve a suitable acceptance rate, we rely both on (1) the correlated PM (CPM) method, which correlates the samples used in the proposed and current states of the Markov chain and (2) a model proposal scheme that preserves the prior distribution. As a synthetic test example, we infer porosity fields using crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) first-arrival traveltimes. We use a (50 x 50)-dimensional pixel-based parametrization of the multi-Gaussian porosity field with known statistical parameters, resulting in a parameter space of high dimension. We demonstrate that the CPM method with our proposed importance sampling and prior-preserving proposal scheme outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both linear and non-linear settings by greatly enhancing the posterior exploration.","[Friedli, L.; Linde, N.] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ginsbourger, D.] Univ Bern, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Ginsbourger, D.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Doucet, A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford, England",University of Lausanne; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Oxford,"Friedli, L (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",lea.friedli@unil.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [184574],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (project number: 184574).

The dynamical, thermodynamic, cloud and precipitation fields obtained from these numerical integrations are then intercompared and validated against various observational sources, including radio- and dropsondes, satellite radiometer, and rain-gauges. The similarities and the deficiencies of the three models are summarized in the paper. After this validation work, the mesoscale fields are degraded in resolution, so that they can be directly compared with the outputs of 300 km resolution simulations, run with Meteo-France's atmospheric general-circulation model (AGCM) Action de Recherche Petite Echelle et Grande Echelle (ARPEGE). The deviations between the upscaled mesoscale models and the coarse AGCM turn out to be significant and highly dependent on the location relative to the storm, with, in particular, a large contrast between the trailing cold region and the warm sector with thick layer clouds, suggesting the existence of some deficiencies in the AGCM.","Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; Met Eireann, Dublin, Ireland; Joint Ctr Mesoscale Meteorol, Met Off, Reading, Berks, England; Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Lab Aerol, Toulouse, France",Met Eireann - Ireland; Met Office - UK; University of Reading; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lopez, P (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.",p.lopez@ecmwf.int,,"Lopez, Philippe/0000-0003-4014-5813; Clark, Peter/0000-0003-1001-9226",,,,,45,12,12,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

The stand-alone modular setup supports both monitoring of dynamic processes and mobile mapping applications based on SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms. The main objective of MOLISENS is to exploit newly emerging perception sensor technologies developed for the automotive industry for geoscientific applications. However, MOLISENS can also be used for other application areas, such as 3D mapping of buildings or vehicle-independent data collection for sensor performance assessment and sensor modeling. Compared to TLSs, small industrial lidar sensors provide advantages in terms of size (on the order of 10 cm), weight (on the order of 1 kg or less), price (typically between EUR 5000 and 10 000), robustness (typical protection class of IP68), frame rates (typically 10-20 Hz), and eye safety class (typically 1). For these reasons, small industrial lidar systems can provide a very useful complement to currently used TLS (terrestrial laser scanner) systems that have their strengths in range and accuracy performance. The MOLISENS hardware setup consists of a sensor unit, a data logger, and a battery pack to support stand-alone and mobile applications. The sensor unit includes the small industrial lidar Ouster OS1-64 Gen1, a ublox multi-band active GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) with the possibility for RTK (real-time kinematic), and a nine-axis Xsens IMU (inertial measurement unit). Special emphasis was put on the robustness of the individual components of MOLISENS to support operations in rough field and adverse weather conditions. The sensor unit has a standard tripod thread for easy mounting on various platforms. The current setup of MOLISENS has a horizontal field of view of 360 degrees, a vertical field of view with a 45 degrees opening angle, a range of 120 m, a spatial resolution of a few centimeters, and a temporal resolution of 10-20 Hz. To evaluate the performance of MOLISENS, we present a comparison between the integrated small industrial lidar Ouster OS1-64 and the state-of-the-art high-accuracy and high-precision TLS Riegl VZ-6000 in a set of controlled experimental setups. We then apply the small industrial lidar Ouster OS1-64 in several real-world settings. The mobile mapping application of MOLISENS has been tested under various conditions, and results are shown from two surveys in the Lurgrotte cave system in Austria and a glacier cave in Longyearbreen on Svalbard.","[Goelles, Thomas; Hammer, Tobias; Muckenhuber, Stefan; Schlager, Birgit; Abermann, Jakob; Bauer, Christian; Schoener, Wolfgang; Schrei, Benjamin] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, Graz, Austria; [Goelles, Thomas; Hammer, Tobias; Muckenhuber, Stefan; Schlager, Birgit; Abermann, Jakob; Exposito Jimenez, Victor J.; Schratter, Markus] Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21a, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Hammer, Tobias; Schlager, Birgit] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Automat & Control, Inffeldgasse 21b, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Senger, Kim] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Arctic Geol Dept, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway",University of Graz; Graz University of Technology; University Centre Svalbard (UNIS),"Goelles, T; Hammer, T; Muckenhuber, S (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, Graz, Austria.;Goelles, T; Hammer, T; Muckenhuber, S; Schlager, B (corresponding author), Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21a, A-8010 Graz, Austria.;Hammer, T; Schlager, B (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Automat & Control, Inffeldgasse 21b, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",thomas.goelles@v2c2.at; hammer.tobias@gmx.de; stefan.muckenhuber@uni-graz.at; birgit.schlager@v2c2.at,,"Goelles, Thomas/0000-0002-3925-6260; Schlager, Birgit/0000-0003-3290-5333",COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); University of Graz; Svalbard Science Forum Arctic Field Grant,COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); University of Graz; Svalbard Science Forum Arctic Field Grant,"The authors received financial support within the COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK), the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), the Province of Styria (Dept. 12), and the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG).

Furthermore, the need for these units could grow due to the currently increasing social vulnerability and climate-related hazards. Thus, to enhance the sustainability performance of THUs, which incorporate the most negative aspects of the building industry, is required. One of the THUs less-studied features, which could have considerable impacts on the main pillars of sustainability, is unit configuration types. Therefore, this study presents a novel model that enables decision-makers to select the most suitable THUs configuration types based on the characteristics and requirements each case has. This model combines several methods for the first time, learning from these methods numerous former uncombined applications. This model assesses THUs sustainability using the Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment (MIVES) combined with DesignBuilder (R), a simplified life-cycle assessment (LCA), interviews and sensibility analyses.1 This project applies this model for the first time to assess different THUs suggested for Bam's earthquake recovery program. This application has validated the model demonstrating that semi-detached units perform as the most suitable configuration types alternatives for Bam's THUs. This is especially the case of two-story types, although several social issues should be improved in future DP housing. Furthermore, after this pioneering research paper in the subfield of THU configuration types, future projects should enlarge upon its findings to move towards better THUs for the future.","[Hosseini, S.

The 3U cubesat constellation of Planet Labs offers the capability of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday at 3-4 m spatial resolution. The higher spatial, as well as temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery in comparison with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, makes it a valuable data source for monitoring the glacial lakes. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of the PlanetScope imagery for glacial lakes mapping with a focus on the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKKH) region. Though the revisit time of the PlanetScope imagery is short, courtesy of 130+ small satellites, this imagery contains only four bands and the imaging sensors in these small satellites exhibit varying spectral responses as well as lower dynamic range. Furthermore, the presence of cast shadows in the mountainous regions and varying spectral signature of the water pixels due to differences in composition, turbidity and depth makes it challenging to automatically and reliably extract surface water in PlanetScope imagery. Keeping in view these challenges, this work uses state of the art deep learning models for pixel-wise classification of PlanetScope imagery into the water and background pixels and compares the results with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The deep learning model is based on the popular U-Net architecture. We evaluate U-Net architecture similar to the original U-Net as well as a U-Net with a pre-trained EfficientNet backbone. In order to train the deep neural network, ground truth data are generated by manual digitization of the surface water in PlanetScope imagery with the aid of Very High Resolution Satellite (VHRS) imagery. The created dataset consists of more than 5000 water bodies having an area of approx. 71km2 in eight different sites in the HKKH region. The evaluation of the test data show that the U-Net with EfficientNet backbone achieved the highest F1 Score of 0.936. A visual comparison with the existing glacial lake inventories is then performed over the Baltoro glacier in the Karakoram range. The results show that the deep learning model detected significantly more lakes than the existing inventories, which have been derived from Landsat OLI imagery.

The output of the U-Net is also compared with the GLakeMap data. The results show that the higher spatial and temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery is a significant advantage in the context of glacial lakes mapping and monitoring.","[Qayyum, Nida; Ghuffar, Sajid; Shahid, Imran] Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Hafiz Mughees] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, Computat Cameras & Vis Res Lab, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yousaf, Adeel] Inst Space Technol, Dept Avion Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",Istanbul Medipol University,"Ghuffar, S (corresponding author), Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",nida06@ist.edu.pk; sajid.ghuffar@mail.ist.edu.pk; hafiz.mughees@std.medipol.edu.tr; adeel.yousaf@ist.edu.pk; imran.shahid@ist.edu.pk,"Shaahid, Imran/O-5026-2014; shahid, Imran/AAD-2733-2021; Ahmad, Hafiz Mughees/ABB-2402-2020","Shaahid, Imran/0000-0003-1058-4698; shahid, Imran/0000-0003-1058-4698; Ahmad, Hafiz Mughees/0000-0003-1648-7071; Ghuffar, Sajid/0000-0002-5618-8247",International Foundation for Science (IFS); COMSTECH grant [W/5805-1],International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science); COMSTECH grant,This research was supported by the International Foundation for Science (IFS) and COMSTECH grant Ref.

Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the capability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different temporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the same as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal scales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens of kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2 needs to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which it can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales involved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally unfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine means that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and depth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represent a better strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer systems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock formations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In particular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic geology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable layers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in terms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer systems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations for multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage between individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a state-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model. The formulation of the full model is simple and exploits the fact that both models can be written in terms of generalized multiphase flow equations with particular choices of the relative permeabilities and capillary pressure functions. The resulting simulation framework is very versatile and can be used to simulate CO2 storage for any combination of 3D and VE-descriptions, thereby enabling the governing equations to be tailored to the local structure. We demonstrate the simplicity of the model formulation by extending the standard flow-solvers from the open-source Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST), allowing immediate access to upscaling tools, complex well modeling, and visualization features. We demonstrate this capability on both conceptual and industry-grade models from a proposed storage formation in the North Sea. The current implementation assumes a sharp interface for the VE model, where the capillary forces do not lead to a capillary fringe. While the examples are taken specifically from CO2 storage applications, the framework itself is general and can be applied to many problems in which parts of the domain are dominated by gravity segregation. Such applications include gas storage and hydrocarbon recovery from gas reservoirs with local layering structure.","[Moyner, Olav; Nilsen, Halvor Moll] SINTEF Digital, Oslo, Norway; [Moyner, Olav] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Moyner, O (corresponding author), SINTEF Digital, Oslo, Norway.;Moyner, O (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway.",Olav.Moyner@sintef.no,,"Moyner, Olav/0000-0001-9993-3879; Nilsen, Halvor Moll/0000-0002-2153-0962",Research Council of Norway [243729]; NCCS -Industry Driven Innovation for Fast Track CCS Deployment [257579]; VISTA by Equinor,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); NCCS -Industry Driven Innovation for Fast Track CCS Deployment; VISTA by Equinor,"This work was funded in part by the Research Council of Norway through grant no. 243729 (Simulation and optimization of large-scale, aquifer-wide CO<INF>2</INF> injection in the North Sea) and NCCS -Industry Driven Innovation for Fast Track CCS Deployment grant no. 257579.

J,"Neznamova, AY",,,,"Neznamova, Anna Yu",,,ELEMENTS OF COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE POETICS IN POEM WITHOUT A HERO BY ANNA AKHMATOVA,TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL,,,Russian,Article,,,,,,Akhmatova; Poem Without a Hero; commedia dell'arte; 20th century; theater; masquerade,,"The article tells about the problem of using elements of poetics of Italian commedia dell'arte (13th century), a specifically Italian phenomenon of a universal cultural importance, in Poema bez geroia [Poem Without A Hero] by A. Akhmatova. During the first decade of the 20th century the theater flourishes in Russia. The common climate of the era (or, rather, the turn of the era) is marked by an avocation to the spirit of mysticism, prophecy and eschatology. The theme of masquerade is one of the most common in this period. Therefore, masquerade has different interpretations, it is not only the carnival fun, but also deception, art, mysticism, even dance macabre. The concept of the mask corresponds to the concept of magnitude, hypocrisy. It most suited the Silver Age characterized by numerous life-building experiments. Russian artists submitted their everyday behavior to a mask or a role they selected wanting the audience to see the image of their real faces they created themselves rather than their real faces. It should be noted that commedia dell'arte is not the only genre tradition in the implementation of the carnival theme. Poetics and semantics of the carnival are determined not only by its antique (of the ancient Rome, thus proto-Italian) origin, but also by the European Medieval (especially French) tradition. In addition, there are motifs of the coven that refer to Goethe's Faust. Thus, commedia dell'arte, originally an entertaining genre, acquires tragic and infernal nature (infernal harlequinade) in Akhmatova's work, where actor's dramatic identification may have the semantics of witch metamorphosis, change of the essence, not of change of masks. In Poem Without a Hero, dedicated to the 1910s, the theatrical theme is associated with the image of the protagonist, Olga Glebova-Sudeykina, whose life and love story is the basis of the poem. However, the main character represents the epoch, as indicated by her nomination Colombine of the '10s. The multidimensional image of the character which consists of the top and the bottom carnival elements is described using the motif of the doll, provoking the reader to ethically evaluate the carnival of the 1910s and of its participants. The love triangle is a traditional story interpreted through figures of commedia dell'arte. In the story, there are several levels, the line of the heroine is projected on the storyline of the author. This theme of duality and mirror is also in the artistic code of commedia dell'arte. In this article, the author concludes that poetics of commedia dell'arte is one of the structural and semantic elements of the poem, although it was be perceived via the tradition and the esthetics of masquerade.","[Neznamova, Anna Yu] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia",Tomsk State University,"Neznamova, AY (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.",paradoxoid@inbox.ru,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1561-7793,1561-803X,,TOMSK STATE UNIV J,Tomsk State Univ.

The purpose of this research is twofold: first, to conduct a comparative cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate environmental impacts of manufacturing options available for obtaining different colours and appearance of facing bricks, and second, basing on LCA results, to examine recent literature and environmental product declaration (EPD) items (ISO 14025:2006) to verify if current EU best available techniques (BATs) in ceramic manufacturing industry that are dated 2007 are still relevant today, especially in the light of current technological progresses. The considered manufacturing options are necessary to obtain three different final appearances of the facing brick. In the first option, the brick is left in its natural colour. The second and third options include the applications of two type of coatings, which are the engobing and the glazing solutions. Methods The analysis of life cycle stages was performed according to the cradle-to-gate approach (ISO 14040:2006b UNI EN ISO 14040:2006-environmental management-life cycle assessment-principles and framework;ISO 14044:(2006c) ISO 14044:2006/Amd 1:2017 environmentalmanagement-life cycle assessment-requirements and guidelines-amendment 1/Amd 1:2017). The software tool used is SimaPro (R) version 9.0.0.31, and inventories are based on ecoinvent v.3.5. LCA was performed basing on ceramic BATs and literature data, assuming the German energy mix. The consistency of results and the evaluation of ceramic BATs were discussed on the basis of a comparison of results with recent LCA studies and application of sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion One of the results of this study is that coating options entail significant environmental impacts. As instance, the application of both engobe and glaze coatings increases the global warming potential (GWP) up to 7.2% and human toxicity (HT) up to 143.1%. Finally, results confirm the importance of implementing existing saving technologies for the firing stage, being the main contributor to climate change among production activities. Moreover, environmental impacts that have been obtained assessing the product life cycle with BATs are generally higher if compared with current literature, in a range up to + 240%. Conclusions In conformity with ISO standards, this LCA analyses the potential environmental impacts of facing bricks, considering three manufacturing options. The evidences provided by this study demonstrate the importance to include coating materials in LCA studies involving facing bricks. Finally, results let the authors to conclude that a revision of BATs is necessary in order to update technology requirements that are contained in the document to the current state of the art.","[Silvestri, Luca] Univ Rome Niccolo Cusano, Dept Engn, Via Don Carlo Gnocchi 3, I-00166 Rome, Italy; [Palumbo, Elisabetta; Traverso, Marzia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Sustainabil Civil Engn, Aachen, Germany; [Forcina, Antonio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Ctr Direz Napoli, Dept Engn, Isola C4, Naples, Italy",Niccolo Cusano Online University; RWTH Aachen University; Parthenope University Naples; Telecom Italia,"Silvestri, L (corresponding author), Univ Rome Niccolo Cusano, Dept Engn, Via Don Carlo Gnocchi 3, I-00166 Rome, Italy.",luca.silvestri@unicusano.it,"Traverso, Marzia/AAT-9006-2020","Traverso, Marzia/0000-0001-8848-6292; Silvestri, Luca/0000-0002-6754-899X",,,,,81,2,2,6,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

Remote sensing images from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites provide an opportunity for SSI estimation through directly retrieving atmospheric and land-surface parameters. This paper presents a new scheme for estimating SSI from the visible and infrared channels of geostationary meteorological and polar-orbiting satellite data. Aerosol optical thickness and cloud microphysical parameters were retrieved from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system images by interpolating lookup tables of clear and cloudy skies, respectively. SSI was estimated using pre-calculated offline lookup tables with different atmospheric input data of clear and cloudy skies. The lookup tables were created via the comprehensive radiative transfer model, Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (SBDART), to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. The atmospheric attenuation effects considered in our approach were water vapor absorption and aerosol extinction for clear skies, while cloud parameters were the only atmospheric input for cloudy-sky SSI estimation. The approach was validated using one-year pyranometer measurements from seven stations in the SURFRAD (SURFace RADiation budget network). The results of the comparison for 2012 showed that the estimated SSI agreed with ground measurements with correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.69, and 0.89 with a bias of 26.4 W/m(2), 5.9 W/m(2), and 14.9 W/m(2) for clear-sky, cloudy-sky, and all-sky conditions, respectively. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) of instantaneous SSI was 80.0 W/m(2) (16.8%), 127.6 W/m(2) (55.1%), and 99.5 W/m(2) (25.5%) for clear-sky, cloudy-sky (overcast sky and partly cloudy sky), and all-sky (clear-sky and cloudy-sky) conditions, respectively. A comparison with other state-of-the-art studies suggests that our proposed method can successfully estimate SSI with a maximum improvement of an RMSE of 24 W/m(2). The clear-sky SSI retrieval was sensitive to aerosol optical thickness, which was largely dependent on the diurnal surface reflectance accuracy. Uncertainty in the pre-defined horizontal visibility for 'clearest sky' will eventually lead to considerable SSI retrieval error. Compared to cloud effective radius, the retrieval error of cloud optical thickness was a primary factor that determined the SSI estimation accuracy for cloudy skies. Our proposed method can be used to estimate SSI for clear and one-layer cloud sky, but is not suitable for multi-layer clouds overlap conditions as a lower-level cloud cannot be detected by the optical sensor when a higher-level cloud has a higher optical thickness.","[Zhang, Hailong; Yu, Shanshan; Li, Li; Xin, Xiaozhou; Liu, Qinhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Jointly Sponsored Inst Remote Sensing & Digital E, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hailong; Yu, Shanshan; Li, Li; Xin, Xiaozhou; Liu, Qinhuo] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Xin, XZ; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Jointly Sponsored Inst Remote Sensing & Digital E, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Xin, XZ; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhlnjnu@163.com; huangch@lreis.ac.cn; yushan0427@163.com; lili3982@radi.ac.cn; xin_xzh@163.com; Liuqh@radi.ac.cn,"LIU, Qinhuo/S-1647-2016","LIU, Qinhuo/0000-0002-3713-9511; Zhang, Hailong/0000-0003-3705-5358","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA15012002, XDA15007502]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771394, 41471335, 41201352]",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was financially supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA15012002, XDA15007502) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41771394, 41471335, 41201352).

The analysis links the surface energy budget to free-troposphere synoptic variables, clouds, precipitation, and in-ice temperatures. The key results are (1) SHEBA melt-season transitions are associated with atmospheric synoptic events (2) onset of melt clearly occurs on May 28, while the end of melt is produced by a sequence of three atmospheric storm events over a 28-day period producing step-like reductions in the net surface energy flux. The last one occurs on August 22.; (3) melt onset is primarily due to large increases in the downwelling longwave radiation and modest decreases in the surface albedo; (4) decreases in the downwelling longwave radiation occur for all end-of-melt transition steps, while increases in surface albedo occur for the first two; (5) decreases in downwelling shortwave radiation contribute only to the first end-of-melt transition step; (6) springtime free-tropospheric warming preconditions the atmosphere-ice system for the subsequent melt onset; and (7) melt-season transitions also mark transitions in system responses to radiative energy flux changes because of invariant melt-season surface temperatures. The extensive SHEBA observations enable an understanding of the complex processes not available from other field program data. The analysis provides a basis for future testing of the generality of the results, and contributes to better physical understanding of multi-year analyses of melt-season trends from less extensive data sets.","[Persson, P.

As a result, there is a renewed interest in the development and application of biologically based computational models that can be used to predict the dosimetry (or ultimately response) in a developing embryo, fetus, or newborn. However, fundamental differences between animal and human development can create many unique challenges. For example, unlike models designed for adults, biologically based models of pre- and postnatal development must deal with rapidly changing growth dynamics (maternal, embryonic, fetal, and neonatal), changes in the state of differentiation of developing tissues, uniquely expressed or uniquely functioning signal transduction or enzymatic pathways, and unusual routes of exposure (e.g., maternal-mediated placental transfer and lactation). In cases where these challenges are overcome or addressed, biological modeling will likely prove useful in assessments geared toward children's health, given the contributions that this approach has already made in cancer and non-cancer human health risk assessments. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the current state of the art in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of the developing embryo, fetus, or neonate and to recommend potential steps that could be taken to improve their use in children's health risk assessments. The intent was not to recommend improvements to individual models per se, but to identify areas of research that could move the entire field forward. This analysis includes a brief summary of current risk assessment practices for developmental toxicity, with an overview of developmental biology as it relates to species-specific dosimetry. This summary should provide a general context for understanding the tension that exists in modeling between describing biological proceses in exquisite detail vs. the simplifications that are necessary due to lack of data (or through a sensitivity analysis, determined to be of little impact) to develop individual PBPK or PD models. For each of the previously published models covered in this review, a description of the underlying assumptions and model structures as well as the data and methods used in model development and validation are highlighted. Although several of the models attempted to describe target tissues in the developing embryo, fetus, or neonate of laboratory animals, extrapolations to humans were largely limited to maternal blood or milk concentrations. Future areas of research therefore are recommended to extend the already significant progress that has been made in this field and perhaps address many of the technical, policy, and ethical issues surrounding various approaches for decreasing the uncertainty in extrapolating from animal models to human pregnancies or neonatal exposures.","Battelle Mem Inst, Pacific NW Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; Dow Chem Co USA, Midland, MI 48640 USA; US EPA, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; Procter & Gamble Co, Cincinnati, OH 45253 USA",Battelle Memorial Institute; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Dow Chemical Company; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Procter & Gamble,"Corley, RA (corresponding author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, 902 Battelle Blvd,POB 999,MSIN P7-59, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",rick.corley@pnl.gov,"Corley, Richard/AAM-3579-2021","Corley, Richard/0000-0003-2877-9194",,,,,152,69,71,3,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-8444,1547-6898,,CRIT REV TOXICOL,Crit.

To this end, integrated solutions that incorporate carbon utilization processes, as well as promote the transition of the fossil fuel-based energy system to carbon-free systems, such as the hydrogen economy, are required. One of the possible pathways is to utilize CO2 as the base chemical for producing a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), using CO2 as a mediating chemical for delivering H-2 to the site of usage since gaseous and liquid H-2 retain transportation and storage problems. Formic acid is a probable candidate considering its high volumetric H-2 capacity and low toxicity. While previous studies have shown that formic acid is less competitive as an LOHC candidate compared to other chemicals, such as methanol or toluene, the results were based on out-of-date process schemes. Recently, advances have been made in the formic acid production and dehydrogenation processes, and an analysis regarding the recent process configurations could deem formic acid as a feasible option for LOHC. In this study, the potential for using formic acid as an LOHC is evaluated, with respect to the state-of-the-art formic acid production schemes, including the use of heterogeneous catalysts during thermocatalytic and electrochemical formic acid production from CO2. Assuming a hydrogen distribution system using formic acid as the LOHC, each of the production, transportation, dehydrogenation, and CO2 recycle sections are separately modeled and evaluated by means of techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). Realistic scenarios for hydrogen distribution are established considering the different transportation and CO2 recovery options; then, the separate scenarios are compared to the results of a liquefied hydrogen distribution scenario. TEA results showed that, while the LOHC system incorporating the thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid is more expensive than liquefied H-2 distribution, the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formic acid system reduces the H-2 distribution cost by 12%. Breakdown of the cost compositions revealed that reduction of steam usage for thermocatalytic processes in the future can make the LOHC system based on thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid to be competitive with liquefied H-2 distribution if the production cost could be reduced by 23% and 32%, according to the dehydrogenation mode selected. Using formic acid as a LOHC was shown to be less competitive compared to liquefied H-2 delivery in terms of LCA, but producing formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction was shown to retain the lowest global warming potential among the considered options.","[Kim, Changsoo; Kim, Kyeongsu; Lee, Ung] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Clean Energy Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Lee, Younggeun] Yullin Technol Co Ltd, Syst Res Ctr, Seoul 06245, South Korea; [Lee, Ung] Korea Univ Sci & Technol UST, KIST Sch, Div Energy & Environm Technol, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Lee, Ung] Korea Univ, Green Sch, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); University of Science & Technology (UST); Korea University,"Kim, K; Lee, U (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Clean Energy Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea.;Lee, U (corresponding author), Korea Univ Sci & Technol UST, KIST Sch, Div Energy & Environm Technol, Seoul 02792, South Korea.;Lee, U (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Green Sch, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",kyeongsu@kist.re.kr; ulee@kist.re.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2020M3H7A1098259],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (no.

There is increasing evidence that agricultural intensification affects soil biodiversity (SBD) and such changes may impact on current and future food security. Here, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art on the relations between agricultural management, SBD and food production. The potential of applying such knowledge to improve food security and nutrition is discussed. Biotechnological methods to describe impacts of agricultural practices on taxonomic and functional diversity of soil organisms are advancing rapidly. At the same time new understanding of soil-plant interactions has provided novel insights into the mechanisms by which soil organisms and plants co-regulate plant growth and defences, or affect food nutritional quality and safety. Yet, empirical studies on SBD - plant productivity relations often lead to results and applications that are crop and context specific. Translating knowledge on SBD into universally applicable soil management recommendations to enhance food production, and ultimately food security, remains challenging. Instead, we propose a holistic approach to SBD management that strengthens multiple ecosystem functions and provides ecological insurance.","[El Mujtar, V.; Tittonell, P.] INTA, Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Munoz, N.] INTA, Ctr Agr & Livestock Res, Cordoba, Argentina; [Prack Mc Cormick, B.] Univ Nacl Lomas Zamora, Fac Ciencias Agr, Lab Suelos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Prack Mc Cormick, B.; Tittonell, P.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pulleman, M.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Agroecosyst & Sustainable Landscapes Res Area, Cali, Colombia; [Pulleman, M.] Wageningen Univ, Soil Biol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); National University of Lomas de Zamora; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Wageningen University & Research,"El Mujtar, V (corresponding author), INTA, Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",elmujtar.veronica@inta.gob.ar,"Mujtar, Verónica El/AAG-4055-2020; McCormick, Barbara Prack/AAR-4399-2021; Pulleman, Mirjam/C-1207-2014","Mujtar, Verónica El/0000-0003-0401-2423; McCormick, Barbara Prack/0000-0002-9066-9749; Pulleman, Mirjam/0000-0001-9950-0176",,,,,127,51,52,7,88,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-9124,,,GLOB FOOD SECUR-AGR,Glob.

The 2011 project which was presented at INTED 2013 resulted in the opening of a new line of inquiry into digital citizenship and online safety. As students spend more time in online affinity spaces dedicated to text creation and these new media are incorporated into teaching and learning in the classroom, it is important to more fully understand the potential and the inherent challenges represented by the convergence of new media, popular culture and participatory creative culture. Teachers must be aware of the digital landscape and the spaces in which students are living and learning. Students are active and engaged in participatory networks, creating and distributing messages and texts via online and interpersonal networks. With access to inexpensive tools for capturing, editing, and organizing young people have the ability to generate multimedia content to promote personal and political interests. Young people in unprecedented numbers are usurping traditional media content providers by utilizing video sharing sites, collaboratively sustained knowledge banks, and fan generated entertainment sites. This research is part of a larger project to understand the pedagogical response to such unprecedented developments in students' literacy practices. It is important to more fully understand the role of text creation in participatory creative cultures and to allow teachers to better prepare students to be critical of the media they consume while creating supportive, affirming and safe learning communities in which to develop important digital literacy and new media skills. Digital media theorist Howard Rheingold calls for a participative pedagogy which focuses on guiding literacies essential to life in the 21st century. Educators are just beginning to ask what this participative pedagogy looks like, and an important first step to more fully understand the space of online participatory media. This paper presents the results of research in which student participants (aged 18-25) were asked to complete an online survey to determine the nature of their experience when creating texts in online affinity spaces (i.e. Tumblr, Deviant Art, Fanfiction. com etc.) The survey attempted to determine: the characteristics of online text creation spaces and how they are similar or different from each other; the experiences of students while creating in these spaces; and how participants use privacy and control features of the sites to influence the climate within the affinity space and mitigate the participation of other members of the site. The research attempts to understand the strategies young people employ to construct their personal networked spaces to facilitate communication, participation and to harness collective intelligence to enhance their own literacy practices.","[Howard, P.] Cape Breton Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Howard, P (corresponding author), Cape Breton Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,6,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-616-8412-0,INTED PROC,,,2014,,,,,5658,5658,,,,,,1,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BE0SN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000366835105104,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Halilovic, S",,,,"Halilovic, Safvet",,,ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION IN SPAIN - A MAGNIFICIENT EXAMPLE OF INTERACTION AND UNITY OF RELIGION AND SCIENCE,PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Islamic civilization; Spain; religion; science; cooperation; unity,,"Islam and its followers had created a civilization that played very important role on the world stage for more than a thousand years. One of the most important specific qualities of the Islamic civilization is that it is a well-balanced civilization that brought together science and faith, struck a balance between spirit and matter and did not separate this world from the Hereafter. This is what distinguishes the Islamic civilization from other civilizations which attach primary importance to the material aspect of life, physical needs and human instincts, and attach greater attention to this world by striving to instantly satisfy desires of the flesh, without finding a proper place for God and the Hereafter in their philosophies and education systems. The Islamic civilization drew humankind closer to God, connected the earth and heavens, subordinated this world to the Hereafter, connected spirit and matter, struck a balance between mind and heart, and created a link between science and faith by elevating the importance of moral development to the level of importance of material progress. It is owing to this that the Islamic civilization gave an immense contribution to the development of global civilization. Another specific characteristic of the Islamic civilization is that it spread the spirit of justice, impartiality and tolerance among people. The result was that people of different beliefs and views lived together in safety, peace and mutual respect, and that mosques stood next to churches, monasteries and synagogues in the lands that were governed by Muslims. This stems primarily from the commandments of the noble Islam according to which nobody must be forced to convert from their religion and beliefs since freedom of religion is guaranteed within the Islamic order. The Islamic civilization in Spain encompasses many fields that left a profound imprint in the Iberian Peninsula and Europe. The cultural climate of Spain in the era of Muslim rule (711-1492) brought about a prospering of different aspects of science and culture. Numerous schools and libraries were established and books were procured due to which the majority of the people were literate. Literature and art flourished. Buildings were constructed and Islamic art with its specific qualities was cultivated. As a result of that movement, Cordoba became the civilization capital of both Spain and the West in general. Many schools were established in it, such as medical and technical schools in addition to the general education and other vocational schools. Hospitals, chemical plants and observatories were also built. The university in Cordoba was a beacon of thought, education and culture, and it made Cordoba the home of science and of a great number of scholars and scientists in medicine, pharmacy, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics and botany. Scholarly disciplines such as philosophy and logic were also studied and busy translation activities were underway. For that reason travelers and people in quest for knowledge and science from different European countries used to come to Cordoba. This scientific and civilizational movement was not limited to Cordoba alone, but also spread into other cities of Spain, such as Granada, Toledo and other cities under Islamic rule. Relevant historical sources state that young men from Europe, particularly from Italy and France, competed to enroll some of the Islamic universities in Andalusia. One of the students of the university in Cordoba was Gerbert, who later became known as Pope Sylvester II. He introduced science of mathematics and Arabic numerals in Italy. The same historical sources also read that Europe was acquainted with Aristotle's manuscripts via the city of Toledo which was a center of bustling translation work from the Arabic into the Latin language. It was in Toledo that many works of Plato and Galen were translated, as were the philosophy manuscripts by Ibn Sina, al-Farabi, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Rushd, and the medical manuscripts by Ibn Sina and al-Razi. These manuscripts quickly spread all over Europe and became a mandatory literature at great European universities. Ibn Sina's Al-Qanun fi al-tibb was considered the fundamental reference book in studies of medicine in Europe for nearly six centuries and was called The Canon of Medicine. This paper cites numerous examples of interaction and unity of religion and science in the times when Islamic culture and civilization flourished in the Iberian Peninsula, the era that lasted for almost eight centuries.","[Halilovic, Safvet] Univ Zenica, Fac Islamic Educ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zenica,"Halilovic, S (corresponding author), Univ Zenica, Fac Islamic Educ, Tafsir & Quran Anthropol, J Neidharta 15, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg.;Halilovic, S (corresponding author), Univ Zenica, Fac Islamic Educ, Board Trustees, Int Union Muslim Scholars, J Neidharta 15, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg.",safwatmustafa25@yahoo.com,,,,,,,24,2,2,1,14,MEDICINSKA NAKLADA,ZAGREB,"VLASKA 69, HR-10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA",0353-5053,,,PSYCHIAT DANUB,Psychiatr.

Being able to adequately close the water budget gives confidence in our ability to model and/or observe the spatio-temporal variations in the water cycle and its components. Due to advances in observation techniques, satellite sensors, and modelling, a number of data products are available that represent the components of water budget in both space and time. Despite these advances, closure of the water budget at the global scale has been elusive. In this study, we attempt to close the global water budget using precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff data at the catchment scale. The large number of recent state-of-the-art datasets provides a new evaluation of well-used datasets. These estimates are compared to terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes as measured by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We investigated 189 river basins covering more than 90 % of the continental land area. TWS changes derived from the water balance equation were compared against GRACE data using two metrics: the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the cyclostationary NSE. These metrics were used to assess the performance of more than 1600 combinations of the various datasets considered. We found a positive NSE and cyclostationary NSE in 99 % and 62 % of the basins examined respectively. This means that TWS changes reconstructed from the water balance equation were more accurate than the long-term (NSE) and monthly (cyclostationary NSE) mean of GRACE time series in the corresponding basins. By analysing different combinations of the datasets that make up the water balance, we identified data products that performed well in certain regions based on, for example, climatic zone. We identified that some of the good results were obtained due to the cancellation of errors in poor estimates of water budget components. Therefore, we used coefficients of variation to determine the relative quality of a data product, which helped us to identify bad combinations giving us good results. In general, water budget components from ERA5-Land and the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) performed better than other products for most climatic zones. Conversely, the latest version of CLSM, v2.2, performed poorly for evapotranspiration in snow-dominated catchments compared, for example, with its predecessor and other datasets available. Thus, the nature of the catchment dynamics and balance between components affects the optimum combination of datasets. For regional studies, the combination of datasets that provides the most realistic TWS for a basin will depend on its climatic conditions and factors that cannot be determined a priori.

This shift can be attributed to increasingly unfavorable environmental conditions for cod reproduction at that time: critical salinity and oxygen levels, needed for successful egg and larval development, deteriorated. Yet, significant inflows of salt- and oxygen-rich water from the North Sea or improved eutrophication management might trigger a shift back to a more productive regime. Coupling a statistical recruitment model to a state-of-the-art, age-structured bio-economic model of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery, we study how optimal management depends on the uncertainty about the future productivity regime. We extend the predominantly theoretical literature on optimal management of a natural resource with a potential regime shift by analyzing an empirical model of age-structured population dynamics and by allowing for the possibility of a back-shift from a bad into a good regime. We find that with a higher probability of a shift back to the more productive regime the optimal management of the fishery becomes more conservative in the short run. We conclude that these benefits for the fishery warrant strong action reducing eutrophication to increase the probability of a regime shift back to high reproductive potential of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery.","[Voss, Rudi; Quaas, Martin] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Biodivers Econ, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Voss, Rudi] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Quaas, Martin] Univ Leipzig, Dept Econ, Leipzig, Germany",University of Kiel; Leipzig University,"Voss, R (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Biodivers Econ, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",voss@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01LC1826A, 03F08768]; BONUS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [773713]",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BONUS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Grant/Award Numbers: 01LC1826A marEEshift, 03F08768 CO2Meso; BONUS, Grant/Award Number: BLUEWEBS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 773713 PANDORA",,75,4,4,4,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0890-8575,1939-7445,,NAT RESOUR MODEL,Nat.

They emitted large quantities of smoke, trace gases and aerosols which were transported downwind over the highly populated regions of Manchester and Liverpool. Surface observations of PM2.5 indicate that concentrations were 4-5.5 times higher than the recent seasonal average. State-of-the-art satellite measurements of total column carbon monoxide (TCCO) from the TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel 5-Precursor (S5P) platform, coupled with measurements from a flight of the UKBAe-146-301 research aircraft, are used to quantify the substantial enhancement in emitted trace gases. The aircraft measured plume enhancements with near-fire CO and PM2.5 concentrations >1500 ppbv and >125 mu g m(-3) (compared to similar to 100 ppbv and similar to 5 mu g m(-3) background concentrations). Downwind fire-plume ozone (O-3) values were larger than the near-fire location, indicating O-3 production with distance from source. The near-fire O-3:CO ratio was (Delta O-3/Delta CO) 0.001 ppbv/ppbv, increasing downwind to 0.060-0.105 ppbv/ppbv, suggestive of O-3 production enhancement downwind of the fires. Emission rates of CO and CO2 ranged between 1.07 (0.07-4.69) kg s(-1) and 13.7 (1.73-50.1) kg s(-1), respectively, similar to values expected from a medium sized power station.","[Graham, A.

Named IRIS, the forecasting system was primarily designed and developed to support the operational fire suppression activities of the Greek Fire Service. It employs a coupled atmosphere-fire modeling system, comprised of a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model and an advanced fire spread model, accounting for the two-way interactions between fire and weather. For the implementation of IRIS, a prototype fuel models' geospatial dataset was constructed for Greece, exploiting high-resolution, open-source pan-European vegetation and land use datasets of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. Calibration of the fire spread component of IRIS was carried out by retrospective forecasting of 8 wildfires that took place in Greece during the 2016-2017 fire seasons, while the evaluation of the calibrated forecasting system was conducted by forecasting 4 major wildfires of the 2018 fire season. Our overarching aim was to assess the capacity of IRIS for providing accurate real-time wildfire spread simulations. Results clearly highlight that reasonably accurate fire spread predictions can be obtained by proper calibration of the fire spread component. IRIS will be operationally deployed in Greece during the 2019 fire season, providing 6 h and 24 h wildfire spread forecasts, when necessary, in about 15 min and 60 min, respectively. To our best knowledge, IRIS is one of the few operational fire spread forecasting systems based on coupled atmosphere-fire modeling.","[Giannaros, Theodore M.; Kotroni, Vassiliki; Lagouvardos, Konstantinos] Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Natl Observ Athens, Athens 15236, Greece",National Observatory of Athens,"Giannaros, TM (corresponding author), Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Natl Observ Athens, Athens 15236, Greece.",thgian@noa.gr,"Kotroni, Vassiliki/D-5336-2014; Lagouvardos, Konstantinos/D-5683-2014; Giannaros, Theodore M./ABB-8472-2020","Giannaros, Theodore M./0000-0003-1138-3724","European Union (European Research Development Fund); European Union (Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance); National Funds, under the INTERREG Balkan-Mediterranean 2014-2020 cooperation program (program DISARM)","European Union (European Research Development Fund); European Union (Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance); National Funds, under the INTERREG Balkan-Mediterranean 2014-2020 cooperation program (program DISARM)","The current work has been co-funded by the European Union (European Research Development Fund & Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance) and National Funds, under the INTERREG Balkan-Mediterranean 2014-2020 cooperation program (program DISARM).",,66,13,13,3,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

Currently such performance is assessed using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather files. TMY3 is the latest TMY file introduced by Department of Energy (DOE) and it represents the historical 30-year average of weather data more closely than any other available datasets. However, TMY3 data reflects the past and do not accurately forecast weather information thus leading to erroneous estimation of performance and economic feasibility. Therefore, more accurate methods are necessary to generate weather files so as to design buildings for sustainability and resilience. This article proposes an effective hybrid modeling methodology based on support vector machine regression and probability estimation to predict long term future weather variables. The methodology has been validated by using a dataset containing historical solar irradiance data for 54 years (1961-2014) for Cincinnati, Ohio. By implementing the proposed technique multiple models were trained with different segments of the dataset, which were used to predict the hourly solar irradiance for 8, 9, 10 and 11 years respectively. Subsequently, the predicted data and the current TMY3 data was compared with the actual historical data. The average increase in accuracy of the predicted over TMY3 direct normal and diffuse horizontal components of solar irradiance was found to be 38.43% and 11.8%. These findings suggest that the long term accuracy of the proposed modeling technique is greater than the current state-of-the-art. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It turned agriculture in India from a household occupation to an industrial system. This phase of rapid industrialization was brought about by the use of improved crop varieties, modern methods of cultivation and use of pesticides and herbicides. However, uncontrolled and excessive use of synthetic growth enhancers, pesticides and fungicide chemicals, has given rise to problems related with soil health, sustainability of productivity, environment stability and health etc. As a result, novel alternative approaches utilizing environmentally benign bio-fertilizers/bio-pesticides, as substitutes to harmful agro-chemicals, came into use so as to ensure human health and environment safety. In more recent times, population explosion and climate changes due to global warming have put additional strain on agricultural scientists to grow sufficient food from less arable land. Therefore, the present era focuses on innovative technologies which are oriented towards addressing the current challenges of sustainability, food safety and security and environment health. Researchers all over the world are exploring the feasibility of various innovative approaches, including nano-technological interventions, for improvement in agricultural sector. State-of-art research has identified the potential of highly innovative nano-material applications in food production. Nanotechnology, though not a recent concept, offers a diverse array of conceptual applications in the field of agriculture aimed at improving plant health and productivity. Nano-based products like nano-fertilizers, nano-diagnostics, nano-fertigation products and nano-pesticides, etc. offer multifaceted advantage over their macro-chemical counterparts. Nano-fertilizers and fertigation based products intend to optimize nutrient use by crops through exploiting properties unique to nanoparticles. Their application is more effective and at lower concentrations than the huge amounts of chemical fertilizers which are responsible for soil degradation and contribute to pollution of surface and underground water resources. The use of smart delivery system enables nutrient management with minimal nutrient losses and maximal yield optimization. Additionally, nano-based smart sensors are useful in precision farming thus enabling maximum productivity from crops while reducing the input costs incurred on excessive nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, irrigation, etc., through rigorous monitoring of physical growth variables and regulated release mechanisms. Moreover, nano-sensors and nano-biosensors are useful for monitoring of soil pH, and soil composition parameters. Other interesting areas of scientific investigations are genetic manipulation of plants through nano-based gene delivery systems and enhancing the nutraceutical value of crops through nano-biofortification. Despite the huge amount of patents and published data on the numerous benefits of nanotechnology in farming sector, this technology has not yet been exploited to its fullest potential. However, it is apparent that nanotechnology marks a new horizon and is a promising technology for revolutionizing modern agriculture.","[Pande, Anjali; Arora, Sandeep] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Mol Biol & Genet Engn, CBSH, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India",Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture Technology,"Arora, S (corresponding author), GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Mol Biol & Genet Engn, CBSH, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India.",,"Pande, Anjali/ABH-2333-2021","Pande, Anjali/0000-0002-6701-5018; Arora, Sandeep/0000-0002-1710-7141",,,,,73,0,0,1,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-13-8499-8; 978-981-13-8498-1,,,,2019,,,,,375,395,,10.1007/978-981-13-8499-8_17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-8499-8_17,10.1007/978-981-13-8499-8,,21,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Plant Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Plant Sciences,BR2EZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000637543800019,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, Succineidae shells are less common in loess deposits in the Mississippi Valley compared to those of the Polygyridae, Helicinidae, and Discidae families. In this study, we conducted several tests to determine whether shells of these gastropods could provide reliable ages for loess deposits in the Mississippi Valley. Our results show that most of the taxa that we investigated incorporate small amounts (1-5%) of old carbon from limestone in their shells, meaning that they should yield ages that are accurate to within a few hundred years. In contrast, shells of the genus Mesodon (Mesodon elevatus and Mesodon zaletus) contain significant and variable amounts of old carbon, yielding ages that are up to a couple thousand C-14 years too old. Although terrestrial gastropod shells have tremendous potential for C-14 dating loess deposits throughout North America, we acknowledge that accuracy to within a few hundred years may not be sufficient for those interested in developing high-resolution loess chronologies. Even with this limitation, however, C-14 dating of terrestrial gastropod shells present in Mississippi Valley loess deposits may prove useful for researchers interested in processes that took place over multi-millennial timescales or in differentiating stratigraphic units that have significantly different ages but similar physical and geochemical properties. The results presented here may also be useful to researchers studying loess deposits outside North America that contain similar gastropod taxa.

In this respect, folklore studies lead not only to the field of language and literature, but also to the studies of sociology, history and cultural science. While the reconciliation between dream and real life is conveyed in fairy tales; every nation expresses its struggle to achieve the standard of living, prosperity and happiness with their own unique symbols. The symbols, which have great meaning for the public, can consist of original animals or some mythological beings. Undoubtedly, one of these symbols is the symbol of the snake, and for centuries the snake symbol has taken an important place in many cultures and beliefs. The snake which is considered to have a mysterious power, mostly carried symbolic meanings such as good luck, health, guardian spirit, vitality, youth, immortality, eternity, healing, revival, and the soul that drives people to evil. The snake, which had an important place in the life of mankind from the primitive period, was seen as an important metaphor at the present time. The concept of snake has been associated with gods, goddesses and rulers in Mesopotamian, Anatolian and Egyptian cultures. In ancient Greece, the snake was associated with health. It was portrayed as a cunning and double-headed creature in Scandinavian and Celtic culture. In this case; in some religions and cultures, the snake was considered sacred, and in some cultures, it was considered a cursed being. This concept will continue to live in science, literature, mythology, faith and art due to the subconscious brought by its historical adventure and the mysterious residue left in the memory of history. The main purpose of our study is to examine the fairytales Shahmaran and The Mistress of the Copper Mountain, which belong to two different cultures; based on the works taken from the oral cultures of both societies and contributed to literature, the content, subject, plot, purpose and end of the tale belonging to these cultures are discussed from different perspectives. To examine the content, purpose and result of both fairy tales in detail and identify the common and different characteristics of the protagonist (snake woman) in both tales, and make inferences about their culture as a result of the comparison. Basically, besides intercultural exchange and historical ties; beliefs play a major role in shaping these similarities in the livelihoods of the society, climate and geographical conditions. In this context, our study aims to open new discussion topics by shedding light to guide new research in the field of comparative folklore in the future. Although the study is similar to Hippolyte Taine's theory of environment, race, and time, it is a different attempt at comparison.","[Ramazanova, Selale] Ardahan Univ, Insani Bilimler & Edebiyat Fak, Rus Dili & Edebiyat Bolumu, Ardahan, Turkey; [Altinkaynak, Erdogan] Ardahan Univ, Insani Bilimler & Edebiyat Fak, Turk Dili & Edebiyat Bolumu, Ardahan, Turkey; [Mercan, Ayse] Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat Univ, Yabanci Diller Yuksekokulu Yabanci Diller Bolumu, Alanya, Turkey",Ardahan University; Ardahan University; Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University,"Ramazanova, S (corresponding author), Ardahan Univ, Insani Bilimler & Edebiyat Fak, Rus Dili & Edebiyat Bolumu, Ardahan, Turkey.",shramazan18@gmail.com; erdoganaltinkaynak@ardahan.edu.tr; ayse_mercan@mail.ru,"Shelale, Shalala Ramazanova/ACH-3209-2022","Shelale, Shalala Ramazanova/0000-0002-3252-6504",,,,,26,0,0,0,0,GELENEKSEL YAYINCILIK LTD STL,ANKARA,"GAZI MAH CAKIR SOK, 21-5 YENIMAHALLE, ANKARA, TURKEY",1300-3984,2146-8087,,MILLI FOLKLOR,Milli Folklor,,2022,134,,,,17,26,,,,,,10,Folklore,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,2Q4EK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000820377600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The consequential model bias can in principle originate from either an underestimation of CO sources or an overestimation of its sinks. We address both the role of surface sources and sinks with a series of MOZART (Model for Ozone And Related Tracers) model sensitivity studies for the year 2008 and compare our results to observational data from ground-based stations, satellite observations, and vertical profiles from measurements on passenger aircraft. In our base case simulation using MACCity (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate project) anthropogenic emissions, the near-surface CO mixing ratios are underestimated in the Northern Hemisphere by more than 20 ppb from December to April, with the largest bias of up to 75 ppb over Europe in January. An increase in global biomass burning or biogenic emissions of CO or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is not able to reduce the annual course of the model bias and yields concentrations over the Southern Hemisphere which are too high. Raising global annual anthropogenic emissions with a simple scaling factor results in overestimations of surface mixing ratios in most regions all year round. Instead, our results indicate that anthropogenic CO and, possibly, VOC emissions in the MACCity inventory are too low for the industrialized countries only during winter and spring. Reasonable agreement with observations can only be achieved if the CO emissions are adjusted seasonally with regionally varying scaling factors. A part of the model bias could also be eliminated by exchanging the original resistance-type dry deposition scheme with a parameterization for CO uptake by oxidation from soil bacteria and microbes, which reduces the boreal winter dry deposition fluxes. The best match to surface observations, satellite retrievals, and aircraft observations was achieved when the modified dry deposition scheme was combined with increased wintertime road traffic emissions over Europe and North America (factors up to 4.5 and 2, respectively). One reason for the apparent underestimation of emissions may be an exaggerated downward trend in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario in these regions between 2000 and 2010, as this scenario was used to extrapolate the MACCity emissions from their base year 2000. This factor is potentially amplified by a lack of knowledge about the seasonality of emissions. A methane lifetime of 9.7 yr for our basic model and 9.8 yr for the optimized simulation agrees well with current estimates of global OH, but we cannot fully exclude a potential effect from errors in the geographical and seasonal distribution of OH concentrations on the modelled CO.","[Stein, O.; Schultz, M.

We first focus on the information content of MOPITT CO column retrievals in terms of constraining CO emissions associated with biomass burning and fossil fuel/biofuel use. Our analysis shows that seasonal variation of biomass-burning CO emissions in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia can be characterized using monthly mean MOPITT CO columns. For the fossil fuel/biofuel source category the derived monthly mean emission estimates are noisy even when the error statistics are accurately known, precluding a characterization of seasonal variations of regional CO emissions for this source category. The derived estimate of CO emissions from biomass burning in southern Africa during the June - July 2000 period is significantly higher than the prior estimate ( prior, 34 Tg; posterior, 13 Tg). We also estimate that emissions are higher relative to the prior estimate in northern Africa during December 2000 to January 2001 and lower relative to the prior estimate in Central America and Oceania/Indonesia during April - May and September - October 2000, respectively. While these adjustments provide better agreement of the model with MOPITT CO column fields and with independent measurements of surface CO from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory at background sites in the Northern Hemisphere, some systematic differences between modeled and measured CO fields persist, including model overestimation of background surface CO in the Southern Hemisphere. Characterizing and accounting for underlying biases in the measurement model system are needed to improve the robustness of the top-down estimates.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD USA; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",Duke University; Science Systems and Applications Inc; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Arellano, AF (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",arellano@ucar.edu,"Arellano, Avelino, Jr./F-5674-2010; Arellano, Avelino/R-5795-2019; van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016; collatz, george j/D-5381-2012; Kasibhatla, Prasad/A-2574-2010; Randerson, James/Y-2550-2019","Arellano, Avelino/0000-0002-2615-5831; van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Kasibhatla, Prasad/0000-0003-3562-3737; Giglio, Louis/0000-0001-6312-7955",,,,,64,77,78,0,13,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

In comparison, faunal derived SSTs ( SIMMAX method) show that August SSTs in the Caribbean varied < 2 degrees C over the past 360 kyr, whereas February SSTs varied between 21.0 degrees C and 26.5 degrees C. Changes in the Mg/Ca-SST record contain a strong 23 kyr periodicity, suggesting the Mg/Ca-SST record reflects a warm season weighted SST average rather than an annual mean SST. Combining several dissolution indices, we identify brief periods of decreased carbonate preservation in our record and show that MIS 11 stands out as the most intensive dissolution cycle in the Caribbean over the last 460 kyr. Comparison of Caribbean SST change with a similar estimate of tropical SST variability in the western Pacific over the past 360 kyr reveals shifts in the east-west tropical SST gradient that are coeval with glacial-interglacial climate change and consistent both with a southward migration of the glacial ITCZ and with a glacial El Nino-like mode of tropical circulation.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Geol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Fodwin Lab Palaeoclimate Res, Cambridge CB3 3EQ, England",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Cambridge,"Schmidt, MW (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",mschmidt@eas.gatech.edu; mava@bas.ac.uk,,"Spero, Howard/0000-0001-5465-8607; Mleneck-Vautravers, Maryline/0000-0003-2534-219X",,,,,109,56,56,1,17,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,1525-2027,,GEOCHEM GEOPHY GEOSY,Geochem.

From this perspective, infrastructural solutions that augment water supplies, such as desalination, are seen as the way to overcome physical resource limits and resolve water scarcity. Drawing on theories of scarcity, risk perception, trust, and governance, we argue that past experiences with poor water quality and a long-standing mistrust of water providers create a particular mode of water scarcity: perceptual scarcity. This paper presents findings from household surveys conducted in two arid Latin American cities where large-scale desalination projects have been undertaken to provide potable water. While both projects use state-of-the-art desalination technology, our survey results indicate that the majority of respondents do not drink desalinated water from their taps and purchase bottled water instead. Our results show that, despite significant investments in infrastructure, respondents still lack an adequate supply of water that is perceived to be fit for human consumption. The two case studies provide empirical evidence that challenges the assumption that desalination technology will resolve water quality and water scarcity concerns. We conclude that institutional investments that promote a more reliable and trustworthy water governance system are as important as investments in physical infrastructure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

G1oFAS, in its operational version 2.1, combines the land surface model (Hydrology Tiled European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts - ECMWF - Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land, HTESSEL) from ECMWF's ERA5 with a hydrological and channel routing model (LIS-FLOOD). Furthermore, we analyse GloFAS' most recent version 3.1, which is not coupled to HTESSEL but uses the full configuration of LISFLOOD. Seasonal cycles as well as annual runoff trends are analysed for the major Arctic watersheds - Yenisei, Ob, Lena, and Mackenzie - where reanalysis-based runoff can be compared to available observed river discharge records. Furthermore, we calculate river discharge over the whole pan-Arctic region and, by combination with atmospheric inputs, storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and oceanic volume transports from ocean reanalyses, we assess closure of the non-steric water volume budget. Finally, we provide best estimates for every budget equation term using a variational adjustment scheme. Runoff from ERA5 and GloFAS v2.1 features pronounced declining trends induced by two temporal inhomogeneities in ERA5's data assimilation system, and seasonal river discharge peaks are underestimated by up to 50 % compared to observations. The new GloFAS v3.1 product exhibits distinct improvements and performs best in terms of seasonality and long-term means; however, in contrast to gauge observations, it also features declining runoff trends. Calculating runoff indirectly through the divergence of moisture flux is the only reanalysis-based estimate that is able to reproduce the river discharge increases measured by gauge observations (pan-Arctic increase of 2 % per decade). In addition, we examine Greenlandic discharge, which contributes about 10 % of the total pan-Arctic discharge and features strong increases mainly due to glacial melting. The variational adjustment yields reliable estimates of the volume budget terms on an annual scale, requiring only moderate adjustments of less than 3 % for each individual term. Approximately 6583 +/- 84 km(3) of freshwater leaves the Arctic Ocean per year through its boundaries. About two-thirds of this is contributed by runoff from the surrounding land areas to the Arctic Ocean (4379 +/- 25 km(3) yr(-1)), and about one-third is supplied by the atmosphere. However, on a seasonal scale budget residuals of some calendar months were too large to be eliminated within the a priori spreads of the individual terms. This suggests that systematical errors are present in the reanalyses and ocean reanalysis data sets, which are not considered in our uncertainty estimation.","[Winkelbauer, Susanna; Mayer, Michael; Seitner, Vanessa; Haimberger, Leopold] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria; [Mayer, Michael; Zsoter, Ervin; Zuo, Hao] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England",University of Vienna; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Winkelbauer, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria.",susanna.winkelbauer@univie.ac.at,,"Zuo, Hao/0000-0003-0860-5832; Winkelbauer, Susanna/0000-0003-2676-2057",Austrian Science Fund [P33177]; Copernicus Marine Environment Service [114-R&D-GLO-RAN-CMEMS Lot 8],Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Copernicus Marine Environment Service,This research has been supported by the Austrian Science Fund (grant no.

His long career enabled him to participate in the progress made in the science of restoration. To begin with, having acquired the expertise of his father-in-law Pierre Carlier-himself a restorer since the opening of the Museum Central des Arts in 1793-he restored the pictorial layer of works entrusted to him by his patron Landon, working outside the new official restoration circuit run by Bonnemaison. Maillot. subsequently demonstrated his skills on a series of recent canvases given by Louis XVIII to Paris churches, then was officially commissioned to restore prestigious works for royal palaces (the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles) and museums (David's Sacre de Napoleon). This was followed by masterpieces in the present-day Muskee du Louvre from a variety of periods and schools including Raphael's St. Michael, Lesueur's cycle of Saint Bruno, Rembrandt's Pilgrims at Emmaus, Vernet's Ports de France and others. The secret of Maillot's success was that he worked as a team along with his wife Emilie. Emilie's role was confined to subsidiary tasks-varnishing, standing in for Maillot in case of illness, and assisting him at Versailles in summer-while he carried out the restoration. We have the list of supplies purchased by Maillot and some of his writings that reveal a laudable awareness of the dangerous effect S of certain products. As a consequence these were only used sparingly. Moreover, in the secrecy of his studio he strove to perfect the techniques of restoration. His lengthy career was tarnished by a single scandal, concerning Ruben's The Peace of Angers where he was said to have neglected to remove some mildew. His responsibility, however, has still never been clearly established. Scott, lie became indispensable; so much so that, in 1822, Landon obtained his appointment to the daily restoration of works, thereby introducing the methods of preventive conservation that, are still in use: regular inspection of exhibition rooms and reserves, climate observation, dusting, selective varnishing etc. The death of his wife in 1836, old age, and, in 1848, the pressures of the competitive recruitment exam for restorers all combined to bring to ail end his collaboration with the new Musee National. Maillot retired after having restored, working behind the scenes, some 9000 paintings, and having entrusted to his two sons the pursuit of his projects, notably on the ceiling of Lemoyne's L'Apotheose d'Hercule in the Chateau de Versailles, which, with six years work, had been the undertaking of his life.","Musees Macon, Macon, France",,"Magnien, C (corresponding author), Musees Macon, Macon, France.",,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,2,CONSEIL MUSEES NATIONAUX,PARIS,"10 RUE DE L ABBAYE, 75006 PARIS, FRANCE",0035-2608,,,REV MUS FR-REV LOUVR,Rev.

It explores indigenous wisdom on their kinship with organic and inorganic sacred totems (plants, animals and features of the landscape) which are protected through relationships that inform governance. The ongoing community of practice and related projects make a case for standing together to address climate change. The paper was developed as part of a University of South Africa project together with the named authors. Mphatheleni Makaulule has developed an a priori and a posteriori approach to Ecosystemic governance that resonates with the work of Wangari Maathai. Makaulule's leadership in Venda that is discussed with fellow project members who are exploring how the agendas for COP 26 could be attained by fostering law informed by Bateson's concept an ecology of mind - which means an understanding of human beings' place within living systems and our need for both education and laws to protect ecosystems such as forests (which are the lungs of the world) and the water systems (which are the life blood of all living systems). The governance approach in Venda emphasised the need to think in terms of our relationships with all living systems. The idea of extending a sense of solidarity to others is explored deeply with Makaulule and colleagues by considering similar approaches in other places, such as the Amazon where Makaulule spent time learning from shamanic leaders, Ghana (where Akwasi Achemfuor has undertaken research), Northern Territory and South Australia (where McIntyre was mentored by Peter Turner and Olive Veverbrants). The paper also refers to the work of Widianingsih based on an in-depth discussion on the Kasepuhan Ciptagelar community in West Java that has also been protecting the forests for more than 300 years. The authors explore whether attributing personhood to nature, could be regarded as limiting a notion of mystical and pragmatic recognition of interbeing or even a form of colonising the notion of interbeing? We suggest that a community of practice approach (Wenger, 1999, Wenger et al., 2009) to support learning organisations and communities could support two-way education to enable cross cultural, cross disciplinary and transnational learning to support steps towards wellbeing through sharing our understanding of interbeing in dialogue, it became clear that transcendence through totemism, dreams and shamanistic rituals support a sense of oneness with nature, relationality as well as a sense of awe, solidarity and responsibility for others which is being increasingly recognised in the arts and sciences.","[McIntyre-Mills, Janet J.; Makaulule, Mphatheleni; Lethole, Patricia; Pitsoane, E.] Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa; [McIntyre-Mills, Janet J.; Wirawan, Rudolf] Adelaide Univ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Makaulule, Mphatheleni] Dzomo Mupo, ZA-0952 Vuwani, Limpopo Provinc, South Africa; [Arko-Achemfuor, Akwasi] Univ South Africa, Coll Educ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Widianingsih, Ida] Univ Indonesia Bandung, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Ctr Decentralizat & Participatory Dev Res, Bandung, Indonesia; [Widianingsih, Ida] Univ Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia",University of South Africa; University of Adelaide; University of South Africa; Universitas Padjadjaran,"McIntyre-Mills, JJ (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.;McIntyre-Mills, JJ (corresponding author), Adelaide Univ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",janet.mcintyre@adelaide.edu.au; mupofood@gmail.com; lethovp@unisa.ac.za; aachea@unisa.ac.za; ida.widianingsih@unpad.ac.id,"Widianingsih, Ida/AAN-8827-2020","Widianingsih, Ida/0000-0003-2472-5236; Arko-Achemfuor, Akwasi/0000-0002-7062-7664",CAUL,CAUL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions,,145,2,2,1,1,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1094-429X,1573-9295,,SYST PRACT ACT RES,Syst.

Yet, leakage remains both loosely conceptualized and poorly understood as a phenomenon in policy making. To fill this gap and broaden the leakage research agenda, we conduct a state-of-the-art review of scientific assessments on leakage (particularly on land use) and combine it with conceptual and analytical frameworks from the environmental governance literature. We then propose a rigorous definition of leakage, discuss frequently overlooked political dimensions, and develop a typology of leakage pathways. Our analysis of leakage through a governance lens yields five core insights: (1) Leakage is not simply a mechanistic phenomenon, but a complex governance issue involving questions of institutional fit, interactions, and political agency. (2) Although the land use literature traditionally focuses on leakage through markets or activity displacement, a governance lens shows that it also occurs through information, motivation, or institutional channels. (3) As policy-makers may act strategically, the unintentionally of leakage should not be assumed but rather become an object of research. (4) A phenomenon not initially regarded as leakage can come to be framed as such through the action of 'problem brokers' and changes in policy fields. (5) Policy-makers and researchers should broaden their focus from only avoiding leakage to seeking positive spillovers and institutional synergies. These insights are illustrated with examples from two cases relating to land use policy in Brazil and Southeast Asia.","[Lima, Mairon G. Bastos; Persson, U.

Poultry (meat and eggs) is the fastest growing livestock sector globally. Poultry housing, including both infrastructure and operating energy, may account for as much as 50% of the total non-renewable energy (non-RE) use and up to 20%-35% of some of the life cycle impacts of poultry production. The application of net zero energy (NZE) building technologies (i.e. that enable net zero non-RE consumption on site) for poultry housing represents a promising but under-considered mitigation strategy, which could help lessen reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Insights from commercial and residential net zero energy building (NZEB) research can, to a limited extent, inform design considerations for NZE poultry housing, but a variety of unique design consider-ations and challenges inherent to confined, intensive animal husbandry must be considered. Towards this end, this review seeks to: 1) identify insights from research of residential and commercial NZEBs that might be applied in designing NZE poultry housing; 2) quantify the magnitude and distribution of energy use in poultry housing in order to determine key energy consuming components; and 3) identify priority design considerations for NZEBs for intensive confined poultry production, taking into account the physiological requirements of poultry as well as specific requirements for intensive, confined production. To accomplish these goals, 249 relevant papers were identified and reviewed. It was found that, similar to commercial/residential applications, design strategies should focus on a combination of aspects respectively aimed at (1) reducing direct energy (DE) use via structural design, (2) improving the energy efficiency of active technology systems and (3) installing context-appropriate renewable energy (RE) generation systems. Some common passive design strategies like maximizing glazed area may be less applicable for poultry housing where photoperiod control is required. Heating (during heating seasons) and ventilation (during cooling seasons) are the two main contributors to DE use in poultry housing but vary considerably based on geography and climate. HVAC systems should hence be a priority focus, considering the high ventilation rates required in confined poultry housing in order to maintain air quality. However, any modifications to current technologies should be based on careful consideration of the physiological requirements of poultry (for example, ambient temperature, air quality, feed and water provision, etc.), along with local cli-matic factors, technical feasibility and availability of alternative technologies, as well as both environmental and economic payback times.","[Li, Y.; Arulnathan, V; Heidari, M.

Several electric alternatives are currently operationalized, and the debate about which is most suitable is attracting considerable attention. This article provides a detailed review of various performance features for three categories of electric buses: hybrid, fuel cell, and battery. Economic, operational, energy, and environmental characteristics of each technology are reviewed in detail based' on simulation models and operational data presented by various scholars in different contexts. The study develops a holistic assessment of electric buses based on side-by-side comparison of 16 features that best inform the decision making process. The review indicates that the selection process of electric technology is highly sensitive to operational context and energy profile. In addition, it highlights that hybrid buses will not provide a significant reduction in GHG and would be suitable only for short-term objectives as a stepping-stone towards full electrification of transit. Battery and fuel cell buses are arguably capable of satisfying the current operational requirements, yet initial investment remains a major barrier. Overnight Battery Electric Bus is advocated as the most suitable alternative for bus transit contexts given the expected improvements in battery technology and the trend to utilize sustainable sources in electricity generation.

Since economic development is usually associated with increasing demand for railway transport as more and more passengers rely on railways, the consequence of disruptions to the railway system becomes unaffordable and creates significant impact on society and economies. Hence, there is a growing need for effective mitigation strategies and greater appreciation of the linkage between vulnerability analysis and policy implementation. This paper reviews recent studies of methods applied for vulnerability analysis of rail transport systems and assesses their policy or strategy-related content. The result shows the predominance of topological approaches in the railway vulnerability analysis context; however, very few provide concrete policy-or strategy -related implications and suggestions. The findings also show that the link between research in the context of vulnerability analysis and risk analysis is weak, and practice-oriented studies are limited; this is identified as an area for future work. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive insight into the state-of-the-art vulnerability analysis of rail transport systems, drawing on both research and practice and offers a guide for future studies. The remaining gap between theory and policymaking is clearly elaborated.","[Hong, Wei -Ting; Clifton, Geoffrey; Nelson, John D.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport, Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hong, WT (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Inst Transport, Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",wei-ting.hong@sydney.edu.au,,"Nelson, John/0000-0003-2199-7412; Hong, Wei-Ting/0000-0002-9494-025X",Taiwan Ministry of Education-University of Sydney Scholarship;  [SC3261],Taiwan Ministry of Education-University of Sydney Scholarship; ,Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding provided in the form of a Taiwan Ministry of Education-University of Sydney Scholarship and the funding code is SC3261.,,86,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Three scenarios have been produced based on different input assumptions and leading to different underlying patterns of growth and resulting volumes of traffic. Data for aviation growth and hence fuel demand have been projected on a year by year basis up to 2030, using 2010 as the baseline. Data sources are Eurostat statistics and actual flight information from EUROCONTROL. Relevant variables such as the number of flights, the type of aircrafts, passengers or cargo tonnes and production indicators (RPKs) are used together with fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data. The target of the European Advanced Biofuels Flightpath to ensure the commercialization and consumption of 2 million tons of sustain ably produced paraffinic biofuels in the aviation sector by 2020, has also been taken into account. Results regarding CO2 emission projections to 2030, reveal a steady annual increase in the order of 3%, 1% and 4% on average, for the three different scenarios, providing also a good correlation compared to the annual traffic growth rates that are indicated in the three corresponding scenarios. In absolute values, these ratios correspond to the central, the pessimistic and the optimistic scenarios respectively, corresponding to 360 million tonnes CO2 emissions in 2030, ranging from 271 to 401 million tonnes for the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, respectively. This article also reports on the supply potential of aviation biofuels (clustered in HEFA/HVOs and biojet) based on the production capacity of facilities around the world and provides an insight on the current and future trends in aviation based on the European and national policies, innovations and state-of-the art technologies that will influence the future of sustainable fuels in aviation.

Smart indoor farms offer the potential to remedy the shortfalls of conventional farms by providing a controlled, intelligent, and smart environment. This paper presents a three-dimensional perspective consisting of soilless farming, energy harvesting, and smart technologies, which could be considered as the three important characteristics of smart indoor farms. A six-layer smart indoor farms architecture has also been proposed, which explains how data are collected using various sensors and devices and then transmitted onto the cloud infrastructure for further analysis and control through various layers. Artificial lighting, smart nutrition management, and artificial climate control, to name a few, are some of the important requirements for smart indoor farms while considering control and service management factors. The major bottleneck in installing such systems is both the economical and the technical constraints. However, with the evolution of technology (and when they become widely available in the near future), a more favourable farming scenario may emerge. Furthermore, smart indoor farms could be viewed as a potential answer for meeting the demands of a sustainable agricultural revolution as we move closer to Agriculture 4.0.

Systematic analysis of trait data is hampered by the lack of a standardized vocabulary and difficulties in extracting structured information from these knowledge sources. Therefore, the Flora Phenotype Ontology (FLOPO) was built by text mining floras for morphological entities and corresponding attributes (using PO and PATO), automated reasoning and subsequent manual curation. Consequently, FLOPO is comprised of a large number of morphological traits and phenotypes. By mobilizing such data from legacy literature, integration with data from other biodiversity data sources and images becomes possible: this includes (1) character matrices used for determination keys or morphology-based phylogenetics as well as (2) morphological traits extracted from other biodiversity literature such as taxonomic revisions and (3) traits extracted from images by pattern recognition. In this way, vast amounts of data are accessible for interlinkage with other domains, and for use in morphological, evolutionary, genetic, and ecological studies including species interactions and macroecology.

We use Sun photometer retrieved particle size distributions and monthly mean satellite-derived smoke emissions as input parameters. We find that using these observations in our model allows us to reproduce the measured optical properties collected during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative campaign ( SAFARI 2000). In particular, we find day-to-day oscillations in the simulated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) similar to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals, suggesting that variations in aerosol loading are controlled more by transport processes than fluctuations in smoke emissions. We also find that the simulated AOT, Angstrom exponent, and single scattering albedo compare well to AERONET. The model and satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) also show that the dominant transport of smoke plumes over Africa was westward during September 2000. However, the satellite observations show higher AOT values than our model over the Atlantic Ocean. These higher values observed by the satellites may be a result of poor single scattering assumptions and the contamination by subpixel clouds in the retrievals. However, the monthly mean smoke emissions may also be too low, resulting in low simulated AOT values. We also find discrepancies between MODIS and MISR, which limit our ability to use the satellite data to validate our model. Our work suggests strategies for improving the treatment of smoke aerosols from African biomass burning in climate and microphysical models.","Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Matichuk, RI (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",rebecca.matichuk@lasp.colorado.edu,"Colarco, Peter R/D-8637-2012","Colarco, Peter R/0000-0003-3525-1662",,,,,57,29,29,0,5,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The strategic situation of Ahvaz city, because of its abundant resources, the war experience and its location on the boundary regions of Iran, highlights its significance. Ahvaz has a high population and an extended texture, and the existence of extraordinary constructions increases the importance of physical resilience in this city. Design/methodology/approach The present study investigates built environment aspects such as the urban structure, the urban form, land-use proximity pattern, urban road network and crucial and vulnerable centres in Ahvaz, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Hence, the areas at risk in Ahvaz were identified and illustrated in a comprehensive risk assessment map, and then, by using the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats technique and finally by using the Delphi method, some strategies and plans were presented to reduce the level of vulnerability in Ahvaz. Then, these strategies are prioritized by applying quality function deployment (QFD) technique. Findings The risk assessment result shows that most parts of Ahvaz's urban areas are highly at risk. The central and northern parts of Ahvaz have the highest vulnerability at a time of crisis. These zones include district 1 (city centre) and districts 2, 3 and 7 at the city's margins. The result of QFD process showed that the essential urban resilience strategy is to positively consider the passive defence studies with a physical resilience approach. Also, the proper distribution of strategic points in the city, moving the industrial and oil companies from the peripheral area, and facilitating access to vital, crucial centres to support urban regions are considered the most effective strategic plans. Originality/value This paper, with an integrated approach, examines and prioritizes the main physical problems of Ahvaz city based on the spatial analysis and opinions of experts. The physical strategies presented in this paper can significantly reduce the risks and increase the urban resilience of Ahvaz city in the face of crisis.","[Pouryarmohammadi, Mozhdeh] Univ Guilan, Fac Architecture & Art, Rasht, Iran",University of Guilan,,hamed@guilan.ac.ir,"Salaripour, Aliakbar/AAA-6349-2022",,,,,,35,1,1,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-5908,1759-5916,,INT J DISASTER RESIL,Int.

The Flood Directive set up a series of measures to increase European resilience, establishing Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) at the level of the river basin district as one relevant action. In order to efficiently fulfil this objective, the involvement of stakeholders as well as the analysis of their roles, responsibilities, and demands has been considered to be crucial to develop FRMPs. As a result, the hypothesis tested in this paper is that a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian Flood Risk Management Plan is feasible. To demonstrate this, both in-depth interviews and questionnaires to key Austrian stakeholders are implemented. The information collected in both participatory techniques are then used to run a conflict prevention analysis. The results show that (a) improving the coordination among regions and including better land-use planning approaches are preferable to a hypothetical business as usual scenario; and (b) a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian FRMP might be achievable on the basis of both a deep discussion on the state-of-the art and green infrastructure development.

Many researchers believe that the construction industry can contribute significantly to carbon dioxide reduction through cleaner and more sustainable building production and construction, e.g. low energy building design and the use of low carbon materials. Nonetheless, the environmental impacts associated with construction process should not be underestimated. Despite that, as construction process is complex and involves many participants, the calculation of carbon emissions during the construction process is never an easy task. Divergence and limitation are found in both the system boundary and carbon sourcing method. This research aims to resolve the problem and facilitate construction managers to identify carbon emissions so as to optimize them through better construction arrangement. In this paper, the system boundary of the construction stage is first defined and the related activities being included in the construction process are identified. A methodology of establishing the sources of carbon emissions during the construction process based on a quota-based method of China is proposed. The calculation model for carbon emissions is established according to the traditional emission factor approach with some modifications. The carbon emitted during the construction process of a case teaching building is calculated using the proposed quota-based carbon tracing (QCT) model. The QCT model not only provides a systematic framework for the tracing of carbon emissions, it could also help construction managers identify low carbon construction methods and logistics schedule in order to maximize the carbon reduction opportunity during the construction stage.

Extant speciose clades that have only recently diverged are ideal study subjects, as they allow the examination of rapid morphological variation in a phylogenetic context, providing insights into a clade's evolution. Here, we focus on skull morphological variability in a widely distributed shrew species complex, the Crocidura poensis species complex. The relative effects of taxonomy, size, geography, climate and habitat on skull form were tested, as well as the presence of a phylogenetic signal. Taxonomy was the best predictor of skull size and shape, but surprisingly both size and shape exhibited no significant phylogenetic signal. This paper describes one of the few cases within a mammal clade where morphological evolution does not match the phylogeny. The second strongest predictor for shape variation was size, emphasizing that allometry can represent an easily accessed source of morphological variability within complexes of cryptic species. Taking into account species relatedness, habitat preferences, geographical distribution and differences in skull form, our results lean in favor of a parapatric speciation model within this complex of species, where divergence occurred along an ecological gradient, rather than a geographic barrier.","[Voet, Inessa; Denys, Christiane; Lalis, Aude; Delapre, Arnaud; Nicolas, Violaine; Cornette, Raphael] Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, EPHE, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,Inst Systemat Evolut Bi, CP51,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France; [Colyn, Marc] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, ECOBIO UMR 6553, Paimpont, France; [Konecny, Adam] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes; Masaryk University Brno,"Voet, I; Nicolas, V; Cornette, R (corresponding author), Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, EPHE, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,Inst Systemat Evolut Bi, CP51,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",inessa.voet@mnhn.fr; violaine.colin@mnhn.fr; raphael.cornette@mnhn.fr,"nicolas, violaine/N-9991-2017","nicolas, violaine/0000-0001-5384-7529",Action Transversale du Museum 2017 (CROCIDURA project); Projet federateur du departement Origines et Evolution 2020 (COLLCROC project),Action Transversale du Museum 2017 (CROCIDURA project); Projet federateur du departement Origines et Evolution 2020 (COLLCROC project),"This work was supported by the Action Transversale du Museum 2017 (CROCIDURA project), the Projet federateur du departement Origines et Evolution 2020 (COLLCROC project).

The central position of this plateau in the province's steppe would also be a crucial factor regarding this process (Belardi & Goni 2006). In this context, the aim of this work is to study this idea of population dynamics given the evidence from lithic technology. In order to do this, we first consider the analysis of variability and provenance of lithic raw materials used for the manufacture of artefacts. It is important to highlight that after 15 years of research carried out in the Strobel Plateau we have not found any lithic source. However, previous works suggest that lithic resources used in the Strobel Plateau are located in nearby areas. Therefore, when analysing the variability, provenance and distance of sources, this work seeks to discuss the access to the plateau and the regional circulation axes. The obtained results support the idea of population convergence occurring in Late Holocene.","[Flores Coni, Josefina] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Nacl Antropol & Pensamiento Latinoamer, Tres Febrero 1378, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Coni, JF (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Nacl Antropol & Pensamiento Latinoamer, Tres Febrero 1378, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",josefinafloresconi@gmail.com,,,Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Pensamiento Latinoamericano; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (PIP-CONICET) [11220120100442]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 201-0373],Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Pensamiento Latinoamericano; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (PIP-CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica(ANPCyT),This work was supported by Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Pensamiento Latinoamericano; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (PIP-CONICET No. 11220120100442); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT 201-0373).

In this research, the parameters related to thermal comfort outdoors like air temperature (Ta), surface temperature (Ts), wind speed (Ws), sky view factor (SVF), mean radiant temperature (MRT), and physiological equivalent temperature (PET) in an urban street were analyzed using ENVI-met simulation. Besides, the effects of the albedo of pavement and the percent of Fraxinous Exceliour as the dominant tree in the study area were also examined to improve thermal comfort conditions. Simultaneously with the field measurements on the site, a questionnaire was used to determine the thermal comfort range of users in urban canyons. The study also integrates with ENVI-met microclimatic modeling to improve the thermal comfort in the urban street canyon, which was used to simulate the current situation and validated with field measurements, showing a good correlation. The result has revealed that SVF is not a precise indicator for crucial radiation exposure and thermal comfort conditions despite its wide application in previous studies. Further, a notable correlation between SVF and PET is observed solely throughout sunset. Additionally, the combination of the low-albedo pavements and covering half of the street with trees (Fraxinus excelsior) can produce the most effective conditions for thermal comfort. The simulation research reveals that albedo's effect on thermal comfort is less prominent than the tree cover. However, significant changes in albedo values and a decrease in urban heat have no significant impact on improving thermal comfort in urban canyons.","[Mohammad, Pir] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India; [Aghlmand, Soheila] Urmia Univ, Dept Architecture, Architecture Urbanism & Art, Orumiyeh 5756151818, Iran; [Fadaei, Ashkan] Ecole Natl Super Architecture Paris La Villette, Paris, France; [Gachkar, Sadaf] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Restorat Hist Heritages, Tehran 1983969411, Iran; [Gachkar, Darya] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Tehran 1983969411, Iran; [Karimi, Alireza] Univ Seville, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construct, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Seville 41012, Spain",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee; Urmia University; Shahid Beheshti University; Shahid Beheshti University; University of Sevilla,"Mohammad, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.",pirmohammad291@gmail.com,Mohammad/ABG-3497-2020,"Mohammad/0000-0002-0075-6372; Karimi, Alireza/0000-0002-6296-9496",,,,,122,17,17,35,68,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,DEC,2021,,,,,,,100993,10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100993,,21-Oct,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WR9LW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000714815200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are known to effectively remove toxic metals (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc) and organic compounds (e.g., DDT, PCB) from contaminated soil, industrial effluents and wastewater treatment. Biosorption of toxic metal ions by dry seaweeds is a kind of biotreatment of polluted water. Also the bioremediation of nutrients, generated by intensive aquaculture (e.g., fish, shrimps and other aquatic animals) in so-called integrated multitrophic aquaculture makes use of seaweeds. Macroalgae derived from unpolluted water - e.g., eutrophicated natural water reservoirs or remediated wastewater from aquaculture can be used for the production of components of fertilizers, feed additives and biochar which provides a multitude of benefits in terms of environmental management, e.g., climate change mitigation due to carbon sequestration, remediation of contaminated sites (water, soil) due to very good sorption properties, plus the mitigation of contaminants movement in soil due to action as a landfill filter medium.

Natural ventilation is crucially important in the northern region of Iran due to its humid climate. Throughout history, the residents of this region have created airflow in their buildings by producing differential pressure. To do this, they have one shaded yard in the north of their homes and a sunny yard in the southern part of the building; due to temperature difference, the air moves from the high-pressure area to the low-pressure area, passing through the building and ventilating it. The yards are located in proper the parts of the building to change the temperature and pressure in hot seasons. This study aims to examine the effect of southern and northern yards on three properties in the northern region of Iran, in terms of improving natural ventilation in buildings. To do so, the temperatures of yards were simulated in different months of the year using simulation software. In the next step, the rates of ventilation of these buildings and their relationships with the temperatures and the geometrical shapes of the yards were evaluated by employing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results show that building 1 had the lowest and the most suitable average indoor temperature and the highest indoor velocity in the daytime, building 2 had the lowest and the most suitable nighttime indoor temperature, and the velocity increased in building 3 indoor at night. By doing this, the more suitable one in natural ventilation was identified. The results of this study can be utilized as a new method for ventilating buildings in densely populated cities.","[Valinejadshoubi, Masoud] Concordia Univ, Ctr Zero Energy Bldg Studies, Bldg Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Heidari, Sahar; Zamani, Pantea] Shomal Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Amol, Iran",Concordia University - Canada,"Valinejadshoubi, M (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Ctr Zero Energy Bldg Studies, Bldg Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",valinejad.masood@gmail.com; sahar.heidari.arch@gmail.com; pantea.zamani@yahoo.com,,,"Concordia University, Montreal, Canada","Concordia University, Montreal, Canada","The authors would like to express thanks to Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, for their support of present research.",,26,7,7,1,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

We have tested the efficacy of this approach for inferring average methane fluxes from regions of pastoral agriculture a few tens of km in extent In its simplest form, vertical concentration profiles are measured upwind and downwind of the target region, based on air samples collected from light aircraft. Using simple mass balance models, the profile contrasts can be related to the mean surface flux over the intervening region. The inferred flux can then be compared with 'bottom-up' estimates based on livestock density and per-animal emissions. However, such simple models may poorly simulate air flows over the New Zealand terrain, and as an alternative, we deploy a state-of-the-art mesoscale meteorological model, RAMS, coupled to an atmospheric dispersion model. RAMS is used prognostically to guide the timing and siting of measurement campaigns, and diagnostically to simulate regional wind fields which are validated against local meteorological data. Source-oriented and receptor-oriented dispersion modelling techniques, in combination with aircraft-based sampling and laboratory gas analysis, provide 'top-down' methane flux estimates that compare favourably with 'bottom-up' estimates. These techniques thus enhance confidence in national emission inventories based on bottom-up estimation. However, the challenge for similar verification of nitrous oxide emission is more imposing.","NIWA, Wellington, New Zealand",National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Lassey, KR (corresponding author), NIWA, POB 14-901 Kilbernie, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,5,5,5,1,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-6199-7,,,,2000,,,,,107,114,,,,,,8,Environmental Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BQ80J,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000089620400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This report summarises measured drying rates of different-aged masticated fuelbeds built from material collected from sites that were treated using one of four mastication techniques. We recreated three replicates of masticated fuelbeds in wire mesh cages using material collected from 13 sites sampled throughout the US Rocky Mountains. These caged fuelbeds were saturated and then their moisture contents were measured daily as they dried over 10 days in both a controlled growth chamber and outdoors. Relative moisture content after 24 and 96h of drying and a drying rate were response variables that were analysed across fuel age, drying environment and mastication method. While our sites occurred across different forest types and climates and the mastication equipment used was different, we found that all fuelbeds dried within 3% of the equilibrium moisture contents (3-6%) after similar to 96h for both growth chamber and outdoors under moderately dry environments. We also found that mastication method influenced fuelbed drying rates whereas age had little effect. Fire managers may use these drying rates to implement effective prescribed burns to reduce adverse impacts when masticated fuelbeds burn during wildfire conditions.","[Keane, Robert E.; Holsinger, Lisa M.; Smith, Helen Y.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula Fire Sci Lab, 5775 Highway 10 West, Missoula, MT 59808 USA; [Sikkink, Pamela G.] RTL Networks, Missoula Fire Sci Lab, 5775 Highway 10 West, Missoula, MT 59808 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Keane, RE (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula Fire Sci Lab, 5775 Highway 10 West, Missoula, MT 59808 USA.",rkeane@fs.fed.us,,,Joint Fire Science Program [JFSP 13-1-05-8]; University of Idaho JFSP [JFSP 13-1-05-7],Joint Fire Science Program; University of Idaho JFSP,"This effort was partially funded by the Joint Fire Science Program (grant number JFSP 13-1-05-8) and is a companion study with a University of Idaho JFSP-funded project (JFSP 13-1-05-7) with PennyMorgan, Alistair Smith and Robert Keefe as principal investigators.

Previous studies that used cloud-scale models as explicit forecast tools, in much the same way as a mesoscale model might be used, have met with limited success. Results presented in this paper suggest that this is due, at least in part, to the nature of cloud-scale models themselves. Results from over 700 cloud-scale model runs indicate that, in some cases, differences in the initial soundings that are smaller than can be measured by the current observing system result in unexpected differences in storm longevity. In other cases, easily measurable differences in the initial soundings do not result in significant differences in storm longevity. There unfortunately appears to be no set of parameters that can be used to determine whether the initial sounding is near some part of the cloud-model parameter space that displays this sensitivity. Because different cloud models share similar philosophies, if not similar design, this sensitivity to initial soundings places a fundamental limit on how well the current slate of cloud-scale models can be expected to perform as explicit forecast tools. Given these results, it is not clear that using state-of-the-art cloud-scale models as explicit forecasting tools is appropriate. However, cloud-model ensembles may help to address some inescapable problems with explicit forecasts from cloud models. The most useful application of cloud-scale models in operational forecasts may be a probabilistic one in which the models are used as members of ensembles, a process that has been demonstrated for models of larger-scale processes.","NOAA, Natl Severe Storms Lab, Norman, OK 73069 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Cooperat Inst Mesoscale Meteorol Studies, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Climate Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Elmore, KL (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Severe Storms Lab, 1313 Halley Circle, Norman, OK 73069 USA.",,"Elmore, Kimberly/AAH-7110-2021",,,,,,35,25,25,0,0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0882-8156,,,WEATHER FORECAST,Weather Forecast.,AUG,2002,4,,,,873,884,,10.1175/1520-0434(2002)017<0873:ECSMFO>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(2002)017<0873:ECSMFO>2.0.CO;2,,,12,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,574NY,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000176897500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The case study was conducted in Barcelona, a Mediterranean compact city. The World Cafe method was used in this work. Five categories of barriers and opportunities were discussed (social, environmental, legal/administrative, technological/architectural, and economic) by interdisciplinary stakeholders. A total of 129 barriers and opportunities were identified. The main barriers identified were as follows: the lack of information and social cohesion regarding UAGR projects; the Mediterranean climate; the lack of specific regulations and protocols; the initial investment; and the pre-condition of the roof and its load bearing capacity. The main opportunities were social cohesion; improved life quality; new specific regulations; the profits derived from UAGR projects; and aesthetic improvement. The UAGR's scale of impact results showed a homogeneous distribution between building and city, while the global scale remains residual. Regarding the stage of the UAGR life cycle at which barriers and opportunities emerge, the results highlight how most opportunities appear during the use stage of the roof, whereas barriers do so during the project stage.","[Zambrano-Prado, Perla; Pons-Gumi, David; Toboso-Chavero, Susana; Parada, Felipe; Gabarrell, Xavier; Rieradevall, Joan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals ICTA UAB, Sostenipra Res Grp Sostenipra 2017 SGR 1683, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Zambrano-Prado, Perla] Univ Guadalajara UdeG, CUAAD, Art Architecture & Design Univ Ctr, Dept Tech & Construct, Calzada Independencia Norte 5075, Guadalajara 44250, Jalisco, Mexico; [Toboso-Chavero, Susana; Gabarrell, Xavier; Rieradevall, Joan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Dept Chem Biol & Environm Engn, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Josa, Alejandro] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech UPC, Escola Camins, Civil Engn Sch, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DECA, Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D2, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Zambrano-Prado, P (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals ICTA UAB, Sostenipra Res Grp Sostenipra 2017 SGR 1683, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",perla.zambrano@academicos.udg.mx,"Rieradevall, Joan/AAB-6993-2022; Gabarrell Durany, Xavier/F-5575-2011","Parada Molina, Felipe/0000-0003-2845-236X; Toboso-Chavero, Susana/0000-0001-8475-5184; Gabarrell Durany, Xavier/0000-0003-1730-4337","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [862663]; Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence in RD [CEX2019-000940-M]; Barcelona city council; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU16/03238]; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research [72180248]; University of Guadalajara (Mexico)","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence in RD; Barcelona city council; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports(Spanish Government); National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research; University of Guadalajara (Mexico)","This research has received financial support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 862663.

This review presents recent advances in photochemical solar fuel production technology. Although efforts in this field have created an incredible number of methods to convert carbon dioxide into gaseous and liquid fuels, these can generally be classified under one of four categories based on how incident sunlight is utilised: solar concentration for thermoconversion (Category 1), transformation toward electroconversion (Category 2), natural photosynthesis for bioconversion (Category 3), and artificial photosynthesis for direct photoconversion (Category 4). Select examples of developments within each of these categories is presented, showing the state-of-the-art in the use of carbon dioxide as a suitable feedstock for solar fuel production.","[Batrice, Rami J.; Gordon, John C.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Inorgan Isotope & Actinide Chem, Div Chem, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Batrice, RJ; Gordon, JC (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Inorgan Isotope & Actinide Chem, Div Chem, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",batricer@lanl.gov; jgordon@lanl.gov,,"Batrice, Rami/0000-0001-5368-3106",Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) [20180705PRD1]; National Nuclear Security Administration of U.S. Department of Energy [89233218CNA000001],Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL); National Nuclear Security Administration of U.S. Department of Energy,"This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) under project numbers 20180705PRD1.

Plant scientists need a non-invasive, non-destructive method to quantitatively measure the 3D growth of plants. Traditional methods, for example, measuring weight, area or volume, often negatively affects the future plant growth. Also the manual nature of this measurement can be quite time consuming, tedious and error prone. Some recent effort have been reported in the literature about the construction of autonomous systems for plant phenotyping, but these are not practical for large scale accurate 3D plant growth computation.

The hepatitis E data used in this study are collected from January 2005 to March 2017 by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. ARIMA, GBDT, SVM, LSTM and Bi-LSTM models are adopted in this study. The data from January 2009 to September 2014 are used as the training set to fit models, and data from October 2014 to March 2017 are used as the testing set to evaluate the predicting accuracy of different models. Selecting models and evaluating the effectiveness of the models are based on mean absolute per cent error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). A total of 44 923 cases of hepatitis E are detected in Jiangsu Province from January 2005 to March 2017. The average monthly incidence rate is 0.35 per 100 000 persons in Jiangsu Province.

The Bi-LSTM model with the meteorological factors of temperature, water vapour pressure, and rainfall can fully extract the linear and non-linear information in the hepatitis E incidence data, and has significantly improved the interpretability, learning ability, generalisability and prediction accuracy.","[Cheng, Xiaoqing; Liu, Wendong; Zhang, Xuefeng; Bao, Changjun] Jiangsu Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Jiangsu Inst Publ Hlth, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiaoqing] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Chinese Field Epidemiol Training Program, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Minghao; Wu, Tianxing] Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Southeast University - China,"Bao, CJ (corresponding author), Jiangsu Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Jiangsu Inst Publ Hlth, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, MH; Wu, TX (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",wmh@seu.edu.cn; bao2000_cn@163.com; tianxingwu@scu.cdu.cn,,"Wu, Tianxing/0000-0003-4669-3570",Jiangsu Province Science & Technology Demonstration Project for Emerging Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention [BE2015714]; Key Medical Discipline of Epidemiology [ZDXKA2016008]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62006040]; Project for the Doctor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Jiangsu Province [JSSCBS20210126]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China and ZhiShan Young Scholar Program of Southeast University,Jiangsu Province Science & Technology Demonstration Project for Emerging Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention; Key Medical Discipline of Epidemiology; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project for the Doctor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Jiangsu Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China and ZhiShan Young Scholar Program of Southeast University,"This study is supported by Jiangsu Province Science & Technology Demonstration Project for Emerging Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention (No.BE2015714), Key Medical Discipline of Epidemiology (No. ZDXKA2016008), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62006040), the Project for the Doctor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Jiangsu Province (No. JSSCBS20210126), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China and ZhiShan Young Scholar Program of Southeast University.",,22,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0950-2688,1469-4409,,EPIDEMIOL INFECT,Epidemiol.

Similarly, GWL are influenced by storm induced ocean wave surge lasting few hours to a day. There has not been a detailed study on the conjunctive impact of such tidal and storm waves on coastal groundwater and its vulnerability. Through our coastal and field-laboratory observations at one of the world's most extreme climate affected regions, the Ganges river mega-delta, we delineate the influence of ocean wave surge impacts on the shallow (<24 m below ground level [m bgl]) and deep (115 m bgl) aquifers GWL. Our study on the multi-layered delta-front aquifers, adjoining the tropical BoB shows that the high-temporal resolution GWL fluctuation due to wave surges are instantaneous, rapid and synchronous at all depths of the aquifers. The potential rise of ocean waves caused by tropical cyclone Bulbul (November 2019) significantly increases the GWL, both in shallow and deeper aquifer. Using multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques, we have attempted to quantify the rise of GWL during each of the ocean wave surge event. The model shows good predictability for deeper groundwater, however it is unable to quantify the shallower GWL of each of the ocean wave surge during storm events. Such phenomenon indicates aquifer vulnerability, thereby posing an emerging threat to drinking water availability to millions of groundwater-dependent inhabitants in coastal areas, globally, which may rapidly intensify with increasing rates of tropical cyclones and sea level rise in recent times and impending future.","[Das, Kousik; Sarkar, Soumyajit; Mukherjee, Abhijit] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Mukherjee, Abhijit; Das, Prerona] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Geol & Geophys, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Mukherjee, Abhijit] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Appl Policy Advisory Hydrogeosci Grp, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Pathak, Amey] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Mukherjee, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Geol & Geophys, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",amukh2@gmail.com,"Sarkar, Soumyajit/AGX-8385-2022; Das, Dr. Kousik/AAF-7627-2020","Sarkar, Soumyajit/0000-0001-8270-2337; Das, Dr. Kousik/0000-0002-7914-2276","Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India [MOES/PAMC/HC/23/2013PC-II, MOES/PAMC/H&C/103/2017-PC-II]","Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India","Financial support for this work was provided by the Ministry of Earth Science, Government of India (vide no.

Remote sensing satellites commonly used for forest monitoring (eg, Landsat, SPOT) typically collect imagery with sufficient temporal frequency, but lack the requisite spatial and categorical detail for some forest inventory information needs. Aerial photography remains a principal data source for forest inventory; however, information extraction is primarily accomplished through manual processes. The spatial, categorical, and temporal information requirements of large-area forest inventories can be met through sample-based data collection. Opportunities exist for very high spatial resolution (VHSR; ie, <1 m) remotely sensed imagery to augment traditional data sources for large-area, sample-based forest inventories, especially for inventory update. In this paper, we synthesize the state-of-the-art in the use of VHSR remotely sensed imagery for forest inventory and monitoring. Based upon this review, we develop a framework for updating a sample-based, large-area forest inventory that incorporates VHSR imagery. Using the information needs of the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) for context, we demonstrate the potential capabilities of VHSR imagery in four phases of the forest inventory update process: stand delineation, automated attribution, manual interpretation, and indirect attribute modelling. Although designed to support the information needs of the Canadian NFI, the framework presented herein could be adapted to support other sample-based, large-area forest monitoring initiatives.","[Falkowski, Michael J.; Wulder, Michael A.; White, Joanne C.; Gillis, Mark D.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Wulder, MA (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 W Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",mike.wulder@nrcan.gc.ca,"Wulder, Michael A/J-5597-2016; White, Joanne C./Z-1981-2019","Wulder, Michael A/0000-0002-6942-1896; White, Joanne C./0000-0003-4674-0373",Canadian Space Agency (CSA); Canadian Forest Service (CFS) of Natural Resources Canada,Canadian Space Agency (CSA)(Canadian Space Agency); Canadian Forest Service (CFS) of Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service),This research was undertaken as part of the 'EcoMonitor: Northern Ecosystem Climate Change Monitoring from Space' project jointly funded by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP) and the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) of Natural Resources Canada.

Until now, intraseasonal variation in prey availability has been difficult to quantify in seabirds. Using a state-of-the-art ocean drift model of larval cod Gadus morhua, an important constituent of the diet of common guillemots Uria aalge in the southwestern Barents Sea, we were able to show clear, short-term correlations between food availability and measurements of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in parental guillemots over a 3-year period (2009-2011). The model allowed the extraction of abundance and size of cod larvae with very high spatial (4km) and temporal resolutions (1day) and showed that cod larvae from adjacent northern spawning grounds in Norway were always available near the guillemot breeding colony while those from more distant southerly spawning grounds were less frequent, but larger. The latter arrived in waves whose magnitude and timing, and thus overlap with the guillemot breeding season, varied between years. CORT levels in adult guillemots were lower in birds caught after a week with high frequencies of southern cod larvae. This pattern was restricted to the two years (2009 and 2010) in which southern larvae arrived before the end of the guillemot breeding season. Any such pattern was masked in 2011 by already exceptionally high numbers of cod larvae in the region throughout chick-rearing period. The findings suggest that CORT levels in breeding birds increase when the arrival of southern sizable larvae does not match the period of peak energy requirements during breeding.","[Barrett, Robert T.; Reiertsen, Tone K.] Tromso Univ Museum, Dept Nat Sci, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Erikstad, Kjell E.; Kristensen, Ditte L.; Reiertsen, Tone K.] FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Erikstad, Kjell E.; Sandvik, Hanno] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, NO-7049 Trondheim, Norway; [Myksvoll, Mari; Vikebo, Frode] Inst Marine Res, NO-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Jenni-Eiermann, Susi] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland; [Moum, Truls] Univ Nordland, Marine Genom Res Grp, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, NO-8049 Bodo, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Institute of Marine Research - Norway; Swiss Ornithological Institute; Nord University,"Erikstad, KE (corresponding author), FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway.",kjell.e.erikstad@nina.no,"Sandvik, Hanno/B-5118-2008","Sandvik, Hanno/0000-0002-5889-1606; Jenni-Eiermann, Susanne/0000-0002-0610-3428; Moum, Truls/0000-0002-0651-6863",Norwegian Research Council [216547/E40]; Tromso University Museum; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research; Norwegian National Monitoring Programme for Seabirds; Norwegian SEAPOP program,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); Tromso University Museum; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research(Bioforsk); Norwegian National Monitoring Programme for Seabirds; Norwegian SEAPOP program,"The study was financed by the Norwegian Research Council (Project No 216547/E40 to KEE), Tromso University Museum, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, the Norwegian National Monitoring Programme for Seabirds and the Norwegian SEAPOP program (www.seapop.no).",,57,17,17,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Munich Oktoberfest, the world's largest folk festival, is a potential source of CH4 as a large amount of natural gas for cooking and heating is used. In 2018 we measured the CH4 emissions of Oktoberfest using in situ measurements combined with a Gaussian plume dispersion model. Measurements were taken while walking and biking around the perimeter of the Oktoberfest premises (Theresienwiese) at different times of the day, during the week and at the weekend. The measurements showed enhancements of up to 100 ppb compared to background values and measurements after Oktoberfest. The average emission flux of Oktoberfest is determined as (6.7 +/- 0.6) mu g (m(2) s)(-1). Additional analyses, including the daily emission cycle and comparisons between emissions and the number of visitors, suggest that CH4 emissions of Oktoberfest are not due solely to the human biogenic emissions. Instead, fossil fuel CH4 emissions, such as incomplete combustion or loss in the gas appliances, appear to be the major contributors to Oktoberfest emissions. Our results can help to develop CH4 reduction policies and measures to reduce emissions at festivals and other major events in cities. Furthermore, events with a limited duration have not yet been included in the state-of-the-art emission inventories, such as TNO-MACC, EDGAR or IER. Our investigations show that these emissions are not negligible. Therefore, these events should be included in future emission inventories.","[Chen, Jia; Dietrich, Florian; Forstmaier, Andreas; Winkler, Dominik] TUM, Environm Sensing & Modeling, Munich, Germany; [Maazallahi, Hossein; Roeckmann, Thomas] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hofmann, Magdalena E.

Increasing the structural complexity of iron modules also increases computational costs and introduces additional uncertainties, with as yet unclear benefits. In order to demonstrate the benefits of explicitly representing iron, we calibrate a hierarchy of iron modules and evaluate the remaining model-data misfit. The first module includes a complex iron cycle with major processes resolved explicitly, the second module applies iron limitation in primary production using prescribed monthly iron concentration fields, and the third module does not explicitly include iron effects at all. All three modules are embedded into the same circulation model. Models are calibrated against global data sets of NO3, PO4 and O-2 applying a state-of-the-art multi-variable constraint parameter optimization. The model with fully resolved iron cycle is marginally (up to 4.8%) better at representing global distributions of NO3, PO4 and O-2 compared to models with implicit or absent parameterizations of iron. We also found a slow down of global surface nutrient cycling by about 30% and a shift of productivity from the tropics to temperate regions for the explicit iron module. The explicit iron model also reduces the otherwise overestimated volume of suboxic waters, yielding results closer to observations.","[Yao, Wanxuan; Kvale, Karin F.; Achterberg, Eric; Koeve, Wolfgang; Oschlies, Andreas] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel,"Yao, WX (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",wyao@geomar.de,"Koeve, Wolfgang/B-6362-2008; Kvale, Karin F/A-7597-2013; Kvale, Karin F/T-1231-2018; Oschlies, Andreas/F-9749-2012; Achterberg, Eric P/C-5820-2009","Koeve, Wolfgang/0000-0002-2298-9230; Kvale, Karin F/0000-0001-8043-5431; Kvale, Karin F/0000-0001-8043-5431; Oschlies, Andreas/0000-0002-8295-4013; Achterberg, Eric P/0000-0002-3061-2767; Yao, Wanxuan/0000-0003-3938-1237","Helmholtz Research School for Ocean System Science and Technology (HOSST, Germany) at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel [VH-KO-601]","Helmholtz Research School for Ocean System Science and Technology (HOSST, Germany) at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel","This work is supported by the Helmholtz Research School for Ocean System Science and Technology (HOSST, Germany) at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (VH-KO-601).

The dust DRE strongly depends on dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD), therefore, DRE efficiency (DREE = DRE /DAOD) is widely compared across different studies to eliminate differences due to the various dust loads. Nevertheless, DREE is still influenced by the uncertainties associated with dust particle size distribution (PSD) and optical properties. In this study, we derive a global clear-sky size-resolved DREE dataset in both shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) at top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface based on satellite observations (i.e., satellite-retrieved dust extinction spatial and vertical distributions). In the DREE dataset, dust geometric diameter from 0.1 to 100 pm is divided into 10 bins and the corresponding monthly mean DREE (with respect to DAOD at 532 nm) for each size bin is derived by using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM). Three sets of state of the art dust refractive indices (RI) and two sets of dust shape models (sphere vs. spheroid) are adopted to investigate the sensitivity of dust DREE to dust absorption and shape. As a result, the size-resolved dust DREE dataset contains globally distributed monthly mean dust DREE at TOA and surface for each of 10 size bins with 5 degrees (longitude) x 2 degrees (latitude) resolution as well as for each dust RI and shape combination. The size-resolved dust DREE dataset can be used to readily calculate global dust DRE for any DAOD and dust PSD, including the uncertainty in the DRE induced by dust microphysical properties, (e.g., dust PSD, RI and shape). By calculating dust DRE based on DAOD climatology retrieved from different satellite sensors and based on different dust PSD, we find that uncertainty in the spatial pattern of DAOD induces more than 10 % of the uncertainty in SW dust DRE at TOA. The observation-based dust PSD induces around 15-20 % uncertainty in dust DRE at TOA and in the atmosphere. The sensitivity assessments of dust DRE to dust RI and shape further suggest that dust nonsphericity induces a negligible effect on dust DRE estimations, while dust RI turns out to be the most important factor in determining dust DRE, particularly in SW.","[Song, Qianqian; Zhang, Zhibo; Zheng, Jianyu] UMBC, Phys Dept, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Song, Qianqian; Zhang, Zhibo; Zheng, Jianyu] UMBC, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res 2, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Yu, Hongbin] NASA, Climate & Radiat Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Kok, Jasper F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Di Biagio, Claudia] Univ Paris Cite, F-75013 Paris, France; [Di Biagio, Claudia] Univ Paris Est Creteil, LISA, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France; [Albani, Samuel] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Environm & Earth Sci, Milan, Italy; [Ding, Jiachen] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); University of Milano-Bicocca; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Song, QQ (corresponding author), UMBC, Phys Dept, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.;Song, QQ (corresponding author), UMBC, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res 2, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",cd11735@umbc.edu,"song, qian/HDL-9868-2022; Kok, Jasper F/A-9698-2008","Kok, Jasper F/0000-0003-0464-8325; Di Biagio, Claudia/0000-0001-8273-6211","National Aeronautics and Space Administration [80NSSC19K1345, 80NSSC20K0130]; National Science Foundation [CNS-0821258, CNS-1228778]",National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research has been supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (grant nos. 80NSSC19K1345 and 80NSSC20K0130) and the National Science Foundation (grant nos.

In this context, one of the major goals for methane recovery from waste is the process of obtaining biogas from biomass or waste, a form of fuel with zero impact on the carbon footprint of the planet. All possible uses of biogas depend mainly on the degree of purification obtained. The removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the main weakness in using biogas in industrial applications. If the use of biogas is intended for engines, turbines or to enrich the biogas to obtain natural gas, lowering the levels of H2S will be necessary, in order to avoid corrosion in gas lines and in engines. Biogas desulfurization can be achieved through different techniques: physical, chemical, biological or hybrid procedures. Selecting the most sustainable technique to clean biogas entails a complex problem, which involves the analysis of these desulfurization treatments under different criteria. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative elicitation to select the consensus procedure for the reduction of the concentration of H2S in biogases from landfills. The elicitation technique is based on fuzzy set theory and VIKOR method in order to handle intangible data and to avoid potential bias by the panelists. The proposed hybrid method guarantees traceability and transparency to achieve consensus among the panel of experts during the decision making procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Natural water resource variability across different temporal scales and the subsequent filtering effect of water storage mass balances are not accounted for, leading to biased optimal power dispatch strategies. In this work, we aim at introducing a novelty in the field by advancing the representation of reservoir hydropower generation in energy systems modelling by explicitly including the most relevant hydrological constraints, such as time-dependent water availability, hydraulic head, evaporation losses, and cascade releases. This advanced characterization is implemented in an open-source energy modelling framework. The improved model is then demonstrated on the Zambezi River Basin in the South Africa Power Pool. The basin has an estimated hydropower potential of 20,000 megawatts (MW) of which about 5,000 MW has been already developed. Results show a better alignment of electricity production with observed data, with a reduction of estimated hydropower production up to 35% with respect to the baseline Calliope implementation. These improvements are useful to support hydropower management and planning capacity expansion in countries richly endowed with water resource or that are already strongly relying on hydropower for electricity production.","[Stevanato, Nicolo; Rocco, Matteo, V; Colombo, Emanuela] Politecn Milan, Dept Energy, Milan, Italy; [Stevanato, Nicolo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Giuliani, Matteo; Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Fondazione Mattei; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Stevanato, N (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Energy, Milan, Italy.;Stevanato, N (corresponding author), Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy.",nicolo.stevanato@polimi.it,"STEVANATO, NICOLO'/AFO-7916-2022","STEVANATO, NICOLO'/0000-0002-3419-0389",DAFNEDecision Analytic Framework to explore the waterenergy-food Nexus in complex transboundary water resource systems of fast developing countries research project - Horizon 2020 programme WATER 2015 of the European Union [690268],DAFNEDecision Analytic Framework to explore the waterenergy-food Nexus in complex transboundary water resource systems of fast developing countries research project - Horizon 2020 programme WATER 2015 of the European Union,"MG and AC were supported by DAFNEDecision Analytic Framework to explore the waterenergy-food Nexus in complex transboundary water resource systems of fast developing countries research project funded by the Horizon 2020 programme WATER 2015 of the European Union, GA 690268.

Approximately 16% of the total land area on Earth suffers from groundwater salinization, potentially creating significant social, economic, and environmental problems. Global bibliographical research focusing on studies related to the utilization and management of salinization-threatened groundwater was conducted. A database of 520 papers from 85 countries was compiled and discussed. The main salinization sources were identified, and seawater intrusion is the primary studied phenomenon. This paper classifies different state-of-the-art approaches for protecting groundwater resources from salinization. Practical scientific solutions, from technical and engineering solutions to rules or regulatory instruments, are discussed from a global perspective. As salinization risk becomes a relevant problem, more complex initiatives should be applied to meet water demands while minimizing disadvantages. From the lowest to the highest complexity, three approaches were defined: the engineering approach, the discharge management approach, and the water and land management approach. The discussion presents directions for future research opportunities.

This changed mind-set towards biomass utilization can lead readily to the implementation of negative CO2 emission along the entire bioenergy supply chain without limiting the potential for Power-to-X applications. First, the technologies for direct conversion of waste and wood into gaseous energy carriers are screened, to highlight the current potential for the production of renewable fuels. Second, the processes for the removal of CO2 from biogenic gas streams are analysed in terms of technological performance, cost and further potential for the CO2 recovered. These technologies are the key to pre-combustion CO2 capture and negative emissions. Third, the possibility of coupling biomass conversion and synthetic fuels production is explored, providing an overview on the technical maturity of the various energy storage processes. The flexible use of biomass can be an essential part of the future CO2-free energy systems, as it can directly provide energy carriers all around the year and also large quantities of climate-neutral carbon for the production of synthetic fuels with renewable energy. In turn, when no additional renewable electricity is available, the CO2 by-product from biofuel synthesis can be captured to achieve negative emissions. This opens the way to an efficient strategy for the seasonal storage of electrical energy, realizing a carbon-neutral energy system coupled with the development of carbon-negative energy strategy.","[Moioli, Emanuele; Schildhauer, Tilman] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy & Environm Div, Forschungstr 111, Villigen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute,"Moioli, E (corresponding author), Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy & Environm Div, Forschungstr 111, Villigen, Switzerland.",Emanuele.moioli@psi.ch,,"Moioli, Emanuele/0000-0002-2943-6823",Swiss Federal Office of Energy [SI/502185],Swiss Federal Office of Energy,This work was conducted within the framework of the IEA Bioenergy task 44: Flexible bioenergy.

Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the impact of rainfall and land use/land cover changes in the current and future scenarios to deduce the soil erosion losses using the state-of-the-art Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). In this study, we evaluated the long-term changes (period 1981-2040) in the land use/land cover and rainfall through the statistical measures and used subsequently in the soil erosion loss prediction. The future land use/land cover changes are produced using the Cellular Automata Markov Chain model (CA-Markov) simulation using multi-temporal Landsat datasets, while long term rainfall data was obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project v5 (CMIP5) and Indian Meteorological Department. In total seven CMIP5 model projections viz Ensemble mean, MRI-CGCM3, INMCM4, canESM2, MPI-ESM-LR, GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL-CM3 of rainfall were used. The future projections (2011-2040) of soil erosion losses were then made after calibrating the soil erosion model on the historic datasets. The applicability of the proposed method has been tested over the Mahi River Basin (MRB), a region of key environmental significance in India. The finding showed that the rainfall-runoff erosivity gradually decreases from 475.18 MJ mm/h/y (1981-1990) to 425.72 MJ mm/h/y (1991-2000). A value of 428.53 MJ mm/h/y was obtained in 2001-2010, while a significantly high values 661.47 MJ mm/h/y has been reported for the 2011-2040 in the ensemble model mean output of CMIP5. The combined results of rainfall and land use/land cover changes reveal that the soil erosion loss occurred during 1981-1990 was 55.23 t/ha/y (1981-1990), which is gradually increased to 56.78 t/ha/y in 1991-2000 and 57.35 t/ha/y in 2000-2010. The projected results showed that it would increase to 71.46 t/h/y in 2011-2040. The outcome of this study can be used to provide reasonable assistance in identifying suitable conservation practices in the MRB.","[Maurya, Swati; Srivastava, Prashant K.; Anand, Akash] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Remote Sensing Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Srivastava, Prashant K.; Mall, R.

The aim of the present study was to test a more rapid alternative, which is based on the spectroscopic analysis of bulk soils in the mid-infrared region (4000-400cm(-1)), combined with partial least-squares regression (PLS). One hundred eleven soil samples from arable and grassland sites across Switzerland were separated into fractions of dissolved OC, particulate organic matter (POM), sand and stable aggregates, silt and clay particles, and oxidation resistant OC. Measured contents of OC in each fraction were then correlated by PLS with infrared spectra to obtain prediction models. For every prediction model, 100 soil spectra were used in the PLS calibration and the residual 11 spectra for validation of the models. Correlation coefficients (r) between measured and PLS-predicted values ranged between 0.89 and 0.97 for OC in different fractions. By combining different fractions to one labile, one stabilized and one resistant fraction, predictions could even be improved (r = 0.98, standard error of prediction = 16%).

In this study, state-of-the-art AI algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), artificial neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM), model tree (M5P), gene expression programming (GEP), and group method of data handling (GMDH) were employed to compute the Local Scour Depth (LSD) and to address identified lacunas. A total of 378 data set consisting of laboratory and field data was used for modeling. Evaluation criteria such as the index of agreement (IOA), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Skill Score (SS), Correlation (Correl), and Taylor diagram were employed to check the goodness-of-fit of the proposed models. IVS was performed using partial mutual information (PMI). The findings of the study showed that velocity (V), the diameter of the pier (b), Reynolds pier number (Rp), and particle densimetric Froude number (Frd) were highly sensitive parameters to the scour. Quantitative and qualitative results indicated that SVM performed better with RMSE (0.06), MAPE (0.04) and SS (0.9).

Probabilistic skill scores have been applied to a common series of hindcasts produced with the dynamical and statistical models. The ECMWF hindcasts have higher relative operating characteristic (ROC) scores than the statistical model for the first three weeks of integrations. The dynamical model also has skill over the Indian Ocean in week 4. The ECMWF hindcasts have lower Brier skill scores than the statistical model after week 2, which is likely because this version of the ECMWF model creates about 30% more TCs than observations and therefore generates a large number of false alarms. A simple calibration has been applied to the ECMWF probabilistic forecasts that significantly improves their reliability, but at the expense of the sharpness. The calibrated dynamical model has higher Brier skill scores than the statistical model during the first three weeks, although the statistical model remains more reliable. The multimodel combination of the calibrated dynamical forecasts with the statistical forecasts helps to improve the reliability of the ECMWF forecasts. The Brier skill score of the multimodel exceeds the Brier skill scores of the individual models, but with less sharpness than the calibrated dynamical model. This result suggests that the statistical model can be useful as a benchmark for dynamical models and as a component of a multimodel combination to improve the skill of the dynamical model. Potential economic value diagrams confirm that the multimodel forecasts are useful up to week 3 over the Southern Hemisphere.","[Vitart, Frederic] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Leroy, Anne] Meteo France, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Wheeler, Matthew C.] Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Australia",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Vitart, F (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.",nec@ecmwf.int,"Wheeler, Matthew C/C-9038-2011","Wheeler, Matthew C/0000-0002-9769-1973",,,,,58,70,71,0,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

The temporal neural encode mechanism found in biological hippocampus enables SNN to possess more powerful computation capability than networks with other encoding schemes. However, this temporal encoding approach requires neurons to process information serially on time, which reduces learning efficiency significantly. To keep the powerful computation capability of the temporal encoding mechanism and to overcome its low efficiency in the training of SNNs, a new training algorithm, the accurate synaptic-efficiency adjustment method is proposed in this paper. Inspired by the selective attention mechanism of the primate visual system, our algorithm selects only the target spike time as attention areas, and ignores voltage states of the untarget ones, resulting in a significant reduction of training time. Besides, our algorithm employs a cost function based on the voltage difference between the potential of the output neuron and the firing threshold of the SNN, instead of the traditional precise firing time distance. A normalized spike-timing-dependent-plasticity learning window is applied to assigning this error to different synapses for instructing their training. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to investigate the learning properties of our algorithm, with input neurons emitting both single spike and multiple spikes. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm possesses higher learning performance than the existing other methods and achieves the state-of-the-art efficiency in the training of SNN.","[Xie, Xiurui; Qu, Hong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Qu, Hong; Kurths, Jurgen] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Yi, Zhang] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Kurths, Jurgen] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Sichuan University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Xie, XR (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China.",xiexiurui@126.com; hongqu@uestc.edu.cn; zhangyi@scu.edu.cn; kurths@pik-potsdam.de,,,"National Science Foundation of China [61273308, 61432012, 61573081]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61273308, Grant 61432012, and Grant 61573081.",,39,30,32,3,32,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

Comprehending the process under which a social license to operate may be granted to a renewable energy project is significant. The GO or NO-GO decision for a renewable energy project is a vital task. In order to illustrate how renewable energy projects can be assessed from the sustainability point of view, two hypothetical scenarios were constructed. These scenarios describe a conceptual renewable energy project evaluated by five imaginary stakeholders under specific criteria and sustainability pillars. The first scenario is a NO-GO scenario: the project is not sustainable due to significant environmental, social, economic, technological and geopolitical negative impacts. In this case, the social license to operate will not be endorsed by the stakeholders; important changes are needed before reassessment. The second scenario is a GO scenario: the preferences of the stakeholders are such that the project may be considered sustainable and the social license to operate may be endorsed by the stakeholders. The methodology utilized to assess the two hypothetical scenarios for the same renewable energy project is the multi-criteria decision analysis combined with the multi-attribute utility theory. The quantification of assessment results was conducted with the assistance of a state-of-the-art decision support system (Acropolis DSS), which allows decision-makers to evaluate multiple options that offer alternate solutions in GO-NO-GO situations.","[Kamenopoulos, Sotiris N.; Tsoutsos, Theocharis] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Lab, Khania, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Tsoutsos, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Lab, Khania, Greece.",theocharis.tsoutsos@enveng.tuc.gr,"Tsoutsos, Theocharis D/H-6311-2019","Tsoutsos, Theocharis D/0000-0002-6411-2736",,,,,34,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, CH-4052, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-03152-7; 978-3-030-03151-0,,,,2019,,,,,223,237,,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_9,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Environmental Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BN5CX,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000482972300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models. Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale modeling. Here we define and synthesize the Appropriate Complexity Method (ACME), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the development of process oriented models across a spectrum of scientific and management objectives. ACME helps modelers efficiently converge upon an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable) to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability, tractability, and generality as functions of computational and representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model objectives, provide further guidance for determining the appropriate level of complexity for representation of processes in models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.

However, the high carbon dioxide (CO2) content in biogas limits its value as a fuel. 'Biogas upgrading' is an advanced process which removes CO2 from biogas, thereby converting biogas to biomethane, which has a higher commercial value. Microbial technologies offer a sustainable and cost-effective way to upgrade biogas, removing CO2 using hydrogen (H-2) as electron donor, generated by surplus electricity from renewable wind or solar energy. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be applied to convert CO2 with H-2 to methane (CH4), or alternatively, homoacetogens can convert both CO2 and H-2 into value-added chemicals. Here, we comprehensively review the current state of biogas generation and utilization, and describe the advances in biological, H-2-dependent biogas upgrading technologies, with particular attention to key challenges associated with the processes, e.g., metabolic limitations, low H-2 transfer rate, and finite CO2 conversion rate. We also highlight several new strategies for overcoming technical barriers to achieve efficient CO2 conversion, including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation, novel reactor designs to improve H-2 transfer rate and utilization efficiency, and employing advanced genetic engineering tools to generate more efficient microorganisms. The insights offered in this review will promote further exploration into microbial, H-2-driven biogas upgrading, towards addressing the global energy crisis and climate change associated with use of fossil fuels.

The dependence on oil as the source of energy for passenger vehicles has economic and political implications, and the crisis will take over as the oil reserves of the world diminish. As concerns of oil depletion and security of the oil supply remain as severe as ever, and faced with the consequences of climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions from the tail pipes of vehicles, the world today is increasingly looking at alternatives to traditional road transport technologies. EVs are seen as a promising green technology which could lead to the decarbonization of the passenger vehicle fleet and to independence from oil. There are possibilities of immense environmental benefits as well, as EVs have zero tail pipe emission and therefore are capable of curbing the pollution problems created by vehicle emission in an efficient way so they can extensively reduce the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the transportation sector as pure electric vehicles are the only vehicles with zero-emission potential. However, there are some major barriers for EVs to overcome before totally replacing ICE vehicles in the transportation sector and obtain appreciable market penetration. This review evaluates the technological aspects of the different power train systems of BEV technology and highlights those technological areas where important progress is expected by focusing on reviewing all the useful information and data available on EV architecture, electrical machines, optimization techniques, and its possibilities of future developments as green mobility. The challenges of different electric drive trains' commercialization are discussed.

Then, optimises a user-defined goodness-of-fit measure until a maximum number of iterations or a convergence criterion are met. Finally, advanced plotting functionalities facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. The current hydroPSO version allows easy parallelization and works with single-objective functions, with multi-objective functionalities being the subject of ongoing development. We compare hydroPSO against standard algorithms (SCE_UA, DE, DREAM, SPSO-2011, and GML) using a series of benchmark functions. We further illustrate the application of hydroPSO in two real-world case studies: we calibrate, first, a hydrological model for the Ega River Basin (Spain) and, second, a groundwater flow model for the Pampa del Tamarugal Aquifer (Chile). Results from the comparison exercise indicate that hydroPSO is: i) effective and efficient compared to commonly used optimisation algorithms, ii) scalable, i.e. maintains a high performance for increased problem dimensionality, and iii) versatile to adapt to different response surfaces of the objective function. Case study results highlight the functionality and ease of use of hydroPSO to handle several issues that are commonly faced by the modelling community such as: working on different operating systems, single or batch model execution, transient- or steady-state modelling conditions, and the use of alternative goodness-of-fit measures to drive parameter optimisation. Although we limit the application of hydroPSO to hydrological models, flexibility of the package suggests it can be implemented in a wider range of models requiring some form of parameter optimisation.

Although recent studies have explored the quantification of system resilience, there has been limited research aimed at understanding the role of multiple performance measures, spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and modeling uncertainties within the assessment of resilience and associated decision-making. Under real-world conditions, there is an increased burden on analysts for translating observed system data (including human and electronic sensor observations) into system performance estimates that may not be directly observable. This paper addresses these issues using a scenario-based risk modeling approach to understand: (1) resilience of complex systems, often in cases of hidden (not readily observable) measures of performance, (2) resilience sensitivity to modeling uncertainties in event and system characteristics, and (3) resilience sensitivity to the measurement of performance across multiple operational perspectives. The methods in this paper integrate uncertainty-driven risk and probabilistic modeling within a multi-state Markov-based approach. This study contributes to the state-of-the-art by developing methodologies for assessing community perceptions of infrastructure system resilience using observable factors and inferring possibly hidden performance measures for facilitating adaptive decision-support. The methods are demonstrated with hypothetical spatiotemporal data across multiple system performance dimensions. The analysis results are useful for infrastructure security analysts, system decision-makers, and the general public.","[Thekdi, Shital A.] Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Chatterjee, Samrat] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",University of Richmond; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Thekdi, SA (corresponding author), Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",sthekdi@richmond.edu,,,,,,,57,9,9,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown effective and superior performance in automatically learning high-level and discriminative features in extracting buildings. However, the fixed receptive fields make conventional CNNs insufficient to tolerate large scale changes. Multiscale CNN (MCNN) is a promising structure to meet this challenge. Unfortunately, the multiscale features extracted by MCNN are always stacked and fed into one classifier, which make it difficult to recognize objects with different scales. Besides, the repeated sub-sampling processes lead to a blurred boundary of the extracted features. In this study, we proposed a novel parallel support vector mechanism (SVM)-based fusion strategy to take full use of deep features at different scales as extracted by the MCNN structure. We firstly designed a MCNN structure with different sizes of input patches and kernels, to learn multiscale deep features. After that, features at different scales were individually fed into different support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to produce rule images for pre-classification. A decision fusion strategy is then applied on the pre-classification results based on another SVM classifier. Finally, superpixels are applied to refine the boundary of the fused results using region-based maximum voting. For performance evaluation, the well-known International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam dataset was used in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed methodology in extracting complex buildings in urban districts.","[Sun, Genyun; Huang, Hui; Zhang, Aizhu; Li, Feng; Fu, Hang] China Univ Petr East China, Sch Geosci, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Sun, Genyun; Huang, Hui; Zhang, Aizhu; Fu, Hang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Sun, Genyun; Huang, Hui; Zhang, Aizhu; Fu, Hang] Key Lab Deep Oil & Gas, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Li, Feng] Shandong Prov Climate Ctr, Jinan 250000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Huimin] Guangdong Polytech Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510000, Guangdong, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University,"Zhang, AZ; Li, F (corresponding author), China Univ Petr East China, Sch Geosci, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.;Zhang, AZ (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Zhang, AZ (corresponding author), Key Lab Deep Oil & Gas, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China.;Li, F (corresponding author), Shandong Prov Climate Ctr, Jinan 250000, Shandong, Peoples R China.",genyunsun@163.com; huihuang_rs@163.com; zhangaizhu789@163.com; lfeng1029@163.com; zhaohuimin@gpnu.edu.cn; hangf_upc@163.com,"Aizhu, Zhang/AAS-8305-2021","Huang, Hui/0000-0001-5503-9090; genyun, Sun/0000-0002-2641-2615","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801275]; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [ZR2018BD007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [18CX05030A, 18CX02179A]; Guangdong Provincial Application oriented Technical Research and Development Special Fund Project [2016B010127006]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Guangdong Provincial Application oriented Technical Research and Development Special Fund Project","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41801275), the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China (ZR2018BD007), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (18CX05030A, 18CX02179A).

Among the species belonging to this genus,Architeuthis dux has received special attention from biologists. The distribution of this species is poorly understood, as most of our information stems from stranded animals or stomach remains. Predicting the habitat and distribution of this species, and more in general of difficult to observe species, is important from a biological conservation perspective. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the potential distribution of A. dux at global scale, with relative high resolution (1-degree). Our approach relies on a complex preparation phase, which improves the reliability of presence, absence and environmental data correlated to the species habitat. We compare our distribution with those produced by state-of-the-art approaches (MaxEnt and AquaMaps), and use an expert-drawn map as reference. We demonstrate that our model projection is in agreement with the expert's map and is also compliant with-several biological assessments of the species habitat and with recent observations. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be generalized as a paradigm that is applicable to other rare species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the last few decades, however, many drinking waters sources in the world, including in China, have undergone serious eutrophication and consequently water quality deterioration due to anthropogenic induced stressors such as elevated external nutrient inputs. In this study, we used the state-of-the-art complex, dynamic, mechanistic model GOTM-FABM-PCLake (a coupled one-dimensional hydrodynamic-lake ecosystem model) to quantitatively assess the impacts of external nutrient loading on the temperate Jihongtan reservoir in Shandong Province, China. Simulated values of all variables targeted in calibration (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a) agreed well with observations throughout the entire calibration and validation period and generally mimicked seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variations as found in the monitoring data. A series of scenarios, representing changed external nutrient loadings (both increasing and decreasing compared to the current nutrient load), were set up to quantify the effects on the reservoir water quality. Changes relative to the current external nutrient load had a significant effect on the simulated TN and TP concentrations in the reservoir. Our impact assessment indicate that TN will meet the Chinese water quality requirements of the water source (Class III) when the external nitrogen load is reduced by 70%, whereas TP will meet the requirements even if the external phosphorus load is increased by 100% relative to current loads. The model predicts progressively higher summer and autumn phytoplankton biomasses in the scenarios with increasing external phosphorus loading and potential toxic cyanobacteria will become more dominant at the expense of diatoms and other algae. Strict control of the external nutrient loading is therefore needed to maintain good drinking water quality in the reservoir.","[Chou, Qingchuan; Zhang, Xiaolin; Cao, Te; Ni, Leyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chou, Qingchuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chou, Qingchuan; Nielsen, Anders; Andersen, Tobias K.; Hu, Fenjuan; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Nielsen, Anders; Andersen, Tobias K.; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Weiyu] Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Res & Implementat, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Mersin, Turkey","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hohai University; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University","Zhang, XL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",zhangxl@ihb.ac.cn,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019","Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31930074, 31870446, 32071574]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [236070]; State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology [2019FBZ01]; China Scholarship Council [201704910729]; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research; CASHFISH project - Danish Council for Independent Research; WATExR project through EU JPI Climate initiative; PROGNOS project through EU JPI Water initiative; project on Mechanistic Models for Water Action Planning - Danish EPA; TUBITAK, BIDEB 2232 program [118C250]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research; CASHFISH project - Danish Council for Independent Research; WATExR project through EU JPI Climate initiative; PROGNOS project through EU JPI Water initiative; project on Mechanistic Models for Water Action Planning - Danish EPA; TUBITAK, BIDEB 2232 program(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31930074, 31870446, 32071574), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (236070) and State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology (2019FBZ01).

Kern Center In 2016 the R.W. Kern Center became Hampshire College's first new building in 40 years (Figure 1). Located at the heart of the Hampshire College campus, the R.W. Kern Center is a multi-purpose facility intended to embody a high threshold of forward-thinking sustainable design: generating its own energy; capturing and treating its own water; and processing and recycling its waste. Its design also embodies a broader definition of green building, prioritizing non-toxic materials, local and ethical products, and principals of biophilia and natural beauty. The new building, which includes classrooms, offices, and a community cafe and gallery, serves as a primary entry point to the campus and was designed to engage prospective students as well as provide community space. In the spring of 2018, the Kern Center became the 17th building to be certified and meet the Living Building Challenge (LBC) (International Living Future Institute, 2018a) after a year of post-occupancy performance verification. At 17,000 square feet, it is the largest Living Building on a higher education campus and considering the relatively small size of the college (similar to 1300 students) it showcases Hampshire College's substantial commitment to sustainable design and development. The Living Building Challenge A program of the International Living Future Institute, the Living Building Challenge is a building certification system and sustainable design framework for creating built environments that have a positive impact on people and the environment (International Living Future Institute, 2018a). The Challenge is organized into seven performance areas covering different aspects of holistic sustainable design: place, water, energy, health + happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. In order to achieve Living status, projects must fulfill all imperatives in each of these categories. Hampshire College Hampshire College is an innovative private college in Amherst, Massachusetts. The academic program is highly dynamic and interdisciplinary, emphasizing an inquiry-based and learner-centered liberal arts education. Students are empowered to think, discover, advocate, and build essential skills through an individualized divisional system utilizing portfolios, narrative evaluations, and self-reflection. The College's motto, Non Satis Scire (To Know is Not Enough), is a call to action for students, as well as the institution. It is not enough for colleges and universities to merely educate students on issues of sustainability or environmental and social justice; Hampshire College has the added responsibility of applying this knowledge in all of its operations. The R.W. Kern Center embodies the commitment to environmental sustainability at Hampshire and is a powerful example of the dynamic role sustainable design can play in educating the next generation of sustainability leaders.","[Cianfrani, Christina M.] Hampshire Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Hydrol, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Hews, Sarah] Hampshire Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Math, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Tor, Jason] Hampshire Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Microbiol, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Jewhurst, Jason J.] Bruner Cott Architects, Cambridge, MA USA; [Shillington, Claire; Raymond, Matthew] Hampshire Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",,"Cianfrani, CM (corresponding author), Hampshire Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Hydrol, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",ccNS@hampshire.edu; shNS@hampshire.edu; jmtNS@hampshire.edu; jjewhurst@brunercott.com; clns15@hampshire.edu; matt.raymond9628@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,4,23,COLLEGE PUBLISHING,GLEN ALLEN,"12309 LYNWOOD DR, GLEN ALLEN, VA 23059 USA",1552-6100,1943-4618,,J GREEN BUILD,J.

The result indicates that the models show high skills in capturing the climatological features of annual mean HC and tropical SST. Moreover, the leading variabilities of HC and tropical SST during the seasonal cycle are well reproduced for both the equatorially asymmetric and symmetric variations. Furthermore, most of the models display good agreement with the observations in depicting the responses contrast of the HC to different SST meridional structures.

Water quality can be affected by multiple stressors including population growth, land use change, global warming, and extreme events, with repercussions on human and ecosystem health. A scientific understanding of factors affecting riverine water quality and predictions at local to regional scales, and at sub-daily to decadal timescales are needed for optimal management of watersheds and river basins. Here, we discuss how machine learning (ML) can enable development of more accurate, computationally tractable, and scalable models for analysis and predictions of river water quality. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of ML for water quality models and discuss opportunities to improve the use of ML with emerging computational and mathematical methods for model selection, hyperparameter optimization, incorporating process knowledge into ML models, improving explainablity, uncertainty quantification, and model-data integration. We then present considerations for using ML to address water quality problems given their scale and complexity, available data and computational resources, and stakeholder needs. When combined with decades of process understanding, interdisciplinary advances in knowledge-guided ML, information theory, data integration, and analytics can help address fundamental science questions and enable decision-relevant predictions of riverine water quality.","[Varadharajan, Charuleka; Arora, Bhavna; Ombadi, Mohammed; Weierbach, Helen; Xu, Zexuan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94010 USA; [Appling, Alison P.; Oliver, Samantha; Sadler, Jeffrey M.; Zwart, Jacob] US Geol Survey, Water Mission Area, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Christianson, Danielle S.; Hendrix, Valerie C.; Mueller, Juliane; Perciano, Talita] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Comp Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kumar, Vipin; Willard, Jared D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Lima, Aranildo R.] Aquat Informat, Vancouver, BC V6E 4M3, Canada",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Varadharajan, C (corresponding author), 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cvaradharajan@lbl.gov,"Arora, Bhavna/D-2293-2015; Ombadi, Mohammed/AAC-6257-2019; Xu, Zexuan/I-3106-2016; Varadharajan, Charuleka/G-3741-2015","Arora, Bhavna/0000-0001-7841-886X; Ombadi, Mohammed/0000-0001-7793-9137; Xu, Zexuan/0000-0001-9534-7370; Varadharajan, Charuleka/0000-0002-4142-3224; Sadler, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8776-4844; Appling, Alison/0000-0003-3638-8572; Hendrix, Valerie C./0000-0001-9061-8952; Weierbach, Helen/0000-0001-6348-9120; Christianson, Danielle/0000-0002-8663-7701; Oliver, Samantha/0000-0001-5668-1165","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering [1934721]; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; U.S. Geological Survey","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey)","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research, Grant/Award Number: DE-AC02-05CH11231; National Science Foundation, Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Grant/Award Number: 1934721; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; U.S. Geological Survey",,258,2,2,21,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

In this paper, the research progress of vegetation ecology associated with bedrock features in the karst CZ in subtropical Southwest China is systematically reviewed. There are great differences in soil formation and soil features (water-holding capacity, particle size, and soil chemistry) between karst and non-karst regions, even between dolomite and limestone within a karst region. Water and soil are easily leached due to the connected underground crevices in karst, particularly in limestone-dominated regions, leading to water deficits in karst CZ plants in subtropical Southwest China. The development of plant roots in crevices affects the water and nutrient absorption by plants and microbial activities in the soil, which form the basis for vegetation distribution and growth in the karst CZ. The organic acids from plants also increase weathering rates. As extensive human activities have accelerated vegetation degradation and soil erosion and further led to rocky desertification characterized by increasing areas of rock exposure, state-of-the-art knowledge about the effects of bedrock-associated belowground and aboveground interactions can guide the implementation of vegetation restoration and the control of further rocky desertification in the subtropical karst CZ.","[Liu, Hongyan; Dai, Jingyu; Xu, Chongyang; Peng, Jian; Wang, Hongya] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiuchen] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Beijing Normal University,"Liu, HY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Liu, HY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, MOE Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lhy@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Dai, Jingyu/GPS-7776-2022","peng, jian/0000-0003-0332-0248; Liu, Hongyan/0000-0002-6721-4439; Dai, Jingyu/0000-0001-5714-6690",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571130044],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is granted by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41571130044).",,67,8,8,15,88,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

Upon environmental perturbation, microbes are also amongst the first natural responsive elements with perturbation-specific cues and markers. These communities are thereby uniquely positioned to inform on the status of environmental conditions. The advent of microbial omics has led to an unprecedented volume of complex microbiological data sets. Importantly, these data sets are rich in biological information with potential for predictive environmental classification and forecasting. However, the patterns in this information are often hidden amongst the inherent complexity of the data. There has been a continued rise in the development and adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning architectures for solving research challenges of this sort. Indeed, the interface between molecular microbial ecology and artificial intelligence (AI) appears to show considerable potential for significantly advancing environmental monitoring and management practices through their application. Here, we provide a primer for ML, highlight the notion of retaining biological sample information for supervised ML, discuss workflow considerations, and review the state of the art of the exciting, yet nascent, interdisciplinary field of ML-driven microbial ecology.

The rainfall predicted by these models 1-3 days (24-72 h) before the LF day of tropical cyclones was compared with TRMM_3B42 rainfall data. Cyclone induced rainfall occurs along its track; thus rainfall within 600 km along the cyclone track was used for comparison. The error in cyclone track prediction affects the rainfall prediction. This has been taken care of by shifting the rainfall distribution over the cyclone best track positions provided by the India Meteorological Department. The validation statistics for the rainfall prediction accuracy of the models were computed by combining the forecasts generated by these seven models during LF of nine cyclones formed in the North Indian Ocean during 2010-2013. The skill of the models was analysed using different rainfall validation measures/statistics. Based on these validation statistics it was found that, of the seven global models, the models from four centres, namely the National Center for Environment Prediction, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts, the UK Meteorological Office and the Canadian Meteorological Centre, performed closer to the observations.

In this paper, a silica-aerogel filled super-insulating glazing system was proposed. A numerical study was conducted to analyze the energy performance and visual performance of the proposed glazing system. Two popular building simulation programs namely EnergyPlus and Radiance were applied in the numerical study. In the study of the energy performance, three control strategies (space temperature control, operative temperature control and PMV control) were applied to simulate the occupant's control behavior toward the air-conditioning system in reality. The result indicated that compared with conventional single clear glazing, the silica aerogel glazing could retain a 4% longer thermally comfort period, while the energy consumption of HVAC system was reduced by 4-7%. The performance of the silica aerogel glazing was almost equal to that of the state-of-art low-e glazing. It is also concluded that as the occupant's request on thermal comfort got stricter, the performance of the silica aerogel glazing would became better. In the visual comfort point of view, it can be concluded that the glare effect and near-window bright zone could be reduced significantly while indoor illumination level still met the requirement.

This article analyses the forms of this persistence, its effects and its causes in the Valley of the Senegal River through a study of the introduction of a social business dairy project into the pastoral area surrounding the city of Richard Toll. The industrial dairy producers and the pastoralists mutually use each other for their own ends, thereby reinforcing the discrepancy between their objectives and the logic of their systems. The model of intensification is persistent because it plays a political role in constructing alliances between actors from agribusiness, and because choices about land use and resource access are depoliticised and repeatedly made in their favour. The article underlines the urgency of re-politicising and rethinking the logic behind pastoral development and the challenges it faces, and of deconstructing the rhetoric of reconciling profit with social development which serves mainly to reinforce the role that private businesses play in shaping public action.","[Magnani, Sergio Dario; Ancey, Veronique] Joint Res Team Pastoralism & Drylands, Dakar, Senegal; [Magnani, Sergio Dario] Inst Res & Applicat Dev Methods Iram, Pastoral Dev, Montpellier, France; [Ancey, Veronique] Res Team Acteurs Ressources & Terr Dev ART Dev, Montpellier, France; [Ancey, Veronique] FAO, Anim Prod & Genet Resources Branch AGAG, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Hubert, Bernard] French Acad Agr, Paris, France; [Hubert, Bernard] Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, Paris, France; [Hubert, Bernard] Adv Sch Social Sci EHESS, Paris, France; [Hubert, Bernard] Agropolis Int, Montpellier, France; [Hubert, Bernard] French CRAI Commiss Rech Agron Int, Paris, France",Universite de Montpellier; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); INRAE,"Magnani, SD (corresponding author), Joint Res Team Pastoralism & Drylands, Dakar, Senegal.;Magnani, SD (corresponding author), Inst Res & Applicat Dev Methods Iram, Pastoral Dev, Montpellier, France.",semagnani@gmail.com; veronique.ancey@cirad.fr; hubert@agropolis.fr,,"Magnani, Sergio/0000-0003-4699-2247",,,,,79,2,2,1,19,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0822-7942,1752-2366,,NOMAD PEOPLES,Nomad.

Simulations of scattered convective clouds near Houston, Texas, are conducted, after being initialized with both relatively low and high CCN concentrations. Deep convective updrafts are identified, and trends in the updraft intensity and frequency are assessed. The factors contributing to the vertical velocity tendencies are examined to identify the physical processes associated with the CCN-induced updraft changes. The models show several consistent trends. In general, the changes between the High-CCN and Low-CCN simulations in updraft magnitudes throughout the depth of the troposphere are within 15% for all of the models. All models produce stronger (similar to 15%-15%) mean updrafts from similar to 4-7 km above ground level (AGL) in the High-CCN simulations, followed by a waning response up to similar to 8 km AGL in most of the models. Thermal buoyancy was more sensitive than condensate loading to varying CCN concentrations in most of the models and more impactful in the mean updraft responses. However, there are also differences between the models. The change in the amount of deep convective updrafts varies significantly. Furthermore, approximately half the models demonstrate neutral-to-weaker (similar to 25% to 0%) updrafts above similar to 8 km AGL, while the other models show stronger (similar to 110%) updrafts in the High-CCN simulations. The combination of the CCN-induced impacts on the buoyancy and vertical perturbation pressure gradient terms better explains these middle- and upper-tropospheric updraft trends than the buoyancy terms alone.","[Marinescu, Peter J.; van den Heever, Susan C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Heikenfeld, Max; Stier, Philip; White, Bethan A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Barrett, Andrew, I; Barthlott, Christian; Hoose, Corinna] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Fan, Jiwen; Zhang, Yuwei] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Fridlind, Ann M.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Matsui, Toshi] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Matsui, Toshi] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Miltenberger, Annette K.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Miltenberger, Annette K.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Vie, Benoit] Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [White, Bethan A.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Colorado State University; University of Oxford; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Leeds; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Monash University,"Marinescu, PJ (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",peter.marinescu@colostate.edu,"Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009; Barthlott, Christian/A-9552-2013; Fridlind, Ann M/E-1495-2012; Fan, Jiwen/E-9138-2011; Marinescu, Peter/GRJ-9592-2022; Stier, Philip/B-2258-2008","Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789; Barthlott, Christian/0000-0003-2927-5051; Fridlind, Ann M/0000-0002-9020-0852; Fan, Jiwen/0000-0001-5280-4391; Stier, Philip/0000-0002-1191-0128; Marinescu, Peter/0000-0002-5842-969X","NASA [80NSSC18K0149]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF) [DGE-1840343]; European 330 Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant [FP7-280025]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) Project BACCHUS [603445]; European Research Council (ERC) project (RECAP) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [724602]; Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0006988, DE-SC0016237]; NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction program; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; Federal Ministry of Education and Research","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF); European 330 Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) Project BACCHUS; European Research Council (ERC) project (RECAP) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","The reviews and suggestions from Dr. Wei-Kuo Tao and two anonymous reviewers improved the clarity of this manuscript and are greatly appreciated.

The site, directly below the ruins of the Rusenschloss near Gerhausen, a part of Blaubeuren in the Alb-Donau district, was excavated in the late 1950s and early 1960s under the direction of G. Riek. With a total of ten layers assigned to the Middle Palaeolithic (very probably all MIS 4 and 3), it is the site with the longest Middle Palaeolithic stratigraphy on the Swabian Alb. Following a PhD thesis published in the 1980s, the site became known also beyond the region. Since this work, the finds have been repeatedly analysed according to the respective state of the art. Through our analyses of the lithic material, it was possible to refit core fragments that provide new information about the reduction strategies within the site. Likewise, the discovery of previously unpublished photographs of the excavations in the archives of the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, University of Tubingen, made it possible to reconstruct the excavation sequence.","[Frick, Jens Axel; Schuerch, Benjamin; Cep, Berrin] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Inst Ur & Fruhgeschichte & Archaol Mittelalters, Abt Altere Urgeschichte & Quartarokol, Schloss Hohentubingen, Burgsteige 11, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Frick, JA (corresponding author), Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Inst Ur & Fruhgeschichte & Archaol Mittelalters, Abt Altere Urgeschichte & Quartarokol, Schloss Hohentubingen, Burgsteige 11, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany.",jens-axel.frick@ifu.uni-tuebingen.de; benjamin.schuerch@uni-tuebingen.de; berrin.cep@uni-tuebingen.de,"Schürch, Benjamin/GOV-4938-2022","Schürch, Benjamin/0000-0001-9558-582X",,,,,132,1,1,0,0,ROMISCH-GERMANISCHES ZENTRALMUSEUM,MAINZ,"ERNST-LUDWIG-PLATZ 2, MAINZ, 55116, GERMANY",0342-734X,,,ARCHAOL KORRESPONDEN,Archaol.

This trend is facilitated by advancements in computational resources, improvements in simulation skill, and the desire to build numerical simulators that represent the water cycle with greater fidelity. In this quest to develop a state-of-the-art water cycle model, we coupled HydroGeoSphere (HGS), a 3-D control-volume finite element surface and variably saturated subsurface flow model that includes evapotranspiration processes, to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, a 3-D finite difference nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model. The two-way coupled model, referred to as HGS-WRF, exchanges the actual evapotranspiration fluxes and soil saturations calculated by HGS to WRF; conversely, the potential evapotranspiration and precipitation fluxes from WRF are passed to HGS. The flexible HGS-WRF coupling method allows for unique meshes used by each model, while maintaining mass and energy conservation between the domains. Furthermore, the HGS-WRF coupling implements a subtime stepping algorithm to minimize computational expense. As a demonstration of HGS-WRF's capabilities, we applied it to the California Basin and found a strong connection between the depth to the groundwater table and the latent heat fluxes across the land surface.","[Davison, Jason Hamilton] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA; [Davison, Jason Hamilton; Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Sudicky, Edward A.] Aquanty Inc, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Sudicky, Edward A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Mallia, Derek V.; Lin, John C.] Univ Utah, Dept Atmospher Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Catholic University of America; University of Waterloo; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Davison, JH (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA.;Davison, JH (corresponding author), Aquanty Inc, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",DavisonJ@cua.edu,"Hwang, Hyoun-Tae/D-3359-2018","Hwang, Hyoun-Tae/0000-0002-3934-1158; Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X; Davison, Jason/0000-0001-9014-2341",Ontario Early Researcher Award; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair; Ontario Early Researcher Award; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair,"Ontario Early Researcher Award(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chair(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs); Ontario Early Researcher Award(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chair(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs)",Jason H.

Recent observations by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the CALIPSO satellite have been explained in terms of heterogeneous nucleation of NAT on foreign nuclei, revealing this to be an important formation pathway for the NAT particles. In state of the art global-or regional-scale models, heterogeneous NAT nucleation is currently simulated in a very coarse manner using a constant, saturation-independent nucleation rate. Here we present first simulations for the Arctic winter 2009/2010 applying a new saturation-dependent parametrisation of heterogeneous NAT nucleation rates within the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). The simulation shows good agreement of chemical trace species with in situ and remote sensing observations. The simulated polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) optical properties agree much better with CALIOP observations than those simulated with a constant nucleation rate model. A comparison of the simulated particle size distributions with observations made using the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) aboard the high altitude research aircraft Geophysica, shows that the model reproduces the observed size distribution, except for the very largest particles above 15 mu m diameter. The vertical NOy redistribution caused by the sedimentation of the NAT particles, in particular the denitrification and nitrification signals observed by the ACE-FTS satellite instrument and the in situ SIOUX instrument aboard the Geophysica, are reproduced by the improved model, and a small improvement with respect to the constant nucleation rate model is found.","[Grooss, J. -U.; Engel, I.; Guenther, G.; Mueller, R.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch Stratosphare IEK 7, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Engel, I.; Hoyle, C.

A state-of-the art, automated, short-term hydrologic prediction framework was implemented using GIS and a regional scale hydrological model (HEC-HMS). The hydrologic framework was applied to the Hudson River basin (similar to 36000 km(2)) in the United States using gridded precipitation data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and was validated against streamflow observations from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). Finally, 21 precipitation ensemble members of the latest Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS/R) were forced into HEC-HMS to generate a retrospective streamflow ensemble forecast for an extreme hydrological event, Hurricane Irene. The work shows that ensemble stream discharge forecasts provide improved predictions and useful information about associated uncertainties, thus improving the assessment of risks when compared with deterministic forecasts. The uncertainties in weather inputs may result in false warnings and missed river flooding events, reducing the potential to effectively mitigate flood damage. The findings demonstrate how errors in the ensemble median streamflow forecast and time of peak, as well as the ensemble spread (uncertainty) are reduced 48h pre-event by utilizing the ensemble framework. The methodology and implications of this work benefit efforts of short-term streamflow forecasts at regional scales, notably regarding the peak timing of an extreme hydrologic event when combined with a flood threshold exceedance diagram.

However, the FER's critical problem with traditional local binary pattern (LBP) is the loss of neighboring pixels related to different scales that can affect the texture of facial images. To overcome such limitations, this study describes a new extended LBP method to extract feature vectors from images, detecting each image from facial expressions. The proposed method is based on the bitwise AND operation of two rotational kernels applied on LBP(8,1) and LBP(8,2) and utilizes two accessible datasets. Firstly, the facial parts are detected and the essential components of a face are observed, such as eyes, nose, and lips. The portion of the face is then cropped to reduce the dimensions and an unsharp masking kernel is applied to sharpen the image. The filtered images then go through the feature extraction method and wait for the classification process. Four machine learning classifiers were used to verify the proposed method. This study shows that the proposed multi-scale featured local binary pattern (MSFLBP), together with Support Vector Machine (SVM), outperformed the recent LBP-based state-of-the-art approaches resulting in an accuracy of 99.12% for the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and 89.08% for the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset.","[Yasmin, Suraiya] Int Islamic Univ Chittagong, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chittagong 4318, Bangladesh; [Pathan, Refat Khan; Biswas, Munmun] BGC Trust Univ Bangladesh, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chittagong 4381, Bangladesh; [Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin] Sunway Univ, Ctr Biomed Phys, Sch Healthcare & Med Sci, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Faruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Space Sci Ctr ANGKASA, Inst Climate Change IPI, UKM, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC); Sunway University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Khandaker, MU (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Ctr Biomed Phys, Sch Healthcare & Med Sci, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.",suraiyabrishti@gmail.com; refatkhan93@gmail.com; munmun@bgctub.ac.bd; mayeenk@sunway.edu.my; rashed@ukm.edu.my,"Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin/F-5376-2011; Faruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal/D-1840-2013","Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin/0000-0003-3772-294X; Yasmin, Suraiya/0000-0003-3728-4927; Khan Pathan, Refat/0000-0002-3773-0950; Faruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal/0000-0003-4086-7672","Research Universiti Grant, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dana Impak Perdana (DIP) [2020-018]","Research Universiti Grant, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dana Impak Perdana (DIP)","This work was supported by the Research Universiti Grant, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dana Impak Perdana (DIP), code: 2020-018.",,38,5,5,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2020,18,,,,,,5391,10.3390/s20185391,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20185391,,,17,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,OE8XZ,32967087,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000580807800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed causes include human overkill, climate, anthropogenic induced habitat change or a combination of these. Most protagonists of the human overkill model suggest the impact was so swift, occurring within a few thousand years of human occupation of the continent, that archaeological evidence should be rare or non-existent. In Tasmania the presence of extinct megafauna has been known since the early twentieth century (Noetling, 1912; Scott, 1911, 1915) with earlier claims of human overlap being rejected because of poor chronology and equivocal stratigraphic associations. More recent archaeological research has not identified any megafauna from the earliest, exceptionally well-preserved late Pleistocene cultural sites. In 2008 however an argument for human induced megafaunal extinctions was proposed using the direct dates from a small sample of surface bone from two Tasmanian non-human caves and a museum sediment sample from an unknown location in a cave, since destroyed by quarrying (Turney et al., 2008). Turney et al. (2008) supplemented their data with published dates from other Tasmanian caves and open sites to argue for the survival of at least seven megafauna species from the last interglacial to the subsequent glacial stage. To investigate the timing of extinctions in Tasmania and examine the latest claims, new excavations and systematic surveys of limestone caves in south central Tasmania were undertaken. Our project failed to show any clear archaeological overlap of humans and megafauna but demonstrated that vigilance is needed when claiming survival of megafauna species based on old or suspect chronologies. The results of our six-years of fieldwork and dating form the first part of the present paper while, in the second part we assess the data advanced by Turney et al. (2008) for the late survival of seven megafauna species. A model of human prey selection and the reasons for the demise of a range of marsupials, now extinct, are discussed in the third part of the paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art analysis of a selection of mobility initiatives that may dictate the future of urban transportation and make cities smarter. These are mechanisms either recently introduced with encouraging uptake so far and much greater potential to contribute in a shift to a better transport paradigm or still in an embryonic stage of their development and yet to be embraced as powerful mechanisms that could change travel behaviour norms. Autonomous and connected vehicles are set to revolutionise the urban landscape by allowing machines to take over driving that for over a century has been exclusively a human activity, while electrical vehicles are already helping decarbonising the transport sector. Bus rapid transit has been steadily reinventing and rebranding conventional bus services revitalising the use of the humblest form of public transport, while hyperloop is an entirely new, disruptive, and somewhat provocative, travel mode proposition based on the use of sealed tube systems through which pods could travel free of air resistance with speeds exceeding 1000 km/h. Shared use mobility mechanisms like car-sharing, ride-sharing, ride-sourcing and public bicycles can help establishing a culture for using mobility resources on an as-needed basis, while mobility-as-a-service will take this sharing culture a step further, offering tailored mobility and trip planning packages that could entirely replace the need for privately owned modes of transport.","[Nikitas, Alexandros; Kougias, Ioannis; Alyavina, Elena; Tchouamou, Eric Njoya] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Logist Operat Hospitality & Mkt, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Kougias, Ioannis] European Commiss, Directorate Energy Transport & Climate, Joint Res Ctr, Energy Efficiency & Renewables Unit, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",University of Huddersfield; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Nikitas, A (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Logist Operat Hospitality & Mkt, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",A.Nikitas@hud.ac.uk; Ioannis.Kougias@ec.europa.eu; Elena.Alyavina@hud.ac.uk; E.Njoya@hud.ac.uk,,"Kougias, Ioannis/0000-0002-5655-4462",,,,,89,69,69,6,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,DEC,2017,4,,,,,,36,10.3390/urbansci1040036,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci1040036,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,VJ7PB,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000621628800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wheat yields are stagnating around the world and new sources of genes for resistance or tolerances to abiotic traits are required. In this context, the tetraploid wheat wild relatives are among the key candidates for wheat improvement. Despite its potential huge value for wheat breeding, the tetraploid GGA(t)A(t) genepool is largely neglected. Understanding the population structure, native distribution range, intraspecific variation of the entire tetraploid GGA(t)A(t) genepool and its domestication history would further its use for wheat improvement. The paper provides the first comprehensive survey of genomic and cytogenetic diversity sampling the full breadth and depth of the tetraploid GGA(t)A(t) genepool. According to the results obtained, the extant GGA(t)A(t) genepool consists of three distinct lineages. We provide detailed insights into the cytogenetic composition of GGA(t)A(t) wheats, revealed group- and population-specific markers and show that chromosomal rearrangements play an important role in intraspecific diversity of T. araraticum. The origin and domestication history of the GGA(t)A(t) lineages is discussed in the context of state-of-the-art archaeobotanical finds. We shed new light on the complex evolutionary history of the GGA(t)A(t) wheat genepool and provide the basis for an increased use of the GGA(t)A(t) wheat genepool for wheat improvement. The findings have implications for our understanding of the origins of agriculture in southwest Asia.","[Badaeva, Ekaterina D.] Russian Acad Sci, NI Vavilov Inst Gen Genet, Moscow, Russia; [Badaeva, Ekaterina D.; Zoshchuk, Svyatoslav A.; Surzhikov, Sergei A.] Russian Acad Sci, Engelhardt Inst Mol Biol, Moscow, Russia; [Konovalov, Fedor A.] Independent Clin Bioinformat Lab, Moscow, Russia; [Konovalov, Fedor A.; Knupfer, Helmut; Ruban, Alevtina S.; Neumann, Kerstin; Graner, Andreas; Hammer, Karl; Filatenko, Anna; Kilian, Benjamin] Leibniz Inst Plant Genet & Crop Plant Res IPK, Gatersleben, Germany; [Fricano, Agostino] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Genom & Bioinformat, Fiorenzuola Darda, PC, Italy; [Ruban, Alevtina S.] KWS SAAT SE & Co KGaA, Einbeck, Germany; [Kehel, Zakaria] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Rabat, Morocco; [Bogaard, Amy] Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England; [Jones, Glynis] Univ Sheffield, Dept Archaeol, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ozkan, Hakan] Univ Cukurova, Fac Agr, Dept Field Crops, Adana, Turkey; [Kilian, Benjamin] Global Crop Divers Trust, Bonn, Germany","Russian Academy of Sciences; Vavilov Institute of General Genetics; Russian Academy of Sciences; Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS; Leibniz Institut fur Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); University of Sheffield; Cukurova University","Badaeva, ED (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, NI Vavilov Inst Gen Genet, Moscow, Russia.;Badaeva, ED (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Engelhardt Inst Mol Biol, Moscow, Russia.",katerinabadaeva@gmail.com,"ÖZKAN, Hakan/C-8510-2011; Badaeva, Ekaterina D./N-4368-2017","ÖZKAN, Hakan/0000-0003-3530-2626; Surzhikov, Sergey/0000-0002-6043-1182; Badaeva, Ekaterina D./0000-0001-7101-9639; Graner, Andreas/0000-0003-3246-6393; Fricano, Agostino/0000-0003-3715-5834; Ruban, Alevtina/0000-0002-9011-6730; Bogaard, Amy/0000-0002-6716-8890; Neumann, Kerstin/0000-0001-7451-7086","European Community [FP7-613556]; Whealbi project; German Research Foundation (DFG) [FKZ KI 1465/1-1, FKZ KI 1465/5-1]; Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) of Germany [FKZ 01/12-13-KAD]; Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Research (IPK, Gatersleben, Germany); Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ, Cologne, Germany); Crop Wild Relatives Project (Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives) by the Government of Norway; Russian State Foundation for Basic Research [20-04-00284, 17-04-00087, 14-04-00247]; Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences","European Community(European Commission); Whealbi project; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) of Germany; Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Research (IPK, Gatersleben, Germany); Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ, Cologne, Germany); Crop Wild Relatives Project (Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives) by the Government of Norway; Russian State Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences(Russian Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, 2007-2013) under the grant agreement no FP7-613556, Whealbi project [http://www.whealbi.eu/project/], the German Research Foundation (DFG) (FKZ KI 1465/1-1 and FKZ KI 1465/5-1), the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) of Germany (FKZ 01/12-13-KAD), the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Research (IPK, Gatersleben, Germany), the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ, Cologne, Germany) and the Crop Wild Relatives Project (Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives) which is supported by the Government of Norway and managed by the Global Crop Diversity Trust [https://www.cwrdiversity.org/].EDB acknowledges support from the Russian State Foundation for Basic Research (projects 20-04-00284, 17-04-00087, 14-04-00247), State Budget Project and the Program `Dynamics and Preservation of Gene Pools' from the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.",,156,7,7,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0040-5752,1432-2242,,THEOR APPL GENET,Theor.

In order to reach such an understanding, it is important to know abiotic variables that impact and drive distributions of native and non-native species. We used an existing long-term macrobenthos database for species presence-absence information and biomass estimates at different environmental gradients in the northern Baltic Sea. Region specific abiotic variables (e.g. salinity, depth) were derived from previously constructed bathymetric and hydrodynamic models. Multidimensional ordination techniques were then applied to investigate potential niche space separation between all native and non-native invertebrates in the northern Baltic Sea. Such an approach allowed to obtain data rich and robust estimates of the current native and non-native species distributions and outline important abiotic parameters influencing the observed pattern. The results showed clear niche space separation between native and non-native species. Non-native species were situated in an environmental space characterized by reduced salinity, high temperatures, high proportion of soft seabed and decreased depth and wave exposure whereas native species displayed an opposite pattern. Different placement of native and non-native species along the studied environmental niche space is likely to be explained by the differences in their evolutionary history, human mediated activities and geological youth of the Baltic Sea. The results of this study can provide early warnings and effectively outline coastal areas in the northern Baltic Sea that are prone to further range expansion of non-native species as climate change is expected to significantly reduce salinity and increase temperature in wide coastal areas, both supporting the disappearance of native and appearance of non-native species.

These events, mostly enhanced by the extremely dry weather associated with the occurrence of strong El Nino conditions, resulted in the transnational transport of hazardous pollutants from the originating sources in Indonesian Borneo and Sumatra to the highly populated Malaysian Peninsula. Quantifying the population exposure form this event is a major challenge, and only two model-based studies have been performed to date, with limited evaluation against measurements. This manuscript presents a new data set of 49 monitoring stations across Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo active during the 2015 haze event, and performs the first comparative study of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter <10 mu m) and carbon monoxide (CO) against the output of a state-of-the-art regional model (WRF-Chem). WRF-Chem presents high skills in describing the spatio-temporal patterns of both PM10 and CO and thus was applied to estimate the impact of the 2015 wildfires on population exposure. This study showed that more than 60% of the population living in the highly populated region of the Greater Klang Valley was systematically exposed to unhealthy/hazardous air quality conditions associated with the increased pollutant concentrations from wildfires and that almost 40% of the Malaysian population was on average exposed to PM10 concentrations higher than 100 mu g m(-3) during September and October 2015.","[Mead, M.

The data set consists of 24-120 h daily precipitation forecasts from five state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs), i.e., European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (Europe), National Center for Environmental Prediction (USA), China Meteorological Administration (China), Canadian Meteorological Centre (Canada) and U.K. Meteorological Office (U.K.). The DMS-MME forecasts are constructed during the monsoon months (JJAS) for the years 2008-13 over the Indian mainland. For the training and verification purposes, India Meteorological Department rainfall is used. The forecast skill of the DMS-MME model has been compared with the performance of individual models and regression-based MME model. Further, to remove the nonnormality of rainfall distribution, square-root and logarithmic transfer functions are used for normalizing the precipitation data. The impact of these transfer functions on the forecast skill of the DMS-MME model has been assessed. The forecast skill of the proposed model is evaluated using the standard statistical measures. DMS-MME forecasts carries higher skill in terms of verification scores compared with the MME forecasts up to 120 h. It has been found that using the DMS-MME approach with a square-root transfer function (SDMS-MME) gives the best results. SDMS-MME outperforms the operational models and the regression-based MME at all forecast steps.","[Bhomia, Swati; Jaiswal, Neeru; Kishtawal, C.

The purpose of this work is to determine how much the scaling of the parameters from leaf to ecosystem level through a seasonally varying leaf area index (LAI) explains the parameter variation within and between PFTs. Using Fluxnet data, we simulate a seasonally variable LAI(F) for a large range of sites, comparable to the LAI(M) derived from MODIS. There are discrepancies when LAI(F) reach zero levels and LAI(M) still provides a small positive value. We find that temperature is the most common constraint for LAI(F) in 55% of the simulations, while global radiation and vapor pressure deficit are the key constraints for 18% and 27% of the simulations, respectively, while large differences in this forcing still exist when looking at specific PFTs. Despite these differences, the annual photosynthesis simulations are comparable when using LAI(F) or LAIM (r(2) = 0.89). We investigated further the seasonal variation of ecosystem-scale parameters derived with LAI(F). V-cm has the largest seasonal variation. This holds for all vegetation types and climates. The parameter alpha is less variable. By including ecosystem-scale parameter seasonality we can explain a considerable part of the ecosystem-scale parameter variation between PFTs. The remaining unexplained leaf-scale PFT variation still needs further work, including elucidating the precise role of leaf and soil level nitrogen.","[Groenendijk, M.; Dolman, A. J.; Gash, J. H.

Nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as an excellent tool to enhance crop production under current rapid climate change and increasing drought intensity. DS negatively affects plant growth, physiological and metabolic processes, and disturbs cellular membranes, nutrient and water uptake, photosynthetic apparatus, and antioxidant activities. The application of NPs protects the membranes, maintains water relationship, and enhances nutrient and water uptake, leading to an appreciable increase in plant growth under DS. NPs protect the photosynthetic apparatus and improve photosynthetic efficiency, accumulation of osmolytes, hormones, and phenolics, antioxidant activities, and gene expression, thus providing better resistance to plants against DS. In this review, we discuss the role of different metal-based NPs to mitigate DS in plants. We also highlighted various research gaps that should be filled in future research studies.

This paper has four major aims. First, we review the original concept of ecological fitting and relate it to the concept of exaptation and current ideas on the positive role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution. Second, we propose phenotypic plasticity, correlated trait evolution and phylogenetic conservatism as specific mechanisms behind ecological fitting. Third, we attempt to operationalize the concept of ecological fitting by providing explicit definitions for terms. From these definitions, we propose a simple conceptual model of ecological fitting. Using this model, we demonstrate the differences and similarities between ecological fitting and ecological resource tracking and illustrate the process in the context of species colonizing new areas and forming novel associations with other species. Finally, we discuss how ecological fitting can be both a precursor to evolutionary diversity or maintainer of evolutionary stasis, depending on conditions. We conclude that ecological fitting is an important concept for understanding topics ranging from the assembly of ecological communities and species associations, to biological invasions, to the evolution of biodiversity.","[Agosta, Salvatore J.; Klemens, Jeffrey A.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Agosta, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",agosta@sas.upenn.edu,"Agosta, Salvatore J/C-8876-2009",,"Sigma Xi; University of Pennsylvania; NSF [0508573, 0400833]; NSF",Sigma Xi; University of Pennsylvania; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We especially, thank Dan Janzen who first started our thinking about ecological fitting.

However, the existing sequential filters and smoothers usually cannot deal with nonlinear or high-dimensional systems well. A state-of-the-art technique is employed in this study to explore the fixed-interval smoothing problem of a conceptual two-dimensional airfoil model in incompressible flow from noisy measurement data. Therein, the governing equations of the airfoil model are assumed to be known or only partially known. A single objective optimization problem is constructed with the classical Runge-Kutta scheme, and then estimations of the system states, the measurement noise and even the unknown parameters are obtained simultaneously through minimizing the objective function. Effectiveness and feasibility of the method are examined under several simulated measurement data corrupted by different measurement noises. All the obtained results indicate that the introduced algorithm is applicable for the airfoil model with cubic or free-play structural nonlinearity and leads to accurate state and parameter estimations. Besides, it is highly robust to Gaussian white and even more complex heavy-tailed measurement noises. It should be emphasized that the employed algorithm is still effective to high-dimensional nonlinear aeroelastic systems.","[Liu, Qi; Xu, Yong; Li, Yongge] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yong] Northwestern Polytech Univ, MIIT Key Lab Dynam & Control Complex Syst, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Kurths, Jurgen] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Kurths, Jurgen] Lobachevsky Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia; [Liu, Xiaochuan] AVIC Aircraft Strength Res Inst, Xian 710065, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC),"Xu, Y (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.;Xu, Y (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, MIIT Key Lab Dynam & Control Complex Syst, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",hsux3@nwpu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Sciencs Fundation of China [12072264, 11772255]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018AAA0102201]; Research Funds for Interdisciplinary Subject of Northwestern Polytechnical University; Shaanxi Project for Distinguished Young Scholars; Shaanxi Provincial Key RD Program [2020KW-013, 2019TD-010]; Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University [CX201962]; Russian Ministry of Science and Education Agreement [075-15-2020-808]",National Natural Sciencs Fundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Research Funds for Interdisciplinary Subject of Northwestern Polytechnical University; Shaanxi Project for Distinguished Young Scholars; Shaanxi Provincial Key RD Program; Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University; Russian Ministry of Science and Education Agreement,"This work was partly supported by the National Natural Sciencs Fundation of China (Grants 12072264, 11772255), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2018AAA0102201), the Research Funds for Interdisciplinary Subject of Northwestern Polytechnical University, the Shaanxi Project for Distinguished Young Scholars, the Shaanxi Provincial Key R&D Program (Grants 2020KW-013, 2019TD-010), and the Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University (Grant CX201962).

Do climatic factors, an internal biological clock, or physiological processes dominate? Using state-of-the-art tracking and monitoring technology on fourteen free-ranging brown bears over three winters, we recorded movement, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), body temperature (T-b), physical activity, ambient temperature (TA), and snow depth to identify the drivers of the start and end of hibernation. We used behavioral change point analyses to estimate the start and end of hibernation and convergent cross mapping to identify the causal interactions between the ecological and physiological variables over time. Results: To our knowledge, we have built the first chronology of both ecological and physiological events from before the start to the end of hibernation in the field. Activity, HR, and Tb started to drop slowly several weeks before den entry. Bears entered the den when snow arrived and when ambient temperature reached 0 degrees C. HRV, taken as a proxy of sympathetic nervous system activity, dropped dramatically once the bear entered the den. This indirectly suggests that denning is tightly coupled to metabolic suppression. During arousal, the unexpected early rise in Tb (two months before den exit) was driven by TA, but was independent of HRV. The difference between Tb and TA decreased gradually suggesting that bears were not thermoconforming. HRV increased only three weeks before exit, indicating that late activation of the sympathetic nervous system likely finalized restoration of euthermic metabolism. Interestingly, it was not until TA reached the presumed lower critical temperature, likely indicating that the bears were seeking thermoneutrality, that they exited the den. Conclusions: We conclude that brown bear hibernation was initiated primarily by environmental cues, but terminated by physiological cues.","[Evans, A. L.; Arnemo, J.

For clarification, direct numerical simulation (DNS) data are additionally included, but the focus is placed on defining a general scaling behavior for scales ranging from global down to cloud resolving. For this, appropriate power-law exponents are determined by calculating and approximating the power density spectrum. The large-scale models (GCM and NWP) show a consistent scaling with a power-law exponent of approximately -2. For the high-resolution LESs, the slope of the power density spectrum shows evidence of being somewhat steeper, although the estimates are more uncertain. Also the transition between resolved and parameterized scales in a current GCM is investigated. Neither a spectral gap nor a strong scale break is found, but a weak scale break at high wavenumbers cannot be excluded. The evaluation of the parameterized total water variance of a state-of-the-art statistical scheme shows that the scale dependency is underestimated by this parameterization. This study and the discovered general scaling behavior emphasize the need for a development of scale-dependent parameterizations.","[Schemann, Vera; Stevens, Bjorn; Gruetzun, Verena] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Quaas, Johannes] Univ Leipzig, Inst Meteorol, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Max Planck Society; Leipzig University,"Schemann, V (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",vera.schemann@zmaw.de,"Quaas, Johannes/I-2656-2013; Stevens, Bjorn/A-1757-2013","Quaas, Johannes/0000-0001-7057-194X; Stevens, Bjorn/0000-0003-3795-0475",German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst); Max Planck Society for Advancement of Science,German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst); Max Planck Society for Advancement of Science(Max Planck Society),This project is funded by the extramural research program of the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) and the Max Planck Society for Advancement of Science.

In this work, a study is presented of semantic segmentation for vine detection in real-world vineyards by exploring state-of-the-art deep segmentation networks and conventional unsupervised methods. Camera data have been collected on vineyards using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) equipped with a dual imaging sensor payload, namely a high-definition RGB camera and a five-band multi spectral and thermal camera. Extensive experiments using deep-segmentation networks and unsupervised methods have been performed on multimodal datasets representing four distinct vineyards located in the central region of Portugal. The reported results indicate that SegNet, U-Net, and ModSegNet have equivalent overall performance in vine segmentation. The results also show that multimodality slightly improves the performance of vine segmentation, but the NIR spectrum alone generally is sufficient on most of the datasets. Furthermore, results suggest that high-definition RGB images produce equivalent or higher performance than any lower resolution multispectral band combination. Lastly, Deep Learning (DL) networks have higher overall performance than classical methods.

Smart buildings are seen by many stakeholders as the way forward. Smart buildings feature advanced monitoring and control systems that allow a better control of the buildings' indoor spaces, but it is becoming evident that the massive amount of data produced in smart buildings is rarely used. This work presents a long-term evaluation of a smart building testbed for one year; the building features state-of-the-art monitoring capability and local energy generation (PV). The analysis shows room for improving energy efficiency and indoor comfort due to non-optimal control settings; for instance, average indoor temperatures in all winter months were above 24 degrees C. The analysis of electricity and domestic hot water use has shown a relevant spread in average use, with single users consuming approximately four times more than the average users. The combination of CO2 and temperature sensor was sufficient to pinpoint the anomalous operation of windows in wintertime, which has an impact on energy use for space heating. Although the quantification of the impact of users on the overall energy performance of the building was beyond the scope of this paper, this study showcases that modern commercial monitoring systems for buildings have the potential to identify anomalies.

However, the application of AI approaches did not reach the peak of its potential due to the inappropriate handling of missing data and the omission of state-of-the-art techniques. In the present contribution, we proposed a hybrid method for the improved stability prediction of construction projects based on individual machine learning (ML) algorithms, input missing data imputation, semi-supervised learning and the classifier ensemble. Seven ML algorithms were selected to build individual classifiers for the classifier ensemble. 5-fold cross validation was used as the validation method and the performance measures were chosen to be the confusion matrix, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under ROC curve (AUC). Exhaustive grid search and firefly algorithm were used for hyper-parameters and weights tuning respectively. The capability of the proposed method was verified using an underground construction dataset, the stope hangingwall (HW) dataset. The case study shows that the input missing data imputation and semi-supervised learning improved the predictive performance of ML algorithms on HW stability prediction. The highest and average AUC values on the testing set were increased to 0.954 and 0.923 respectively on the expanded dataset, compared with 0.879 and 0.860 on the original complete dataset. Further improvement was obtained through the classifier ensemble, with the AUC value being increased to 0.976. Harnessing such method extends recent efforts for stability prediction in construction projects, and can significantly accelerate the project design and stability management. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the viscoelastic behavior of asphalt mixtures, cracks caused by intermediate temperatures (ITCs) have led researchers to think more about improving the technical properties of asphalt mixtures with additives. On the other hand, asphalt pavements are affected by freeze-thaw cycles during their service life, a process that intensifies distress and reduces crack resistance. However, despite the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the fracture behavior of LTCs and ITCs, this process has received less attention from researchers. Hence, in this study, the effect of Nano-SiO2 on the occurrence of low and intermediate temperature cracks under freeze-thaw damage (FTD) conditions in asphalt mixtures has been investigated experimentally. For this purpose, Semi -Circular Bending (SCB) and Edge Notched Disc Bend (ENDB) tests were used under mode I loading to investigate the effect of Nano-SiO2 on the crack resistance of the asphalt mixture (i.e., vertical and angular cracks) at temperatures of +/- 15 ?C. Before the fracture test, the samples were subjected to 0 and 3 FTD cycles to investigate the effect of these conditions on the long-term fracture resistance of the samples. The results showed that adding Nano-SiO2 increased the brittleness of the mixtures, fracture energy, and fracture toughness of asphalt mixtures containing vertical and angular cracks in both 0 and 3 FTD cycles. Also, it was concluded that Nano-SiO2 could recover a large part of the resistance reduced by the 3 FTD cycles; therefore, using Nano-SiO2 additive improved the long-term behavior of LTC and ITC asphalt mixtures under mode I loading and FTD conditions. Finally, by comparing all the geometries used in this research, it was concluded that from the point of view of fracture energy, the ENDB geometry, and from the point of fracture toughness, the SCB geometry with an angle of 35?was critical due to lower average fracture energy and lower average fracture toughness, respectively (temperatures of +/- 15 ?C under 0 and 3 FTD cycles).","[Zarei, Mohammad; Salehikalam, Arsalan] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Qazvin, Iran, Islamic R; [Tabasi, Ehsan] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Naseri, Alireza] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tabriz Branch, Tabriz, Iran; [Khordehbinan, Mohammad Worya] Univ Appl Sci & Technol, Cultur & Art Appl Sci Teaching Ctr Kurdistan Branc, Sanandaj, Iran; [Negahban, Meghdad] Payame Noor Univ PNU, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran",K.

The vulnerability of a particular location to pollution from reactive solutes, such as nitrate, is determined by the interplay between hydrologic transport and biogeochemical transformations. Current studies on the controls of subsurface vulnerability do not consider the transient behaviour of transport dynamics in the root zone. Here, using state-of-the-art hydrologic simulations driven by observed hydroclimatic forcing, we demonstrate the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hydrologic transport dynamics and reveal that these dynamics are primarily controlled by the hydroclimatic gradient of the aridity index across Europe. Contrasting the space-time dynamics of transport times with reactive timescales of denitrification in soil indicate that similar to 75% of the cultivated areas across Europe are potentially vulnerable to nitrate leaching for at least onethird of the year. We find that neglecting the transient nature of transport and reaction timescale results in a great underestimation of the extent of vulnerable regions by almost 50%. Therefore, future vulnerability and risk assessment studies must account for the transient behaviour of transport and biogeochemical transformation processes.","[Kumar, R.; Hesse, F.; Musolff, A.; Sarrazin, F.; Samaniego, L.; Fleckenstein, J.

As a response to these challenges the water sensitive cities concept emerged, which supports cities to become more resilient to these challenges while making them more prosperous, sustainable and liveable. A water sensitive city harnesses the whole water cycle through integrated water management solutions, designs beautiful blue and green urban spaces and comprises healthy communities who are strongly connected with each other and with their local environment. Indonesian cities have an opportunity to 'leapfrog' towards a water sensitive city and to bypass the negative consequences that have resulted from urbanisation and growth that developed countries have gone through Contributing to this growing field of research, this paper synthesizes key insights from the transformative change, sustainable urban water management and leapfrogging literature. The paper defines what leapfrogging to a water sensitive city means and describes three catalysts that facilitate this transition: trans-disciplinary science, cross sectoral collaboration and innovation experiments. The paper also introduces a joint Australian-Indonesian research program that develops water sensitive city leapfrogging strategies by translating these catalysts into practice.","[Brodnik, C.; Copa, V.; Rogers, B.; Farrelly, M.] Monash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Holden, J.; Brown, R.] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Marino, R.; Lovering, D.

The method (fully Bayesian), resolution (daily and 90 m), temporal extent (31 years), and accuracy provide a unique dataset for investigating snow processes. The verified dataset (based on a comparison with over 9000 station years of in situ data) exhibited mean and root-mean-square errors less than 3 and 13 cm, respectively, and correlation greater than 0.95 compared with in situ SWE observations. The reanalysis dataset was used to characterize the peak SWE climatology to provide a basic accounting of the stored snowpack water in the Sierra Nevada over the last 31 years. The pixel-wise peak SWE volume over the domain was found to be 20.0 km(3) on average with a range of 4.0-40.6 km(3). The ongoing drought in California contains the two lowest snowpack years (water years 2014 and 2015) and three of the four driest years over the examined record. It was found that the basin-average peak SWE, while underestimating the total water storage in snowpack over the year, accurately captures the interannual variability in stored snowpack water. However, the results showed that the assumption that 1 April SWE is representative of the peak SWE can lead to significant underestimation of basin-average peak SWE both on an average (21% across all basins) and on an interannual basis (up to 98% across all basin years).","[Margulis, Steven A.; Cortes, Gonzalo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5732D Boelter Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Girotto, Manuela] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Girotto, Manuela] Univ Space Res Assoc, GESTAR, Columbia, MD USA; [Durand, Michael] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Durand, Michael] Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Margulis, SA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5732D Boelter Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",margulis@seas.ucla.edu,"Durand, Michael Thomas/D-2885-2013; Girotto, Manuela/AAK-2193-2021","Durand, Michael Thomas/0000-0003-2682-6196; Girotto, Manuela/0000-0003-2795-2063",NASA NEWS project [NNX15AD16G]; NASA Earth System Science Fellowship [NNX11AL58H]; National Science Foundation [EAR-1246473],NASA NEWS project; NASA Earth System Science Fellowship(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was based in part upon work supported by a NASA NEWS project (Grant NNX15AD16G), a NASA Earth System Science Fellowship (Grant NNX11AL58H), and the National Science Foundation (Grant EAR-1246473).

Most of these techniques produce discontinuous outputs caused by obstacles, such as shadows, buildings, and vehicles. This study proposes a shape and connectivity-preserving road identification deep learning-based architecture called SC-RoadDeepNet to overcome the discontinuous results and the quality of road shape and connectivity. The proposed model comprises a state-of-the-art deep learning-based network, namely, the recurrent residual convolutional neural network, boundary learning (BL), and a new measure based on the intersection of segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleton called connectivity-preserving centerline Dice (CP_clDice). The recurrent residual convolutional layers accumulate low-level features for segmentation tasks, thus allowing for better feature representation. Such representation enables us to construct a UNet network with the same number of network parameters but improved segmentation effectiveness. BL also aids the model in improving the road's boundaries by penalizing boundary misclassification and fine-tuning the road form. Furthermore, the CP_clDice method aids the model in maintaining road connectivity and obtaining accurate segmentations. We demonstrate that CP_clDice ensures connection preservation for binary segmentation, thereby allowing for efficient road network extraction at the end. The proposed model improves F1 score accuracy to 5.49%, 4.03%, 3.42%, and 2.27% compared with other comparative models, such as LinkNet, ResUNet, UNet, and VNet, respectively. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate that the proposed SC-RoadDeepNet can improve road extraction by tackling shadow and occlusion-related interruptions. These assessments can also produce high-resolution results, particularly in the area of road network completeness.","[Abdollahi, Abolfazl; Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Adv Modelling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMG, Fac Engn & IT, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Climate Change, Earth Observat Ctr, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Alamri, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geol & Geophys, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",University of Technology Sydney; Sejong University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; King Saud University,"Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Adv Modelling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMG, Fac Engn & IT, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.;Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea.;Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Climate Change, Earth Observat Ctr, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",biswajeet.pradhan@uts.edu.au,"Pradhan, Biswajeet/E-8226-2010; Abdollahi, Abolfazl/U-4187-2019","Pradhan, Biswajeet/0000-0001-9863-2054; Abdollahi, Abolfazl/0000-0002-1704-4670","Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Australia; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2021/14]","Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Australia; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This work was supported in part by the Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Australia, and in part by the Researchers Supporting Project number RSP-2021/14, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,43,2,2,14,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

But now a remarkable series of finds from a remote Scottish island indicates that Ancient Britons were performing similar, if less elaborate, practices of bodily preservation. Evidence of mummification is usually limited to a narrow range of and or frozen environments which are conducive to soft tissue preservation. Mike Parker Pearson and his team show that a combination of microstructural, contextual and AMS(14)C analysis of bone allows the identification of mummification in more temperate and wetter climates where soft tissues and fabrics do not normally survive. Skeletons from Cladh Hallan on South Uist, Western Isles, Scotland were buried several hundred years after death, and the skeletons provide evidence of post mortem manipulation of body parts. Perhaps these practices were widespread in mainland Britain during the Bronze Age.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Archaeol, Sheffield S1 4ET, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Biol, Ctr Antropol Mol Studio DNA Ant, I-00133 Rome, Italy; Univ Sheffield, ARCUS, Sheffield S1 4ET, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Wales Coll Cardiff, Sch Hist & Archaeol, Cardiff CF1 1XL, S Glam, Wales; Bournemouth Univ, Sch Conservat Sci, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; British Geol Survey, NERC, Isotope Geosci Lab, Keyworth NG12 5GG, Notts, England; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO1 7EP, N Yorkshire, England; Univ York, Dept Archaeol, York YO1 7EP, N Yorkshire, England; Scottish Univ Res & Reactor Ctr, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Sheffield, Dept Oral Pathol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Wales Coll Cardiff, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Struct Biophys Grp, Cardiff CF1 1XL, S Glam, Wales; Univ Bradford, Dept Archaeol Sci, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Oxford, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3QJ, England; Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Dept Geosci & Civil Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Sheffield; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Sheffield; Cardiff University; Bournemouth University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Geological Survey; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Scottish Universities Research & Reactor Center; University of Sheffield; Cardiff University; University of Bradford; University of Oxford; Newcastle University - UK,"Pearson, MP (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Archaeol, Sheffield S1 4ET, S Yorkshire, England.",M.Parker-Pearson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Collins, Matthew James/O-1095-2019; Cook, Gordon T/E-3056-2010; Montgomery, Janet/A-2738-2012; Evans, Jane A/G-3673-2010; Mulville, Jacqueline/AAC-6106-2020; Collins, Matthew J/A-7534-2008; Chamberlain, Andrew T/F-2118-2018","Collins, Matthew James/0000-0003-4226-5501; Collins, Matthew J/0000-0003-4226-5501; Taylor, Gillian/0000-0002-9478-6053; Mulville, Jacqueline/0000-0002-9392-3693; Bardsley, Jennifer/0000-0001-8714-942X; Chenery, Carolyn Ann/0000-0001-9592-051X; Marshall, Peter/0000-0002-1949-7702; Montgomery, Janet/0000-0001-6729-3088",,,,,52,55,56,1,16,ANTIQUITY,YORK,"KINGS MANOR, YORK Y01 7EP, ENGLAND",0003-598X,,,ANTIQUITY,Antiquity,SEP,2005,305,,,,529,546,,,,,,18,Anthropology; Archaeology,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Anthropology; Archaeology,969MI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000232237900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we show that these changes significantly affect wintertime clouds and precipitation over the East China Sea downwind of major emission sources. Satellite observations show an increase of cloud droplet number concentration from less than 200 cm(-3) in the 1980s to more than 300 cm(-3) in 2005. In the same time period, precipitation frequency reported by voluntary ship observers was reduced from more than 30% to less than 20% of the time. A back trajectory analysis showed the pollution in the investigation area to originate from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Jinan industrial areas. A model sensitivity study was performed, isolating the effects of changes in emissions of the aerosol precursors SO2 and NOx on clouds and precipitation using a state-of-the-art mesocale model including chemistry and aerosol indirect effects. Similar changes in cloud droplet number concentration over the East China Sea were obtained when the current industrial emissions in China were reduced to the 1980s levels. Simulated changes in precipitation were somewhat smaller than the observed changes but still significant. Citation: Bennartz, R., J. Fan, J. Rausch, L. R. Leung, and A. K.

Band selection is a technique that provides clear physical-meaning results for hyperspectral dimensional reduction, alleviating the difficulty for transferring and processing hyperspectral images caused by a property of hyperspectral images: large data volumes. In this study, a simple and efficient band ranking via extended coefficient of variation (BRECV) is proposed for unsupervised hyperspectral band selection. The naive idea of the BRECV algorithm is to select bands with relatively smaller means and lager standard deviations compared to their adjacent bands. To make this simple idea into an algorithm, and inspired by coefficient of variation (CV), we constructed an extended CV matrix for every three adjacent bands to study the changes of means and standard deviations, and accordingly propose a criterion to allocate values to each band for ranking. A derived unsupervised band selection based on the same idea while using entropy is also presented. Though the underlying idea is quite simple, and both cluster and optimization methods are not used, the BRECV method acquires qualitatively the same level of classification accuracy, compared with some state-of-the-art band selection methods","[Su, Peifeng; Pellikka, Petri K.

The daily time values (12UTC) of meteorological variables in the period 1966-2017 from seven synoptic stations of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) (Jelenia Gora, Klodzko, Legnica, Leszno, Wroclaw, Opole, snie(z) over dotka) were used as the basic data to assess the thermal stress index UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index). The UTCI can be interpreted by ten different thermal classes, representing the bulk of these bioclimatic conditions. Stochastic autoregressive moving-average modelling (ARMA) was used for the statistical analysis and modelling of the UTCI as well as separately for all meteorological components. This made it possible to test differences in predicting UTCI as a full index or reconstructing it from single meteorological variables. The results show an annual and seasonal variability of UTCI for the Lower Silesia region. Strong significant spatial correlations in UTCI were also found in all stations of the region. No thermal stress is the most commonly occurring thermal class in this region (about 38%). Thermal conditions related to cold stress classes occurred more frequently (all cold classes at about 47%) than those of heat stress classes (all heat classes at about 15%). Over the available 52-year period, the occurrence of extreme heat stress conditions was not detected. Autoregressive analysis, although successful in predicting UTCI, was nonetheless unsuccessful in reconstructing the wind speed, which showed a persistent temporal correlation possibly due to its vectorial origin. We conclude thereby that reconstructing UTCI using linear autoregressive methods is more suitable when working directly on the UTCI as a whole rather than reconstructing it from single variables.","[Glogowski, Arkadiusz; Brys, Krystyna] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Protect & Dev, Ul CK Norwida 25, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [Perona, Paolo] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; University of Edinburgh,"Glogowski, A (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Protect & Dev, Ul CK Norwida 25, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland.",arkadiusz.glogowski@upwr.edu.pl; krystyna.brys@upwr.edu.pl; paolo.perona@ed.ac.uk,"Głogowski, Arkadiusz R/A-8806-2017","Głogowski, Arkadiusz R/0000-0002-7587-8892; Brys, Krystyna/0000-0001-6970-9649", [0019/SDU/2018/18],,"This research was co-financed under the program of the Minister of Science and Higher Education Strategy of Excellence -University of Research in 2018 -2019 project number 0019/SDU/2018/18 in the amount of PLN 700 000 as well under the Leading Reasarch Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019.",,51,4,4,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

These six components closely interact and contribute to fatal outcomes: primarily to extreme weather events and hydro-meteorological disasters (drought, flash floods, storms) and envirorimentally-induced migrations. These two fatal outcomes may have - in some cases societal repercussions that may trigger or contribute to domestic, regional and international crisis and conflicts and thus they may become an issue of both human, societal, national and international security. To illustrate the causal linkages: for example in Morocco in the 1980s and 1990s, the following chain of events could be observed: severe drought, increase in food prices, hunger riots, general strikes, the police and armed forces interfered to repress these violent upheavals and subsequently hundreds of casualties could be deplored. These cases were not listed as a conflict in the relevant conflict data bases. The paper is organised in three parts: In the first part, the complex casual interactions among six factors of global environment change, two fatal outcomes and three societal repercussions: crises, conflicts and conflict avoidance, prevention and resolution will be discussed. In the second part, different security concepts will be reviewed that may be of relevance for dealing with desertification as a security issue. In the third part, possible security relevance pro-active political strategies will be considered, to avoid, and prevent that desertification issues can pose security challenges, and to contribute to a resolution of the desertification driven violence.","Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Sci, D-1000 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,,,,,,,,,146,10,10,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1871-4668,,1-4020-3758-9,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,NATO Sci.

The DK's main purpose is to carry out measurements and monitoring of the deformation dynamics of wooden objects. The monitoring can take place in virtually any environment, for any desired duration (minutes, hours, weeks, years, and so on). The measurement can be carried out mainly, but not exclusively, in connection with fluctuations of ambient temperature and relative humidity. The DK provides a reliable and accurate record (a first step towards understanding) of the behaviour of original panel paintings placed in their usual exhibition location, enabling curatorial staff and researchers to (a) obtain information about the behaviour of individual supports, in order to evaluate the impact of climate on their conservation state, help to make decisions for future restoration interventions; and (b) provide reference data for calibrating and validating numeric models. It can also provide data on the deformation of a panel while it is handled and transported, enabling an evaluation of stresses to which it is subjected during this operation. The device consists of two displacement transducers, which are fixed (in a low-impact, reversible way) to the back face of the panel, perpendicular to the grain, at different distances from the panel's surface. The two transducers not only measure the in-plane shrinkage/swelling of the panel, but since they are located at different distances, their measurements can also be combined with simple geometrical calculations to indicate the amount of distortion (cupping) which the panel undergoes.

However, architectural integration of these systems in buildings has not been fully explored. Current developments such as small scale solar driven heat pumps and solar cooling kits commercially available for application raise questions about how to successfully integrate these systems into buildings, while present interesting opportunities for the development of new performance based fa ade components or even self-sustaining cooling fa ade modules for high-performing commercial buildings. The present paper seeks to discuss current possibilities for fa ade integration of solar cooling systems, generating a framework for the understanding and further development of solar cooling fa ade systems. The proposed framework was made by means of a review of solar cooling technologies and solar cooling fa ade concepts found in the literature. The outcomes of this study are a matrix outlining the possibilities for the integration of several components and subsystems from the entire cooling process (cooling generation, distribution and delivery), and an assessment of the development level of state-of-the-art experiences within the field considering examples from current research projects and working prototypes, for the development of solar cooling integrated fa ade concepts.

The present study was carried out to assess the salt tolerance among 15 local squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne) landraces. Different salt (NaCl) concentrations of 0, 100, 200 and 300 mM were selected in order to evaluate the response of the study germplasm to salt stress based on 12 agronomic parameters and 3 biochemical traits, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) and chlorophylls. A varied effect of the salt stress level was observed among the studied landraces based on germination potential, as well as on growth and biochemical parameters at seedling stage. Results showed that all landraces were drastically affected at high stress level with a significant variation in their stress response, indicating the existence of considerable genetic variability. Landraces 746 and 747 were the best performing cultivars across stress levels, whereas 1007, 1008 and 1009 were the most negatively affected. Based on the tested landrace performance, four landraceswere selected and further evaluated at biochemical level, focusing on the determination of compounds that play a key role in the ability to withstand salt stress. The mean MDA content across landraces was generally increased in stressed plants, as compared to the control treatment; the increase was attributed to a peak in MDA content at specific stress levels. In particular, 746 and 1007 showed the maximum content at 100 mM NaCl, while in landrace 751, MDA content reached its peak at 300 mM NaCl. In addition, the response of most landraces to salt stress involved an increase in free proline content, with the exception of 746, with the maximum content being observed either at 200 mM (748 and 751 landraces) or at 300 mM NaCl, where only 747 expressed the highest content. These findings can be extrapolated into efforts to develop more salt-tolerant squash landraces and exhaust the possibilities of using saline water or soils under changing climate conditions.","[Tarchoun, Neji; Saadaoui, Wassim; Mezghani, Najla] Univ Sousse, High Agron Inst Chott Mariem, Sousse 4042, Tunisia; [Mezghani, Najla] Natl Gene Bank, Blvd Leader Yasser Arafat,ZI Charguia 1, Tunis 1080, Tunisia; [Pavli, Ourania, I; Petropoulos, Spyridon A.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytokou St, Volos 38446, Greece; [Falleh, Hanen] Ctr Biotechnol Borj Cedria, BP 901, Hammam Lif 2050, Tunisia",Universite de Sousse; University of Thessaly; Centre de Biotechnologie de Borj Cedria,"Tarchoun, N (corresponding author), Univ Sousse, High Agron Inst Chott Mariem, Sousse 4042, Tunisia.;Petropoulos, SA (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytokou St, Volos 38446, Greece.",nejitarchoun@yahoo.fr; wessaadaoui@gmail.com; najla_mezghani@yahoo.fr; ouraniapavli@uth.gr; hanenfalleh@gmail.com; spetropoulos@uth.gr,"Petropoulos, S.

The solar modeling problem refers to the persisting discrepancy between helioseismological observations and predictions of solar models computed implementing state-of-the-art photospheric abundances. We critically reassess the problem, in particular considering the new set of abundances of von Steiger & Zurbuchen, determined through the in situ collection of solar wind samples from polar coronal holes. This new set of abundances indicates a solar metallicity Z(circle dot) >= 0.0196 +/- 0.0014, significantly higher than the currently established value. The new values hint at an abundance of volatile elements (i.e., C, N, O, Ne) close to previous results of Grevesse and Sauval, whereas the abundance of refractory elements (i.e., Mg, Si, S, Fe) is considerably increased. Using the Linear Solar Model formalism, we determine the variation of helioseismological observables in response to the changes in elemental abundances, in order to explore the consistency of these new measurements with constraints from helioseismology. We find that for observables that are particularly sensitive to the abundance of volatile elements, in particular the radius of the convective zone boundary (CZB) and the sound speed around the radius of CZB, improved agreement over previous models is obtained. Conversely, the high abundance of refractories correlates with a higher core temperature, resulting in an overproduction of neutrinos and a huge increase in the surface helium abundance. We conclude that the solar modeling problem remains unsolved.","[Vagnozzi, Sunny; Freese, Katherine] Stockholm Univ, Oskar Klein Ctr Cosmoparticle Phys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Freese, Katherine] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Michigan Ctr Theoret Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zurbuchen, Thomas H.] NASA Headquarters, 300 E St SW, Washington, DC 20546 USA; [Zurbuchen, Thomas H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Oskar Klein Centre; Stockholm University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Vagnozzi, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Oskar Klein Ctr Cosmoparticle Phys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",sunny.vagnozzi@fysik.su.se; ktfreese@umich.edu; thomas.h.zurbuchen@nasa.gov,"Vagnozzi, Sunny/W-7331-2019","Vagnozzi, Sunny/0000-0002-7614-6677",DoE [de-sc0007859]; Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics; Vetenskapsraadet (Swedish Research Council) [638-2013-8993]; Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics; NASA [NNX13AH66],DoE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics; Vetenskapsraadet (Swedish Research Council); Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"K.F.acknowledges support from DoE grant de-sc0007859 at the University of Michigan, as well as support from the Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics.

These materials mimic the functionalities of various natural materials found in the human body (e.g., the healing of skin and bones by the vascular system). The fabrication methods used to produce these vascular-system-like engineered self-healing materials, such as electrospinning (including co-electrospinning and emulsion spinning) and solution blowing (including coaxial solution blowing and emulsion blowing) are discussed in detail. Further, a few other approaches involving the use of hollow fibers are also described. In addition, various currently used healing materials/agents, such as dicyclopentadiene and Grubbs' catalyst, poly(dimethyl siloxane), and bisphenol-A-based epoxy, are described. We also review the characterization methods employed to verify the physical and chemical aspects of self-healing, that is, the methods used to confirm that the healing agent has been released and that it has resulted in healing, as well as the morphological changes induced in the damaged material by the healing agent. These characterization methods include different visualization and spectroscopy techniques and thermal analysis methods. Special attention is paid to the characterization of the mechanical consequences of self-healing. The effects of self-healing on the mechanical properties such as stiffness and adhesion of the damaged material are evaluated using the tensile test, double cantilever beam test, plane strip test, bending test, and adhesion test (e.g., blister test). Finally, the future direction of the development of these systems is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Bronstert, A; Plate, EJ",,,,"Bronstert, A; Plate, EJ",,,Modelling of runoff generation and soil moisture dynamics for hillslopes and micro-catchments,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WATER; SIMULATION; FLOW,"The modelling of hillslope hydrology is of great importance not only for the reason that all non-plain, i.e. hilly or mountainous, landscapes can be considered as being composed of a mosaic of hillslopes. A hillslope model may also be used for both research purposes and for application-oriented, detailed, hillslope-scale hydrological studies in conjunction with related scientific disciplines such as geotechnics, gee-chemistry and environmental technology. Despite the current limited application of multi-process and multi-dimensional hydrological models (particularly at the hillslope scale), hardly any comprehensive model has been available for operational use. In this paper we introduce a model which considers most of the relevant hillslope hydrological processes. Some recent applications are described which demonstrate its ability to narrow the stated gap in hillslope hydrological modelling. The modelling system accounts for the hydrological processes of interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, soil-moisture movement (where the Bow processes can be modelled in three dimensions), surface runoff, subsurface stormflow and stream-flow discharge. The relevant process interactions are also included. Special regard has been given to consideration of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning rapid soilwater Bow processes during storm conditions (e.g. macropore infiltration, lateral subsurface stormflow, return flow) and to its transfer to and inclusion within an operational modelling scheme. The model is ''physically based'' in the sense that its parameters have a physical meaning and can be obtained or derived from field measurements. This somewhat weaker than usual definition of a physical basis implies that some of the sub-models (still) contain empirical components, that the effects of the high spatial and temporal variability found in nature cannot always be expressed within the various physical laws, i.e. that the laws are scale dependent, and that due to limitations of measurements and data processing, one can express only averaged and incomplete data conditions. Several applications demonstrate the reliable performance of the model for one-, two- and three-dimensional simulations. The described examples of application are part of a comprehensive erosion and agro-chemical transport study in a loessy agricultural catchment in southwestern Germany, and of a study on the sealing efficacy of capillary barriers in landfill covers.

Liquid desiccant air-conditioning systems represent an energy-efficient and more environmentally friendly alternative technology for dehumidification and cooling, particularly in those cases with high latent loads to maintain indoor air quality and comfort conditions. This technology is considered particularly efficient in hot and humid climates. As a matter of fact, the choice of the desiccant solution influences the overall performance of the system. The current paper reviews the working principle of liquid desiccant systems, focusing on the thermodynamic properties of the desiccant solutions and describes an evaluation of the reference thermodynamic properties of different desiccant solutions to identify which thermodynamic, physical, transport property influences the liquid desiccant process and to what extent. The comparison of these thermodynamic properties for the commonly used desiccants is conducted to estimate which fluid could perform most favourably in the system. The economic factors and the effect of different applications and climatic conditions on the system performance are also described. The paper is intended to be the first step in the evaluation of alternative desiccant fluids able to overcome the problems related to the use of the common desiccant solutions, such as crystallization and corrosion to metals. Ionic liquids seem a promising alternative working fluid in liquid desiccant air-conditioning systems and their characteristics and cost are discussed.","[Giampieri, Alessandro; Ma, Zhiwei; Smallbone, Andrew; Roskilly, Anthony Paul] Newcastle Univ, Sir Joseph Swan Ctr Energy Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Ma, ZW (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sir Joseph Swan Ctr Energy Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",zhiwei.ma@newcastle.ac.uk,"Giampieri, Alessandro/AAP-3290-2021","Giampieri, Alessandro/0000-0002-9961-9115; Smallbone, Andrew/0000-0001-7843-8967; Roskilly, Anthony Paul/0000-0002-9356-3157; Ma, Zhiwei/0000-0003-3735-8850","Heat STRESS project - Engineering and Physical Science Research Council [EP/N02155X/1]; H-DisNet project - European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme [695780]; EPSRC [EP/P005667/1, EP/N02155X/1, EP/K039377/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Heat STRESS project - Engineering and Physical Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); H-DisNet project - European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the Heat STRESS project (EP/N02155X/1) funded by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, and the H-DisNet project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under grant agreement 695780.",,149,61,63,6,70,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

This work has created a geospatial platform using geographic information systems (GIS) combined with big data analytics for the southeastern region of United States. Severe injury reports were collected and visualized through state-of-the-art spatial statistics including spatial clustering, heat maps, and hotspots to identify the most vulnerable regions due to various injury types from a safety vantage point. A special focus was also given to the construction industry, considering the hazardous nature of the industry. Statistically significant spatial clustering was observed within the study region, with Moran's I index of 0.49. Hotspots for severe injuries were also identified with approximately 99% confidence level using Getis Ord Gi* statistics. Results indicated statistically significant high-risk zones particularly around city areas with spatial injury rates (SIR) up to approximately 2.84 per county. Analysis also showed increased number of severe injuries during summer months, with approximately 1,000 injuries during the month of June and July. The construction industry accounted for 20% of all injuries, with caught-in/between being the highest amongst the four primary causes of severe injuries, commonly known as the fatal four. Finally, a web-based application was created to disseminate the results. Big data mining coupled with geospatial technology in OSH management can offer decision makers up-to-date and highly geospatial information for severe injuries that can be integrated in developing a comprehensive occupational safety surveillance plan.

In a companion paper (Pace et al., 2006) the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent were used together with airmass backward trajectories to identify and classify different aerosol types. The MFRSR diffuse-to-direct ratio (DDR) at 415.6 nm and 868.7 nm for aerosol classified as biomass burning-urban/industrial, originating primarily from the European continent, and desert dust, originating from the Sahara, is used in this study to estimate the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA). A detailed radiative transfer model is initialised with the measured aerosol optical depth; calculations are performed at the two wavelengths varying the SSA values until the modelled DDR matches the MFRSR observations. Sensitivity studies are performed to estimate how uncertainties on AOD, DDR, asymmetry factor (g), and surface albedo influence the retrieved SSA values. The results show that a 3% variation of AOD or DDR produce a change of about 0.02 in the retrieved SSA value at 415.6 and 868.7 nm; a +/- 0.06 variation of the asymmetry factor g produces a change of the estimated SSA of <0.04 at 415.6 nm, and <0.06 at 868.7 nm; finally, an increase of the assumed surface albedo of 0.05 causes very small changes (0.01-0.02) in the retrieved SSA. The calculations show that the SSA of desert dust (DD) increases with wavelength, from 0.81 +/- 0.05 at 415.6 nm to 0.94 +/- 0.05 at 868.7 nm; on the contrary, the SSA of urban/industrial (UN) aerosols decreases from 0.96 +/- 0.02 at 415.6 nm to 0.87 +/- 0.07 at 868.7 nm; the SSA of biomass burning (BB) particles is 0.82 +/- 0.04 at 415.6 nm and 0.80 +/- 0.05 at 868.7 nm. Episodes of UN aerosols occur usually in June and July; long lasting BB aerosol episodes with large AOD are observed mainly in July and August, the driest months of the year, when the development of fires is frequent.","ENEA, Climate Lab, Rome, Italy; ENEA, Climate Lab, Palermo, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Meloni, D (corresponding author), ENEA, Climate Lab, Rome, Italy.",daniela.meloni@casaccia.enea.it,"di Sarra, Alcide/J-1491-2016; Meloni, Daniela/AAB-2217-2022","di Sarra, Alcide/0000-0002-2405-2898; Monteleone, Francesco/0000-0001-7330-2745; Meloni, Daniela/0000-0002-2171-1296",,,,,43,90,90,0,15,EUROPEAN  GEOSCIENCES UNION,KATLENBURG-LINDAU,"MAX-PLANCK-STR 13, 37191 KATLENBURG-LINDAU, GERMANY",1680-7316,,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is a tree boosting method that has evolved into a state-of-the-art approach for many ML challenges. However, it has rarely been used in simulations of land use change so far. Xilingol, a typical region for research on serious grassland degradation and its drivers, was selected as a case study to test whether XGBoost can provide alternative insights that conventional landuse models are unable to generate. A set of 20 drivers was analysed using XGBoost, involving four alternative sampling strategies, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) to interpret the results of the purely data-driven approach. The results indicated that, with three of the sampling strategies (over-balanced, balanced, and imbalanced), XGBoost achieved similar and robust simulation results. SHAP values were useful for analysing the complex relationship between the different drivers of grassland degradation. Four drivers accounted for 99% of the grassland degradation dynamics in Xilingol. These four drivers were spatially allocated, and a risk map of further degradation was produced. The limitations of using XGBoost to predict future land-use change are discussed.","[Batunacun; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Batunacun; Wieland, Ralf; Nendel, Claas] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Lakes, Tobia; Nendel, Claas] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Friedrichstr 191, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Batunacun (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.;Batunacun (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",batunacun@zalf.de,"Nendel, Claas/C-8844-2013","Nendel, Claas/0000-0001-7608-9097; Lakes, Tobia/0000-0001-8443-7899",Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,The publication of this article was funded by the Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association.,,99,11,11,16,54,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The decarbonization of industrial wastes contemplates the classic decarbonization through optimization of conventional processes as well as utilization of renewable energy and resources. The upgrading of existing processes and integration of the methodologies with a focus on efficiency improvement and reduction of energy consumption and the environment is the main focus of this review. The implementation of renewable energy and feedstocks, green electrification, energy conversion methodologies, carbon capture, and utilization, and storage are also covered. The main objectives of this review are towards chemical industries by introducing the potential technology enhancement at different subsectors. For this purpose, state-of-the-art roadmaps and pathways from the literature findings are presented. Both common and innovative renewable attempts are needed to reach out both short and long-term deep decarbonization targets.

First, we describe the hydrologic simulators used in IWROM applications, and the mathematical methods used to solve the optimization problems. It is suggested that IWROMs (a) seek to model coupled human-nature relationships and mimic the impact of water resources management strategies on the environment at the basin scale; (b) allow for the simulation and assessment of economic policies and strategies on water resources management; (c) can support basin-wide decision-making; and (d) are particularly useful for water-scarce regions.

These changes in lake ice cover must be understood in terms of resulting effects on lake ecosystems. Accurate predictions of lake ice phenology are essential to assess resulting impact. We applied the one-dimensional physical lake model FLake to analyse past variability in ice cover timing, intensity and duration of Berlin-Brandenburg lakes. The observed ice phenology in two lakes in the period 1961-2007 was reconstructed by FLake reasonably well and with higher accuracy than by state-of-the-art linear regression models. Additional modelling results of FLake for 38 Berlin-Brandenburg lakes, observed in the winter of 2008/09, were quite satisfactory and adequately reproduced the effects of varying lake morphology and trophic state. Observations and model results showed that deeper and clearer lakes had more ice-free winters, later ice cover freezing and earlier ice cover thawing dates, resulting in shorter ice-covered periods and fewer ice-covered days than shallow and less clear lakes. The 1947-2007 model hindcasts were implemented using FLake for eight Berlin-Brandenburg lakes without ice phenology observations. Results demonstrated past trends of later ice start and earlier ice end, shorter ice cover duration and an increase in ice-free winters.","[Bernhardt, Juliane; Engelhardt, Christof; Kirillin, Georgiy] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Bernhardt, Juliane; Matschullat, Joerg] Tech Univ Bergakad Freiberg, Interdisciplinary Environm Res Ctr, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Technical University Freiberg,"Bernhardt, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",bernhardt@igb-berlin.de,"Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Matschullat, Jörg/AAW-1655-2021","Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; ",,,,,66,55,60,5,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

However, there are concerns these clusters could produce large ramping events on time scales of less than 6 h as local meteorological phenomena simultaneously impact the production of several farms. This paper presents generation data from the wind farms in the Thames Estuary (the largest cluster in the world) for 2014 and quantifies the high frequency power ramps. Based on a case study of a ramping event which occurred on 3rd November 2014, we show that due to the large capacity of the cluster, a localised ramp can have a significant impact on the cost of balancing the power system on a national level if it is not captured by the forecast of the system operator. The planned construction of larger offshore wind zones will exacerbate this problem. Consequently, there is a need for accurate regional wind power forecasts to minimise the costs of managing the system. This study shows that state-of-the-art high resolution forecast models have capacity to provide valuable information to mitigate this impact. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, accurate information on temporal variation in building activity is rather limited. Dendrochronological databases containing dated historical wooden constructions provide an important resource. We used 6514 tree-felling dates to reconstruct building activity in the Czech lands for the period 1450-1950. Comparing felling dates with historical events demonstrated that building activity was negatively associated with intense wars, particularly during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). After the Peace of Westphalia (1648), socioeconomic renewal and demographic growth were reflected in an upsurge of building activity, especially ecclesiastical buildings. While the construction of ecclesiastical and noble buildings culminated around the 1720s, rural buildings peaked in the 1780s and the 1820s. Although no direct effect of climate was demonstrated, adverse climatic conditions leading to harvest failures and subsequent famines (e.g. the 'Hunger Years' 1770-1772) significantly contributed to declines in building activity. In contrast, a higher number of felling dates were detected when strong and/or frequent windstorms occurred. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of building activity in Central Europe and advocates the use of dendrochronological databases for the investigation of human activities in history.","[Kolar, Tomas; Sochova, Irena; Rybnicek, Michal] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Kolar, Tomas; Dorrovolny, Petr; Sochova, Irena; Rybnicek, Michal] Czech Acad Sci CzechGlobe, Global Change Res Inst, Brno, Czech Republic; [Dorrovolny, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Brno, Czech Republic; [Szabo, Peter] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dept Vegetat Ecol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Mikita, Tomas] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Forest Management & Appl Geoinformat, Brno, Czech Republic; [Kyncl, Tomas; Kyncl, Josef] DendroLab Brno, Brno, Czech Republic; [Flidr, Ales] Masaryk Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Art Hist, Brno, Czech Republic; [Merta, David] Archaia Brno Zu, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Kolar, T (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Brno, Czech Republic.",koldatom@gmail.com,"Rybníček, Michal/B-5714-2014; Szabó, Péter/B-1736-2010; Kolar, Tomas/B-4846-2014; Mikita, Tomas/B-5141-2014","Rybníček, Michal/0000-0003-1299-8923; Szabó, Péter/0000-0002-2985-0717; Kolar, Tomas/0000-0002-6461-7582; Dobrovolny, Petr/0000-0002-2682-1988; Mikita, Tomas/0000-0002-4013-8923; Sochova, Irena/0000-0002-0041-345X",SustES - Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions project [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000797];  [RVO 67985939],SustES - Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions project; ,"This work was supported by the SustES - Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions project, ref.

Here, we describe the discovery of three stratified and buried archaeological sites in the Nefud Desert, which includes the oldest dated occupation for the region. The stone tool assemblages are identified as a Middle Palaeolithic industry that includes Levallois manufacturing methods and the production of tools on flakes. Hominin occupations correspond with humid periods, particularly Marine Isotope Stages 7 and 5 of the Late Pleistocene. The Middle Palaeolithic occupations were situated along the Jubbah palaeolake-shores, in a grassland setting with some trees. Populations procured different raw materials across the lake region to manufacture stone tools, using the implements to process plants and animals. To reach the Jubbah palaeolake, Middle Palaeolithic populations travelled into the ameliorated Nefud Desert interior, possibly gaining access from multiple directions, either using routes from the north and west (the Levant and the Sinai), the north (the Mesopotamian plains and the Euphrates basin), or the east (the Persian Gulf). The Jubbah stone tool assemblages have their own suite of technological characters, but have types reminiscent of both African Middle Stone Age and Levantine Middle Palaeolithic industries. Comparative inter-regional analysis of core technology indicates morphological similarities with the Levantine Tabun C assemblage, associated with human fossils controversially identified as either Neanderthals or Homo sapiens.","[Petraglia, Michael D.; Groucutt, Huw S.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England; [Petraglia, Michael D.] Smithsonian Inst, Human Origins Program, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Alsharekh, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Dept Archaeol, Coll Tourism & Archaeol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Alsharekh, Abdullah] Minist Higher Educ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Breeze, Paul; Drake, Nick A.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Clarkson, Chris; Shipton, Ceri] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Crassard, Remy] CNRS, Lyon, France; [Jennings, Richard] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Archaeol, Cork, Ireland; [Parker, Adrian G.; Parton, Ash] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Roberts, Richard G.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Matheson, Carney; Veall, Margaret-Ashley] Lakehead Univ, Dept Anthropol, Paleo DNA Lab, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [al-Omari, Abdulaziz] Taif Antiqu Off, Saudi Gen Commiss Tourism & Antiqu, At Taif, Saudi Arabia",University of Oxford; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; King Saud University; University of London; King's College London; University of Queensland; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University College Cork; Oxford Brookes University; University of Wollongong; Lakehead University,"Petraglia, MD (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England.",michael.petraglia@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Parker, Adrian/X-2596-2019; Groucutt, Huw/GNM-5500-2022; Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021; Alsharekh, Abdullah M/AAH-3718-2019; Parker, Adrian/T-3421-2019; Matheson, Carney/ABE-5699-2020; Roberts, Richard Graham/B-8245-2013","Parker, Adrian/0000-0003-2989-7344; Matheson, Carney/0000-0002-3890-1838; Roberts, Richard Graham/0000-0002-0128-4119; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727; Clarkson, Chris/0000-0002-8938-8974; Jennings, Richard/0000-0001-9996-7518; Crassard, Remy/0000-0002-2403-1894",National Geographic Society; Leakey Foundation; European Research Council [295719]; Australian Research Council; Arts and Humanities Research Council,National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); Leakey Foundation; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This research was funded by the National Geographic Society, the Leakey Foundation, the European Research Council (no. 295719) and the Australian Research Council.

The specimen comes from the north-east Siberian site of Pokrovka 2 (55019'46.30 ' N, 92026'48.80 ' E). The remains consist of the anterior portion of the cranium or the superior part of the face; that is, the forehead and the roof of the eye sockets. Sadly, indifferent features of the frontal bone do not allow a confident diagnosis of the sex of the individual. The evidence suggests, however, that the remains are probably those of a young adult (teenager) and an anatomically modern human, rather than a Neanderthal. Radiocarbon dating was undertaken at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU). The radiocarbon age determination of the bone fragment, 27 740 +/- 150 bp (OxA-19850), is one of the earliest direct dates for a modern human from Siberia. The Pokrovka cranial fragment dates to the middle Upper Palaeolithic of Eurasia and is broadly contemporary with the human remains from the famous eastern European site of Sunghir. When the radiocarbon age is compared with the Cariaco Basin 14C data set and the Greenland oxygen isotope record of NGRIP, it corresponds with Greenland Interstadial 5, a warmer phase of the Last Glacial period, although this is a preliminary conclusion, and is based on climate records that may or may not be wholly synchronous between the two locations.","[Akimova, E.] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Archaeol & Ethnog, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Akimova, E.; Stasyuk, I.] Krasnoyarsk State Pedag Univ, Krasnoyarsk 660049, Russia; [Higham, T.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Buzhilova, A.; Dobrovolskaya, M.; Mednikova, M.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Inst & Museum Anthropol, Moscow 125009, Russia; [Buzhilova, A.; Dobrovolskaya, M.; Mednikova, M.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol, Moscow 117036, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Archaeology & Ethnography, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences; Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University; University of Oxford; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Institute of Archaeology, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences","Akimova, E (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Archaeol & Ethnog, Prospect Lavrentieva 17, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",,"Higham, Tom/Y-2707-2019; Dobrovolskaya, Maria/AAO-2565-2020","Higham, Tom/0000-0002-5949-598X; Dobrovol'skaa, Maria/0000-0001-9695-4199","Institute for Bioarchaeology, San Francisco, California; NERC [NRCF010002] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NRCF010002] Funding Source: researchfish","Institute for Bioarchaeology, San Francisco, California; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This investigation was supported by the Institute for Bioarchaeology, San Francisco, California.

State-of-the-art one-source evaporation models use remotely sensed radiometric surface temperature as a substitute for the aerodynamic temperature and apply empirical corrections to accommodate for their inequality. This introduces substantial uncertainty in operational drought mapping over complex landscapes. By employing a non-parametric model, we show that evaporation can be directly retrieved from thermal satellite data without the need of any empirical correction. Independent evaluation of evaporation in a broad spectrum of biome and aridity yielded statistically significant results when compared with eddy covariance observations. While our simplified model provides a new perspective to advance spatio-temporal evaporation mapping from any thermal remote sensing mission, the direct retrieval of aerodynamic temperature also generates the highly required insight on the critical role of biophysical interactions in global evaporation research.","[Mallick, Kaniska; Hu, Tian; Trebs, Ivonne; Sulis, Mauro; Bossung, Christian] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Mallick, Kaniska; Baldocchi, Dennis] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jarvis, Andrew] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Bhattarai, Nishan; Kustas, William P.] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD USA; [Eid, Yomna] Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; [Cleverly, Jamie] James Cook Univ, Terr Ecosyst Res Network, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Beringer, Jason; Silberstein, Richard] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Woodgate, William] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Woodgate, William] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Silberstein, Richard] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Hinko-Najera, Nina] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Creswick, Vic, Australia; [Meyer, Wayne S.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Ghent, Darren] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester, Leics, England; [Szantoi, Zoltan] European Space Agcy, Sci Applicat & Climate Dept, Frascati, Italy; [Szantoi, Zoltan] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Boulet, Gilles] Ctr Etud Spatiales Biosphere, Toulouse, France",Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Lancaster University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Wurzburg; James Cook University; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Queensland; Edith Cowan University; University of Melbourne; University of Adelaide; University of Leicester; European Space Agency; Stellenbosch University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Mallick, K (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Belvaux, Luxembourg.;Mallick, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kaniska.mallick@gmail.com,"silberstein, richard/GZM-4393-2022; Baldocchi, Dennis/A-1625-2009; Cleverly, Jamie/L-2134-2016; Beringer, Jason/B-8528-2008; Boulet, Gilles/C-3067-2013","Baldocchi, Dennis/0000-0003-3496-4919; Cleverly, Jamie/0000-0002-2731-7150; Sulis, Mauro/0000-0002-3149-4096; Beringer, Jason/0000-0002-4619-8361; Boulet, Gilles/0000-0002-3905-7560; Trebs, Ivonne/0000-0001-5966-4942","ESA CCI+ Phase1 New ECVS LST (ESA) [400123553/18/I-NB]; SMARTIES funding through FNR-PRIMA [INTER/PRIMA/19/13566440/SMARTIES]; FNR Luxembourg [INTER/MOBILITY/2020/14521920/MONASTIC]; FNR [C19/SR/13652816]; NASA Ecostress project; US Department of Energy, Office of Science; National Collaborative Infrastructure Strategy through the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network; Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship [DE190101182]","ESA CCI+ Phase1 New ECVS LST (ESA); SMARTIES funding through FNR-PRIMA; FNR Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund); FNR(Luxembourg National Research Fund); NASA Ecostress project; US Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Collaborative Infrastructure Strategy through the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network; Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship(Australian Research Council)","KM acknowledges the funding from ESA CCI+ Phase1 New ECVS LST (ESA/Contract No. 400123553/18/I-NB), SMARTIES funding through FNR-PRIMA (INTER/PRIMA/19/13566440/SMARTIES), and Mobility Fellowship from the FNR Luxembourg (INTER/MOBILITY/2020/14521920/MONASTIC).

Since windows play an important role in the overall energy and environmental performance of buildings, emerging technologies are focused on the optimization of these building components. Among window design technologies, electrochromic (EC) devices have received growing interest for their ability to dynamically manage the daylight and solar energy entering buildings. Near-infrared switching electrochromic (NEC) glazed windows use a novel EC window technology that is able to continuously provide high transparency while modulating solar heat gains. This study evaluated the manufacturing phase of NEC windows to understand if their use phase performance comes at acceptable manufacturing burdens. This study also identified which constraints are connected to the market shift to the novel technology, which can provide the research community with useful information to better design the technology as it develops. A comparative cradle-to-gate energy and emissions analysis was carried out between NEC and conventional EC windows. The obtained results for the Global Warming Potential of the conventional EC device was 85 kg CO2-eq/m(2) and the Cumulative Energy Demand was 1680 MJ-eq/m(2). Results for the NEC device were found to be 50 kg CO2-eq/m(2) and 1050 MJ-eq/m(2), with the reduction primarily due to replacing the energy intensive thin film deposition used in conventional EC with a solution-based coating process. Finally, when an entire window is modeled (EC device, frame, glazing and sealing), the difference over conventional EC, in terms of primary energy consumption, ranged for the whole window manufacturing from 15% to 21%, depending on the material of the frame.

Realistic estimates of the effects of tropospheric anthropogenic O3 on GPP are thus potentially important to assess the strength of the terrestrial biosphere as a carbon sink. To better understand the impact of ozone damage on the terrestrial carbon cycle, we developed a module to estimate O-3 uptake and damage of plants for a state-of-the-art global terrestrial biosphere model called OCN. Our approach accounts for ozone damage by calculating (a) O-3 transport from 45m height to leaf level, (b) O-3 flux into the leaf, and (c) ozone damage of photosynthesis as a function of the accumulated O-3 uptake over the lifetime of a leaf. A comparison of modelled canopy conductance, GPP, and latent heat to FLUXNET data across European forest and grassland sites shows a general good performance of OCN including ozone damage. This comparison provides a good baseline on top of which ozone damage can be evaluated. In comparison to literature values, we demonstrate that the new model version produces realistic O-3 surface resistances, O-3 deposition velocities, and stomatal to total O-3 flux ratios. A sensitivity study reveals that key metrics of the air-to-leaf O-3 transport and O-3 deposition, in particular the stomatal O-3 uptake, are reasonably robust against uncertainty in the underlying parameterisation of the deposition scheme. Nevertheless, correctly estimating canopy conductance plays a pivotal role in the estimate of cumulative O-3 uptake. We further find that accounting for stomatal and non-stomatal uptake processes substantially affects simulated plant O-3 uptake and accumulation, because aerodynamic resistance and non-stomatal O-3 destruction reduce the predicted leaf-level O-3 concentrations. Ozone impacts on GPP and transpiration in a Europe-wide simulation indicate that tropospheric O-3 impacts the regional carbon and water cycling less than expected from previous studies. This study presents a first step towards the integration of atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem dynamics modelling, which would allow for assessing the wider feedbacks between vegetation ozone uptake and tropospheric ozone burden.","[Franz, Martina; Zaehle, Soenke] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Biogeochem Integrat Dept, Jena, Germany; [Franz, Martina] Int Max Planck Res Sch IMPRS Global Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Zaehle, Soenke] Michael Stifel Ctr Jena Data Driven & Simulat Sci, Jena, Germany; [Simpson, David] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, EMEP MSC W, Oslo, Norway; [Simpson, David] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Arneth, Almut] KIT, Dept Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany",Max Planck Society; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Chalmers University of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Franz, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Biogeochem Integrat Dept, Jena, Germany.;Franz, M (corresponding author), Int Max Planck Res Sch IMPRS Global Biogeochem, Jena, Germany.",mfranz@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Simpson, David/A-3313-2009; Zaehle, Sönke/C-9528-2017","Simpson, David/0000-0001-9538-3208; Zaehle, Sönke/0000-0001-5602-7956",EU Framework Programme [282910]; Max Planck Society through the ENIGMA; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [647204]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme (QUINCY),EU Framework Programme; Max Planck Society through the ENIGMA; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme (QUINCY)(European Research Council (ERC)),"We would like to thank Magnuz Engardt of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for providing the RCA3 climate dataset.

The insights from our review indicate that cross-sectoral, multiscale, interdisciplinary research is beginning to provide a solid scientific foundation for applying the ecosystem services framework in urban areas and land management. Our review offers a foundation for seeking novel, nature-based solutions to emerging urban challenges such as wicked environmental change issues.","[Kremer, Peleg] Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Kremer, Peleg] New Sch, Tishman Environm & Design Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Hamstead, Zoe] New Sch, Milano Sch Int Affairs Management & Urban Policy, New York, NY USA; [Haase, Dagmar; Kabisch, Nadja; Larondelle, Neele] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Munich, Germany; [McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Environm Studies Program, Urban Ecol Lab, New York, NY USA; [Frantzeskaki, Niki] Erasmus Univ, Fac Social Sci, DRIFT, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Andersson, Erik; Schewenius, Maria; Elmqvist, Thomas] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kabisch, Nadja] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Munich, Germany; [Kabisch, Nadja] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Larondelle, Neele] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Rall, Emily L.; Hansen, Rieke; Pauleit, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Munich, Germany; [Voigt, Annette] Alpen Adria Univ, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Baro, Francesc; Langemeyer, Johannes] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Bertram, Christine; Rehdanz, Katrin] Kiel Inst World Econ, Res Area Environm & Nat Resources, Kiel, Germany; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, Trondheim, Norway; [Kaczorowska, Anna; Kain, Jaan-Henrik] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kronenberg, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Dept Int Econ, Lodz, Poland; [Rehdanz, Katrin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [van Ham, Chantal] IUCN, Gland, Switzerland",Villanova University; The New School; The New School; Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); The New School; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Stockholm University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Munich; University of Klagenfurt; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Chalmers University of Technology; University of Lodz; University of Kiel,"Kremer, P (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",,"Andersson, Erik/AAE-9771-2019; Kain, Jaan-Henrik/P-4805-2015; Baró, Francesc/C-1564-2019; Frantzeskaki, Niki/AAN-1044-2021; Elmqvist, Thomas/AAY-6344-2021; Langemeyer, Johannes/AAH-7736-2020; Kabisch, Nadja/ABE-6198-2020; Voigt, Annette/AAK-3239-2020; Kronenberg, Jakub/ABD-9941-2021; Langemeyer, Johannes/AAY-6252-2020; Kremer, Peleg/H-8373-2019; Kaczorowska, Anna/V-5710-2017; Kaczorowska, Anna Teresa/U-2502-2018","Kain, Jaan-Henrik/0000-0001-8838-099X; Baró, Francesc/0000-0002-0145-6320; Frantzeskaki, Niki/0000-0002-6983-448X; Elmqvist, Thomas/0000-0002-4617-6197; Langemeyer, Johannes/0000-0002-0558-8486; Kabisch, Nadja/0000-0002-8925-4423; Kronenberg, Jakub/0000-0003-4903-2401; Kremer, Peleg/0000-0001-6844-5557; Schewenius, Maria/0000-0002-7122-6790; Larondelle, Neele/0000-0003-2064-1713; Hamstead, Zoe/0000-0003-4104-2373; Andersson, Erik/0000-0003-2716-5502; Hansen, Rieke/0000-0002-4230-1579; Voigt, Annette/0000-0003-4434-1758; Kaczorowska, Anna/0000-0002-8993-9553; Rehdanz, Katrin/0000-0002-5336-0582; Kaczorowska, Anna Teresa/0000-0003-4372-5637; Haase, Dagmar/0000-0003-4065-5194; Bertram, Christine/0000-0002-8186-5617; Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720","ERA-Net BiodivERsA as part of the URBES project; ERANET fund; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1444755] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","ERA-Net BiodivERsA as part of the URBES project; ERANET fund; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA as part of the URBES project (2011-2014), and the national funding bodies contributing to the ERANET fund.",,64,119,124,37,254,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

The continuous development and improvement of urban land surface models enable rather accurate assessment of the environmental impact on urban development strategies, whereas physically-based simulations remain computationally costly and time consuming, as a consequence of the increasing complexity of urban system dynamics. Hence it is imperative to develop fast, efficient, and economic operational toolkits for urban planners to foster the design, implementation, and evaluation of urban mitigation strategies, while retaining the accuracy and robustness of physical models. In this study, we adopt a machine learning (ML) algorithm, viz. Gaussian Process Regression, to emulate the physics of heat and biogenic carbon exchange in the built environment. The ML surrogate is trained and validated on the simulation results generated by a state-of-the-art single-layer urban canopy model over a wide range of urban characteristics, showing high accuracy in capturing heat and carbon dynamics. Using the validated surrogate model, we then conduct multi-objective optimization using the genetic algorithm to optimize urban design scenarios for desirable urban mitigation effects. While the use of urban greenery is found effective in mitigating both urban heat and carbon emissions, there is manifest trade-offs among ameliorating diverse urban environmental indicators.","[Li, Peiyuan; Xu, Tianfang; Wei, Shiqi; Wang, Zhi-Hua] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Wang, ZH (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",zhwang@asu.edu,,,"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-1930629, CBET-2028868, GEO-2044051, CISE-1931297]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC20K1263]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA20OAR4310341]; Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) project under NSF [DEB-1637590]",U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) project under NSF,"This study is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants AGS-1930629, CBET-2028868, GEO-2044051, and CISE-1931297, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under grant #80NSSC20K1263, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under grant NA20OAR4310341.

In some cases, trees may become the subject of dispute between neighbors, which sometimes ends in tree death after months or years of dispute. In this paper, we analyze a case of clandestine tree killing and look into ways through which evidence left by delinquents can be analyzed a posteriori with state-of-the-art approaches. The investigation presented here looks at a series of old-growth trees that were supposedly poisoned inside a protected, nineteenth century grove in Switzerland. After the sudden, unexplained death of several old Black poplar (Populus nigra) trees along the main alley in fall 2015 and their subsequent removal, the dying of five additional, neighboring Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and English walnut (Juglans regia) trees in 2016 promptly triggered a suite of criminal investigations at the property. During an initial inspection, a large number of boreholes was found in the root plates of the dying trees. We present findings obtained from treering, wood anatomical and dendrogeochemical investigations performed on root, stem and leave material from the assumedly poisoned trees and show that massive amounts of chemical elements-supposedly in the form organic pesticides with high Al, As, Fe, Cr, Ni contents, aluminum phosphides or glyphosate-based pesticides were injected into 36 boreholes drilled into the roots around September 2016. Results obtained in this study are currently used in criminal investigations, and are a nice example of how scientific detectives can help their real World colleagues in identifying delinquents.","[Stoffel, Markus; Canovas, Juan Antonio Ballesteros] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climate Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Stoffel, Markus; Canovas, Juan Antonio Ballesteros] Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab Ch, Geneva, Switzerland; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Slaveykova, Vera, I] Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Environm Biogeochem & Ecotoxicol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Slaveykova, Vera, I] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Corona, Christophe] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Univ Limoges, GEOLAB, CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite de Limoges,"Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climate Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab Ch, Geneva, Switzerland.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",markus.stoffel@unige.ch,"Stoffel, Markus/A-1793-2017; Slaveykova, Vera/AAL-2669-2020; Slaveykova, Vera I/A-1469-2016; Cánovas, Juan Antonio Ballesteros/ABG-7903-2020","Stoffel, Markus/0000-0003-0816-1303; Slaveykova, Vera/0000-0002-8361-2509; Slaveykova, Vera I/0000-0002-8361-2509; Ballesteros Canovas, Juan A./0000-0003-4439-397X; CORONA, Christophe/0000-0002-7645-6157",,,,,65,1,1,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,FEB,2020,2,,,,,,e03386,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03386,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03386,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,KS5SJ,32072064,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000518367800090,View Full Record in Web of Science

In view of this, the study evaluates the available orange peels in Ghana as potential bio-oil producing feedstock using fast pyrolysis technology in order to supplement the country's overriding fuel demand. The paper therefore reviewed the current advancement in fast pyrolysis bio-oil production and utilization, determined the available orange peel produced from fruit processing industries in Ghana and finally determined the potential yield of fast pyrolysis bio-oil to satisfy the projected fuel demand by 2020 and 2030. From this study, Ghana has the ability to replace just about 0.09% of its diesel and petroleum demand in 2020 and 0.07% in 2030 after processing just 10% of the total oranges produced using 2013 orange production as baseline. However, increasing the area of cultivation of oranges to 1.6 million ha (the area covered by cocoa in Ghana) and considering scenarios where the percentage of oranges processed were increased to 40%, 50% and 60% as observed in Brazil, USA, Mexico and other leading producers showed promising potential. The study observed that increasing the area of cultivation of oranges to the same area occupied by cocoa in 2013 saw a possible replacement of total diesel and petrol demand of 8.73% for processing just 10% increasing to 34.92% for 40% processing, 43.65% for 50% processing and 52.38% for 60% processing by 2020. Similarly, in 2030 the country will be able to replace 6.70% of the total diesel and petrol fuels with bio-oil for processing just 10% of its oranges produced which increases to 26.80% for processing 40%, 33.5% for processing 50% and 40.20% for processing 60% of oranges producing. The country still has the potential to channel some of the produced bio-oil for cooking purposes using improved stoves rather than relying on firewood and petroleum fuels. In order to meet these potentials, the study recommended, that the government creates appropriate platform for private sector collaborations and an improvement in R & D in order to integrate the fast pyrolysis technology on large scale.","[Aboagye, D.; Banadda, N.; Kiggundu, N.; Kabenge, I.] Makerere Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University,"Banadda, N (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda.",banadda@caes.mak.ac.ug,"Kiggundu, Nicholas/P-8494-2016; Kabenge, Isa/L-3500-2019; Aboagye, Dominic/AAA-1524-2021; Aboagye, Dominic/GZL-8428-2022","Kiggundu, Nicholas/0000-0001-9014-7695; Kabenge, Isa/0000-0003-1578-4568; Aboagye, Dominic/0000-0003-1504-9010; Aboagye, Dominic/0000-0003-1504-9010",,,,,68,28,29,2,31,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Given the relevance of teams and work-units in organizations, our aim is to analyze the state of the art on happy-productive work-units (HPWU) through a systematic review and integrate existing research on different collective well-being constructs and collective performance. Research on HPWU (30 studies, 2001-2018) has developed through different constructs of well-being (hedonic: team satisfaction, group affect; and eudaimonic: team engagement) and diverse operationalizations of performance (self-rated team performance, leader-rated team performance, customers' satisfaction, and objective indicators), thus creating a disintegrated body of knowledge about HPWU. The theoretical frameworks to explain the HPWU relationship are attitude-behavior models, broaden-and-build theory, and the job-demands-resources model. Research models include a variety of antecedents, mediators, and moderating third variables. Most studies are cross-sectional, all propose a causal happy-productive relationship (not the reverse), and generally find positive significant relationships. Scarce but interesting time-lagged evidence supports a causal chain in which collective well-being leads to team performance (organizational citizenship behavior or team creativity), which then leads to objective work-unit performance. To conclude, we identify common issues and challenges across the studies on HPWU, and set out an agenda for future research.","[Esther Garcia-Buades, M.; Isabel Montanez-Juan, Maria; Ortiz-Bonnin, Silvia] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Psychol, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Peiro, Jose M.] Univ Valencia, IDOCAL Inst Invest Psicol RRHH Desenvolupament Or, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Peiro, Jose M.] IVIE, Valencia 46020, Spain; [Kozusznik, Malgorzata W.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Work Org & Personnel Psychol Res Grp WOPP, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",Universitat de les Illes Balears; University of Valencia; KU Leuven,"Garcia-Buades, ME (corresponding author), Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Psychol, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.;Peiro, JM (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, IDOCAL Inst Invest Psicol RRHH Desenvolupament Or, Valencia 46010, Spain.;Peiro, JM (corresponding author), IVIE, Valencia 46020, Spain.",esther.garcia@uib.es; jose.m.peiro@uv.es; m.montanez@uib.es; gosia.kozusznik@kuleuven.be; silvia.ortiz@uib.es,"Montañez-Juan, Maribel/AAQ-2823-2021; Ortiz Bonnin, Silvia/R-9186-2018; Garcia-Buades, M.

The annual growth rate of this population is about 5%, while in a fast-growing seal population, it could be as high as 10-12%. The reasons behind the fairly slow population growth rate are not known. In the current study, we investigated reproductive rate and nutritional status of ringed seals in the Bothnian Bay, the largest subpopulation in the Baltic Sea. The aims of the present study were (1) to estimate reproductive rate of females and (2) to examine especially annual variation in nutritional status (blubber thickness) in relation to prey quality and quantity as it affects reproductive rate. The proportion of females with corpus albicans (an estimate of birth rate) in Baltic ringed seals has increased from low values since the late 1990s and is at present about 72%. It was highest among females at the age of 5-12years and declined thereafter, especially after the age of 20. Uterine occlusions, which earlier caused sterility to females, were rare in recent years. Blubber thickness of both pups and older seals decreased during spring and increased during the rest of the year. Average blubber thickness of sub-adults and adults declined until the early 2000s and increased thereafter, except in adult females, and correlated positively especially with average weight of herring (Clupea harengus). In sub-adults, blubber thickness correlated also with the weight and catch size of vendace (Coregonus albula). These results suggest that the quality and quantity of important prey fish may affect the nutritional status of seals. In recent years, average blubber thickness of adult females in spring declined, although herring quality increased. This may be partly due to stress caused by poor ice conditions in the nursing period in late winter.

These problems create a need for intelligent prediction models that learn and adapt to their environment in order to provide water managers with decision-relevant information related to the operation of river systems. This manuscript presents examples of state-of-the-art techniques for forecasting that combine excellent generalization properties and sparse representation within a Bayesian paradigm. The techniques are demonstrated as decision tools to enhance real-time water management. A relevance vector machine, which is a probabilistic model, has been used in an online fashion to provide confident forecasts given knowledge of some state and exogenous conditions. In practical applications, online algorithms should recognize changes in the input space and account for drift in system behavior. Support vectors machines lend themselves particularly well to the detection of drift and hence to the initiation of adaptation in response to a recognized shift in system structure. The resulting model will normally have a structure and parameterization that suits the information content of the available data. The utility and practicality of this proposed approach have been demonstrated with an application in a real case study involving real-time operation of a reservoir in a river basin in southern Utah.","Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, Utah Water Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Khalil, A (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",akhalil@cc.usu.edu,,,,,,,72,32,33,0,14,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

Thus, accurate radiative transfer models are required to compute the solar and infrared fluxes in complex urban geometry accounting for the spectral and directional properties of the atmosphere and city fabric materials. In addition, these reference models may be used to evaluate existing parametrization models of radiative heat transfer and to develop new ones. The present article introduces a new reference model for outdoor radiative exchange based on the backward Monte Carlo method. The integral formulations of the direct and scattered solar, and the terrestrial infrared radiative flux densities are presented. This model can take into account the ground (e.g., roads, grass), different types of buildings and vegetation (e.g., trees consisting of opaque leaves and trunks) with their spectral and directional (Lambertian and specular) reflectivity of materials. Numerical validations of the algorithm are presented against the results of a state-of-the-art model based on the radiosity method for the particular case of an infinitely long street canyon. In addition, the convergence of urban solar radiation budgets is studied for a selection of urban complex geometries including or not the window glazing. Good convergence is found for all geometries, even in the presence of rare events due to specular reflections.","[Caliot, Cyril] UPPA, LMAP, E2S, CNRS, 1 Allee Parc Montaury, Anglet, France; [Schoetter, Robert; Chung, Tin-Yuet] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, Toulouse, France; [Forest, Vincent; Eymet, Vincent] Mesostar SAS, Longages, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse,"Caliot, C (corresponding author), UPPA, LMAP, E2S, CNRS, 1 Allee Parc Montaury, Anglet, France.",cyril.caliot@cnrs.fr,,"Cyril, Caliot/0000-0003-3994-5637",French Agency for Ecological Transition ADEME [MODRADURB-1917C001]; French National Research Agency [ANR-21-CE46-0013],French Agency for Ecological Transition ADEME; French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This work received financial support from the French Agency for Ecological Transition ADEME (project MODRADURB-1917C001).

We evaluated the performance of five state-of-the-art global hydrological and land surface models in the context of modelling extreme conditions (drought and flood). Uncertainty was apportioned between the model used (model skill) and also the satellite-based precipitation products used to drive the simulations (forcing data variability) for extreme values of precipitation, surface runoff and evaporation. We found in general that model simulations acted to augment uncertainty rather than reduce it. In percentage terms, the increase in uncertainty was most often less than the magnitude of the input data uncertainty, but of comparable magnitude in many environments. Uncertainty in predictions of evapo-transpiration lows (drought) in dry environments was especially high, indicating that these circumstances are a weak point in current modelling system approaches. We also found that high data and model uncertainty points for both ET lows and runoff lows were disproportionately concentrated in the equatorial and southern tropics. Our results are important for highlighting the relative robustness of satellite products in the context of land surface simulations of extreme events and identifying areas where improvements may be made in the consistency of simulation models.","[Marthews, Toby R.; Blyth, Eleanor M.; Martinez-de la Torre, Alberto] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Veldkamp, Ted I.

In this paper, we decipher the effects of non-conductive pattern structures on the membrane in ED and identify two factors to control conductive/convective ion transports: i) electric view factor (deduced from the analogy of view factor of radiative heat flux) representing the possibility of ion conduction, and ii) vortex intensity representing the strength of ion convection. To do this, we build a two-dimensional ED platform with six different pattern structures on the membrane, and then visualize in situ ion concentration and fluid flow over these patterns in Ohmic, limiting, and overlimiting current regimes. In the Ohmic-limiting regime (V 2 V), the electric view factor determines current, Ohmic conductance, and salt removal. In the overlimiting regime (V 2 V), electroconvection (EC) occurs on the membranes, so the vortex intensity of EC determines current and salt removal. Moreover, overlimiting conductance can be predicted by the density of this vortex intensity. Lastly, taken together, we develop new scaling law for the electric Nusselt number, which presents the degree of ion convection vs. ion conduction, as a function of the pattern shape and EC strength.","[Kim, Joonhyeon; Kim, Sangha; Kwak, Rhokyun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Mech Convergence Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwak, Rhokyun] Hanyang Univ, Inst Nano Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Kwak, R (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Mech Convergence Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",rhokyun@hanyang.ac.kr,,,Climate Change Response Technology Development Project from the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017M1A2A2047475]; Individual Basic Science & Engineering Research Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019R1C1C1008262],Climate Change Response Technology Development Project from the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Individual Basic Science & Engineering Research Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the Climate Change Response Technology Development Project from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017M1A2A2047475) and Individual Basic Science & Engineering Research Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019R1C1C1008262).,,45,9,9,6,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0011-9164,1873-4464,,DESALINATION,Desalination,1-Feb,2021,,,,,,,114801,10.1016/j.desal.2020.114801,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2020.114801,,,10,"Engineering, Chemical; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Water Resources,PB0OY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000596028900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

MOENCH; GRAIN-SORGHUM; SEED-SET; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; YIELD; WHEAT; GENOTYPES,"Sorghum is an important food crop in arid and semiarid regions of the world. The resilience of sorghum production to changes in climate can be improved via better understanding of physiological bases of abiotic stress tolerance or susceptibility. Among the various abiotic stresses that limits sorghum production, drought and high temperature (HT) are of foremost importance. Physiological mechanisms of drought resilience are (i) drought avoidance, (ii) drought escape, and (iii) drought tolerance. Primary effects of drought stress are cellular dehydration and increase in hydraulic resistance. The secondary effects include reduced cellular and metabolic activities, stomatal closure, and production of reactive oxygen species. The primary and secondary effects finally leads to wilting by loss of turgor. In sorghum, the most sensitive stage to drought is during the panicle development, flowering, and grain-filling stages. The traits like stay green, limited transpiration under high vapor pressure deficit, canopy temperature depression, and root architecture can be used to identify drought stress tolerant genotypes. High temperature stress during reproductive stage (sporogenesis and anthesis) is most sensitive stage in sorghum. In sorghum, HT causes decreases the CO2 assimilation by causing damage to thylakoid membrane, stomatal conductance, and rubisco activase enzyme activity. Apart from this, HT stress decreases pollen viability leading to decreased seed numbers per panicle. The decreased seed number is not compensated with increased individual seed mass. The traits like canopy temperature depression, favorable respiration, time of day of anthesis, pollen germination percentage, seed-set percentage and seed size were the traits that has significant in identification of HT stress tolerant sorghum genotypes in the breeding program.","[Prasad, P.

The study of their interactions is important both for water resource management and environmental studies. However, despite constant innovation, physically-based simulations of water flows are still time consuming. That is especially problematic for large and/or long-term studies, or to test a large range of parametrizations with an adjoint model. As the current trend in computing sciences is to increase the computational power with additional computational units, new model developments are expected to scale efficiently on parallel infrastructures. This paper describes a coupled surface-subsurface flow model that combines implicit and explicit time discretizations for the surface and subsurface dynamics, respectively. Despite that the surface flow has a faster dynamics than the subsurface flow, we are able to use a unique nearly-optimal time step for each submodel, hence improving the resources use. The surface model is discretized with an implicit control volume finite element method while the subsurface model is solved by means of an explicit discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The surface and subsurface models are coupled by weakly imposing the continuity of water pressure. By imposing a threshold on the influence coefficients of the control volume finite element method, we can prevent the occurrence of unphysical fluxes in anisotropic elements. The proposed coupling is shown to produce results similar to state-of-the-art models for four different test cases while achieving better strong and weak scalings on up to 192 processors.

SECM is based on a simple equation depending on 17 empirical parameters, latitude, and date. The empirical parameters have been determined by least squares fitting to NOAA's (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) assimilation system CarbonTracker version 2010 (CT2010). Comparisons with TCCON (total carbon column observing network) FTS (Fourier transform spectrometer) measurements show that SECM XCO2 agrees quite well with reality. The synthetic XCO2 values have a standard error of 1.39 ppm and systematic station-to-station biases of 0.46 ppm. Typical column averaging kernels of the TCCON FTS, a SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY), and two GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) XCO2 retrieval algorithms have been used to assess the smoothing error introduced by using SECM profiles instead of CT2010 profiles as a priori. The additional smoothing error amounts to 0.17 ppm for a typical SCIAMACHY averaging kernel and is most times much smaller for the other instruments (e.g. 0.05 ppm for a typical TCCON FTS averaging kernel). Therefore, SECM is well suited to provide a priori information for state-of-the-art ground-based (FTS) and satellite-based (GOSAT, SCIAMACHY) XCO2 retrievals. Other potential applications are: (i) near real-time processing systems (that cannot make use of models like CT2010 operated in delayed mode), (ii) 'CO2 proxy' methods for XCH4 retrievals (as correction for the XCO2 background), and (iii) observing system simulation experiments especially for future satellite missions.","[Reuter, M.; Buchwitz, M.; Schneising, O.; Heymann, J.; Bovensmann, H.; Burrows, J.

Making electric vehicles attractive and competitive compared to conventional automobiles depends on the availability of reliable, safe, high power, and highly energetic batteries whose components are abundant and cost effective. Nickel rich Li[NixCoyMn1-x-y]O-2 layered cathode materials (x > 0.5) are of interest because they can provide very high specific capacity without pushing charging potentials to levels that oxidize the electrolyte solutions. However, these cathode materials suffer from stability problems. We discovered that doping these materials with tungsten (1 mol%) remarkably increases their stability due to a partial layered to cubic (rock salt) phase transition. We demonstrate herein highly stable Li ion battery prototypes consisting of tungsten-stabilized Ni rich cathode materials (x > 0.9) with specific capacities >220 mA h g(-1). This development can increase the energy density of Li ion batteries more than 30% above the state of the art without compromising durability.","[Kim, U. -H.; Jun, D. -W.; Park, K. -J.; Sun, Y. -K.] Hanyang Univ, Dept Energy Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Zhang, Q.; Kaghazchi, P.] Freie Univ, Phys & Theoret Chem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Aurbach, D.; Major, D.

Nowhere is this challenge more prominent than in Brazil, where low productivity and environmentally degrading agricultural activities occupy vast areas. We used the emergy synthesis approach, including innovative indices - emergy footprint and carbon-emergy output intensity - to assess and compare the environmental performance of an integrated crop-livestock system to a continuous crop and a continuous livestock system. Our analysis uses survey and empirical case study data from the 2017/18 crop season in Mato Grosso state, Brazil - the largest grain and beef producer in the country. Economic indicators such as gross revenue, production costs and profitability were calculated to complement the sustainability assessments. The emergy indices indicate that integrated crop-livestock system shows a balanced performance between input use and economic and environmental outcomes. In contrast, due to its heavy dependence on external inputs, the cropping system has poor environmental results, but the highest profitability. By excluding these environmental costs, current accounting of soy-corn production in Brazil dramatically overstates its net benefits to society and overall sustainability. The Emergy Sustainability Index for the integrated system was 0.66 and its Net Profit was USD 235.69 ha(-1), while for the continuous crop system the values were 0.47 and USD 295 ha(-1), respectively. The livestock system performed poorly in both, economic and environmental outcomes, underscoring the need to transition away from existing extensive systems. Livestock shows the highest positive greenhouse gas emissions, 7.98 E-09 tonCO2eq for each joule produced, and Net Loss of USD 0.58 ha(-1). These results provide further support for Brazil's investment in integrated systems as part of its climate mitigation and sustainable agricultural development plans and warrant consideration in sustainable agriculture initiatives in other countries where cattle production is widespread.

There are several plausible nucleation mechanisms and precursor species in this atmospheric region, which, in the absence of observational constraints, lead to uncertainties in modeled aerosols. In particular, the type of nucleation mechanism and concentrations of nucleation precursors, in part, determine the spatial distribution of new particles and resulting spatial distribution of CCN from this source. Although substantial advances in understanding NPF have been made in recent years, NPF processes in the UT in pristine marine regions are still poorly understood and are inadequately represented in global models. Here, we evaluate commonly used and state-of-the-art NPF schemes in a Lagrangian box model to assess which schemes and precursor concentrations best reproduce detailed in situ observations. Using measurements of aerosol size distributions (0.003 < D-p < 4.8 mu m) in the remote marine troposphere between similar to 0.18 and 13 km altitude obtained during the NASA Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission, we show that high concentrations of newly formed particles in the tropical UT over both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are associated with outflow regions of deep convective clouds. We focus analysis on observations over the remote Pacific Ocean, which is a region less perturbed by continental emissions than the Atlantic. Comparing aerosol size distribution measurements over the remote Pacific with box model simulations for 32 cases shows that none of the NPF schemes most commonly used in global models, including binary nucleation of sulfuric acid and water (neutral and ion-assisted) and ternary involving sulfuric acid, water, and ammonia, are consistent with observations, regardless of precursor concentrations. Through sensitivity studies, we find that the nucleation scheme among those tested that is able to explain most consistently (21 of 32 cases) the observed size distributions is that of Riccobono et al. (2014), which involves both organic species and sulfuric acid. The method of Dunne et al. (2016), involving charged sulfuric acid-water- ammonia nucleation, when coupled with organic growth of the nucleated particles, was most consistent with the observations for 5 of 32 cases. Similarly, the neutral sulfuric acid-water-ammonia method of Napari (2002), when scaled with a tuning factor and with organic growth added, was most consistent for 6 of 32 cases. We find that to best reproduce both nucleation and growth rates, the mixing ratios of gas-phase organic precursors generally need to be at least twice that of SO2, a proxy for dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Unfortunately, we have no information on the nature of oxidized organic species that participated in NPF in this region. Global models rarely include organic-driven nucleation and growth pathways in UT conditions where globally significant NPF takes place, which may result in poor estimates of NPF and CCN abundance and contribute to uncertainties in aerosol-cloud-radiation effects. Furthermore, our results indicate that the organic aerosol precursor vapors may be important in the tropical UT above marine regions, a finding that should guide future observational efforts.","[Kupc, Agnieszka; Williamson, Christina J.; Kazil, Jan; Ray, Eric; Froyd, Karl D.; Rollins, Andrew; Schill, Gregory P.; Brock, Charles A.] NOAA, Chem Sci Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Kupc, Agnieszka; Dollner, Maximilian; Weinzierl, Bernadett B.] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Aerosol Phys & Environm Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Williamson, Christina J.; Kazil, Jan; Ray, Eric; Froyd, Karl D.; McKain, Kathryn; Schill, Gregory P.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hodshire, Anna L.; Pierce, Jeffrey R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bui, T.

In the present work, a novel SfM-based technique for the analysis of damage mechanisms of cube-armored breakwaters is proposed, which is based on the evaluation of descriptors of the macro and micro-roughness of the armor layer. The first one represents the waviness of the armor slope, whereas the latter one is a proxy of the armor layer surface porosity. A systematic experimental investigation was performed, considering different upgrading options for a harbor rubble-mound breakwater with cube-shaped armor units, which involve, besides the rise of the wave wall, the addition of extra armor blocks similar or smaller than the existing ones. Damage measurements acquired through traditional laboratory techniques were combined with the armor surface roughness descriptors. The results of the novel analysis of the cube armor layer macro-roughness revealed that the processes which cause the displacement of the outer blocks are influenced by the level of waviness of the armor slope. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of the micro -roughness enabled the automated identification of four damage mechanisms experienced by the outer armor layer: (i) static equilibrium; (ii) incipient instability; (iii) bulk displacement; (iv) individual displacements. The use of the proposed roughness parameters makes simple and immediate the quantitative comparison between the performances of different upgrading solutions.","[Stagnitti, M.; Musumeci, R.

Canopy, litter, duff, dead wood, and other fuel components were burned in combinations that represented realistic fuel complexes for several important western US coniferous and chaparral ecosystems including ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, sub-alpine fir, chamise, and manzanita. In addition, dung, Indonesian peat, and individual coniferous ecosystem fuel components were burned alone to investigate the effects of individual components (e.g., duff) and fuel chemistry on emissions. The smoke emissions were characterized by a large suite of state-of-the-art instruments. In this study we report emission factor (EF, grams of compound emitted per kilogram of fuel burned) measurements in fresh smoke of a diverse suite of critically important trace gases measured using open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (OP-FTIR). We also report aerosol optical properties (absorption EF; single-scattering albedo, SSA; and Angstrom absorption exponent, AAE) as well as black carbon (BC) EF measured by photoacoustic extinctiometers (PAXs) at 870 and 401 nm. The average trace gas emissions were similar across the coniferous ecosystems tested and most of the variability observed in emissions could be attributed to differences in the consumption of components such as duff and litter, rather than the dominant tree species. Chaparral fuels produced lower EFs than mixed coniferous fuels for most trace gases except for NO x and acetylene. A careful comparison with available field measurements of wildfires confirms that several methods can be used to extract data representative of real wildfires from the FIREX laboratory fire data. This is especially valuable for species rarely or not yet measured in the field. For instance, the OP-FTIR data alone show that ammonia (1.62 g kg(-1)), acetic acid (2.41 g kg(-1)), nitrous acid (HONO, 0.61 g , and other trace gases such as glycolaldehyde (0.90 g kg(-1)) and formic acid (0.36 g kg(-1)) are significant emissions that were poorly characterized or not characterized for US wildfires in previous work. The PAX measurements show that the ratio of brown carbon (BrC) absorption to BC absorption is strongly dependent on modified combustion efficiency (MCE) and that BrC absorption is most dominant for combustion of duff (AAE 7.13) and rotten wood (AAE 4.60): fuels that are consumed in greater amounts during wildfires than prescribed fires. Coupling our laboratory data with field data suggests that fresh wildfire smoke typically has an EF for BC near 0.2 g kg(-1), an SSA of similar to 0.91, and an AAE of similar to 3.50, with the latter implying that about 86% of the aerosol absorption at 401 nm is due to BrC.","[Selimovic, Vanessa; Yokelson, Robert J.] Univ Montana, Dept Chem, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Warneke, Carsten; Roberts, James M.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Earth Syst Res Lab, Chem Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [de Gouw, Joost] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Reardon, James] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Fire Sci Lab, Missoula, MT USA; [Griffith, David W.

For every individual load point, the oxygen transport resistance and voltage losses due to the formation of platinum oxides were obtained in addition to commonly measured electrochemical surface area, high frequency resistance, as well as cathode ionomer resistance. These data were used to break down the voltage losses into six different contributors. With this break down, performance gains and performance losses were determined at end-of-test. At low current densities, it was found that voltage losses due to degradation are dominated by the loss of specific activity and catalyst surface area -in line with the state-of-the-art knowledge. But by quantifying the losses from platinum oxide formation explicitly, we show that end-of-test an unassigned voltage loss is not only present at highest current densities, but already at low current density. More precisely, the unassigned voltage loss shows a linear increase with decreasing half cell voltage and is independent from the chosen accelerated stress test. As this unassigned loss depends on half cell voltage, it might arise from ionomer adsorption. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Linear improvement is to apply to the mean visibility degradation on the statistically 20% worst days, measured as a Haze Index in units of deciviews (log of aerosol extinction). We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) with 1 degrees x 1 degrees horizontal resolution to simulate present-day visibility statistics in the USA, compare them to observations from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) surface network, and provide natural and background visibility statistics for application of the Regional Haze Rule. Background is defined by suppression of US anthropogenic emissions but allowance for present-day foreign emissions and associated import of pollution. Our model is highly successful at reproducing the observed variability of visibility statistics for present-day conditions, including the low tail of the frequency distribution that is most representative of natural or background conditions. We find considerable spatial and temporal variability in natural visibility over the USA, especially due to fires in the west. A major uncertainty in estimating natural visibility is the sensitivity of biogenic organic aerosol formation to the availability of preexisting anthropogenic aerosol. Background visibility is more variable than natural visibility and the 20% worst days show large contributions from Canadian and Mexican pollution. Asian pollution, while degrading mean background visibility, is relatively less important on the worst days. Recognizing the influence of uncontrollable transboundary pollution in the Regional Haze Rule would substantially decrease the schedule of emission reductions required in the 2004-18 implementation phase. Meaningful application of the Rule in the future will require projections of future trends in foreign anthropogenic emissions, wildfire frequency, and climate variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty tonnes dry matter ha(-1) greenwaste biochar were added to three plots and compared with three control plots. Cumulated N2O field measurements revealed a reduction of 21.5% in the plots with biochar. The reductions for samples where the biochar was added at the beginning of the experiment in the field and samples which were collected each month and measured in the laboratory were in the same range (11.4-39.2%). Emission reductions from laboratory incubations when biochar was freshly mixed with soil in the laboratory were about twice as large (46.5-58.0%). Our results indicate provisionally that, at our site, biochar controls N2O emission through its capacity for reducing NO3- availability to denitrifiers, with the efficiency being related to the effectiveness of mixing of biochar in soil.","[Felber, R.; Leifeld, J.; Neftel, A.] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut & Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Horak, J.] Slovak Univ Agr, Hort & Landscape Engn Fac, Dept Biometeorol & Hydrol, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Felber, R (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut & Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",raphael.felber@agroscope.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Horak, Jan/V-4106-2019","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Horak, Jan/0000-0003-0078-9083; Felber, Raphael/0000-0002-0285-2894",,,,,28,49,54,4,125,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-0754,1365-2389,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

We developed a comprehensive online monitoring system at Rappbode reservoir, the largest drinking water reservoir in Germany, and its inflows. The Rappbode Reservoir Observatory comprises of a set of online-sensors for the measurement of physical, chemical, and biological variables and is complemented by a biweekly limnological sampling schedule. Measurement stations are deployed at the four major inflows into the system, at the outlets of all pre-reservoirs, as well as in the main reservoir. The newly installed monitoring system serves both scientific monitoring and process studies, as well as reservoir management. Particular emphasis is paid to the monitoring of short-term dynamics and many variables are measured at high temporal resolution. As an example, we quantitatively documented a flood event which mobilised high loads of dissolved organic carbon and changed the characteristics of the receiving reservoir from eutrophic to dystrophic within a few days. This event could have been completely missed by conventional biweekly sampling programs, but is relevant for biogeochemical fluxes at the catchment scale. We also show that the high frequency data provide a deeper insight into ecosystem dynamics and lake metabolism. The Rappbode Reservoir Observatory; moreover, offers a unique study site to apply, validate, and develop state of the art lake models to improve their predictive capabilities.","[Rinke, Karsten; Kuehn, Burkhard; Bocaniov, Serghei; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin; Tittel, Joerg; Schultze, Martin; Herzsprung, Peter; Roenicke, Helmut; Rinke, Kristine; Friese, Kurt] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Lake Res, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany; [Buettner, Olaf] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal & Management, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany; [Rink, Karsten] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Informat, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Dietze, Maren] Talsperrenbetrieb Sachsen Anhalt, D-38889 Blankenburg, Germany; [Matthes, Marco] Fernwasserversorgung Elbaue Ostharz GmbH, Wasserwerk Wienrode, D-38889 Wienrode, Germany; [Paul, Lothar] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Forest Geo & Watersci, Okol Stn Neunzehnhain, D-09514 Lengefeld, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Technische Universitat Dresden,"Rinke, K (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Lake Res, Bruckstr 3A, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany.",karsten.rinke@ufz.de,"Friese, Kurt/E-1395-2012; Schultze, Martin/D-4985-2015; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/E-1708-2016; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Büttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008","Friese, Kurt/0000-0002-7769-0818; Schultze, Martin/0000-0003-3526-2919; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/0000-0002-7407-3312; Rinke, Karsten/0000-0003-0864-6722; Büttner, Olaf/0000-0002-4332-5441; BOCANIOV, SERGHEI/0000-0001-5988-2034; Herzsprung, Peter/0000-0001-5872-443X",TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [033L003A],TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research was funded by TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories; www.tereno.net) and by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Grant No. 033L003A.
