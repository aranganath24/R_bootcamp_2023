In this context, the use of a bio-regionalization analysis to objectively identify ocean areas that differ in their biological characteristics and environmental conditions may be useful to disentangle the functioning of the ecosystem. In this work, satellite surface chlorophyll-alpha concentration observations were used to obtain a bio-regionalization of the Labrador Sea (LS). Specifically, bioregions were defined using a K-means cluster analysis applied on the satellite time-series of chlorophyll-alpha concentration. Finally, the resulting biologically regionalization was used in conjunction with simulated data from a state-ofthe-art ocean circulation model (NEMO) to investigate difference in spring bloom timing response across the Labrador Sea (LS). Chlorophyll-alpha seasonal cycle in the LS varies markedly between two neighboring but distinct bioregions: the north (> 60 degrees N) and the south (< 60 degrees N). The north LS blooms earlier (similar to early-mid April) and more intensely, while the south LS blooms later (similar to May) and its duration may persist all summer long. In the southern LS bioregion, the maximum phytoplankton growth rate (i.e., the initiation of the surface spring bloom) coincides closely with the timing of the first cooling-to-heating shift in air-sea heat fluxes. In this area, the bloom timing tends to precede the shoaling of the mixed-layer depth and the vernal development of the upper ocean stratification. In the southern bioregion, the cooling-to-heating shift in air-sea heat fluxes provided a more suitable indicator for the spring bloom initiation. Meanwhile, in the northern LS bioregion, the early onset of the spring bloom is related to the seasonal evolution (i.e., shoaling) of the mixed-layer depth and precedes the cessation of wintertime cooling. Over the northern bioregion, freshwater exchanges may suppress vertical mixing while the air-sea fluxes are still negative (i.e., ocean cooling). Given the heterogeneity of the LS basin, this study emphasizes the importance to consider the bioregion-specific differences in the upper ocean physical biological interactions.","[Marchese, Christian; Belanger, Simon] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Grp BOREAS & Quebec Ocean, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [de la Guardia, Laura Castro; Myers, Paul G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, 1-26 Earth & Atmospher Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada",University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; University of Alberta,"Marchese, C (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Grp BOREAS & Quebec Ocean, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",christian.marchese74@gmail.com,,,"ArcticNet (Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada) [355774, 04357]; NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada); VITALS (Ventilation, Interactions and Transports Across the Labrador Sea) [433898]","ArcticNet (Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada); NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); VITALS (Ventilation, Interactions and Transports Across the Labrador Sea)","Ocean-color satellite data were made available by the European Space Agency's GlobColour project (http://www.globcolour.info).The Argo (Array for Real Time Geostrophic Oceanography) data were collected and made freely available by the International Argo Program and the national programs that contribute to it (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu; http://argo.jcotnmops.org).The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing System.

This study aims to compare urban and periurban tree composition along a geographic gradient, and test hypotheses about species composition and ecological homogeneity. We paired urban forest (UF) data from eight cities across the southeastern US with periurban forest (PF) data from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program. We found that tree diversity, as well as both observed and estimated species richness values were greater in UF versus PF. Community size structure analysis also indicated a greater proportion of large trees and greater numbers of non-native, invasive, and unclassified tree species in the UF versus the PF, regardless of location. Both forest type and ecological province had a significant effect on community species composition, with forests closer together in space being more similar to each other than those more distant. While land use change and management has been associated with ecological homogenization in human dominated landscapes, we found that species composition was more dissimilar along latitudinal lines than compared to between forest types, refuting this hypothesis, at least in terms of tree diversity.","[Blood, Amy; Starr, Gregory; Staudhammer, Christina] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA; [Escobedo, Francisco] Univ Rosario, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Biol Program, Bogota, Colombia; [Chappelka, Art] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Universidad del Rosario; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Staudhammer, C (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA.",ablood@crimson.ua.edu; gstarr@ua.edu; franciscoj.escobedo@urosario.edu.co; chappah@auburn.edu; cstaudhammer@ua.edu,"Escobedo, Francisco J/H-1286-2016","Escobedo, Francisco J/0000-0002-9272-5046; Staudhammer, Christina/0000-0003-1887-418X",USDA Forest Service-Urban Forestry South; US Forest Service [13-CS-11330144-061]; USFS UCF via VA Dept. of Forestry; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,USDA Forest Service-Urban Forestry South; US Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); USFS UCF via VA Dept. of Forestry; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors would like to thank Dudley Hartel at USDA Forest Service-Urban Forestry South for funding and direction.

In this study, two of the main disturbances occurring in Mediterranean forests, harvesting operations and forest fires, were analyzed through the analysis of Landsat Times Series images in a case study in Central Italy (Tuscany region). Disturbances were characterized based on their distinct temporal behaviors before and after the event: a period of 20 years (1999-2018) was used to extract and analyze at pixel level spectral trajectories for each disturbance and produce descriptive temporal trends of the phenomena. Recovery metrics were used to characterize both short- (5 years) and long-term aspects of recovery for harvested and burned areas. Spectral, recovery, and trend analysis metrics were then used with the Random Forest classifier to differentiate between the two disturbance classes and to investigate their potential as predictors. Among spectral bands, the Landsat SWIR 1 band proved the best to detect areas interested by harvesting, while forest fires were better detected by the SWIR 2 band; among spectral indices, the NBR scored as the best for both classes. On average, harvested areas recovered faster in both short- and long-term aspects and showed less variability in the magnitude of the disturbance event and recovery rate over time. This tendency is confirmed by the results of the classifier, which obtained an overall accuracy of 98.6%, and identified the mean of the post-disturbance values of the trend as the best predictor to differentiate between disturbances.","[Bonannella, Carmelo] OpenGeoHub Fdn, NL-6708 PW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bonannella, Carmelo] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bonannella, Carmelo; Chirici, Gherardo; Travaglini, Davide; Pecchi, Matteo; Vangi, Elia; D'Amico, Giovanni; Giannetti, Francesca] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry, Geolab Lab Forest Geomat, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Chirici, Gherardo; Travaglini, Davide; Giannetti, Francesca] Univ Florence, ForTech Lab Congiunto, I-50145 Florence, Italy",Wageningen University & Research; University of Florence; University of Florence,"Giannetti, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry, Geolab Lab Forest Geomat, I-50145 Florence, Italy.;Giannetti, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, ForTech Lab Congiunto, I-50145 Florence, Italy.",carmelo.bonannella@opengeohub.org; gherardo.chirici@unifi.it; davide.travaglini@unifi.it; matteo.pecchi@unifi.it; elia.vangi@unifi.it; giovanni.damico@unifi.it; francesca.giannetti@unifi.it,"D'Amico, Giovanni/HGD-3376-2022; Travaglini, Davide/F-1845-2013","Travaglini, Davide/0000-0003-0706-2653; Bonannella, Carmelo/0000-0002-5391-8427; Vangi, Elia/0000-0002-9772-2258; Giannetti, Francesca/0000-0002-4590-827X; D'Amico, Giovanni/0000-0002-2341-3268",GO-SURF [56 of Reg.1305/2013],GO-SURF,"This research was funded by GO-SURF Decision support to sustainable forest planning, Tuscany Rural development 2014-2020 for Operational Groups (in the sense of Art 56 of Reg.1305/2013).",,85,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2571-6255,,,FIRE-BASEL,Fire-Switzerland,JUN,2022,3,,,,,,68,10.3390/fire5030068,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire5030068,,,21,Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,2K7PT,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000816524000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Enhancement of the AOTC amplified atmospheric precipitation over the Eurasian interior strengthening Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Increased rainfall on the vast Russian Plain drained into the endorheic Caspian Sea, which makes the Caspian geological record highly potential for tracing atmospheric precipitation changes. Two major palaeohydrological events in the Caspian Sea, the Akchagylian transgression and the Akchagylian marine incursion, led to a five-fold enlargement of the Caspian Sea surface area and transformed the basin palaeoecology, enabling active interregional faunal dispersals. The Akchagylian Stage still lacks an unequivocal age model with two age constraints - the long Akchagylian (3.6-1.8 Ma) and the short Akchagylian (2.7-2.1 Ma) standing on magnetostratigraphic studies of geological records in Turkmenistan and the Kura Basin, respectively. The age discrepancies also exist within the Kura Basin, where the fossil mammal-bearing Kvabebi locality with Akchagylian marine fauna was magnetostratigraphically dated at 3.2 Ma. In this paper, we try to resolve the age contradictions for the Akchagylian Stage. We revisit the Kvabebi (Georgia) and Kushkuna (Azerbaijan) sections of the western Kura Basin and provide new magnetostratigraphic and 40Ar/39Ar age constraints on these marginal Akchagylian deposits. Moreover, we revise the magnetostratigraphy of 25 geological records from Turkmenistan and the Kura Basin and propose a new unified age model for the Akchagylian Stage: 1. Intrabasinal Akchagylian freshwater-mesohaline transgression at 2.95 +/- 0.02 Ma; 2. Akchagylian marine incursion through establishment of a Caspian-Arctic connection (2.75-2.45 Ma); 3. Akchagylian-Apsheronian boundary highlighting a Caspian-Black Sea connection at 2.13 Ma. The sudden expansion of the Caspian Sea at 2.95 +/- 0.02 Ma potentially correlates to the interglacial intensification of the AOTC between 2.95 and 2.82 Ma. The new ages constrain a much shorter (2.95-2.1 Ma) Akchagylian than in previously mentioned regional geological time scales (3.6-1.8 Ma) and strongly appeal to reconsider the ages of numerous archaeological and mammalian sites in the Caspian region.","[Lazarev, S.; Jorissen, E.

The models are similar to CMIP6/AerChemMIP Earth System Models (ESMs) and provide a robust multi-model ensemble. Inter-model spread of aerosol species lifetimes and emissions appears to be similar to that of mass extinction coefficients (MECs), suggesting that aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainties are associated with a broad spectrum of parameterised aerosol processes. Total AOD is approximately the same as in AeroCom phase I (AP1) simulations. However, we find a 50% decrease in the optical depth (OD) of black carbon (BC), attributable to a combination of decreased emissions and lifetimes. Relative contributions from sea salt (SS) and dust (DU) have shifted from being approximately equal in AP1 to SS contributing about 2/3 of the natural AOD in AP3. This shift is linked with a decrease in DU mass burden, a lower DU MEC, and a slight decrease in DU lifetime, suggesting coarser DU particle sizes in AP3 compared to AP1. Relative to observations, the AP3 ensemble median and most of the participating models underestimate all aerosol optical properties investigated, that is, total AOD as well as fine and coarse AOD (AOD(f), AOD(c)), Angstrom exponent (AE), dry surface scattering (SCdry), and absorption (AC(dry)) coefficients. Compared to AERONET, the models underestimate total AOD by ca. 21% +/- 20% (as inferred from the ensemble median and interquartile range). Against satellite data, the ensemble AOD biases range from -37% (MODIS-Terra) to -16% (MERGED-FMI, a multi-satellite AOD product), which we explain by differences between individual satellites and AERONET measurements themselves. Correlation coefficients (R) between model and observation AOD records are generally high (R > 0.75), suggesting that the models are capable of capturing spatiotemporal variations in AOD. We find a much larger underestimate in coarse AOD(c) (similar to-45% +/- 25 %) than in fine AOD(f) (similar to-15% +/- 25 %) with slightly increased inter-model spread compared to total AOD. These results indicate problems in the modelling of DU and SS. The AOD(c) bias is likely due to missing DU over continental land masses (particularly over the United States, SE Asia, and S. America), while marine AERONET sites and the AATSR SU satellite data suggest more moderate oceanic biases in AOD(c). Column AEs are underestimated by about 10% +/- 16 %. For situations in which measurements show AE > 2, models underestimate AERONET AE by ca. 35 %. In contrast, all models (but one) exhibit large overestimates in AE when coarse aerosol dominates (bias ca. +140% if observed AE < 0.5). Simulated AE does not span the observed AE variability. These results indicate that models overestimate particle size (or underestimate the fine-mode fraction) for fine-dominated aerosol and underestimate size (or overestimate the fine-mode fraction) for coarse-dominated aerosol. This must have implications for lifetime, water uptake, scattering enhancement, and the aerosol radiative effect, which we can not quantify at this moment. Comparison against Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) in situ data results in mean bias and inter-model variations of -35% +/- 25% and -20% +/- 18% for SCdry and AC(dry), respectively. The larger underestimate of SCdry than AC(dry) suggests the models will simulate an aerosol single scattering albedo that is too low. The larger underestimate of SCdry than ambient air AOD is consistent with recent findings that models overestimate scattering enhancement due to hygroscopic growth. The broadly consistent negative bias in AOD and surface scattering suggests an underestimate of aerosol radiative effects in current global aerosol models. Considerable inter-model diversity in the simulated optical properties is often found in regions that are, unfortunately, not or only sparsely covered by ground-based observations. This includes, for instance, the Sahara, Amazonia, central Australia, and the South Pacific. This highlights the need for a better site coverage in the observations, which would enable us to better assess the models, but also the performance of satellite products in these regions.

In the present study we used particle size SUM fractions (sand, silt and clay), derived from the Ah soil horizon from a Norway spruce forest in Southern Germany, to study the effects of different stabilization mechanisms on the bioavailability of soil organic carbon (SOC) in a one year incubation experiment. The respired CO2 was hourly recorded, additionally (CO2)-C-13 was analysed 20 times and (CO2)-C-14 three times during the incubation experiment. To better differentiate between particulate OM (POM) and mineral associated OM (MIN), the incubated fractions and bulk soil were separated according to density (1.8 g cm(-3)) after the incubation experiment. C-13-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy was used to study the chemical composition of the incubated samples. We demonstrate a clear increase in SUM bioavailability due to aggregate disruption, as the calculated theoretical CO2 evolution of the SUM fractions recombined by calculation was 43.8% higher in relation to the intact bulk soil. The incubated sand fraction, dominated by POM rich in O/N-alkyl C, showed a prolonged bioavailability of SOC moieties with mean residence times (MRT) of 78 years. Interestingly, the silt fraction, dominated by highly aliphatic, more recalcitrant POM, showed low mineralization rates and slow MRT's (192 years) close to values for the clay fraction (171 years), which contained a large amount of mineral-associated SOM. The recorded (CO2)-C-13/12 signatures showed a high depletion in C-13 during the initial stage of the incubation, but an enrichment of the respired (CO2)-C-13 of up to 3.4 parts per thousand relative to the incubated SUM was observed over longer time periods (after 3 and 4 days for bulk soil and sand, respectively, and after 14 days for silt and clay). Therefore, we found no evidence for a C-13 enrichment of SUM as driven by metabolic isotopic fractionation during microbial SUM mineralization, but an indication of a change in the isotopic composition of the C-source over time.

PISCES, as part of the European Community Earth system model (EC-Earth) model suite, runs in offline mode using prescribed dynamical fields as simulated by the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean model. Present-day atmospheric deposition fluxes of inorganic N, Fe, and P into the global ocean account for similar to 40 TgNyr(-)1, similar to 0.28 Tg Fe yr(-1), and similar to 0.10 Tg P yr(-1). Pre-industrial atmospheric nutrient deposition fluxes are lower compared to the present day (similar to 51 %, similar to 36 %, and similar to 40% for N, Fe, and P, respectively). However, the overall impact on global productivity is low (similar to 3 %) since a large part of marine productivity is driven by nutrients recycled in the upper ocean layer or other local factors. Prominent changes are, nevertheless, found for regional productivity. Reductions of up to 20% occur in oligotrophic regions such as the subtropical gyres in the Northern Hemisphere under pre-industrial conditions. In the subpolar Pacific, reduced pre-industrial Fe fluxes lead to a substantial decline of siliceous diatom production and subsequent accumulation of Si, P, and N, in the subpolar gyre. Transport of these nutrient-enriched waters leads to strongly elevated production of calcareous nanophytoplankton further south and southeast, where iron no longer limits productivity. The North Pacific is found to be the most sensitive to variations in depositional fluxes, mainly because the water exchange with nutrient-rich polar waters is hampered by land bridges. By contrast, large amounts of unutilized nutrients are advected equatorward in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, making these regions less sensitive to external nutrient inputs. Despite the lower aerosol N: P ratios with respect to the Redfield ratio during the pre-industrial period, the nitrogen fixation decreased in the subtropical gyres mainly due to diminished iron supply. Future changes in air pollutants under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario result in a modest decrease of the atmospheric nutrients inputs into the global ocean compared to the present day (similar to 13 %, similar to 14 %, and similar to 20% for N, Fe, and P, respectively), without significantly affecting the projected primary production in the model. Sensitivity simulations further show that the impact of atmospheric organic nutrients on the global oceanic productivity has turned out roughly as high as the present-day productivity increase since the preindustrial era when only the inorganic nutrients' supply is considered in the model. On the other hand, variations in atmospheric phosphorus supply have almost no effect on the calculated oceanic productivity.","[Myriokefalitakis, Stelios] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev IERSD, Penteli, Greece; [Groeger, Matthias] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde IOW, Rostock, Germany; [Hieronymus, Jenny; Doescher, Ralf] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, Norrkoping, Sweden",National Observatory of Athens; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Myriokefalitakis, S (corresponding author), Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev IERSD, Penteli, Greece.;Groger, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde IOW, Rostock, Germany.",steliosm@noa.gr; matthias.groeger@io-warnemuende.de,"Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/J-3701-2014; Gröger, Matthias/G-6758-2015","Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/0000-0002-1541-7680; Gröger, Matthias/0000-0002-9927-5164",H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (ODEON) [705652]; H2020 Environment (CRESCENDO) [641816]; National Observatory of Athens [5065]; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (ODEON); H2020 Environment (CRESCENDO); National Observatory of Athens; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,"This research has been supported by the H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (ODEON, grant no. 705652), the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020 Environment (CRESCENDO, grant no. 641816), and the National Observatory of Athens (grant no. 5065).",,96,6,6,4,15,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1812-0784,1812-0792,,OCEAN SCI,Ocean Sci.,17-Oct,2020,5,,,,1183,1205,,10.5194/os-16-1183-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-16-1183-2020,,,23,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,OH4WU,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000582577700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ship emissions have the potential to contribute to air quality degradation in coastal areas, in addition to contributing to global air pollution. With the aim to quantify the impacts of shipping emissions on urban air quality in coastal areas in Europe, an in depth literature review was carried out focussing on particulate matter and gaseous pollutants but also reviewing the main chemical tracers of shipping emissions, the particle size distribution of ship-derived particulates and their contributions to population exposure and atmospheric deposition. Mitigation strategies were also addressed. In European coastal areas, shipping emissions contribute with 1-7% of ambient air PM10 levels, 1-14% of PM2.5, and at least 11% of PM1. Contributions from shipping to ambient NO2 levels range between 7 and 24%, with the highest values being recorded in the Netherlands and Denmark. Impacts from shipping emissions on SO2 concentrations were reported for Sweden and Spain. Shipping emissions impact not only the levels and composition of particulate and gaseous pollutants, but may also enhance new particle formation processes in urban areas. (C) 2014 The Authors.

S. Navy recovered USS Monitor's icon revolving gun turret from the Atlantic Ocean, successfully capping off a multi-year recovery of over 200 tons of artifacts from the wreck site of the Civil War ironclad. Since that time, NOAA and their partners at The Mariners' Museum (TMM) have undertaken a pioneering collaborative effort to promote the historical and cultural significance of this National Historical Landmark. Education and outreach initiatives form the backbone of this collaboration, including an award-winning exhibition and conservation laboratory at The Mariners' Museum, classroom initiatives, distance learning, and events and festivals around the country, all of which have introduced hundreds of thousands of people to the Monitor's story. The goals of this multi-pronged approach are to raise public awareness; encourage public involvement in resource protection; increase knowledge about maritime history, science, and technology; and expand ocean and climate literacy. This paper will examine the methods used by the partnership to achieve these goals and provide a template for best practices in maritime science and history education through a public-private partnership. The USS Monitor Center at The Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, is the official repository for all artifacts recovered from the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary and associated archives, and it is the central hub of all outreach and education. This 63,500 square foot facility contains the award-winning Ironclad Revolution exhibit, including conserved artifacts, immersive multimedia experiences, and re-created ship interiors. The Monitor Center also houses the Batten Conservation Laboratory, a state-of-the-art marine artifact conservation facility staffed by a team of international experts. NOAA and TMM designed the lab for maximum visitor interplay by incorporating massive viewing platforms and windows into the lab, a series of live web cameras, and periodically offering behind-the-scenes tours. The regular transition of conserved artifacts from the lab into the gallery also allows for a dynamic visitor experience over time. The Monitor Center increases TMM's international profile and simultaneously promotes NOAA's objectives of public awareness of this precious national resource and increases the historical, cultural, and scientific knowledge of mankind's interaction with the ocean. NOAA continues to work with other regional organizations in an education and outreach capacity to tell the USS Monitor's story to a broader audience. These other partners, including the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum, North Carolina Aquarium, and Civil War Naval Museum, ultimately engage and encourage the public to visit The Mariners' Museum for a deeper learning and entertainment experience. NOAA is also working with its partners to promote a USS Monitor Trail. Although still in development, this interactive tool will allow people to trace Monitor's story and history from Buffalo, NY to the Hudson Valley and all the way down the East Coast to Hampton Roads where Monitor battled the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia and ultimately to the ship's final resting place within the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary off Hatteras, NC. The Monitor Trail has the potential to link people who previously had little or no understanding of the ironclad to the key locations of the country responsible for transforming the Monitor from a series of conceptual sketches into the savior of the Union Navy and future of naval technology. TMM and NOAA are using other traditional and technologically advanced methods of education and outreach. Experts in the fields of history, science, conservation, and technology offer formal and informal educational programs to groups of all ages. Museum and sanctuary visitors, school systems, lifelong learning groups, and other sanctuary constituents are primary audiences. Distance learning is utilized to target groups outside of the region. A robust interactive video conferencing (IVC) facility allows TMM and NOAA to reach national and international audiences. To date, IVC programs have reached thousands of students in 29 states and 6 countries. Using the Monitor's historical significance as the entry point, NOAA and TMM are able to introduce concepts that transcend a single vessel or moment in time. While the primary purpose for recovering over 1,500 artifacts from the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary was to make Monitor's story accessible to the widest possible audience, it was never intended to be purely a maritime historical story. By pursuing an integrated and immersive educational and outreach experience, TMM and NOAA have pioneered a comprehensive approach to promote awareness and protection not only of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary's natural and cultural resources, but also that of our nation's oceans.","[Krop, David S.; Holloway, Anna G.] Mariners Museum, USS Monitor Ctr, Newport News, VA 23606 USA; [Alberg, David W.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Monitor Natl Marine Sanctuary, Newport News, VA 23606 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Krop, DS (corresponding author), Mariners Museum, USS Monitor Ctr, Newport News, VA 23606 USA.",,"Holloway, Anna Gibson/ABD-2245-2021","Holloway, Anna Gibson/0000-0001-9304-2354",,,,,0,0,0,0,18,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4673-0829-8; 978-1-4673-0830-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Telecommunications,BDW56,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000315350300180,View Full Record in Web of Science

Surface wettability, which drives coolant capillarity, has a profound effect on the boiling process. We demonstrate pool boiling enhancement through wettability control using electrosprayed, nano textured surfaces of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4). When a BiVO4 liquid precursor is electrostatically charged and sprayed, submicron droplets are formed and their acceleration is driven by the electrostatic force established between the nozzle exit and substrate. As droplets approach the substrate, Brownian diffusion takes place and an opposing thermophoretic force impedes the dynamic motion of evaporating droplets. As a result, nano-pillars are formed, whose physical sizes change the wettability of a surface and change pool-boiling phenomenon. The surface wettabilities of nano-textured surfaces were quantified with the water contact angle. Increased spraying time resulted in greater nano-pillar structure heights. Both the critical heat flux and effective heat transfer coefficient increased with nano-pillar height. However, excessively tall pillars had an adverse effect on pool-boiling through trapping of nucleated bubbles near the heat surface, which hindered efficient heat transfer.

The factors that influence individual behavioral response thus warrants a close examination. Using survey data for respondents from 10 states merged with state level data, our study represents a pioneering effort to reveal contextual and individual social capital factors that explain public mask wearing in response to COVID?19. Findings of logistic multilevel regression show that the COVID?19 death rate and political control of government at the state level along with one?s social capital at the individual level altogether influence whether people decide to wear face masks. These findings contribute to the rapidly growing literature and have policy implications for mitigating the pandemic?s devastating impact on the American public.","[Hao, Feng] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Shao, Wanyun] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Huang, Weiwei] Ringling Coll Art & Design, Sarasota, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Hao, F (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",fenghao@usf.edu,,"Shao, Wanyun/0000-0002-1609-7383",,,,,68,27,27,4,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1353-8292,1873-2054,,HEALTH PLACE,Health Place,MAR,2021,,,,,,,102537,10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102537,,21-Feb,9,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",RB7EV,33636596,"Green Published, Bronze",,,12/21/22,WOS:000632271900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We observed significant temporal trends of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (Sigma PFCAs) in all three subpopulations. Concentrations of FOSA and PFOS had started decreasing significantly since the mid-1990s to 2000 in the Greenland and Norwegian subpopulations, consistent with the 3M phase-out, though in sharp contrast to overall increasing trends observed in the Swedish subpopulation. Moreover, Sigma PFCA concentrations significantly increased in all three subpopulations throughout the study periods. These temporal trends suggest on-going input of PFOS in the Baltic and of Sigma PFCAs in all three regions. Considerable spatial variation in PFAS concentrations and profiles was observed: PFOS concentrations were significantly higher in Sweden, whereas FOSA and Sigma PFCA concentrations were similar among the subpopulations. PFOS dominated the PFAS profiles in the Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, in contrast to the domination of FOSA and Sigma PFCAs in the Greenland one. Our spatiotemporal observations underline the usefulness of archived bird of prey feathers in monitoring spatiotemporal PFAS trends and urge for continued monitoring efforts in each of the studied subpopulations.","[Sun, Jiachen; Eens, Marcel] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol & Ecophysiol Grp, Univ Pl 1, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Bossi, Rossana] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Arctic Res Ctr, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Boertmann, David; Dietz, Rune; Sonne, Christian; Eulaers, Igor] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Bustnes, Jan Ove] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Unit Arctic Ecol, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14,POB 6606, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Helander, Bjorn] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Environm Res & Monitoring, Frescativagen 40,POB 50007, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Herzke, Dorte] Norwegian Inst Air Res, FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, NILU, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Jaspers, Veerle L.

The metrics selection process, that in practice is left to the subjective judgment of stakeholders, is often complex and should simultaneously take into account monitoring data, environmental models, socio-economic considerations, and stakeholder interests. With limited funding, it is often very difficult to balance the importance of multiple metrics, often competing, intended to measure different environmental, social, and economic aspects of the system. To help restoration planners and practitioners develop the most useful and informative design and monitoring programs, we propose the use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, broadly defined, to select optimal ecosystem restoration metric sets. In this paper, we apply and compare two MCDA methods, multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), and probabilistic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (ProMAA), for a hypothetical river restoration case study involving multiple stakeholders with competing interests. Overall, the MCDA results in a systematic, quantitative, and transparent evaluation and comparison of potential metrics that provides planners and practitioners with a clear basis for selecting the optimal set of metrics to evaluate restoration alternatives and to inform restoration design and monitoring. In our case study, the two MCDA methods provide comparable results in terms of selected metrics. However, because ProMAA can consider probability distributions for weights and utility values of metrics for each criterion, it is most likely the best option for projects with highly uncertain data and significant stakeholder involvement. Despite the increase in complexity in the metrics selection process, MCDA improves upon the current, commonly-used ad-hoc decision practice based on consultations with stakeholders by applying and presenting quantitative aggregation of data and judgment, thereby increasing the effectiveness of environmental design and monitoring and the transparency of decision making in restoration projects.

This study used a well-established test wall to investigate the impact of environmental conditions on the deterioration of earthen heritage at the remote and under-studied site of Suoyang Ancient City, Gansu Province, China, which is exhibiting widespread deterioration. Test walls have previously been used in earthen heritage research as they allow controlled experiments to be undertaken on complex, realistic structures without risking damage or loss of value to the historic material. This study used portable wind and rain erosion simulation devices to investigate experimentally (i) the comparative effect of wind, sediment-laden wind and wind-driven rain in causing deterioration to earthen heritage and (ii) how the incipient deterioration features produced by wind, sediment-laden wind and wind-driven rain on the test wall relate to the deterioration features recorded on the historic city walls. The test wall was subjected to low, medium and high intensities of clean wind, sediment-laden wind and wind-driven rain. The extent of deterioration produced was measured using repeat, high resolution laser scans before and after each test run. The deterioration features caused by each environmental force were notably different with clean wind removing the loose surface material, sediment-laden wind causing pitting and wind-driven rain causing incipient gullying. These incipient features compare well with more developed features seen on the historic walls. Wind-driven rain caused the greatest amount of deterioration while clean wind caused the least. However, as the frequency and duration of wind events at Suoyang is much greater than those of rain events, wind is likely to play an important role in the deterioration of earthen heritage over annual timescales. These findings show that conservation strategies at rammed earth sites like Suoyang need to address the impact of multiple environmental forces, such as clean wind, sediment laden wind and wind-driven rain.","[Richards, J.; Zhang, H.; Viles, H.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford Rock Breakdown Lab, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Zhao, G.] Dunhuang Acad, Dunhuang 736200, Peoples R China",University of Oxford,"Richards, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford Rock Breakdown Lab, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",jennifer.richards@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/L016036/1]; Getty Conservation Institute,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Getty Conservation Institute,"This research was funded by UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant for the Centre for Doctoral Training Science and Engineering in Art, Heritage and Archaeology (EP/L016036/1) in association with the Getty Conservation Institute.",,47,14,16,8,42,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2050-7445,,,HERIT SCI,Herit.

The Saksunarvatn Ash is believed to have been produced by eruptions of the Grimsvotn volcanic system approximate to 10.3 ka BP, which had two axes of dispersal, one plume in a north-west direction over northern Iceland and into Greenland, and a second southerly plume covering the Faroe Isles, Shetland Isles, western Norway and northern Germany. Here we present data from Potremser Moor, north-east Germany, extending the easterly margin of the ash fallout zone. We also present single grain trace element data from the type site at Saksunarvatn as well as from Potremser Moor. The Saksunarvatn Ash is indistinguishable between Potremser Moor and Saksunarvatn, suggesting the two tephras were produced by the same eruption. Trace element compositions from both sites are similar to data from the North Atlantic marine core (LINK 14:185), but different from the GRIP ice core (GRIP 1528.61m), indicating that the south-east and north-west plumes may have arisen from separate eruption events.

Relevant findings are reported on the 2008-2011 study 'Environmental Assessment of Domestic Laundering', drawing on monitored data from 22 case studies out of 100 dwellings surveyed in Glasgow. Differing consumer traits and habits, combined with variable technical performance, provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of a wide estimated annual consumption range. Actual usage and energy consumption averaged less than UK predictions; and values did not necessarily correspond with manufacturers' energy ratings. In a wider discussion, case study median and mean extrapolations of electricity consumed by laundering (105 and 174 kWh/person-year) prove significant relative to the proportion of what could be available to a dwelling achieving the German Passivhaus standard. The potential for heat recovery from 'grey' water is posited along with other options for mitigating power consumed by appliances. Renewable technology to offset consumption in shared facilities is discussed as a means of easing the performance of individual homes. The foregoing aspects are among key conclusions directed at housing occupiers, providers, national and local governments, and industry.","[Porteous, C. D. A.; Sharpe, T. R.; Menon, R.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of a full-scale down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor to recover after a 10-day outage. The DHS tested in this study uses polyurethane sponge as packing material. This full-scale DHS reactor has been tested over a period of about 4 years in India with a flow rate of 500 m(3)/day. Water was not supplied to the DHS reactor that was subjected to the 10-day outage; however, the biomass did not dry out because the sponge was able to retain enough water. Soon after the reactor was restarted, a small quantity of biomass, amounting to only 0.1% of the total retained biomass, was eluted. The DHS effluent achieved satisfactory removal of suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, and ammonium nitrogen within 90, 45, and 90 min, respectively. Conversely, fecal coliforms in the DHS effluent did not reach satisfactory levels within 540 min; instead, the normal levels of fecal coliforms were achieved within 3 days. Overall, the tests demonstrated that the DHS reactor was sufficiently robust to withstand long-term outages and achieved steady state soon after restart. This reinforces the suitability of this technology for developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP)-based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (b(bp)) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from b(bp) via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m(3)], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to> 100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in R-rs leads to< 20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads.","[Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan, V; Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc SSAI, Lanham, MD USA; [Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan, V] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan, V] Geosensing & Imaging Consultancy, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; [Binding, Caren] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Schalles, John] Creighton Univ, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Loisel, Hubert] Univ Lille, Univ Littoral Cote Opale, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, CNRS,UMR 8187,LOG, Lille, France; [Gurlin, Daniela] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Madison, WI USA; [Greb, Steven] Univ Wisconsin, Space Sci & Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Alikas, Krista; Randla, Mirjam] Univ Tartu, Tartu Observ, Tartu, Estonia; [Bunkei, Matsushita] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Moses, Wesley] Naval Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Ha Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Lehmann, Moritz K.] Xerra Earth Observat Inst, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Lehmann, Moritz K.] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [O'Donnell, David] Upstate Freshwater Inst, Syracuse, NY USA; [Ondrusek, Michael] NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, College Pk, MD USA; [Han, Tai-Hyun] Korea Ocean Satellite Ctr KIOST, Busan, South Korea; [Fichot, Cedric G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Moore, Tim] Univ New Hampshire, Ocean Proc Anal Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Boss, Emmanuel] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Systems and Applications Inc; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Creighton University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Tartu; Tartu Observatory; University of Tsukuba; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research Laboratory; Vietnam National University Hanoi; University of Waikato; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Boston University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Pahlevan, N (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",nima.pahlevan@nasa.gov,"Moses, Wesley/FVK-3856-2022; Alikas, Krista/ABE-1431-2020; Pahlevan, Nima/L-7746-2014; Alikas, Krista/F-7279-2017; Boss, Emmanuel/C-5765-2009","Alikas, Krista/0000-0003-3855-6525; Pahlevan, Nima/0000-0002-5454-5212; Alikas, Krista/0000-0003-3855-6525; Boss, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8334-9595; Moses, Wesley/0000-0003-3551-6093; Nguyen, Ha/0000-0002-5010-5615; Lehmann, Moritz/0000-0001-7346-3901; Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan/0000-0002-6952-1475; Gurlin, Daniela/0000-0002-4899-9795; Schalles, John/0000-0003-4228-1288","NASA ROSES Awards [80NSSC18K0077, 80HQTR19C0015]; USGS Landsat Science Team Award [140G0118C0011]; ONR [N000141612218]; NOAA [NA11SEC4810001]; NSF [1832178]",NASA ROSES Awards; USGS Landsat Science Team Award; ONR(Office of Naval Research); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We gratefully acknowledge the PIs, scientists and contributors to SeaBASS, including Zhongping Lee, Steve Ackleson, Richard Reynolds (ICESCAPE), Colleen Mouw, and are also very thankful to the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), David Doxaran, and Kevin Ruddick for distributing in situ datasets.

Total fluxes were derived from concentration differences of total ammonium (NH3 and NH4+) and total nitrate (HNO3 and NO3-) measured at two levels. Gaseous species and related particulate compounds were measured selectively, simultaneously and continuously above a spruce forest canopy in south-eastern Germany in summer 2007. Measurements were performed using a wet-chemical two-point gradient instrument, the GRAEGOR. Median concentrations of NH3, HNO3, NH4+, and NO3- were 0.57, 0.12, 0.76, and 0.48 mu g m(-3), respectively. Total ammonium and total nitrate fluxes showed large variations depending on meteorological conditions, with concentrations close to zero under humid and cool conditions and higher concentrations under dry conditions. Mean fluxes of total ammonium and total nitrate in September 2007 were directed towards the forest canopy and were -65.77 ng m(-2) s(-1) and -41.02 ng m(-2) s(-1) (in terms of nitrogen), respectively. Their deposition was controlled by aerodynamic resistances only, with very little influence of surface resistances. Including measurements of wet deposition and findings of former studies on occult deposition (fog water interception) at the study site, the total N deposition in September 2007 was estimated to 5.86 kg ha(-1).","[Wolff, V.; Trebs, I.; Meixner, F.

Forensic results published to date indicate that the majority of oil samples collected share a common origin, yet the exact source of the mystery oil has yet to be conclusively determined. The proposed sources include illegal discharges from vessels traversing near, within, or downstream of Brazilian waters, leaking offshore platforms, natural seeps, and historic shipwrecks. To constrain the potential sources of oil and provide additional insights into the composition of the oil, we analyzed samples collected from the Ceara state coastal zone in 2019 with a broad suite of geochemical tools and approaches. These approaches included bulk elemental analyses and state-of-the-art analytical platforms including comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC), gas chromatography with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Based on bulk and molecular features, field samples collected from northeast Brazil share the same source as other 2019 mystery oil samples collected over similar to 2400 km to the south. A shared source across the Brazilian coast points to an input location east of Brazil within the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current, allowing transport both north and south of the bifurcation. The relative abundance and composition of diagnostic markers were consistent with the published analyses of Venezuelan petroleum. The composition of the field samples is consistent with the blending of, at least, two different petroleum products, a common practice to produce an on spec product such as a fuel oil used to power an underway vessel. The two components appear to be the residuum from atmospheric distillation and a thermally altered, aromatics-rich, nondistilled material. To the best of our knowledge, no samples from potential sources are available for a direct comparison to field samples. Hence, these results play a supporting role in determining the source, and benefit efforts to understand short- and long-term weathering and recovery.","[Reddy, Christopher M.; Nelson, Robert K.; Hanke, Ulrich M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Cui, Xingqian; Summons, Roger E.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Valentine, David L.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rodgers, Ryan P.; Chacon-Patin, Martha L.] Natl High Magnet Field Lab, Ion Cyclotron Resonance Program, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Niles, Sydney F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Teixeira, Carlos E.

Glass chemistry suggests that the tephras derive from Italian, Hellenic and Turkish sources. The visible tephra layer is trachytic in composition and has been correlated to the approximate to 39 ka Campanian Ignimbrite super-eruption from Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy. Two cryptotephra layers are associated with eruptions from Acigol volcano (Turkey) around the Last Glacial Maximum, another is linked to activity at Erciyes Dagi in the Early Holocene (Perikartini or Karagullu), and a cryptotephra layer near the top of the core correlates to the approximate to 3.6k cal a BP Minoan (marine Z2) tephra from Santorini (Thera), Greece. This extends the known dispersal area for all these volcanic ash units. Many other calc-alkaline rhyolite layers preserved in the core are likely to be from central Anatolian sources but the lack of detailed proximal data for many of the volcanoes in the region prohibits further correlations. The tephrostratigraphy and glass compositional data presented here allow the tephra layers to be used to correlate sedimentary archives across the region, and help to extend the Mediterranean tephrochronology framework towards the east.","[Cullen, Victoria L.; Smith, Victoria C.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Arz, Helge W.] Leibnitz Inst Balt Sea Res, D-18119 Rostock, Germany",University of Oxford,"Cullen, VL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",victoria.cullen@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Smith, Victoria/AAA-4152-2021; Smith, Victoria C/P-6317-2016; Arz, Helge/A-6659-2013","Smith, Victoria/0000-0003-0878-5060; Smith, Victoria C/0000-0003-0878-5060; Arz, Helge Wolfgang/0000-0002-1997-1718",NERC [NE/J500045/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [1204874] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"V.L.C. is funded by an NERC studentship (NE/J500045/1).

We apply BRTs to multiple Holocene and Lateglacial pollen sequences from northern Europe, and compare their performance with two commonly-used calibration methods: weighted averaging regression (WA) and the modern-analogue technique (MAT). Using these calibration methods and fossil pollen data, we present synthetic reconstructions of Holocene summer temperature, winter temperature, and water balance changes in northern Europe. Highly consistent trends are found for summer temperature, with a distinct Holocene thermal maximum at ca 8000-4000 cal. a BP, with a mean T-jja anomaly of ca +0.7 degrees C at 6 ka compared to 0.5 ka. We were unable to reconstruct reliably winter temperature or water balance, due to the confounding effects of summer temperature and the great between-reconstruction variability. We find BRTs to be a promising tool for quantitative reconstructions from palaeoenvironmental proxy data. BRTs show good performance in cross-validations compared with WA and MAT, can model a variety of taxon response types, find relevant predictors and incorporate interactions between predictors, and show some robustness with non-analogue fossil assemblages.

Our preliminary analysis indicates that JEM-EUSO, taking advantage of its large FOV and good sensitivity, should be able to detect meteors down to absolute magnitude close to 7. This means that JEM-EUSO should be able to record a statistically significant flux of meteors, including both sporadic ones, and events produced by different meteor streams. Being unaffected by adverse weather conditions, JEM-EUSO can also be a very important facility for the detection of bright meteors and fireballs, as these events can be detected even in conditions of very high sky background. In the case of bright events, moreover, exhibiting some persistence of the meteor train, preliminary simulations show that it should be possible to exploit the motion of the ISS itself and derive at least a rough 3D reconstruction of the meteor trajectory. Moreover, the observing strategy developed to detect meteors may also be applied to the detection of nuclearites, exotic particles whose existence has been suggested by some theoretical investigations. Nuclearites are expected to move at higher velocities than meteoroids, and to exhibit a wider range of possible trajectories, including particles moving upward after crossing the Earth. Some pilot studies, including the approved Mini-EUSO mission, a precursor of JEM-EUSO, are currently operational or in preparation. We are doing simulations to assess the performance of Mini-EUSO for meteor studies, while a few meteor events have been already detected using the ground-based facility EUSO-TA.","[Abdellaoui, G.; Benadda, B.; Djenas, S.

Urban greenspace can help mitigate the UHIE, but the characteristics that determine the extent to which any given greenspace can cool an urban area are not well understood. A key characteristic is likely to be the properties of trees that are found in a greenspace. Here, we explore the sensitivity of the strength of the cooling effect to tree community structure for greenspaces in Changzhou, China. Land surface temperatures were retrieved from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS and were used to evaluate the temperature drop amplitude (TDA) and cooling range (CR) of 15 greenspaces across each of the four seasons. Tree community structure of the greenspaces was investigated using 156 sample plots across the 15 greenspaces. We found that a number of plant community structure indicators of greenspaces have a significant impact on the strength of the cooling effect. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, tree species richness and tree canopy coverage of greenspaces are all positively correlated with the magnitude of the temperature drop amplitude, with the strength of their influence varying seasonally. We also find that mean crown width is positively correlated with cooling range in summer and autumn, while greenspace tree density is negatively correlated with cooling range in winter. Our findings improve understanding of the relationship between plant community structure and the cooling effect of greenspaces.

When recession discharge is characterized by -dQ/dt=aQ(b), this is equivalent to constant dQ/dt or b=0. This result suggests that a previously reported exponential decrease with time (b=1) of modeled recession discharge from a similar sloping aquifer represented by the same equation appears to be an artifact of the numerical solution scheme and its interpretation. Because the linearly decreasing recession discharge (b=0) is not known from field studies, these findings challenge the application of a nonlinear Boussinesq framework assuming uniform conductivity and geometric similarity to infer hydraulic properties of sloping aquifers from observations of streamflow. This finding also questions the validity of the physical interpretation of the exponential decline in late time resulting from the commonly used linearized form of the Boussinesq equation, opposed to the full nonlinear equation, when applied under these conditions. For this reason, application of the linearized equation to infer hydraulic properties of sloping aquifers is also challenged, even if the observed recession is consistent with that of the linearized Boussinesq equation.","[Bogaart, Patrick W.; van derVelde, Ype] Univ Utrecht, Environm Sci Grp, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Rupp, David E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Oregon Climate Change Res Inst, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Selker, John S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Biol & Ecol Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Utrecht University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"Bogaart, PW (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Environm Sci Grp, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.w.bogaart@uu.nl,"Rupp, David/G-8171-2014; Bogaart, Patrick William/G-4795-2013","Bogaart, Patrick William/0000-0002-8612-1289; Selker, John/0000-0001-9751-6094; van der Velde, Ype/0000-0002-2183-2573",NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research) [857.00.008]; Oregon Experiment station,NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Oregon Experiment station,"This research was partly funded by NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research) project 857.00.008, and the Oregon Experiment station.

The RSM provides the dimensionless mixing efficiencies Gamma(alpha) (alpha stands for heat, salt and momentum). However, to compute the diffusivities, one needs additional information, specifically, the dissipation epsilon. Since a dynamic equation for the latter that includes the physical processes relevant to the ocean is still not available, one must resort to different sources of information outside the RSM to obtain a complete Mixing Scheme usable in OGCMs. As for the RSM results, we show that the Gamma(alpha)'s are functions of both Ri and R-rho (Richardson number and density ratio representing double diffusion, DD); the Gamma(alpha) are different for heat, salt and momentum; in the case of heat, the traditional value Gamma(h) = 0.2 is valid only in the presence of strong shear (when DD is inoperative) while when shear subsides, NATRE data show that rh can be three times as large, a result that we reproduce. The salt Gamma(s) is given in terms of Gamma(h). The momentum Gamma(m) has thus far been guessed with different prescriptions while the RSM provides a well defined expression for Gamma(m)(Ri,R-rho). Having tested Gamma(h), we then test the momentum Gamma(m) by showing that the turbulent Prandtl number Gamma(m)/Gamma(h) vs. Ri reproduces the available data quite well. As for the dissipation epsilon, we use different representations, one for the mixed layer (ML), one for the thermocline and one for the ocean's bottom. For the ML, we adopt a procedure analogous to the one successfully used in PB (planetary boundary layer) studies; for the thermocline, we employ an expression for the variable epsilon N-2 from studies of the internal gravity waves spectra which includes a latitude dependence; for the ocean bottom, we adopt the enhanced bottom diffusivity expression used by previous authors but with a state of the art internal tidal energy formulation and replace the fixed Gamma(alpha) = 0.2 with the RSM result that brings into the problem the Ri, R-rho dependence of the Gamma(alpha); the unresolved bottom drag, which has thus far been either ignored or modeled with heuristic relations, is modeled using a formalism we previously developed and tested in PBL studies. We carried out several tests without an OGCM. Prandtl and flux Richardson numbers vs. Ri. The RSM model reproduces both types of data satisfactorily. DD and Mixing efficiency Gamma(h)(Ri,R-rho).

Here, we propose gypsum ballasting as a new mechanism that likely facilitated enhanced vertical carbon export from an under- ice phytoplankton bloom dominated by the haptophyte Phaeocystis. In the spring 2015 abundant gypsum crystals embedded in Phaeocystis aggregates were collected throughout the water column and on the sea floor at a depth below 2 km. Model predictions supported by isotopic signatures indicate that 2.7 g m(-2) gypsum crystals were formed in sea ice at temperatures below - 6.5 degrees C and released into the water column during sea ice melting. Our finding indicates that sea ice derived (cryogenic) gypsum is stable enough to survive export to the deep ocean and serves as an effective ballast mineral. Our findings also suggest a potentially important and previously unknown role of Phaeocystis in deep carbon export due to cryogenic gypsum ballasting. The rapidly changing Arctic sea ice regime might favour this gypsum gravity chute with potential consequences for carbon export and food partitioning between pelagic and benthic ecosystems.","[Wollenburg, J.

The Chinese Torreya tree (Torreya grandis cv Merrillii) is a traditional nut tree cultivated in China for more than a thousand years. The income from the cultivation of this species has improved the local economy in southeastern China. To increase nuts production, large industrial plantations of Torreya are under construction, which require clear-cutting local subtropical evergreen forests. In this study, several biophysical indices from remote sensing data at a regular evergreen broadleaved forest and a nearby Torreya plantation were compared. The results indicated that the Torreya plantation had a significantly lower albedo (12.43 +/- 0.15%) and higher soil water storage within surface 2-m layer (69.0 +/- 2.24 kg/m(2)/month) than the regular forest (12.64 +/- 0.14% and 57.87 +/- 1.81 kg/m(2)/month). The annual average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was significantly higher at the regular forest landscape than at the Torreya forest landscape. Except for NDVI, the resilience of these ecological processes was high in the regular evergreen broadleaved forest than in the Torreya plantation. The development of Torreya plantations at a large scale could alter local energy and hydrological processes. Environmental impacts and multiple ecological services should be considered for the sustainable development of Torreya plantations in this region.

In terms of air quality, they are seen as localized but strong emission sources of aerosols and trace gases which in turn affect air pollution levels in the city or in downwind regions. In the state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry general circulation model EMAC, generic aerosol and gas-phase tracers with equal emission source strengths at 46 MPC locations are used to study the balance between local pollution build-up and pollution export, either vertically into the upper troposphere or horizontally in the lower troposphere. The insoluble gas-phase tracers with fixed lifetimes are transported with the atmospheric circulation, while the aerosol tracers also undergo gravitational sedimentation as well as dry and wet deposition processes. The strength of low-level tracer export depends on the location of the emission source and prevailing meteorology, in particular on atmospheric stability and the height of the boundary layer and the mixing out of this layer. In contrast, vertical transport of tracer mass depends on the tracer's solubility: the more soluble a tracer is, the less mass reaches altitudes above five kilometers. Hence, the mass of insoluble gas-phase tracer above five kilometers can be up to ten times higher than the hydrophilic aerosol mass from the same source. In the case of aerosol tracers, pollution build-up around the source is determined by meteorological factors which have only indirect effects on tracer lifetime, like surface wind, boundary layer height, and turbulent mixing, as well as those which affect the lifetime of the tracers such as precipitation. The longer a tracer stays in the atmosphere, the lower is the relative importance of the location of the source to the atmospheric mass, and thus the lower is the relative local pollution build-up. We further use aerosol deposition fields to estimate regions with high deposition, that is more than 1% or more than 5% of the corresponding tracer emission deposited in this region. In doing so, we find that the high deposition areas are larger for aerosols with diameters of 10.0 mu m, and these differ less between the MPCs than for aerosols with diameters smaller than 2.5 mu m due to faster deposition. Furthermore, cities in regions with high precipitation rates or unfavorable geographic locations, e. g., in a basin, suffer most of this high deposition. Most of the high deposition occurs over land, although about 50% of the MPCs are located along coastlines. By folding the aerosol deposition fields with geographical distributions of cropland, pasture, and forest, the impact on different land ecosystems is assessed. In general, forest is exposed most to deposition from MPCs while pastureland is least affected. Moreover, the impact on humans, measured with a threshold exceedance of pollutant surface mixing ratios, is more dependent on population densities than on the size of the area with a certain mixing ratio.","[Kunkel, D.; Lawrence, M.

In water samples, Sigma chlorinated-OPEs (Cl-OPEs) concentrations exceeded Sigma non-chlorinated-OPEs (non-Cl-OPEs) with median concentrations of 10 ng L-1 and 1.3 ng L-1, respectively. In sediment samples, Sigma Cl-OPEs and Sigma nonchlorinated-OPEs had median concentrations of 4.5 and 2.5 ng g(-1), respectively. High concentrations of OPEs in samples from the Mackenzie River plume suggest riverine discharge as an OPE source to the Canadian Arctic. The prevalence of OPEs at other sites is consistent with long-range transport. The OPE inventory of the Canadian Arctic Ocean representative of years 2013-2018 was estimated at 450-16,000 tonnes with a median Sigma 11OPE mass of 4100 tonnes with >99% of the OPE inventory estimated to be in the water column. These results highlight the importance of OPEs as water-based Arctic contaminants subject to long-range transport and local sources. The high OPE inventory in the water column of the Canadian Arctic Ocean points to the need for international regulatory mechanisms for persistent and mobile organic contaminants (PMOCs) that are not covered by the risk assessment criteria of the Stockholm Convention.","[Suehring, Roxana] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Suehring, Roxana] Ryerson Univ, Dept Chem & Biol, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Diamond, Miriam L.; Adams, Jennifer K.; Jantunen, Liisa M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada; [Bernstein, Sarah; Jantunen, Liisa M.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Air Qual Proc Res Sect, Egbert, ON L0L 1N0, Canada; [Schuster, Jasmin K.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Air Qual Proc Res Sect, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Fernie, Kim] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Burlington, ON L7S 1A1, Canada; [Elliott, Kyle] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Stern, Gary] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",Stockholm University; Toronto Metropolitan University; University of Toronto; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; McGill University; University of Manitoba,"Jantunen, LM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada.;Jantunen, LM (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Air Qual Proc Res Sect, Egbert, ON L0L 1N0, Canada.",liisa.jantunen@canada.ca,"Sühring, Roxana/AFK-6559-2022; Elliott, Kyle/S-9185-2019; Diamond, Miriam L/D-1770-2013","Sühring, Roxana/0000-0002-7285-8044; Diamond, Miriam L/0000-0001-6296-6431; Fernie, Kim/0000-0003-3073-3208; Stern, Gary/0000-0003-2160-0841",ECCC; Northern Contaminants Program (Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs),ECCC; Northern Contaminants Program (Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs),"We thank ECCC for their continuing support and funding, we also thank the Northern Contaminants Program (Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs) for funding and ArcticNet for ship time.

Here we highlight recent developments in our understanding of how high temperatures, elevated salinities and low oxygen levels affect physiological processes, responses at the organismal level, and impacts on species interaction and community assembly. As aquatic insects may be exposed to multiple stressors, we review their sensitivity to interactive effects of multiple stressors. While each of these stressors may operate via different physiological mechanisms, they all influence the overall energy budget as well as the allocation of energy to competing functions such as homeostatic maintenance, growth, development and reproduction. As such, there is potential for interaction whereby one stressor may exacerbate the effect of another stressor. Integrating research on these stressors can provide a powerful approach for delineating the sensitivity of aquatic insects to multiple stressors and developing sound management practices.","[Verberk, Wilco C.

It shapes and reshapes adaptive response and human ideology over the short and long term. In 2011, the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC), Arizona, U.S.A. sponsored a study of dust entrainment within the jurisdiction of its airshed. The study's primary objectives were to determine the relationship between sediment sources and sinks in premodern contexts and how indigenous people have coped with eolian activity since intensive settlement of the Middle Gila River Valley began. Ethnographic and archaeological sources indicate that people respect winds and observe cultural procedures consistent with their origin and to reduce their ill effects. Geomorphic data also show stratigraphic correspondence between relic wash channels and adjacent terrace and sand sheet deposits demonstrating a long history of eolian activity derived from fluvial sources. Climatological data from PM10 exceedance events corroborate anthropological analyses indicating that extreme dust events are typically westerlies and occur during exceptionally dry periods. Eolian dust is part of the ambient ecosystem of the GRIC and should be viewed as such within the modern cultural and regulatory environment governing these emissions.","[Wright, David K.] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, Seoul 151745, South Korea; [Darling, J.

Most of the water samples were found to be alkaline. Based on their TDS values, 53 groundwater samples were considered 'fresh' and 'desirable for drinking'. The investigated groundwater samples were found to be heavily contaminated with As, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb, as their average values of 84.3, 106.7, 101.4, 84.1 and 131.9 ppb, respectively, far exceeded the guideline values recommended by World Health Organization and United States Environment Protection Agency. Doses due to ingestion via drinking water pathway and dermal absorption were computed for two different age groups of child and adult. The non-carcinogenic risk expressed in terms of target hazard quotient was found to be greater than unity for As, Co, Cr and Pb. The average carcinogenic risk of As and Cr calculated as 1.56 x 10(-3) and 2.38 x 10(-2), respectively, crossed the acceptable range of 10(-6)-10(-4).

Air pollution measurements conducted by the Ministry of Health in Koprbasi region in between 1985 and 1990 showed that the short term SO2 limits (STL=400 mu g/m(3)) set by the Air Pollution Control Regulation were reached on 11 days in December 1986, 22 days in January 1987, 5 days in February 1988, 3 days in December 1989, 19 days in January 1990 and 11 days in February 1990. According to Eskisehir Environmental Outlook Report during winter seasons of 1992-1993, 1993-1994 and 1994-1995, short term limits for SO2 levels were reached in December, January and February while after 1995-1996 these levels were recorded to be lower than the Long Term Limit (LTL) of 150 mu g/m(3). The reason that the air pollution levels decreased after 1996 can directly be attributed to the beginning of natural gas use in industry (full implementation) and household (in most regions). In the last 20 years Anatolian University Department of Environmental Engineering has conducted detailed scientific investigations and prepared Clean Air Plan for Eskisehir in 2010. This report which investigates particular matter and SO2 in addition to polluters such as NO2, O-3 and PAH and pollution resulting from transportation, states that the outlook for Eskisehir while not presenting any threats according to the national limits, in general is beyond limits set by the European Union and World Health Organization. Use of natural gas in Eskisehir started in 1990 in Eskisehir Organized Industrial Region (EOSB) with Botas and the service was transferred to Eskisehir Natural Gas Distribution Inc. (ESGAZ) after the the privatization in 2004. ESGAZ provides natural gas services to all kinds of streets open to built up, and increased the number of customers from 107.000 in 2004 to 300.000 in 2011. Except the EOSB region, the consumption increased from 211.756.888 m(3) in 2005 to 348.974.147 m(3) in 2011. Against all these positive developments, use of imported and local coals in the areas with natural gas infrastructure still causes air pollution. At the first stage, in the city center and especially in the winter season, it is suggested that natural gas is to be utilized instead of coal and measures needs to be taken to avoid air pollution caused by transportation.",,,,nazmioru@yahoo.com; engin.ataman@esgaz.com; halenur.kirkgoz@esgaz.com.tr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,KARABUK UNIV,KARABUK,"MAIN CAMPUS, BALIKLARKAYASI, KARABUK, 00000, TURKEY",2147-0626,,,TARIH KULT SANAT ARA,Tarih Kult.

This study reports about prehistoric fire incidents and their impact on the flora and vegetation near the village of Ardez in the Lower Engadine Valley (Switzerland) since the Late Neolithic Period. Pollen, charcoal particles and non-pollen palynomorphs preserved in the Saglias and Cutura peat bog stratigraphies were quantified and the results compared with the regional archaeological evidence. Anthropogenic deforestation using fire started around 4850 cal. BP at Saglias and aimed at establishing first cultivated crop fields (e.g. cereals) and small pastoral areas as implied by the positive correlation coefficients between charcoal particles and cultural and pastoral pollen indicators, as well as spores of coprophilous fungi. Pressure on the natural environment by humans and livestock continued until 3650 cal. BP and was followed by reforestation processes until 3400 cal. BP because of climatic deterioration. Thereafter, a new, continuous cultivation/pastoral phase was recorded for the Middle to Late Bronze Age (3400-2800 cal. BP). After rather minor human impact during the Iron Age and Roman Period, intensive agriculture was recorded for the Medieval Period. The area around Ardez was used for crop cultivation from about 1000 cal. BP until the start of the Little Ice Age' (600 cal. BP). Despite a land-use reorganisation, the following gradual decrease in agricultural activities led to the extant mixture of a cultivated, grazed and forested landscape in the Lower Engadine. In addition, this study demonstrates the excellent value of the fungus Gelasinospora as a highly local marker of past and today's fire incidents, as well as of the use of micro-charcoals from pollen slides and macro-charcoals (>150 mu m) from pollen sample residues for the reconstruction of short- and long-term fire histories.","[Dietre, Benjamin; Kofler, Werner; Haas, Jean Nicolas] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Bot, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Walser, Christoph; Reitmaier, Thomas] Archaeol Serv Canton Grisons, Chur, Switzerland; [Walser, Christoph; Kothieringer, Katja; Lambers, Karsten] Univ Bamberg, Inst Archaeol Heritage Sci & Art Hist, Bamberg, Germany; [Hajdas, Irka] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Ion Beam Phys, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lambers, Karsten] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Innsbruck; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Dietre, B (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Bot, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",benjamin.dietre@uibk.ac.at,"Haas, Jean Nicolas/I-8835-2018; Hajdas, Irka/C-6696-2011","Hajdas, Irka/0000-0003-2373-2725; Lambers, Karsten/0000-0001-6432-0925; Dietre, Benjamin/0000-0002-9959-3613",Dr. Herzog-Sellenberg-Foundation; Dr. Erich Ritter-Foundation (Germany) [T021/20506/2010],Dr. Herzog-Sellenberg-Foundation; Dr. Erich Ritter-Foundation (Germany),This work is part of the international interdisciplinary project 10.000 years of climate and settlement dynamics in the Silvretta Massif between Paznaun (Austria) and Lower Engadine (Switzerland) within the research initiative Climate Change in the Alps - Junior Research Groups supported by the Dr. Herzog-Sellenberg-Foundation and the Dr. Erich Ritter-Foundation (Germany) from 2010 to 2014 (grant number T021/20506/2010).,,120,25,25,4,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,FEB,2017,2,,,,181,196,,10.1177/0959683616658523,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616658523,,,16,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,EL9QO,,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000394955300001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Rull, V",,,,"Rull, Valenti",,,Natural and anthropogenic drivers of cultural change on Easter Island: Review and new insights,QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Deforestation; Collapse; Cultural shift; Paleoclimate; Paleoenvironment; Ecocide; Genocide; Rapa Nui,RAPA-NUI; RANO AROI; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; LAND-USE; PACIFIC; RECORDS; SEDIMENTARY; HISTORY; COLONIZATION; RETHINKING,"Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is a remote Pacific island known for its megalithic statues, the moai, built by an ancient culture which disappearance is still debated. Theories claiming for either self-destruction (ecocide) of this ancient culture or an eventual genocide after the European contact have been the most popular. Anthropogenic drivers have been traditionally preferred as causes of this major cultural shift, whereas climatic changes have been dismissed or underrated. However, the latest findings suggest that the topic is more complex than formerly thought and demand a more holistic perspective. This paper reviews the main paleoclimatic, paleoecological, archaeological and historical evidence of the major Rapanui cultural shift leading to the end of the moai-building civilization and uses an integrated approach to analyze its timing and potential causes. The disappearance of the ancient Eastern Island culture that erected the moai was a dramatic cultural shift with significant changes in lifestyle, sociopolitical organization, religious performance, art and also in the geographical settlement of the cultural core of the Rapanui society. The ancient society, represented by the so called Ancient Cult (or moai cult) was centered on the Rano Raraku crater, to the east of the island, whose soft volcanic rocks (tuff) where suitable for moai carving. This society was replaced by the Birdman-Cult society, based on Rano Kao, to the westernmost end of the island. The assumed date for such shift is uncertain ranging between mid-16th and late-18th centuries. It is suggested that such geographical change, as well as the associated societal transformations, may have been the result of a combination of climatic, ecological and cultural drivers and events. The latest paleoecological reconstructions show that the Rano Raraku catchment was deforested by AD 1450 and the lake inside dried out by AD 1550 owing to an intense climatic drought. This would have caused a landscape deterioration transforming the Raraku catchment into a wasteland devoid of freshwater and unsuitable for human life and the cultural flourishment that characterized the Ancient-Cult society. The drought lasted for about a century and a half and would have forced the Rapanuis to look for alternative freshwater sources. The only feasible option was the freshwater lake inside the then forested Rano Kao crater, where the ceremonial village of Orongo, the center of the Birdman Cult, was funded by AD 1600. The Kao crater is made of hard volcanic rocks (basalts) unsuitable for moai carving by the Neolithic Rapanui culture, unaware of metals, which would have contributed to the end of the moai-building phase. Deforestation and drought would have led to a general demographic decline. The shift from the rigid socio-political organization of the Ancient Cult to the more flexible system characteristic of the Birdman Cult could be viewed as a cultural adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The occurrence of a further, rather catastrophic, genocide caused by slave trading and epidemic diseases, occurred shortly after the European contact (AD 1722), has been documented historically. Therefore, the Rapanui civilization has undergone at least two cultural crises caused by natural and anthropogenic drivers. A complex synergistic scenario like that proposed here can conciliate multidisciplinary lines of evidence formerly used to defend more simplistic and apparently contradictory hypotheses of cultural change.

This increase in interest is directed towards the need for a better understanding of the conditions for effective and legitimate governance in a complex, interconnected, and volatile world fraught with a new class of poorly understood systematic risk. We are progressively observing resilience as a component of sustainability as the dominant organising frame in the field of urban planning. The application of the adapted Wilkinson (2011) framework, which we situate within a broader framework for evaluating metropolitan plans (Nguyen, Davidson & Gleeson, 2018), reveals the extent to which newly released metropolitan plans are incorporating strategies for social-ecological resilience. Our point is to offer an early assessment of the framing of social-ecological resilience within the embedded understanding of metropolitan planning practice. Our research has revealed that social-ecological resilience thinking has been incorporated only to a limited extent into metropolitan planning strategies worldwide, as demonstrated through the evaluation of our two sites-OneNYC and Plan Melbourne. We have argued that OneNYC incorporates the strategies of social-ecological resilience to a greater extent than Plan Melbourne, possibly pointing to a strengthening governing system by incorporating processes of social learning and adaptation. We conclude by acknowledging the critical insights into the limitations of the reality of implementing these ideas of social-ecological resilience within policy settings (see Duit, 2016), and which requires urgent consideration within a fuller institutional study that must in any case await the fuller roll-out of social-ecological resilience in sustainability agendas within city strategic planning.","[Davidson, Kathryn] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Design, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thi Minh Phuong Nguyen] Univ South Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, Discipline Urban & Reg Planning, Level 3,Kaurna Bldg,City West Campus, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Beilin, Ruth] Univ Melbourne, Level 1,Room G55,Baldwin Spencer Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Briggs, Jessie] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Design, Connected Cities Lab, Level 3,MSD Bldg 133,Mason Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of South Australia; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Nguyen, TMP (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, Discipline Urban & Reg Planning, Level 3,Kaurna Bldg,City West Campus, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",davidson.k@unimelb.edu.au; thi_minh_phuong.nguyen@mymail.unisa.edu.au; rbeilin@unimelb.edu.au; jessie.briggs@unimelb.edu.au,,"Nguyen, Thi Minh Phuong/0000-0003-3590-8695",,,,,79,18,18,3,66,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,SEP,2019,,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.cities.2019.03.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.03.012,,,9,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,IT5AF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000482870900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we propose a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based fully self-powered instantaneous and real-time wireless sensor system which does not contain electronic devices and microchips, but the passive components only. An innovative cylindrical capacitive-type liquid level sensor is also proposed and is then integrated into the wireless sensor system for monitoring liquid levels or identifying substance of the liquids. This sensor system can convert pulsed voltage output of the TENG into sinusoidal signal with a resonant frequency containing the sensing information and is transmitted to the receiver in distance in real-time. The maximum transmission distance of the sensor system could reach 1.5 m for a 10 cm diameter magnetic-core coil pair. The wireless sensor system exhibited excellent stability and excellent linearity with a sensitivity of 4.63 kHz/cm, and demonstrated its great application potential for the self-powered liquid level monitoring.","[Xu, Liangquan; Tang, Yuzhi; Liu, Fuhai; Chen, Jinkai; Xuan, Weipeng] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Elect & Informat, Minist Educ, Key Lab RF Circuits & Syst, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi; Jin, Hao; Ye, Zhi; Cao, Zhen; Li, Yubo; Wang, Xiaozi; Dong, Shurong; Luo, Jikui] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi; Jin, Hao; Ye, Zhi; Cao, Zhen; Li, Yubo; Wang, Xiaozi; Dong, Shurong; Luo, Jikui] Zhejiang Univ, Int Joint Innovat Ctr, Haining 314400, Peoples R China; [Liu, Fuhai] Hangzhou Vocat & Tech Coll, Special Equipment Coll, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Dianzi University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Hangzhou Vocational & Technical College,"Xuan, WP (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Elect & Informat, Minist Educ, Key Lab RF Circuits & Syst, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.;Luo, JK (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.;Luo, JK (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Int Joint Innovat Ctr, Haining 314400, Peoples R China.",xuanweipeng@hdu.edu.cn; jackluo@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2002500]; Zhejiang Province Key R D programs [2021C05004, 2020C03039]; NSFC [61974037, 61904042, 61801158]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [LY21F040006]; Zhejiang University Education Foundation Global Partnership",National Key R&D Program of China; Zhejiang Province Key R D programs; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Zhejiang University Education Foundation Global Partnership,"This work was funded by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFB2002500), Zhejiang Province Key R & D programs (Nos. 2021C05004 and 2020C03039), NSFC (Nos. 61974037, 61904042, and 61801158), Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang (No. LY21F040006), and Zhejiang University Education Foundation Global Partnership.",,50,0,0,36,61,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1998-0124,1998-0000,,NANO RES,Nano Res.,JUN,2022,6,,,,5425,5434,,10.1007/s12274-022-4125-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12274-022-4125-9,,22-Mar,10,"Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,1X5JO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000769316800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, its oxidised form is involved in removing itself and several other trace elements from ocean waters. Here we report the longest thus far (17 500 km length) full-depth ocean section of dissolved Mn in the west Atlantic Ocean, comprising 1320 data values of high accuracy. This is the G Lambda 02 transect that is part of the GEO-TRACES programme, which aims to understand trace element distributions. The goal of this study is to combine these new observations with new, state-of-the-art, modelling to give a first assessment of the main sources and redistribution of Mn throughout the ocean. To this end, we simulate the distribution of dissolved Mn using a global-scale circulation model. This first model includes simple parameterisations to account for the sources, processes and sinks of Mn in the ocean. Oxidation and (photo) reduction, aggregation and settling, as well as biological uptake and remineralisation by plankton are included in the model. Our model provides, together with the observations, the following insights: The high surface concentrations of manganese are caused by the combination of photoreduction and sources contributing to the upper ocean. The most important sources are sediments, dust, and, more locally, rivers. Observations and model simulations suggest that surface Mn in the Atlantic Ocean moves downwards into the southward-flowing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), but because of strong removal rates there is no elevated concentration of Mn visible any more in the NADW south of 40 degrees N. The model predicts lower dissolved Mn in surface waters of the Pacific Ocean than the observed concentrations. The intense oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in subsurface waters is deemed to be a major source of dissolved Mn also mixing upwards into surface waters, but the OMZ is not well represented by the model. Improved high-resolution simulation of the OMZ may solve this problem. There is a mainly homogeneous background concentration of dissolved Mn of about 0.10-0.15nM throughout most of the deep ocean. The model reproduces this by means of a threshold on particulate manganese oxides of 25 pM, suggesting that a minimal concentration of particulate Mn is needed before aggregation and removal become efficient. The observed distinct hydrothermal signals are produced by assuming both a strong source and a strong removal of Mn near hydrothermal vents.","[van Hulten, Marco; Dutay, Jean-Claude; Roy-Barman, Matthieu; Gehlen, Marion] CEA Orme Merisiers, IPSL, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Middag, Rob] Univ Otago, Res Ctr Oceanog, NIWA, Dept Chem, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Middag, Rob] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Middag, Rob] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Middag, Rob; de Baar, Hein] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Ocean Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Middag, Rob; de Baar, Hein] Univ Utrecht, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [de Baar, Hein] Univ Groningen RUG, Postbus 72, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [van Hulten, Marco; Sterl, Andreas] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731 GA De Bilt, Netherlands; [Tagliabue, Alessandro] Univ Liverpool, 4 Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Otago; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ); Utrecht University; University of Groningen; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Liverpool,"van Hulten, M (corresponding author), CEA Orme Merisiers, IPSL, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;van Hulten, M (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731 GA De Bilt, Netherlands.",mvhulten@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Sterl, Andreas/AAE-7174-2020; Middag, Rob/D-6423-2013","Sterl, Andreas/0000-0003-3457-0434; Middag, Rob/0000-0002-3326-530X; van Hulten, Marco/0000-0002-3045-4949; Gehlen, Marion/0000-0002-9688-0692","NWO; GEOTRACES, Global Change and Microbial Oceanography in the West Atlantic Ocean [839.08.410]; GEOTRACES Netherlands-USA Joint Effort on Trace Metals in the Atlantic Ocean [820.01.014]; Swedish Research Council [349-2012-6287]; NSF [OCE-0223378, OCE-0550317, OCE-0649639]","NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); GEOTRACES, Global Change and Microbial Oceanography in the West Atlantic Ocean; GEOTRACES Netherlands-USA Joint Effort on Trace Metals in the Atlantic Ocean; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We would like to thank several people in particular who helped in different ways in this study.

The Stone-Geary functional form allows price elasticity of demand to vary with quantity consumed, price, and income and enables estimation of a threshold level of consumption below which demand is considered perfectly price inelastic. An encompassing test of consumer price response reveals evidence favoring a lagged average price specification rather than one using lagged marginal price. The estimated model also finds substantial seasonal variation in price elasticity and declining consumer price responsiveness.","[Clarke, Andrew J.] BASIS Educ Ventures, Scottsdale, AZ 85261 USA; [Colby, Bonnie G.; Thompson, Gary D.] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Arizona,"Clarke, AJ (corresponding author), BASIS Educ Ventures, Scottsdale, AZ 85261 USA.",,,,Bureau of Reclamation's Enhancing Water Supply Reliability Program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via the Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) at the University of Arizona,Bureau of Reclamation's Enhancing Water Supply Reliability Program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via the Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) at the University of Arizona,"The authors appreciate research funding from the Bureau of Reclamation's Enhancing Water Supply Reliability Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via the Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) at the University of Arizona.

Points, produced by striking specifically shaped core surfaces (debitage) and/or by retouching flakes, are iconic artefacts of the Middle Palaeolithic. The study of point variation brings together many themes, including debates on function, on the technology of lithic reduction, standardisation and even on putatively 'symbolic' aspects. This paper considers in detail the character of point morphology and production at the similar to 60-50 ka site of Tor Faraj, Jordan. It does so both to consider point technology at this well preserved and excavated southwest Asian site, which has been suggested to represent one of the most southern limits of Neanderthal dispersal, but also as a case study with which to consider wider themes of point variability in time and space. Much recent discussion has focussed on dichotomising precocious points made by 'modern' humans, perhaps leading to their global dispersal, in contrast to purportedly inferior analogues made by 'archaic' hominins. This dichotomy is frequently seen in terms of a distinction between projectile and thrusting technology, on the assumption that the normative function of points was as weapon tips, and that there is a clear link between size and function. Many Late Middle Palaeolithic assemblages in the Levant, which are exclusively associated with Neanderthal fossils, reflect an emphasis on the production of points by debitage methods. Here, the standardised nature of point production at Tor Faraj is described. Further insights into point technology require the development of technological and quantitative, rather than typological, analyses and the transcendence of simplistic interpretative dichotomies.

Current technological solutions allow for the use of dual water supply systems in both private and public buildings. The latter, due to the potential to better manage an alternative water source in a sustainable manner, are recommended for larger scale use. In this article, the function of a dual water supply system operating in a sports facility, including the collection and use of rainwater for non-potable purposes, was evaluated on the basis of technical, quantitative and financial data. The analyses were performed to determine the facility?s water savings efficiency and cost reduction during period of 3 years. The results of the research prove that it is possible to manage rainwater for the benefit of the environment and achieve financial gain as a result of savings on charges for water from the municipal water supply and sewage disposal. While the findings of this study should encourage the use of rainwater in sports facilities, they also point to the need for properly designed of water storage tanks to maximise system efficiency.","[Burszta-Adamiak, Ewa] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Engn, Pl Grunwaldzki 24, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland; [Spychalski, Pawel] Grad Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Burszta-Adamiak, E (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Engn, Pl Grunwaldzki 24, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland.",ewa.burszta-adamiak@upwr.edu.pl,,"Burszta-Adamiak, Ewa/0000-0003-3755-2047",Leading Research Groups support project [N040/0001/20],Leading Research Groups support project,"The publication stage was financed by the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019 (Project no.

However, the particular characteristics of the molecule always made it a chemical with low, if any, benefit once compared to conventional fossil fuels. Still, the current need to decarbonize our economy makes the search of new methods crucial to use chemicals, such as ammonia, that can be produced and employed without incurring in the emission of carbon oxides. Therefore, current efforts in this field are leading scientists, industries, and governments to seriously invest efforts in the development of holistic solutions capable of making ammonia a viable fuel for the transition toward a clean future. On that basis, this review has approached the subject gathering inputs from scientists actively working on the topic. The review starts from the importance of ammonia as an energy vector, moving through all of the steps in the production, distribution, utilization, safety, legal considerations, and economic aspects of the use of such a molecule to support the future energy mix. Fundamentals of combustion and practical cases for the recovery of energy of ammonia are also addressed, thus providing a complete view of what potentially could become a vector of crucial importance to the mitigation of carbon emissions. Different from other works, this review seeks to provide a holistic perspective of ammonia as a chemical that presents benefits and constraints for storing energy from sustainable sources. State-of-the-art knowledge provided by academics actively engaged with the topic at various fronts also enables a clear vision of the progress in each of the branches of ammonia as an energy carrier. Further, the fundamental boundaries of the use of the molecule are expanded to real technical issues for all potential technologies capable of using it for energy purposes, legal barriers that will be faced to achieve its deployment, safety and environmental considerations that impose a critical aspect for acceptance and wellbeing, and economic implications for the use of ammonia across all aspects approached for the production and implementation of this chemical as a fueling source. Herein, this work sets the principles, research, practicalities, and future views of a transition toward a future where ammonia will be a major energy player.","[Amer-Hatem, F.] Minist Educ, Gen Directorate Educ Diyala, Diyala 32001, Iraq; [Azad, A.

However, questions regarding the timing and mechanisms of this dispersal remain, and the previously accepted model (termed 'Clovis-first')-suggesting that the first inhabitants of the Americas were linked with the Clovis tradition, a complex marked by distinctive fluted lithic points(1)-has been effectively refuted. Here we analyse chronometric data from 42 North American and Beringian archaeological sites using a Bayesian age modelling approach, and use the resulting chronological framework to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of human dispersal. We then integrate these patterns with the available genetic and climatic evidence. The data obtained show that humans were probably present before, during and immediately after the Last Glacial Maximum (about 26.5-19 thousand years ago)(2,3)but that more widespread occupation began during a period of abrupt warming, Greenland Interstadial 1 (about 14.7-12.9 thousand years beforead 2000)(4). We also identify the near-synchronous commencement of Beringian, Clovis and Western Stemmed cultural traditions, and an overlap of each with the last dates for the appearance of 18 now-extinct faunal genera. Our analysis suggests that the widespread expansion of humans through North America was a key factor in the extinction of large terrestrial mammals. A Bayesian age model suggests that human dispersal to the Americas probably began before the Last Glacial Maximum, overlapping with the last dates of appearance for several faunal genera.","[Becerra-Valdivia, Lorena; Higham, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Becerra-Valdivia, Lorena] Univ New South Wales, Chronos Cycle Facil 14C, SSEAU, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Oxford; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Becerra-Valdivia, L (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England.;Becerra-Valdivia, L (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Chronos Cycle Facil 14C, SSEAU, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",l.becerravaldivia@unsw.edu.au,,"Becerra-Valdivia, Lorena/0000-0001-5501-5347","Clarendon Fund Scholarship, University of Oxford","Clarendon Fund Scholarship, University of Oxford","Without implying their agreement with the content of this article, we thank E.

Throughout a year, they can cover up to 11% of the Earth surface, concentrated toward the poles. These forms impact the local surface energy balance and the distribution of precipitation. Only a few studies have concentrated on their genesis. Their size ranges from 2cm (ripple marks) to 2.5m tall (whaleback dunes). We counted a total of seven forms that are widely recognized. Among them sastrugi, an erosional shape, is the most widespread. From laser scans, we compared scaling of snow versus sand barchan morphology. We found that both have proportionally the same footprint, but snow barchans are flatter. The key difference is that snow can sinter, immobilizing the bedform and creating an erodible material. Using a model, we investigated the effect of sintering on snow dune dynamics. We found that sintering limits their size because it progressively hardens the snow and requires an ever-increasing wind speed to maintain snow transport. From the literature and results from this model, we have reclassified snow bedforms based on two parameters: wind speed and snow surface conditions. The new data show that snow dune behavior mirrors that of sand dunes, with merging, calving, and collision. However, isolated snow barchans are rare, with most of the snow surfaces encountered in the field consisting of several superimposed bedforms formed sequentially during multiple weather events. Spatially variable snow properties and geometry can explain qualitatively these widespread compound snow surfaces.","[Filhol, Simon] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Sturm, Matthew] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Geophys, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Filhol, S (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",svfilhol@alaska.edu,"Sturm, Matthew/GXF-6926-2022",,National Science Foundation [1023052]; Alaska Climate Science Center from the United States Geological Survey [G10AC00588]; University of Alaska Fairbanks International Arctic Research Center; Directorate For Geosciences [1023562] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Alaska Climate Science Center from the United States Geological Survey; University of Alaska Fairbanks International Arctic Research Center; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Data used in this publication are available online from the International Arctic Research Center data archive at the following URL: http://climate.iarc.uaf.edu:8080/geonetwork?uuid=95e94b32-50b6-4274-8322-145488bfe477.

However, the removal processes involved in NO2 deposition to terrestrial ecosystems are still the subject of ongoing discussion. This study reports NO2 flux measurements made over a meadow using the eddy covariance method. The measured NO2 deposition fluxes during daytime were about a factor of two lower than a priori calculated fluxes using the Surfatm model without taking into account an internal (also called mesophyllic or sub-stomatal) resistance. Neither an underestimation of the measured NO2 deposition flux due to chemical divergence or an in-canopy NO2 source nor an underestimation of the resistances used to model the NO2 deposition explained the large difference between measured and modelled NO2 fluxes. Thus, only the existence of the internal resistance could account for this large discrepancy between model and measurements. The median internal resistance was estimated to be 300 s m(-1) during daytime, but exhibited a large variability (100-800 s m(-1)). In comparison, the stomatal resistance was only around 100 s m(-1) during daytime. Hence, the internal resistance accounted for 50-90% of the total leaf resistance to NO2. This study presents the first clear evidence and quantification of the internal resistance using the eddy covariance method; i.e. plant functioning was not affected by changes of microclimatological (turbulent) conditions that typically occur when using enclosure methods.","[Stella, P.; Kortner, M.; Meixner, F.

Predation effects could be mitigated by stocking Walleye fingerlings based on smelt and Walleye morphometric relationships. By combining 0.95 quantile regression of smelt gape size on TL and 0.05 quantile regression of Walleye body depth on TL, we constructed a stocking tool to determine the appropriate size to stock Walleye fingerlings in lakes invaded by smelt such that few Walleyes are vulnerable to predation by smelt. In lakes where the largest smelt TL is known, Walleye fingerlings can be stocked according to the model: TLWYE = 0.819(TLRWS) -23.838. In cases where the smelt population size structure is unknown, Walleyes should be stocked at sizes larger than 142 mm, which would be a sufficient size for Walleye fingerlings to avoid predation by Rainbow Smelt in all lakes in this study.","[Lawson, Zach J.; Carpenter, Stephen R.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Lawson, ZJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, 680 North Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",zlawson@wisc.edu,"Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020",,A.W.

The operational ozone profile retrieval algorithm was developed at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the OMI mission data has been processed and made publicly available. Advantages of these nadir sounded ozone profiles are the excellent spatial resolution at nadir and daily global coverage while the vertical resolution is limited to 6-7 km. Comparisons with well-validated ozone profile recordings by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), both aboard the NASA EOS-Aura platform, provide an excellent opportunity for validation because of the large amount of collocations with OMI due to the instruments significant geographical overlap. In addition, comparisons with collocated ozone profiles from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE-II), the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), the Global Ozone Monitoring by the Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) and the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager System (OSIRIS) satellite instruments and balloon-borne electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes are presented. OMI stratospheric ozone profiles are found to agree within 20% with global correlative data except for both the polar regions during local spring. For ozone in the troposphere OMI shows a systematic positive bias versus the correlative data sets of order 60% in the tropics and 30% at midlatitude regions. The largest source of error in the tropospheric ozone profile is the fit to spectral stray light in the operational algorithm.","[Kroon, M.; de Haan, J. F.; Veefkind, J.

In many disciplines, data and model scenarios are becoming multifaceted: data are often spatiotemporal and multivariate; they stem from different data sources (multimodal data), from multiple simulation runs (multirun/ensemble data), or from multiphysics simulations of interacting phenomena (multimodel data resulting from coupled simulation models). Also, data can be of different dimensionality or structured on various types of grids that need to be related or fused in the visualization. This heterogeneity of data characteristics presents new opportunities as well as technical challenges for visualization research. Visualization and interaction techniques are thus often combined with computational analysis. In this survey, we study existing methods for visualization and interactive visual analysis of multifaceted scientific data. Based on a thorough literature review, a categorization of approaches is proposed. We cover a wide range of fields and discuss to which degree the different challenges are matched with existing solutions for visualization and visual analysis. This leads to conclusions with respect to promising research directions, for instance, to pursue new solutions for multirun and multimodel data as well as techniques that support a multitude of facets.","[Kehrer, Johannes; Hauser, Helwig] Univ Bergen, Dept Informat, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Kehrer, Johannes] VRVis Res Ctr, A-1220 Vienna, Austria",University of Bergen,"Kehrer, J (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Informat, Thormohlensgate 55,POB 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",kehrer@VRVis.at; Helwig.Hauser@UiB.no,,,Austrian Funding Agency (FFG),Austrian Funding Agency (FFG),"The authors thank Heidrun Schumann (University of Rostock) and Min Chen (University of Oxford) for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper [178].

However, effective implementation requires a systemic change across supply chains, involving both technological and nontechnological innovations. Frameworks are beginning to emerge to foster CE thinking in organizations. However, literature review carried out as part of this research has revealed gaps in their ability to fulfil CE requirements. Furthermore, few frameworks provide support on how CE requirements may be implemented. To address these issues, this article presents a new framework, BECE (backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy), to ensure that businesses can implement CE requirements more readily. BECE empowers organizations to tackle the CE holistically by embedding the concept into corporate decision making and by bringing operational and systems thinking together, thus increasing the likelihood of successful implementation. The potential of the BECE framework was tested through a pilot workshop focusing on the development of a CE business model through redesign of products and supply chains. Using vacuum cleaners as an illustrative case study, several product design and supply-chain alternatives were identified, including the development of scenarios and action plans for their implementation at the business level. Although the case study focuses on a particular product, the BECE framework is generic and applicable across different products and business sectors.","[Mendoza, Joan Manuel F.; Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro; Azapagic, Adisa] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Ind Syst SIS Grp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sharmina, Maria; Heyes, Graeme] Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Mendoza, JMF (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sustainable Ind Syst, Sch Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",joan.mendoza@manchester.ac.uk,"Mendoza, Joan Manuel F./F-5979-2018; Schmid, Alejandro Gallego/B-2332-2016; Heyes, Graeme/ABC-4844-2021; Sharmina, Maria/GWC-2144-2022","Mendoza, Joan Manuel F./0000-0003-1666-0268; Schmid, Alejandro Gallego/0000-0002-0583-2143; Heyes, Graeme/0000-0002-8073-1975; ","project Designing sustainable supply chains through the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK","project Designing sustainable supply chains through the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK","This work has been carried out as part of the project Designing sustainable supply chains funded through the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.",,125,133,133,10,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

Yet, little is known about how different combinations of news frames and issues relate to discrete emotions and whether these emotions, in turn, affect issue perceptions. The present study investigates these questions by testing whether (a) the effects of news articles, featuring highly versus moderately contested policy issues on perceived policy effectiveness (PPE), are mediated by three discrete emotions (anger, fear, and hope) and (b) if these effects depend on the type of generic news frame used (human interest vs. economic consequences). An online experimental survey (N = 405) demonstrated that the effects of issue contestation on PPE were mediated by hope and anger, but not by fear. These effects were only apparent within a human interest frame. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","[Feinholdt, Alina; Schuck, Andreas R.

Assessing the extent of the threat of far-travelled ash clouds on flight paths is substantially hindered by an incomplete volcanic history and an underestimation of the potential reach of distant eruptive centres. The risk of extensive ash clouds to aviation is thus poorly quantified. New evidence is presented of explosive Late Pleistocene eruptions in the Pacific Arc, currently undocumented in the proximal geological record, which dispersed ash up to 8000 km from source. Twelve microscopic ash deposits or cryptotephra, invisible to the naked eye, discovered within Greenland ice-cores, and ranging in age between 11.1 and 83.7 ka b2k, are compositionally matched to northern Pacific Arc sources including Japan, Kamchatka, Cascades and Alaska. Only two cryptotephra deposits are correlated to known high-magnitude eruptions (Towada-H, Japan, ca 15 ka BP and Mount St Helens Set M, ca 28 ka BP). For the remaining 10 deposits, there is no evidence of age-and compositionally-equivalent eruptive events in regional volcanic stratigraphies. This highlights the inherent problem of under-reporting eruptions and the dangers of underestimating the long-term risk of widespread ash dispersal for trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flight routes.","[Bourne, A.

In Germany, most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic soils are attributed to sites managed as grassland. Here, we investigated a land use gradient from near-natural wetland (NW) to an extensively managed (GE) to an intensively managed grassland site (GI), all formed in the same bog complex in northern Germany. Vertical depth profiles of delta C-13, delta N-15, ash content, C / N ratio and bulk density as well as radiocarbon ages were studied to identify peat degradation and to calculate carbon loss. At all sites, including the near-natural site, delta C-13 depth profiles indicate aerobic decomposition in the upper horizons. Depth profiles of delta N-15 differed significantly between sites with increasing delta N-15 values in the top soil layers paralleling an increase in land use intensity owing to differences in peat decomposition and fertilizer application. At both grassland sites, the ash content peaked within the first centimetres. In the near-natural site, ash contents were highest in 10-60 cm depth. The ash profiles, not only at the managed grassland sites, but also at the near-natural site indicate that all sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities either currently or in the past, most likely due to drainage. Based on the enrichment of ash content and changes in bulk density, we calculated the total carbon loss from the sites since the peatland was influenced by anthropogenic activities. Carbon loss at the sites increased in the following order: NW< GE< GI. Radiocarbon ages of peat in the topsoil of GE and GI were hundreds of years, indicating the loss of younger peat material. In contrast, peat in the first centimetres of the NW was only a few decades old, indicating recent peat growth. It is likely that the NW site accumulates carbon today but was perturbed by anthropogenic activities in the past. Together, all biogeochemical parameters indicate a degradation of peat due to (i) conversion to grassland with historical drainage and (ii) land use intensification.","[Krueger, J.

This has meant a productive simplification, and peasant communities have been displaced and stripped of their traditional ways of life. However, in this landscape of disaster, biotic communities of fungi have flourished, and with them human communities of collectors have learned to sustain themselves in a monocultural and privatized scenario. This paper is based on a multi-local ethnographic approach, built upon 26 semi-structured interviews, participant observation, social mapping, creating a calendar and a trend line. The text documents the processes of two communities affected by massive fires which have developed organization, agencies and practices. Mushrooms (callampas in Chilean Spanish) are claimed as a common good derived from the forestry model, claiming access to their use and usufruct of land belonging to forestry companies. They have also developed local governance systems for the care and better use of this new resource for common use. Forestry companies, for their part, try to subsume these practices in their territorial governance processes, disputing these commons' meaning and purpose. Both cases contribute to empirically address the central thesis of this article, according to which communalization exercises within contexts of capitalist expansion constitute responses of survival, resistance and adaptation in landscapes transformed and devastated by extractivist industries.","[Carrasco Henriquez, Noelia] Univ Concepcion, Hist Dept, Art & Humanities Fac, Edmundo Larenas 240, Concepcion 4030000, Chile; [Carrasco Henriquez, Noelia] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Concepcion, Chile; [Cid-Aguayo, Beatriz E.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion 4030000, Chile; [Krstulovic-Matus, Josefa E.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Social Sci, Masters Programme Social Res & Dev, Dept Sociol, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion 4030000, Chile; [Mella-Moraga, Valentina; Onate Vargas, Diego] Univ Concepcion, Social Sci Fac, Masters Programme Social Res & Dev, Dept Sociol, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion 4030000, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion,"Henriquez, NC (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Hist Dept, Art & Humanities Fac, Edmundo Larenas 240, Concepcion 4030000, Chile.;Henriquez, NC (corresponding author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Concepcion, Chile.",noeliacarrasco@udec.cl,,,Fondecytregular [1190020]; Anillo [ACT210037],Fondecytregular(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Anillo(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS),This work was funded by Fondecytregular 1190020 and Anillo ACT210037.,,30,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0010-3802,1468-2656,,COMMUNITY DEV J,Community Dev.

The conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels by solar energy is an immediate solution to mitigate CO2 emissions, while providing global energy security. In this work, boron-and phosphorus-doped silicon nanocrystals (ncSi), comprised of three earth-abundant elements, are investigated for gas-phase heterogeneous photoreduction of CO2 for the first time. Surface dopants are demonstrated to induce CO2 adsorption capacity. Remarkably, phosphorus-doped ncSi is found to be the best performer among the singly doped and co-doped ncSi samples, doubling the rate of pristine ncSi. The enhancement of activity is attributed to the combination of the number of surface hydrides, its surface hydrophobicity, the addition of electronegative surface atoms, and perhaps an enhanced hydridic character of the Si-H induced by the n-doping effect. Significantly, boron and phosphorus dopants are shown to provide increased stability of CO2 reduction activity compared to pristine ncSi after storing the samples in air for 2 weeks. These noteworthy findings open up a pathway to develop sustainable alternatives for existing photocatalysts for CO2 conversion.","[Wong, Annabelle P.

Hypotheses centring around heat conservation, heat dissipation, primary productivity and seasonality have been advanced to explain geographic body-size patterns. However, identification of the primary body-size drivers has often been hampered by a paucity of data for broadly distributed species and the application of regression models that have not explicitly accounted for the spatial clustering inherent in such datasets. We used Australia's most widespread marsupial, the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula, as a model species with which to test five proposed drivers of geographic body-size variation. Using geo-referenced skull measurements from 588 specimens and a suite of putative environmental covariates, we employed spatial simultaneous autoregressive models, together with information criteria, to evaluate these different hypotheses. Our analysis identified a strong, positive relationship between possum body size and primary productivity during the least productive season, whereas the relationship with mean annual productivity received less support. Consistent with the heat-dissipation hypothesis, T. vulpecula body size also decreased with increasing mean summer maximum temperature. Spatial autoregression coefficients estimated from the simultaneous autoregressive models were always high, suggesting that additional abiotic or biotic factors might contribute to the spatial patterns observed. We argue that the analysis of geographic body-size variation should consider multi-causal possibilities rather than treating the numerous hypotheses as competing, mutually exclusive alternatives.","[Correll, Rachel A.; Prideaux, Gavin J.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Prowse, Thomas A.

Samples were prepared using one of a number of different methods: untreated (control); acid-base-acid (ABA); and acid.-base-wet oxidation with stepped combustion (ABOX-SC) after Bird et al. 0 999). The results show that for material younger than similar to 25 ka BP there is little difference between the two chemical pretreatment methods and the control. For charcoal beyond similar to 25 ka BP, however, there are differences Of LIP to 4000 a, with ABOX-SC ages being consistently older. This is argued to be a more effective pretreatment method for decontaminating charcoal Samples prior to radiocarbon dating. For radiocarbon dating charcoals greater than similar to 25 ka BP, the ABOX-SC pretreatment and combustion approach appears to be the most rigorous method for developing a robust chronological framework for tropical sequences and should be more widely applied in contexts where the material being dated is likely to be ancient. The new chronology developed for Niah Cave based on this technique suggests that the earliest human evidence dates back to at least 45 ka BP and may extend significantly earlier than this based on the recent discovery of lithics 50cm below the earliest dated charcoal.

In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) absorption spectrometer to continuously measure ammonia concentrations at high time resolution and thus to quantify the net exchange between a seminatural peatland ecosystem and the atmosphere based on the eddy-covariance approach. Changing diurnal patterns of both ammonia concentration and fluxes were found during different periods of the campaign. We observed a clear tipping point in early spring with decreasing ammonia deposition velocities and increasingly bidirectional fluxes that occurred after the switch from dormant vegetation to CO2 uptake but was triggered by a significant weather change. While several biophysical parameters such as temperature, radiation, and surface wetness were identified to partially regulate ammonia exchange at the site, the seasonal concentration pattern was clearly dominated by agricultural practices in the surrounding area. Comparing the results of a compensation point model with our measurement-based flux estimates showed considerable differences in some periods of the campaign due to overestimation of non-stomatal resistances caused by low acid ratios. The total cumulative campaign exchange of ammonia after 9 weeks, however, differed only in a 6% deviation with 911 and 857 gNH(3)-N ha(-1) deposition being found by measurements and modeling, respectively. Extrapolating our findings to an entire year, ammonia deposition was lower than reported by Hurkuck et al. (2014) for the same site in previous years using denuder systems. This was likely due to a better representation of the emission component in the net signal of eddy-covariance fluxes as well as better adapted site-specific parameters in the model. Our study not only stresses the importance of high-quality measurements for studying and assessing land surface-atmosphere interactions but also demonstrates the potential of QCL spectrometers for continuous observation of reactive nitrogen species as important additional instruments within long-term monitoring research infrastructures such as ICOS or NEON at sites with strong nearby ammonia sources leading to relatively high mean background concentrations and fluxes.","[Zoell, Undine; Bruemmer, Christian; Schrader, Frederik] Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Ammann, Christof] Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroscope ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ibrom, Andreas] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Flechard, Christophe R.] Agrocampus Ouest, INRA, SAS UMR1069, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Nelson, David D.; Zahniser, Mark] Aerodyne Res Inc, Billerica, MA USA; [Kutsch, Werner L.] Univ Helsinki, Head Off, ICOS, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Technical University of Denmark; INRAE; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; Aerodyne Research; University of Helsinki,"Zoll, U (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",undine.richter@thuenen.de,"Brümmer, Christian/J-1183-2016; Flechard, Chris/AAQ-7159-2020; INRAE, UMR SAS/L-1751-2013","Brümmer, Christian/0000-0001-6621-5010; Flechard, Chris/0000-0002-5954-9925; Kutsch, Werner Leo/0000-0003-1656-7514; Ammann, Christof/0000-0002-0783-5444; INRAE, UMR SAS/0000-0001-6346-7845; Schrader, Frederik/0000-0002-5668-3467; Ibrom, Andreas/0000-0002-1341-921X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the Junior Research Group NITROSPHERE [FKZ 01LN1308A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the Junior Research Group NITROSPHERE(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Funding for this study from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the Junior Research Group NITROSPHERE under support code FKZ 01LN1308A is greatly acknowledged.

Scholars argue that this 'neoextractivism' is made politically possible by directing some profits toward the funding of progressive social programs. The Brazilian Amazon's vast wealth of extractive resources and its large economically depressed population make it the emblematic site for neoextractivism. Its biodiversity and inhabited landscapes, however, mean that the neoextractive program encounters concerted resistance from the global environmental community as well as from traditional, indigenous, and migrant smallholders. In response, neoextractivism must deploy another form of progressivism-environmentalism. The author uses the case of agroindustrial soy production in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Para to demonstrate how the emergence of environmental governance there facilitates neoextractivism by 'greening' it. Through an analysis of the mechanisms and effects of two programs, implemented through partnerships between nongovernmental organizations and corporations, to manage soy expansion into the Amazon, it is demonstrated that these programs have questionable environmental benefits at best and at worst work to reenforce the hegemony of international environmental organizations, to green the image of agri-business multinationals, and to destabilize strategies of resistance.","Duke Univ, Thompson Writing Program, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Baletti, B (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Thompson Writing Program, Art Bldg,Campus Box 90025, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Brenda.baletti@duke.edu,,,,,,,83,35,35,4,65,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

The quality of input parameters for UV calculations has been validated with available ground based total ozone data and estimates of Cloud Modification Factor (CMF), and the results have been compared with existing UV data. Owing to limited availability of validation data especially during 1960s and 1970s the analysis focused on sites located in central and northern Europe. The current work is the first step in deriving reliable long-term UV time series from the ERA-40 reanalysis. Total ozone from the ERA-40 reanalysis is affected by significant biases, especially before satellite ozone measurements were available for assimilation. Estimations of the effect of clouds on surface UV were made using global radiation (300-3000 nm) budgets at the surface because available ERA-40 cloud data do not allow good estimates of surface daily UV doses. There are some problems with ERA-40 solar radiation budgets which cause systematic biases in calculated daily UV doses. Comparison of calculated daily erythemal UV doses against ground-based UV data indicate that ERA-40 UV doses are typically overestimated by 6-18% in central and northern Europe and underestimated by 9-17% at Davos, Switzerland. Root-mean-square errors of the calculated daily UV doses are usually in the range of 30-40%. Trends of UV doses were calculated for the concurrent period of the TOMS satellite UV data (1979-2002).

While researchers have shown that the region around the Tungabhadra and Krishna River basins displays significant subsistence and demographic continuity, and intensification, from the Neolithic into the Iron Age ca. 1200 cal. BC, archaeological and chronometric records in the Sanganakallu region point to hilltop village expansion during the Late Neolithic and 'Megalithic' transition period (ca. 1400-1200 cal. BC) prior to apparent abandonment ca. 1200 cal. BC, with little evidence for the introduction of iron technology into the region. We suggest that the difference in these settlement histories is a result of differential access to stable water resources during a period of weakening and fluctuating monsoon across a generally arid landscape. Here, we describe well-dated, integrated chronological, archaeobotanical, archaeozoological and archaeological survey datasets from the Sanganakallu-Kupgal site complex that together demonstrate an intensification of settlement, subsistence and craft production on local hilltops prior to almost complete abandonment ca. 1200 cal. BC. Although the southern Deccan region as a whole may have witnessed demographic increase, as well as subsistence and cultural continuity, at this time, this broader pattern of continuity and resilience is punctuated by local examples of abandonment and mobility driven by an increasing practical and political concern with water.","[Roberts, Patrick; Boivin, Nicole; Petraglia, Michael] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Masser, Paul] Headland Archaeol Ltd, 13 Jane St, Edinburgh EH6 5HE, Midlothian, Scotland; [Meece, Stephanie] Univ Arts London, 272 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EY, England; [Weisskopf, Alison; Silva, Fabio; Fuller, Dorian Q.] UCL, Inst Archaeol, 31-34 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PY, England; [Korisettar, Ravi] Karnatak Univ, Dept Hist & Archaeol, Dharwad 580003, Karnataka, India",University of Oxford; University of Arts London; University of London; University College London; Karnatak University,"Roberts, P (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",patrick.roberts@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Fuller, Dorian/AAF-7400-2019; Fuller, Dorian Q/C-1908-2008; Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021","Fuller, Dorian/0000-0002-4859-080X; Fuller, Dorian Q/0000-0002-4859-080X; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727; BOIVIN, NICOLE/0000-0002-7783-4199; Silva, Fabio/0000-0003-1368-6331; Roberts, Patrick/0000-0002-4403-7548",British Academy; Arts and Humanities Research Council; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research; Clarendon Fund; Natural Environmental Research Council; Leverhulme Trust; Karnatak University; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K003402/1]; NERC [NE/K003402/1] Funding Source: UKRI,British Academy; Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research; Clarendon Fund; Natural Environmental Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Karnatak University; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was funded through grants from the British Academy, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research to NB; the Clarendon Fund to PR; the Natural Environmental Research Council and the Leverhulme Trust to DQF; and Karnatak University to RK.

Various radar calibration and monitoring techniques have been developed, but only recently have integrated approaches been proposed, that is, using different calibration techniques in combination. In this paper the following three techniques are used: 1) ground clutter monitoring, 2) comparisons with spaceborne radars, and 3) the self-consistency of polarimetric variables. These techniques are applied to a C-band polarimetric radar (CPOL) located in the Australian tropics since 1998. The ground clutter monitoring technique is applied to each radar volumetric scan and provides a means to reliably detect changes in calibration, relative to a baseline. It is remarkably stable to within a standard deviation of 0.1 dB. To obtain an absolute calibration value, CPOL observations are compared to spaceborne radars on boar dTRMM and GPM using a volume-matching technique. Using an iterative procedure and stable calibration periods identified by the ground echoes technique, we improve the accuracy of this technique to about 1 dB. Finally, we review the self-consistency technique and constrain its assumptions using results from the hybrid TRMM-GPM and ground echo technique. Small changes in the self-consistency parameterization can lead to 5 dB of variation in the reflectivity calibration. We find that the drop-shape model of Brandes et al. with a standard deviation of the canting angle of 12 degrees best matches our dataset.","[Louf, Valentin; Warren, Robert A.; Jakob, Christian] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Protat, Alain; Raunyiar, Surendra] Bur Meteorol, Res & Dev Branch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Collis, Scott M.] Argonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Wolff, David B.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Wallops Flight Facil, Wallops Isl, VA 23337 USA; [Petersen, Walter A.] NASA, Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Earth Sci Off, Huntsville, AL USA",Monash University; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,"Louf, V (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",valentin.louf@monash.edu,"Rauniyar, Surendra/GQB-4414-2022; Jakob, Christian/A-1082-2010","Jakob, Christian/0000-0002-5012-3207; Louf, Valentin/0000-0001-8133-3031; Warren, Robert/0000-0003-4195-986X; Rauniyar, Surendra/0000-0001-8178-334X; Protat, Alain/0000-0002-8933-874X","U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research program [DE-SC0014063]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Climate Model Development and Validation activity of the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research","U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Climate Model Development and Validation activity of the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research","This work has been supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research program through Grant DE-SC0014063.

A key challenge is to quantify the stability of critical points: more stable points may represent more important phenomena or vice versa. The topological notion of robustness is a tool which allows us to quantify rigorously the stability of each critical point. Intuitively, the robustness of a critical point is the minimum amount of perturbation necessary to cancel it within a local neighborhood, measured under an appropriate metric. In this paper, we introduce a new analysis and visualization framework which enables interactive exploration of robustness of critical points for both stationary and time-varying 2D vector fields. This framework allows the end-users, for the first time, to investigate how the stability of a critical point evolves over time. We show that this depends heavily on the global properties of the vector field and that structural changes can correspond to interesting behavior. We demonstrate the practicality of our theories and techniques on several datasets involving combustion and oceanic eddy simulations and obtain some key insights regarding their stable and unstable features.","[Wang, B.; Rosen, P.; Bhatia, H.; Pascucci, V.] Univ Utah, Sci Comp & Imaging Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Sci Comp & Imaging Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Rosen, Paul/AAN-1370-2021; Bhatia, Harsh/K-7836-2019","Rosen, Paul/0000-0002-0873-9518; Bhatia, Harsh/0000-0001-8712-7773","DOE NETL; KAUST [KUS-C1-016-04]; EU project TOPOSYS [FP7-ICT-318493-STREP]; NSF [OCI-0906379, OCI-0904631]; DOE/NEUP [120341]; DOE/MAPD [DESC000192]; DOE/LLNL [B597476]; DOE/Codesign [P01180734]; DOE/SciDAC [DESC0007446]",DOE NETL(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); KAUST(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); EU project TOPOSYS; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE/NEUP(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE/MAPD; DOE/LLNL(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE/Codesign; DOE/SciDAC(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank Jackie Chen for the combustion dataset.

Studies on the 2005 drought present a complex, and sometimes contradictory, picture of how these forests have responded to the drought. Now, on the heels of the 2005 drought, comes an even stronger drought in 2010, as indicated by record low river levels in the 109 years of bookkeeping. How has the vegetation in this region responded to this record-breaking drought? Here we report widespread, severe and persistent declines in vegetation greenness, a proxy for photosynthetic carbon fixation, in the Amazon region during the 2010 drought based on analysis of satellite measurements. The 2010 drought, as measured by rainfall deficit, affected an area 1.65 times larger than the 2005 drought - nearly 5 million km(2) of vegetated area in Amazonia. The decline in greenness during the 2010 drought spanned an area that was four times greater (2.4 million km(2)) and more severe than in 2005. Notably, 51% of all drought-stricken forests showed greenness declines in 2010 (1.68 million km(2)) compared to only 14% in 2005 (0.32 million km(2)). These declines in 2010 persisted following the end of the dry season drought and return of rainfall to normal levels, unlike in 2005. Overall, the widespread loss of photosynthetic capacity of Amazonian vegetation due to the 2010 drought may represent a significant perturbation to the global carbon cycle. Citation: Xu, L., A.

Varied input costs of diesel fuel, labor, and interest rate were input into a highly detailed cost analysis for bulk-format and baseline round bale logistics. These operational input factors, potentially reflecting an evolving economic climate or paradigm shift, were examined to provide insight into the cost to deliver preprocessed biomass feedstock for centralized commercial-scale conversions. Total annual costs per dry unit of SG were determined for all combinations of diesel fuel prices of $0.53 L-1, $0.92 L-1, and $1.32 L-1; total labor costs of $20.00 h(-1), $28.85 h(-1), and $40.00 h(-1) singly and uniformly applied across all labor inputs; and three representative interest rates of 6%, 8%, and 12%. Increases in total cost most depended on increases in diesel fuel cost, followed by labor rate, and finally interest rate. Increases in fuel costs from $0.53 L-1 to $1.32 L-1 yielded a total cost increase of about $11.56 dMg(-1) and $13.36 dMg(-1) for bulk-format and round bale logistics, respectively, for all combinations of labor and interest rates. The overall increase in labor rate ($20.00 h(-1) to $40.85 h(-1)) resulted in increased total costs of about $10.32 dMg(-1) for bulk-format logistics and $9.94 dMg(-1) for round bale logistics for all fuel and interest rates. The overall increase in interest rate (6% to 12%) resulted in increased total costs of about $6.72 dMg(-1) for bulk-format logistics and $4.21 dMg(-1) for round bale logistics for all fuel and labor rates. Increases in total costs for combined increases in fuel cost, labor rate, and interest rate were $28.60 dMg(-1) and $27.48 dMg(-1), yielding maximum total costs of $87.87 dMg(-1) and $86.53 dMg(-1) for bulk-format and round bale logistics, respectively. Costs were determined for existing equipment systems, including novel use of waste compaction and ejector semi-trailers. The highest potential for cost reductions may require clean-sheet equipment designs specifically tailored for SG, such as forage harvesters that direct-cut standing SG, mobilized stacker-reclaimer technology to not inhibit stack-area footprint, self-compacting ejector trailer technology, and bale grinding technology incorporating controlled mass feeding and shear failure elements.","[Womac, A.

The study focuses on low grade heat sources from a paper mill located on a British coastal area which presents a large quantity of recoverable waste heat at low temperature (<100 degrees C). Two scenarios are considered: (1) low grade heat is used directly to feed the desalination process, (ii) low grade heat is upgraded using a heat pump coupled with a desalination system. In the first scenario, a Humidification Dehumidification process was identified as a suitable technology due to its low operating temperature. In the second scenario, the low grade heat temperature was upgraded using a hybrid absorption heat pump and subsequently used to feed a Multiple Effect Distillation desalination system. These two cases were compared in terms of performances and economics. For both cases, a payback period of less than 10 years could be obtained for water price equal to 2 pound per tonnes of water. This is comparable to the price of home water supply. Environmental aspects were also discussed from the results of a full Lifecycle assessment. Low grade heat utilisation in both cases reduced the Global Warming Potential in comparison with fossil fuel powered systems, but toxicological impacts appeared higher in comparison to a system using natural gas.

There are now a sufficient number of models that it is worth taking stock of the way these models have been developed. Here, we review 20 agricultural agent-based models (ABM) addressing heterogeneous decision-making processes in the context of European agriculture. The goals of this review were to i) develop a framework describing aspects of farmers' decision-making that are relevant from a farm-systems perspective, ii) reveal the current state-of-the-art in representing farmers' decision-making in the European agricultural sector, and iii) provide a critical reflection of underdeveloped research areas and on future opportunities in modelling decision-making. To compare different approaches in modelling farmers' behaviour, we focused on the European agricultural sector, which presents a specific character with its family farms, its single market and the common agricultural policy (CAP). We identified several key properties of farmers' decision-making: the multi-output nature of production; the importance of non-agricultural activities; heterogeneous household and family characteristics; and the need for concurrent short- and long-term decision-making. These properties were then used to define levels and types of decision-making mechanisms to structure a literature review. We find most models are sophisticated in the representation of farm exit and entry decisions, as well as the representation of long-term decisions and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies. Considerably fewer attempts to model farmers' emotions, values, learning, risk and uncertainty or social interactions occur in the different case studies. We conclude that there is considerable scope to improve diversity in representation of decision-making and the integration of social interactions in agricultural agent-based modelling approaches by combining existing modelling approaches and promoting model inter-comparisons. Thus, this review provides a valuable entry point for agent-based modellers, agricultural systems modellers and data driven social scientists for the re-use and sharing of model components, code and data. An intensified dialogue could fertilize more coordinated and purposeful combinations and comparisons of ABM and other modelling approaches as well as better reconciliation of empirical data and theoretical foundations, which ultimately are key to developing improved models of agricultural systems.","[Huber, Robert; Xiong, Hang; Finger, Robert] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETHZ, Agr Econ & Policy AECP, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bakker, Martha] Wageningen Univ & Res, Land Use Planning Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Balmann, Alfons; Sun, Zhanli] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Berger, Thomas; Troost, Christian] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Land Use Econ Trop & Subtrop 490d, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Bithell, Mike] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Brown, Calum] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gret-Regamey, Adrienne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETHZ, Planning Landscape & Urban Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Quang Bao Le] ICARDA, POB 950764, Amman, Jordan; [Mack, Gabriele] Agroscope, Dept Socioecon, CH-8356 Tanikon, Ettenhausen, Switzerland; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Millington, James] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Mueller, Birgit] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Polhill, J.

The roofs of the cells are removable so that one can analyze different roofs with a different coating each. We monitored the test cells for two weeks and measured roofs surface temperature, indoor air temperature and determined the heat flux of the roofs. The red roof (RR) had a surface temperature 3 C higher than the gray roof (GR) and this difference caused the RR to have a peak heat flux 20% higher. On the other hand, the white reflective roofs (WR) reduced the surface temperature between 10 and 14.6 degrees C compared with the GR. We obtained the daily heat gain of the roofs by calculating the area under the curve of the heat flux of each day. The WR had a daily heat gain between 59 and 80% lower than the GR, whereas the RR had a net heat gain 22% greater. Finally, using data from the experiments we validated roof model to determine the year-round performance of the roofs. From the results provided by the roof model, we estimated cost effectiveness of the roofs coatings. We found that WR are a cost-effective strategy to reduce building energy consumption in Mexico because its payback period is lower than 2 years. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We identify established and emerging approaches for transformation towards a more circular nutrient economy with relevance to SDGs 6 and 14. The paper cites the example of the Baltic Sea Region which has experienced decades of fertilizer overuse (1950s-1990s) and concomitant urban sources of excessive nutrients. Regulations and incentive policies combining the nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon cycles are necessary if circular nutrient technologies and practices are to be scaled up. Pricing chemical fertilizer at levels to reflect society's call for circularity is a central challenge.","[Rosemarin, Arno; Macura, Biljana; Barquet, Karina; Ek, Filippa; Jarnberg, Linn; Lorick, Dag; Haddaway, Neal R.] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Carolus, Johannes] Thunen Inst Farm Econ, Braunschweig, Germany; [Johannesdottir, Solveig] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Skelleftea, Sweden; [Carolus, Johannes; Pedersen, Soren Marcus] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Koskiaho, Jari] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Helsinki, Finland; [Haddaway, Neal R.] Univ Johannesburg, Africa Ctr Evidence, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Haddaway, Neal R.] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Okruszko, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Stockholm Environment Institute; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; RISE Research Institutes of Sweden; University of Copenhagen; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Johannesburg; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Rosemarin, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",arno.rosemarin@sei.org,"Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/AAG-1351-2020; Rosemarin, Arno/AAY-3071-2021; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/O-6001-2015","Rosemarin, Arno/0000-0002-6779-3872; Koskiaho, Jari/0000-0001-9337-7592; Macura, Biljana/0000-0002-4253-1390; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/0000-0003-4617-0286",BONUS (Baltic Organisations' Network for Funding Science EEIG) - EU [185]; BONUS (Baltic Organisations' Network for Funding Science EEIG) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS [185]; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA; Academy of Finland; National Centre for Research and Development in Poland,"BONUS (Baltic Organisations' Network for Funding Science EEIG) - EU; BONUS (Baltic Organisations' Network for Funding Science EEIG) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA(Vinnova); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); National Centre for Research and Development in Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)","This work is part of the BONUS RETURN project (www.bonusreturn.eu) funded by BONUS (Art 185) (Baltic Organisations' Network for Funding Science EEIG), funded jointly by the EU and Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS, Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA, Academy of Finland and National Centre for Research and Development in Poland.",,109,22,23,4,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

J,"Hapetchenko, R",,,,"Hapetchenko, R.",,,"Folk traditions, customs, holidays and ceremonies as components of family cultural and leisure activities",NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD,,,Russian,Article,,,,,,family; traditions; customs; holidays; ceremonies; cultural and leisure activities,,"The article deals with the Ukrainian folk traditions, customs, holidays and ceremonies and its influence on the family cultural and leisure activities formation; the article gives a detailed analysis of the family traditions and holidays influence on making a positive micro climate in the family. Special attention is focused on rural, agricultural families, their holidays and traditions. This paper investigates some forms of organizing family cultural and leisure activities in a modern Ukrainian society, based on folk traditions, customs, holidays and ceremonies. Ukrainian folk has been forming its traditions, customs, holidays and ceremonies within centuries, and even now, all the time, they are in the process of formation and transformation. Family traditions, customs and ceremonies have been reflecting the experience of upbringing children of each nation. Sophistication of long-lasting family, common and cultural traditions indicates high level of an ethnic group formation of each nationality. Family traditions, supported by the force of public opinion, play an important role in the spiritual life formation. Being improved and transformed, they become norms and rules, important accelerators of a social progress. Traditions of each family have their own peculiarities. Good traditions unite family and help to preserve home warmth and coziness, ensure creation of harmony, love and respect in the family. Old and good tradition in the family is involving children in a joint work, discussion of family achievements and problems, involving all the members of the family in joint breakfasts and dinners, family Saturday's lunches for exchanging experience and all sorts of news. As a tradition may be considered some interesting, according to the certain scenario, birthday keeping of each member of the family, celebration of important dates, meeting guests, joint outings, visiting of cultural and art events, morning exercises and etc. Regular communication, warm feelings, respect of family members - these are those components of a moral and ethical culture, which join together family, create a favorable microclimate and form spiritual culture of each individual. Each nation, each folk, even each social group has its customs, formed within many centuries and time honored. Folk customs cover all the areas of public, family and social life. In the process of historical development, there were developed and established the forms, means and mechanisms of preservation and transmission of social experience, which are together called a tradition. The aim of a tradition is to consolidate and reflect in new generations established ways of life, types of thinking and behavior. Forms of tradition realization are different, but the main of them are customs, holidays and ceremonies. If a tradition has its place in all of the spheres of the material and spiritual life, a custom exists only in separate areas of it, mainly in the spheres of labor, welfare, communication and family relationships. The whole family life in the past was accompanied by different ceremonies and rituals, which in the figurative symbolic form meant certain stages of human life and separate stages of family development. According to the natural cycle of human existence, there was set a complex of the following family ceremonies: maternity, wedding, funeral and memorial. Together with the development of rational knowledge, a sense of forbidden magical ceremonies has been lost step by step, and ritual actions were transformed to one of the traditional entertainment of the folk. With the advent of new ceremonial actions and symbolic rituals, the old one has been kept, though; their sense has been changed over time. Except funeral and memorial, all the ceremonies are jolly and celebratory. But still, a ceremony and a holiday is not the same, because the last includes a ceremony or ceremonies as a component part, but is not limited to a ceremony. A holiday doesn't have a strictly set form; it may well evolve depending on the creativity of its participants, the initiative of who is not restricted. Holidays and ceremonies has been relatively independent cultural phenomenon, means of experience transfer from generation to generation. The family is a main carrier of national traditions, which within centuries have helped to form a wide spiritual world, high moral values, nurture industriousness, respect for elders and love for native land. Through a family sphere, the traditions are transferred between the generations. Approximately, 60% of the whole scope of ethnic and cultural information is assimilated in the frames of a family and it is the base of ethnical self-identity of an individual. Against modernization and globalization processes in the life of the society, a family is a stable element in a national upbringing of an individual based on traditions, customs, holidays and ceremonies. Through teaching the way of communication in a family, joint cultural and leisure activities and formation of a common human behavior traits and spiritual values, there happen first steps of socialization of an individual and forming of a family spiritual culture.",,,,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,NATL ACAD MANAGERIAL STAFF CULTURE & ARTS,KYIV,"VUL LAVRSKA, 9, KORPUS 15, KYIV, 01015, UKRAINE",2226-3209,2409-0506,,NATL ACAD MANAG STA,Natl.

Rigorous syntheses of such studies can help develop understanding and inform decision-making. They can combine findings from studies in varied or similar contexts to address questions relating to, for example, the lived experience of those affected by environmental phenomena or interventions, or to intervention implementation. Researchers in environmental management have adapted methodology for systematic reviews of quantitative research so as to address questions about the magnitude of intervention effects or the impacts of human activities or exposure. However, guidance for the synthesis of qualitative evidence in this field does not yet exist. The objective of this paper is to present a brief overview of different methods for the synthesis of qualitative research and to explore why and how reviewers might select between these. The paper discusses synthesis methods developed in other fields but applicable to environmental management and policy. These methods include thematic synthesis, framework synthesis, realist synthesis, critical interpretive synthesis and meta-ethnography.

A high-resolution conceptual hydrologic model (wflow_sbm) was parameterized for the Rhine basin in Europe based on point-scale (pedo)transfer functions, without further calibration of effective model parameters on discharge. Parameters were estimated on the data resolution, followed by upscaling of parameter fields to the model resolution. The method was tested using a 6-hourly time step at four model resolutions (1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 km), followed by a validation with discharge observations and a comparison with actual evapotranspiration (ETact) estimates from an independent model (DMET Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility). Additionally, the scalability of parameter fields and simulated fluxes was tested. Validation of simulated discharges yielded Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, except for the Alps where a volume bias caused lower performance. Catchment-averaged temporal ETact dynamics were comparable with independent ET estimates (KGE approximate to 0.7), although wflow_sbm model simulations were on average 115 mm yr(-1) higher. Spatially, the two models were less in agreement (SPAEF = 0.10), especially around the Rhine valley. Consistent parameter fields were obtained, and by running the model at the different resolutions, preserved ETact fluxes were found across the scales. For recharge, fluxes were less consistent with relative errors around 30% for regions with high drainage densities. However, catchment-averaged fluxes were better preserved. Routed discharge in headwaters was not consistent across scales, although simulations for the main Rhine River were. Better processing (scale independent) of the river and drainage network may overcome this issue. Plain Language Summary Hydrologic models are used for flood and drought predictions. Most models have parameters, and to increase model performance, hydrologists often tune these parameters by calibration. State-of-the-art gridded hydrologic models have parameter sets per grid cell, leading to many parameters and making current calibration procedures far from ideal. Here, we tested the use of well-known (pedo)transfer functions from literature to estimate these parameter values, something which can reduce the calibration burden. By using parameter-specific upscaling rules to derive seamless parameter maps for the wflow_sbm model, which explicitly takes subsurface lateral flows into account, this gives a model which is scalable to different grid cell sizes. We assessed the approach on multiple model resolutions, and we found consistent parameter fields and the preservation of vertical fluxes. Only routed discharge, a key output, deteriorates for headwater catchments on coarser resolutions. We attribute this to model structure and the derivation procedure of the river network on different scales, resulting in the loss of lateral flow representation on coarser resolutions. Nevertheless, discharge and evapotranspiration simulations are similar to observations and other models. Hence, regionalization with literature transfer functions and upscaling techniques can further lower the calibration burden and enable predictions in ungauged basins. Key Points Seamless distributed parameter maps can be obtained for the gridded hydrologic model wflow_sbm with transfer functions from literature Application of wflow_sbm with these seamless parameter maps yields simulation results with high KGE and NSE across the Rhine basin Fluxes matched across model scales for evapotranspiration, but this match was considerably less for fluxes affected by (sub)surface flows","[Imhoff, R.

We therefore reconstructed long-term (1939-2015) and large-scale (West Greenland, Norway, and central Sweden) trends of major legacy OCs using white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) body feathers, to understand the exposure dynamics in regions with different contamination sources and concentrations, as well as the effectiveness of legislations. We included dietary proxies (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in temporal trend models to control for potential dietary plasticity. Consistent with the hypothesised high local pollution sources, levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in the Swedish subpopulation exceeded those in the other subpopulations. In contrast, chlordanes (CHLs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) showed higher concentrations in Greenland, suggesting the importance of long-range transport. The models showed significantly decreasing trends for all OCs in Sweden in 1968-2011 except for CHLs, which only decreased since the 1980s. Nevertheless, median concentrations of DDTs and PCBs remained elevated in the Swedish subpopulation throughout the 1970s, suggesting that the decreases only commenced after the implementation of regulations during the 1970s. We observed significant trends of increasing concentrations of PCBs, CHLs and HCB in Norway from the 1930s to the 1970s/1980s and decreasing concentrations thereafter. All OC concentrations, except those of PCBs were generally significantly decreasing in the Greenland subpopulation in 1985-2013. All three subpopulations showed generally increasing proportions of the more persistent compounds (CB 153, p.p'-DDE and beta-HCH) and decreasing proportions of the less persistent ones (CB 52, p.p'-DDT, alpha- and gamma-HCH). Declining trends of OC concentrations may imply the decreasing influence of legacy OCs in these subpopulations. Finally, our results demonstrate the usefulness of archived museum feathers in retrospective monitoring of spatiotemporal trends of legacy OCs using birds of prey as sentinels.","[Sun, Jiachen; Eens, Marcel] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol & Ecophysiol Grp, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Covaci, Adrian; Malarvannan, Govindan] Univ Antwerp, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Toxicol Ctr, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Bustnes, Jan Ove; Bardsen, Bard-Jorgen] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, FRAM High North Res Ctr Climate & Environm, Arctic Ecol Dept, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14,POB 6606, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Jaspers, Veerle L.

Hunter-gatherers position themselves in locations not just to exploit food resources, but also to maintain a certain distance to neighboring bands. Hunter-gatherer spatial organization was an agglomerated consequence of balancing two behaviors: spacing and proximizing. Thus, any given band's decision to relocate affects other bands' positioning, possibly resulting in a domino effect on a regional scale. We explain population fluctuations in Korea from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the early Holocene. The population history of southern Korea is characterized by an increasing occupational density during the LGM and population decline in periods of climatic amelioration. Contrasting this pattern to the population fluctuations observed in the northern latitudes of continental East Asia, we suggest that population increase in southern Korea during the LGM resulted from the southward movement of a wider hunter-gatherer network. As sea levels rose during the post-LGM, the network moved to the north and bands on the southern Korean peninsula moved north to avoid isolation. This process explains depopulation on the peninsula during the post-LGM and early Holocene.","[Seong, Chuntaek] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Hist, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Kim, Jangsuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",haeram@khu.ac.kr; jangsuk@snu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A5A2A03043510],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",We thank Matthew Conte for valuable comments on earlier version of this paper and Donghee Chong for figures.

J,"Oliinyk, O",,,,"Oliinyk, Oksana",,,Psychological characteristics of modern leisure space,NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD,,,Russian,Article,,,,,,creativity; leisure; collective leisure; psychic activity; the stages of leisure measures,,"The article includes the theoretical analysis of creativity problem as a psychological feature of individual's leisure space organization. The concept of creativity in modern domestic and foreign psychological science was revealed. The main types of creativity such as communicative, naive, cultural, talent one, self-actualization creativity were identified and characterized. On the basis of creativity nature researches of S. Taylor and E. Torrens there was defined a low probability model of individual differences in creativity. It was emphasized on the leading role of the environment in the development of creativity in the younger generation. The expediency of human creativity development was substantiated in the process of leisure that is carried out in a specific atmosphere of free choice, support and partnership, absence of competition, pleasure of the creative process and the result. It is indicated that creativity development optimization in the leisure activities is carried out under conditions of good public attention on the manifestation of human initiative to creative activity, social support of creative activities, development of adequate self-esteem personality, forming its inner motivation to creativity. It was generalized that defined conditions are conducive to the formation of a non-standard people's of different ages and social groups attitude to creative activity during leisure time. The analysis of the leisure concept in cultural studies and psychology is performed. According to the culturological approach the leisure is presented as a set of activities that perform restoring physical and mental strength of personality function. According to the psychological vision the leisure is defined as an indicator of human life, a source of comfort for the pleasure of its psychological needs. The preference was given to the personal choice freedom in leisure activities or activities considering its interests and preferences. The significance of leisure in the development of amateur performances, initiativeness, creative abilities and general person's creativity was presented and characterized. There were defined social and psychological and cultural values of leisure, which lies in fulfilling the specific needs of the person only in the field of leisure. They are the need for creative activity, the need to attend cultural and leisure measures, perceiving works of art, reading books, watching TV shows. It was generalized, that the diversity of leisure activity forms for different social and age groups of the population determines the effectiveness of cultural development of our society and influences the mental activity of humans. In particular, it contribute the formation of a positive emotional people's attitude to the participations in various types of leisure (organized, spontaneous and home leisure), the creation of relax and self-confidence atmosphere, the development of people's interest to self-knowledge through self-revelation and creative self-expression, that is impossible to be made at home and at work, the activation of people's awareness and acceptance of their own value, the development of adequate evaluation of their own abilities and capabilities skills, the development of communicative skills, overcoming the block of external and internal personality communication; formation of the ability to express their own emotional experiences associated with leisure activities and receive pleasure from its results. The relationship between different forms of individual's mental activity and its personal qualities was actualized in the process of organizing of leisure activities. They are the emotions reinforce the logic of thinking operations, the promotion of their activation and occurrence of the interest to new leisure activities, the stimulation of the cognitive activity of cultural and leisure activities for understanding of their own image. The roles of leisure in the development of various forms of personal mental activity are the mental cognitive processes (feeling, perception, memory, thinking, imagination) and cognitive activity, the sphere of emotions and feelings; mental states (exaltation, inspiration), personality characteristics (abilities, traits, interests, motivation, harassments), self-esteem, value attitude toward themselves, positive image of themselves. It was indicated that highlighted psychological features of leisure are optimally implemented in individual and collective people's leisure and contribute the development of motivation to participate in it. The choice of collective leisure forms was actualized under the following factors such as the group is a kind of unity that is able to provide optimal space and time for awareness, approbation and fixing various types and forms of leisure by its subjects. There were defined basic principles of groups functioning to ensure maximum effectiveness of creativity development and maximal collective leisure effectiveness: activity of participants, sociability, feedback, mutual trust, mutual respect, adequate self-revelation, subjecting of their statements, favorable psychological climate. It is outlined and described that the main stages of organized collective leisure activity realization are initial, main, final. The expediency of using psychological tricks and techniques at every stage of leisure was actualized. It is defined the leading role of animators, organizers and presenters and their psychological training importance in providing guidance and support to the participants of the collective leisure.","[Oliinyk, Oksana] Kyiv Natl Univ Culture & Arts, Cultural Studies Chair, Kiev, Ukraine",Kyiv National University of Culture & Arts,"Oliinyk, O (corresponding author), Kyiv Natl Univ Culture & Arts, Cultural Studies Chair, Kiev, Ukraine.",okleons@mail.ru,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,NATL ACAD MANAGERIAL STAFF CULTURE & ARTS,KYIV,"VUL LAVRSKA, 9, KORPUS 15, KYIV, 01015, UKRAINE",2226-3209,2409-0506,,NATL ACAD MANAG STA,Natl.

In this paper the sulphur and nitrogen deposition estimates of six state-of-the-art regional models (CAMx, CHIMERE, EMEP MSC-W, LOTOS-EUROS, MINNI and CMAQ) are evaluated and compared for four intensive EMEP measurement periods (25 Feb-26 Mar 2009; 17 Sep-15 Oct 2008; 8 Jan-4 Feb 2007 and 1-30 Jun 2006). For sulphur, this study shows the importance of including sea salt sulphate emissions for obtaining better model results; CMAQ the only model considering these emissions in its formulation, was the only model able to reproduce the high measured values of wet deposition of sulphur at coastal sites. MINNI and LOTOS-EUROS underestimate sulphate wet deposition for all periods and have low wet deposition efficiency for sulphur. For reduced nitrogen, all the models underestimate both wet deposition and total air concentrations (ammonia plus ammonium) in the summer campaign, highlighting a potential lack of emissions (or incoming fluxes) in this period. In the rest of campaigns there is a general underestimation of wet deposition by all models (MINNI and CMAQ with the highest negative bias), with the exception of EMEP, which underestimates the least and even overestimates deposition in two campaigns. This model has higher scavenging deposition efficiency for the aerosol component, which seems to partly explain the different behaviour of the models. For oxidized nitrogen, CMAQ CAMx and MINNI predict the lowest wet deposition and the highest total air concentrations (nitric acid plus nitrates). Comparison with observations indicates a general underestimation of wet oxidized nitrogen deposition by these models, as well as an overestimation of total air concentration for all the campaigns, except for the 2006 campaign. This points to a low efficiency in the wet deposition of oxidized nitrogen for these models, especially with regards to the scavenging of nitric acid, which is the main driver of oxidized N deposition for all the models. CHIMERE, LOTOS-EUROS and EMEP agree better with the observations for both wet deposition and air concentration of oxidized nitrogen, although CHIMERE seems to overestimate wet deposition in the summer period. This requires further investigation, as the gas-particle equilibrium seems to be biased towards the gas phase (nitric acid) for this model. In the case of MINNI, the frequent underestimation of wet deposition combined with an overestimation of atmospheric concentrations for the three pollutants indicates a low efficiency of the wet deposition processes. This can be due to several reasons, such as an underestimation of scavenging ratios, large vertical concentration gradients (resulting in small concentrations at cloud height) or a poor parameterization of clouds. Large differences between models were also found for the estimates of dry deposition. However, the lack of suitable measurements makes it impossible to assess model performance for this process. These uncertainties should be addressed in future research, since dry deposition contributes significantly to the total deposition for the three deposited species, with values in the same range as wet deposition for most of the models, and with even higher values for some of them, especially for reduced nitrogen.

We attempt to resolve these differences by situating this debate within the larger framework of the anthro-shift. The anthro-shift explains how the society-environment relationship changes over time. The theory assumes this relationship is the product of interrelations among the state, market, and civil society sectors. We focus on two distinctive qualities of the anthro-shift: the role risk plays as a pivot for reorienting how society interacts with the natural environment and the multidirectionality of the theory, highlighting how it combines elements of many of the dominant critical and optimistic perspectives into a broader framework.","[Fisher, Dana R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Art Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jorgenson, Andrew K.] Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Jorgenson, Andrew K.] Boston Coll, Environm Studies, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Boston College; Boston College,"Fisher, DR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Art Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",drfisher@umd.edu,,,,,,,173,16,16,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0735-2751,1467-9558,,SOCIOL THEOR,Sociol.

I show that the practice of green consumption does appeal to the relatively well-educated, but argue that the social differentiation implicated in green consumption occurs, in part, through the expression of tastes that do not rely on conspicuous signaling and that are contingent on the symbolic nature of the goods themselves. The paper employs a logistic regression analysis on national data from a 2008 ABC News/Discovery Channel/Stanford University survey of American adults to show that an increasing level of education is positively related to the odds of finding green consumption desirable. Being female, having children under the age of 18 years old in the home, and identifying as an environmentalist are also positive predictors. These findings are situated in existing literature on green consumption and interpreted using the theoretical contributions of Pierre Bourdieu (1984, 2005) in Distinction and The Social Structures of the Economy. The result is an engagement with scholarship on green consumption that is both theoretically and empirically informed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Biochar (B) amended soil has been suggested as a sustainable agricultural practice to improve crop yield and mitigate agricultural pollutants' contamination. Evaluating the effect of fertilization on Brassica crops, in combination with spectral analysis, may specify changes in the chemical composition of the vegetable as a result of N fertilization. This study characterized cauliflower tissues treated with N fertilizer and biochar, employing Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. The experiment was conducted in cauliflower mesocosms treated with two doses of N fertilizer (130 and 260 kg N ha(-1)) with or without B. Attenuated total reflectance fractions were used to characterize fractions of curds, leaves, stems, and roots in the infrared using a Fourier transform. Principal component analysis was performed to classify the main differences among cauliflower tissues concerning treatments. FTIR spectra of Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis tissues were related to nitrogen-based agricultural practices. The specific molecules associated with functional groups in cauliflower tissues were phenols, amides, proteins, amines, and glucosinolates. Biochar amended soil resulted in higher peaks that correspond to the stretching of phenols and proteins. The application of sustainable nitrogen fertilizers might influence the absorption bands characteristic of cauliflower's typical metabolites. The research allows the identification of Brassicaceae's functional molecules with a potential agronomic application.","[Losacco, Daniela; Campanale, Claudia; Tumolo, Marina; Ancona, Valeria; Massarelli, Carmine; Uricchio, Vito Felice] Natl Council Res, Water Res Inst, CNR IRSA, I-70132 Bari, Italy; [Losacco, Daniela; Tumolo, Marina] Univ Bari, Dept Biol, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque (IRSA-CNR); Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Losacco, D (corresponding author), Natl Council Res, Water Res Inst, CNR IRSA, I-70132 Bari, Italy.;Losacco, D (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Dept Biol, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",daniela.losacco@ba.irsa.cnr.it,"Massarelli, Carmine/ABH-3564-2020","Massarelli, Carmine/0000-0001-8006-6998; Tumolo, Marina/0000-0001-8182-0454; Daniela, Losacco/0000-0002-2993-6254; campanale, claudia/0000-0003-3673-3903", [91/676/CEE];  [152/2006];  [92],; ; ,This research was funded by project Attuazione Direttiva 91/676/CEE relativa alla protezione delle acque dall'inquinamento provocato dai nitrati provenienti da fonti agricole-art. 92 del D.Lgs. 152/2006-revisione delle Zone Vulnerabili da Nitrati di origine agricola e aggiornamento del Programma D'Azione Nitrati-Convenzione tra Regione Puglia e CNR-IRSA di Bari del 27/11/2019.,,63,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,19,,,,,,11985,10.3390/su141911985,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141911985,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5G6SS,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000867127100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Emissions of black carbon increase almost linearly, totaling about 1000 Gg in 1850, 2200 Gg in 1900, 3000 Gg in 1950, and 4400 Gg in 2000. Primary organic carbon shows a similar pattern, with emissions of 4100 Gg, 5800 Gg, 6700 Gg, and 8700 Gg in 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000, respectively. Biofuel is responsible for over half of BC emission until about 1890, and dominates energy-related primary OC emission throughout the entire period. Coal contributes the greatest fraction of BC emission between 1880 and 1975, and is overtaken by emissions from biofuel around 1975, and by diesel engines around 1990. Previous work suggests a rapid rise in BC emissions between 1950 and 2000. This work supports a more gradual increase between 1950 and 2000, similar to the increase between 1850 and 1925; implementation of clean technology is a primary reason.","Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Bond, TC (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, MC-250,205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",yark@uiuc.edu; ekta.bhardwaj@gmail.com; rdong2@uiuc.edu; jogani@uiuc.edu; soonkyujung@yahoo.com; croden@uiuc.edu; dstreets@anl.gov; ntrautmann@anl.gov,"Bond, Tami/A-1317-2013","Bond, Tami/0000-0001-5968-8928; Streets, David/0000-0002-0223-1350",,,,,98,577,587,4,217,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,1944-9224,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

Combining the functions can, however, create unintended dependencies, which can influence the desired performance of the system in unexpected ways. Recognising the risks associated with these dependencies early during the conceptual design phase can help to improve the system capability to mitigate the resulting threats and to take advantage of the opportunities created. This paper examines the use of the 'Functional Resonance Analysis Method' (FRAM) for qualitative risk analysis of multifunctional flood defences. The method is customised and applied to a case study of a multifunctional flood defence in the Netherlands. The analysis results are used to identify the threats and opportunities that need attention during the design of a multifunctional flood defence and to propose recommendations for how to address them. It is concluded that FRAM can serve as a useful complement to the reliability analysis methods for enriching the risk analysis of multifunctional flood defences.","[Anvarifar, Fatemeh; Voorendt, Mark Z.; Zevenbergen, Chris] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Zevenbergen, Chris] UNESCO IHE, Water Sci & Engn Dept, Delft, Netherlands; [Thissen, Wil] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, NL-2600 AA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Delft University of Technology,"Anvarifar, F (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",flora.anvarifar@gmail.com,,,Netherlands' Technology Foundation (STW); STW program [P10-28]; Netherlands' Technology Foundation (STW); STW program [P10-28],Netherlands' Technology Foundation (STW)(Technologiestichting STW); STW program; Netherlands' Technology Foundation (STW)(Technologiestichting STW); STW program,The research described in this paper is part of the program on 'Integral and sustainable design of multi-functional flood defences'.

Multiple-habitat users such as wild bees depend on both nesting and foraging habitat. Thus, they may be affected by the fragmentation of at least two habitat types. We investigated the effects of landscape-scale amount of and patch isolation from both nesting habitat (woody plants) and foraging habitat (specific pollen sources) on the abundance and diet of Osmia bicornis L. Trap-nests of O. bicornis were studied in 30 agricultural landscapes of the Swiss Plateau. Nesting and foraging habitats were mapped in a radius of 500 m around the sites. Pollen composition of larval diet changed as isolation to the main pollen source, Ranunculus, increased, suggesting that O. bicornis adapted its foraging strategy in function of the nest proximity to main pollen sources. Abundance of O. bicornis was neither related to isolation or amount of nesting habitat nor to isolation or abundance of food plants. Surprisingly, nests of O. bicornis contained fewer larvae in sites at forest edge compared to isolated sites, possibly due to higher parasitism risk. This study indicates that O. bicornis can nest in a variety of situations by compensating scarcity of its main larval food by exploiting alternative food sources.","[Coudrain, Valerie; Herzog, Felix] Res Stn ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Coudrain, Valerie; Rittiner, Sarah] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Coudrain, Valerie; Entling, Martin H.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau Pfalz, Germany; [Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Coudrain, Valerie] INRA Ecosys, RD 10, F-78026 Versailles, France",University of Bern; University of Koblenz & Landau; University of Bern; University of Bern; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Coudrain, V (corresponding author), Res Stn ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",vcoudrain@gmail.com,"Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Entling, Martin H/C-6953-2008; Herzog, Felix/B-1911-2009","Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Herzog, Felix/0000-0001-9472-4891",Swiss National Science foundation [3100A0-114058],Swiss National Science foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"We are grateful to Jacqueline van Leeuwen and Pim van der Knaap (from the Institute of Paleoecology of the University of Bern) for the help in the pollen determination and to Florencia Oberli for the help in pollen analysis.

However, most of the spatiotemporal correlations between land use types and LST are focused on industrial land use and urban green space, and there are fewer discussions on the totality of urban land use types. Here, using multi-source remote sensing images, correlation analysis and the stepwise regression method, we elaborate the relationship between landscape structure and land surface temperature (LST) across the different seasons of 850 planning management units in Jiaozuo, China. Our results show that the degree of explanation of surface temperature by landscape structure increased with a fine division of land use. The imprint of urban-rural gradients on LST was largely masked by the land use categories at the regional scales. Moreover, the tridimensional structure of buildings significantly affected the LST of residential regions, and the large number of low-rise buildings in urban planning practice contributes to high LSTs. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of each land use type and landscape structure on surface temperature in urban space and also provides strategies and methods for urban planning in rapidly developing regions of the country.","[Jia, Xiaoli; Song, Peihao; Zhang, Kaihua; Du, Chenyu; Feng, Yuan; Qu, Kexin; Wu, Meng; Ge, Shidong] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Dept Landscape Architecture, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Yun, Guoliang] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Ang; Wang, Kun] Henan Agr Univ, Int Union Lab Landscape Architecture, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",Henan Agricultural University; Peking University; Henan Agricultural University,"Ge, SD (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Dept Landscape Architecture, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",shidongge@henau.edu.cn,,,"Key Technology R&D Program of Henan Province [212102310838]; Special Fund for Young Talents in Henan Agricultural University [30500930, 30501053]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52208056]",Key Technology R&D Program of Henan Province; Special Fund for Young Talents in Henan Agricultural University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Key Technology R&D Program of Henan Province (212102310838), the Special Fund for Young Talents in Henan Agricultural University (30500930 and 30501053) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52208056).",,68,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2022,10,,,,,,1687,10.3390/land11101687,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101687,,,18,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5P7JS,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000873323500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most people acknowledge that they do not understand global warming very well, and results from questions about the perceived causes and consequences of global warming illustrate their limited understanding. While often confusing global warming with ozone depletion and air pollution, majorities of respondents in all but Russia believe that it is already occurring and large majorities within all nations believe that it will occur within their lifetimes. Furthermore, as discussions of the 'risk society' suggest, public perceptions of global warming do not vary consistently across differing social strata within the nations.

Our results directly confirm previous inferences that multiple phases of aeolian deposition, including megabarchan dune reactivation, occurred within the Sand Hills during the middle and late Holocene. Optical dates on stratified aeolian (barchan dune) sediments from two localities provide ages ranging from c. 6 ka to <300 years ago. Weakly developed palaeosols intercalated within the dune sediments and other forms of post-depositional modification indicate periods of relative stability and reduced dune mobilization. Optical dates on the upper 12-15 m of two dune exposures indicate repeated, possibly regionally correlative, reactivations which occurred between c. 400-500 and 200-300 years ago. Comparison of late-Holocene aeolian activity with local and regional palaeoclimatic proxy records suggests that dune reactivation may have occurred frequently, possibly in response to periods of extended (>20 yr) drought.","UNIV NEBRASKA,CONSERVAT & SURV DIV,LINCOLN,NE 68588",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Stokes, S (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD,ARCHAEOL & HIST ART RES LAB,SCH GEOG,OXFORD OX1 3QJ,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,,52,71,72,0,7,"ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC",LONDON,"338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 3BH",0959-6836,,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,SEP,1997,3,,,,263,272,,10.1177/095968369700700302,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968369700700302,,,10,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,YB599,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1997YB59900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

While grid extension is claimed as necessary, stakeholder opposition has slowed down this process. To alleviate this tension, increased stakeholder participation is considered as a solution to increase acceptance. The question of stakeholder empowerment is central to participation and it is assumed that higher levels of empowerment improve planning processes. In this paper, we describe, evaluate and compare the planning processes for very high-voltage transmission lines in France and Norway by means of a document analysis. We operationalize the degree of empowerment in three levels: information, consultation and cooperation. The results reveal low stakeholder empowerment that barely rises above the level of consultation. The evaluation of recent projects entailing innovations to enhance stakeholder participation reveals a trend of increasing empowerment levels, especially in the early phases of the planning procedure, i.e. the discussion about the needs for new lines and about the needs of the affected stakeholders.

There is little research on the systematic impact assessment. This study took Shanghai Port as an example and evaluated the impact under different scenarios through establishing a System Dynamics model. It is found that the epidemic mainly has a greater impact on passenger transport, but less on cargo transport. The ports with the function of transportation in highway, railway, and waterway were the key nodes in the international logistics network. More attention should be paid to the impact assessment of COVID-19 on ports' production and operation. It is necessary to strengthen the port's collection and distribution capabilities, improve port production efficiency, and further strengthen port modernization. This research method proposed in this paper can provide a reference for the impact assessment of similar events, and the empirical results can provide a reference for handling the epidemic shock for the port and shipping departments.","[Tai, Zili; Guo, Ji] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Guo, Ji] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate & Meteorol Disaste, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Guan, Yeli] Meteorol Bur Linyi City, Linyi 276007, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Qingquan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Coll Art & Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Shanghai Maritime University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Guo, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.;Guo, J (corresponding author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate & Meteorol Disaste, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",185391@shmtu.edu.cn,,"Tai, Zili/0000-0001-7817-1481","Natural Social Science Foundation of China [17BGL142, 18ZDA052, 16ZDA047, 91546117, 71904117]",Natural Social Science Foundation of China,"This research was supported by the Natural Social Science Foundation of China (17BGL142, 18ZDA052, 16ZDA047, 91546117, and 71904117).",,39,1,1,35,116,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0197-6729,2042-3195,,J ADV TRANSPORT,J.

The average mass concentration of PM2.5 was higher in dry and hot summer (7.0 +/- 3.5 mu g m(-3)) than in cold and humid winter (5.8 +/- 2.8 mu g m(-3)) with frequent wet scavenging. The non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) measured with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) plus black carbon (BC) mostly consists of organic aerosol (OA) with 60% in summer and 44% in winter. The contributions of sulfate to NR-PM2.5 plus BC was higher in summer (18%) than in winter (13%), while that of nitrate was lower in summer (6%) than in winter (22%). During the entire measurement periods in both seasons, relatively flat diurnal variations of sulfate were found, suggesting that it was associated with regional transport. However, occasionally rapid increase of sulfate can be caused by the transport of upwind industrial sources and enhanced vertical mixing processes. Nitrate showed a peak at morning rush hours related to traffic emissions, and then subsequently decreased by evaporation processes during daytime with higher temperature. Positive matrix factorization analysis revealed that the total OA was dominated by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) over the primary traffic emissions with -82% in summer and -48% in winter. A detailed analysis of two pollution episodes clearly demonstrated the impact of meteorological conditions on secondary aerosol formation and accumulation. A summertime heatwave episode showed high contributions of SOA to PM2.5 mass, which formed locally through daytime photochemical oxidation as well as nighttime chemistry of biogenic precursors. A wintertime transitional episode occurred with significant shift from relatively warm and humid to cold and dry conditions. The fast formation of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and SOA were found under the warm and humid period after receiving a local industrial emission plume. The cold and dry period was influenced by various sources including long-range transport of Saharan dust and anthropogenic emissions in central Europe. This study highlights the variations of urban PM2.5 sources under certain meteorological conditions such as summer heatwave and humid winter, which are expected high occurrence in future. Our results provide the implication on actual needs of mitigation actions to these pollution episodes in less-polluted western Europe cities.","[Song, Junwei; Saathoff, Harald; Gao, Linyu; Jiang, Feng; Vallon, Magdalena; Leisner, Thomas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Gebhardt, Reiner] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Reinhard Baumeister Pl 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Song, Junwei; Gao, Linyu; Jiang, Feng; Bauer, Jonas; Norra, Stefan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Appl Geosci, Chair Geochem & Econ Geol, Working Grp Environm Mineral & Environm Syst Anal, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Leisner, Thomas] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Neuenheimer Feld 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Song, JW (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",junwei.song@kit.edu,"Saathoff, Harald/J-8911-2012","Saathoff, Harald/0000-0002-1301-8010","China Scholarship Council (CSC); Modular Observation Solutions for Earth Systems (MOSES) project, a novel observing system of the Helmholtz Association","China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); Modular Observation Solutions for Earth Systems (MOSES) project, a novel observing system of the Helmholtz Association","The authors gratefully thank to the staff at IMK-AAF and IFGG of KIT for helpful discussions and technical support as well as the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for financial support of J.

Using case studies we illustrate measurement of plasmapause location, shape and movement during storms; refilling of flux tubes within and outside the plasmasphere; storm-time increase in heavy ion concentration near the plasmapause; and detection and mapping of density irregularities near the plasmapause, including drainage plumes, biteouts and bulges. We also use a 2D MHD model of wave propagation through the magnetosphere, incorporating a realistic ionosphere boundary and Alfven speed profile, to simulate ground array observations of power and cross-phase spectra, hence confirming the signatures of plumes and other density structures.","[Menk, Frederick; Sciffer, Murray; Robinson, Peter; Waters, Colin; Grew, Russell] Univ Newcastle, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Kale, Zoe; Mann, Ian] Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2J1, Canada; [Clilverd, Mark] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England",University of Newcastle; University of Alberta; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey,"Menk, F (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",fred.menk@newcastle.edu.au,"Sciffer, Murray D/B-3061-2011; Waters, Colin L/B-3086-2011; Menk, Frederick/A-2640-2009","Waters, Colin L/0000-0003-2121-6962; Menk, Frederick/0000-0002-1154-6223",NERC Antarctic Funding Initiative; Australian Research Council [DP0559544]; NERC [bas0100023] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [bas0100023] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC Antarctic Funding Initiative(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank all those involved in operating and providing data for the various instrument arrays.

Through physical measurements, questionnaires, and field observations, four residential areas in Changsha city were studied. The outdoor thermal comfort and activity of residents were studied with the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) as a model. The results showed that: (1) the neutral PET and neutral PET ranges for residents were 26.2 degrees C and 24.7-27.8 degrees C, respectively, and the range of 90% acceptable PET was lower than 28.5 degrees C; (2) globe temperature and air temperature were the primary factors influencing the thermal sensation of the residents; and (3) residents adapted to the thermal environment by adjusting their activity time and space in summer. These results help us to better understand the outdoor thermal comfort and activities of people living in subtropical regions and can provide guidance for the design of future residential open spaces.","[Deng, Yuwan; Gan, Dexin; Tang, Na; Li, Xinyi; Chen, Simin; Li, Xiaoma] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architectural & Art Design, Hunan Prov Key Lab, Landscape Ecol & Planning & Design Regular Higher, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zhengwu] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Dongting La, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University; Hunan Agricultural University,"Li, XM (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architectural & Art Design, Hunan Prov Key Lab, Landscape Ecol & Planning & Design Regular Higher, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",lixiaoma@hunau.edu.cn,"li, xin/HHS-9461-2022; li, xinyi/GWZ-8941-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [32001161]; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2021JJ30329]; Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Agricultural University,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Agricultural University,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32001161), Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 2021JJ30329), and Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Agricultural University.",,50,0,0,20,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2022,9,,,,,,1357,10.3390/atmos13091357,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091357,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4T9QQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000858442300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although primarily defined at the national scale, these C & I also have implications at scales ranging from forest stands to the forest management unit. In this paper, we review existing forest growth and ecosystem models from the point of view of applicability to prediction of indicators of sustainable management, focusing on stand scale models and management. To do this, we first present a conceptual framework for understanding the role of models in assessing forest management at the stand level in the context of sustainability criteria and indicators. We classify the criteria into those predictable using models operating at the stand scale, and those derivable either through scaling up or as solutions of a multi-objective management optimisation problem. We conclude that to date, no comprehensive models exist that could be used to predict all the indicators simultaneously. The most promising approach seems to be a modular system where different models are combined and run simultaneously, with shared inputs and well defined mutual links. More modelling efforts are needed especially regarding the state of the soil, including carbon, nitrogen and water balances and physical effects. Models also need development in their ability to deal with heterogeneous stand structures and with non-woody forest products such as berries, mushrooms or cork. The outputs of the models need to be developed in a direction where they can be interpreted in terms of the recreational or biodiversity value of the forest. Data requirements are most pronounced on the same issues as the gaps in model availability. It would be important to consider amending the national forest inventories and other similar standard data collection protocols with variables required for sustainability assessment. Importantly, combining different models in a modular system and with variable data sources requires advanced model parameterisation and evaluation methods and assessment of parameter and model uncertainty. The probabilistic, Bayesian approaches hold a lot of promise in this respect. Predictions using several different models or model systems, with systematic analysis of e.g. inter-model variability, could also be considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Emerging airborne remote sensing techniques offer a powerful approach to understand how aboveground carbon density (ACD) varies across tropical landscapes. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system to detect top-of-canopy tree height (TCH) and ACD across the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. LiDAR and field-estimated TCH and ACD were highly correlated across a wide range of forest ages and types. Top-of-canopy height (TCH) reached 67 m, and ACD surpassed 225 Mg C ha(-1), indicating both that airborne CAO LiDAR-based estimates of ACD are accurate in tall, high-biomass forests and that the Osa Peninsula harbors some of the most carbon-rich forests in the Neotropics. We also examined the relative influence of lithologic, topoedaphic and climatic factors on regional patterns in ACD, which are known to influence ACD by regulating forest productivity and turnover. Analyses revealed a spatially nested set of factors controlling ACD patterns, with geologic variation explaining up to 16% of the mapped ACD variation at the regional scale, while local variation in topographic slope explained an additional 18%. Lithologic and topoedaphic factors also explained more ACD variation at 30-m than at 100-m spatial resolution, suggesting that environmental filtering depends on the spatial scale of terrain variation. Our result indicate that patterns in ACD are partially controlled by spatial variation in geologic history and geomorphic processes underpinning topographic diversity across landscapes. ACD also exhibited spatial autocorrelation, which may reflect biological processes that influence ACD, such as the assembly of species or phenotypes across the landscape, but additional research is needed to resolve how abiotic and biotic factors contribute to ACD variation across high biomass, high diversity tropical landscapes.","[Taylor, Philip; Cole, Rebecca; Townsend, Alan] Univ Colorado, Inst Art & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Asner, Gregory; Anderson, Christopher; Knapp, David; Martin, Roberta; Mascaro, Joseph] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dahlin, Kyla] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Adv Study Program, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Chazdon, Robin] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Wanek, Wolfgang; Hofhansl, Florian] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Malavassi, Edgar; Vilchez-Alvarado, Braulio] Escuela Ingn Forestal, Inst Tecnol Costa Rica, Cartago, Costa Rica",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Carnegie Institution for Science; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Connecticut; University of Vienna; Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica,"Taylor, P (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Art & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",philipgrahamtaylor@gmail.com,"Hofhansl, Florian/E-6656-2012; Wanek, Wolfgang/E-7001-2012; Townsend, Alan/AAE-9602-2019; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Martin, Roberta/A-5073-2015; Chazdon, Robin/O-9766-2018","Hofhansl, Florian/0000-0003-0073-0946; Wanek, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2178-8258; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Martin, Roberta/0000-0003-3509-8530; Anderson, Christopher/0000-0001-7392-4368; Dahlin, Kyla/0000-0002-6016-2605; Chazdon, Robin/0000-0002-7349-5687",Blue Moon Foundation; National Science Foundation [0918835]; John D. and Catherine T.

CuO dissolution is sometimes incorrectly considered negligible at high pH, since complexation of Cu with dissolved organic matter may enhance nanoparticle dissolution. Therefore data on the effects of plant-microbial-soil interactions on nanoparticle dissolution, particularly in alkaline soils, are needed. Dissolution of CuO nanoparticles (100 mg kg(-1)Cu) was studied in sand supplemented with factorial combinations of wheat growth, a root-colonizing bacterium, and saturated paste extracts (SPEs) from three alkaline, calcareous soils. In control sand systems with 3.34 mM Ca(NO3)(2)solution, dissolved Cu was low (266 mu g L-1Cu). Addition of dissolved organic matterviawheat root metabolites and/or soil SPEs increased dissolved Cu to 795-6250 mu g L-1Cu. Dissolution was correlated with dissolved organic carbon (R= 0.916,p< 0.0001). Ligands >3 kDa, presumably fulvic acid from the SPEs, complexed Cu driving solubility; the addition of plant exudates further increased solubility 1.5-3.5x. The root-colonizing bacterium decreased dissolved Cu in sand pore waters from planted systems due to metabolism of root exudates. Batch solubility studies (10 mg L-1Cu) with the soil SPEs and defined solutions containing bicarbonate or fulvic acid confirmed elevated CuO nanoparticle solubility at >7.5 pH. Nanoparticle dissolution was suppressed in batch experiments compared to sand,viananoparticle organic matter coating or homoconjugation of dissolved organic matter. Alterations of CuO nanoparticles by soil organic matter, plant exudates, and bacteria will affect dissolution and bioavailability of the CuO nanoparticles in alkaline soils.","[Hortin, J.

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the 'Deep Skull,' controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present. A new chronostratigraphy has been developed through a re-investigation of the lithostratigraphy left by the earlier excavations, AMS-dating using three different comparative pre-treatments including ABOX of charcoal, and U-series using the Diffusion-Absorption model applied to fragments of bones from the Deep Skull itself. Stratigraphic reasons for earlier uncertainties about the antiquity of the skull are examined, and it is shown not to be an `intrusive' artifact. It was probably excavated from fluvial-pond-desiccation deposits that accumulated episodically in a shallow basin immediately behind the cave entrance lip, in a climate that ranged from times of comparative aridity with complete desiccation, to episodes of greater surface wetness, changes attributed to regional climatic fluctuations. Vegetation outside the cave varied significantly over time, including wet lowland forest, montane forest, savannah, and grassland. The new dates and the lithostratigraphy relate the Deep Skull to evidence of episodes of human activity that range in date from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Initial investigations of sediment scorching, pollen, palynomorphs, phytoliths, plant macrofossils, and starch grains recovered from existing exposures, and of vertebrates from the current and the earlier excavations, suggest that human foraging during these times was marked by habitat-tailored hunting technologies, the collection and processing of toxic plants for consumption, and, perhaps, the use of fire at some forest-edges. The Niah evidence demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the subsistence behavior developed by modern humans to exploit the tropical environments that they encountered in Southeast Asia, including rainforest.

A critical issue is to understand how net community production (NCP; the balance between gross primary production and community respiration) responds to changes and modulates air-sea CO2 fluxes. Using data collected as part of the ArcticNet-Malina 2009 expedition in the southeastern Beaufort Sea (Arctic Ocean), we synthesize information on sea ice, wind, river, water column properties, metabolism of the planktonic food web, organic carbon fluxes and pools, as well as air-sea CO2 exchange, with the aim of documenting the ecosystem response to environmental changes. Data were analyzed to develop a non-steady-state carbon budget and an assessment of NCP against air-sea CO2 fluxes. During the field campaign, the mean wind field was a mild upwelling-favorable wind (similar to 5 km h(-1)) from the NE. A decaying ice cover (<80% concentration) was observed beyond the shelf, the latter being fully exposed to the atmosphere. We detected some areas where the surface mixed layer was net autotrophic owing to high rates of primary production (PP), but the ecosystem was overall net heterotrophic. The region acted nonetheless as a sink for atmospheric CO2, with an uptake rate of -2.0 +/- 3.3 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation associated with spatial variability). We attribute this discrepancy to (1) elevated PP rates (>600 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) over the shelf prior to our survey, (2) freshwater dilution by river runoff and ice melt, and (3) the presence of cold surface waters offshore. Only the Mackenzie River delta and localized shelf areas directly affected by upwelling were identified as substantial sources of CO2 to the atmosphere (>10 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). Daily PP rates were generally < 100 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and cumulated to a total PP of similar to 437.6 x 10(3) t C for the region over a 35-day period. This amount was about twice the organic carbon delivery by river inputs (similar to 241.2 x 10(3) t C). Subsurface PP represented 37.4% of total PP for the whole area and as much as similar to 72.0% seaward of the shelf break. In the upper 100 m, bacteria dominated (54 %) total community respiration (similar to 250 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), whereas protozoans, metazoans, and benthos, contributed to 24, 10, and 12 %, respectively. The range of production-to-biomass ratios of bacteria was wide (1-27% d(-1)), while we estimated a narrower range for protozoans (6-11% d(-1)) and metazoans (1-3% d(-1)). Over the shelf, benthic biomass was twofold (similar to 5.9 g Cm-2) the biomass of pelagic heterotrophs (similar to 2.4 g Cm-2), in accord with high vertical carbon fluxes on the shelf (956 +/- 129 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Threshold PP (PP at which NCP becomes positive) in the surface layer oscillated from 20 to 152 mg C m(-2) d(-1), with a pattern from low-to-high values as the distance from the Mackenzie River decreased. We conclude that (1) climate change is exacerbating the already extreme biological gradient across the Beaufort shelf-basin system; (2) the Mackenzie Shelf acts as a weak sink for atmospheric CO2, suggesting that PP might exceed the respiration of terrigenous and marine organic matter in the surface layer; and (3) shelf break upwelling can transfer CO2 to the atmosphere, but CO2 outgassing can be attenuated if nutrients brought also by upwelling support diatom production. Our study underscores that cross-shelf exchange of waters, nutrients and particles is a key mechanism that needs to be properly monitored as the Arctic transits to a new state.","[Forest, A.; Coupel, P.; Fortier, L.; Tremblay, J. -E; Babin, M.] Univ Laval, Takuvik Joint Int Lab, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Forest, A.; Coupel, P.; Fortier, L.; Tremblay, J. -E; Babin, M.] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Forest, A.; Coupel, P.; Fortier, L.; Tremblay, J. -E; Babin, M.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol & Quebec Ocean, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Else, B.; Papakyriakou, T.] Univ Manitoba, Ctr Earth Observat Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Nahavandian, S.; Gratton, Y.] Inst Natl Rech Sci Eau Terre Environm, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada; [Lansard, B.] Univ Versailles St Quentin, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, CNRS, IPSL,CEA, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Raimbault, P.] Aix Marseille Univ, UMR7294, CNRS, MIO,INSU,IRD,UMR235, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Raimbault, P.] Univ Toulon & Var MIO, F-83957 La Garde, France; [Babin, M.] Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, F-06238 Villefranche Sur Mer, France",Laval University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Laval University; University of Manitoba; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Forest, A (corresponding author), Golder Associates, 200-1170 Boul Lebourgneuf, Quebec City, PQ G2K 2E3, Canada.",alexandre_forest@golder.com,,"Forest, Alexandre/0000-0001-9002-947X; Babin, Marcel/0000-0001-9233-2253",ANR (Agence nationale de la recherche); INSU-CNRS (Institut national des sciences de l'univers-Centre national de la recherche scientifique); CNES (Centre national d'etudes spatiales); ESA (European Space Agency); ArcticNet (a Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada),ANR (Agence nationale de la recherche)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); INSU-CNRS (Institut national des sciences de l'univers-Centre national de la recherche scientifique)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); CNES (Centre national d'etudes spatiales)(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales); ESA (European Space Agency)(European Space Agency); ArcticNet (a Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada),"This work was supported in the field by the officers and crew members of the CCGS Amundsen.

Consequently, interactions of CuO NPs with soil pore water (SPW) components, plants, and microbes must be understood. These experiments examined whether dissolved natural organic matter (DNOM) from SPW, or root/bacterial exudates, changed wheat (Triticum aestivum L. v. Deloris) responses to 100 mg kg(-1) (Cu/sand) as CuO NPs. Seedlings were grown in sand with 3.34 mM Ca(NO3)(2) or one of three SPWs, differing in DNOM concentration and composition. At 10 days post-germination, CuO NPs stunted roots by 59% in the 3.34 mM Ca(NO3)(2) and 26-35% in the three SPWs compared to plants grown without NPs. Malate, citrate, gluconate, and 2 '-deoxymugineic acid (DMA), were elevated 1.3 to 5-fold in the rhizosphere with CuO NPs present. Cu was bioavailable through metallo-organic complexes, including Cu-DMA and Cu-gluconate. Fulvic acid in SPWs mitigated CuO NP-induced wheat root shortening. Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 eliminated malate and citrate in the rhizospheres, reduced rhizosphere dissolved Cu similar to 18-66%, and reduced root Cu 39% across all SPWs while enhancing root stunting similar to 17% more across all SPWs than non-inoculated wheat grown with CuO NPs. Thus, both SPW components and root microbial colonization influenced wheat responses to CuO NPs. These interactions are likely in agricultural soils with additional processes, such as ion sorption, to influence CuO NP phytotoxicity, highlighting the importance of considering not just the target plant, but soil properties and associated microbiomes when evaluating impacts of NPs in agricultural usage.","[Hortin, J.

Since the deployment of 5G in many countries (i.e., 3.3-3.6 GHz), FSS is not the exclusive system in the C-Band anymore. In order to minimize the detrimental interference for the FSS to allowable levels, regional exclusion zones of maximum radiated power in 5G base stations (BS) are proposed and evaluated. In this paper, a measurement campaign has been carried out, and an analysis of the interference has been studied. A filtering model, namely Filter to Remove Broadband Interference 5G (FIREBRING), is proposed and analyzed concerning the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N). Moreover, this paper focuses on the evaluation of the 5G interference into the FSS. The proposed solution deployed an Low-Noise Block (LNB) with a band frequency of 3.7 to 4.2 GHz to test the satellite down-conversion signal at the receiver. The paper offered a complete analysis of the 5G signal, taking into account the implications of out-of-band emissions, potentially LNB saturation into FSS receiver, and the repercussions of the deployment of the 5G BS active antenna systems. With the LNB and down-converter in place, it can be found that the signal interference between 1.450 GHz and 1.550 GHz, is nearly 18 dB.","[Al-Jumaily, Abdulmajeed; Sali, Aduwati; Ismail, Alyani] Univ Putra Malaysia, Comp & Commun Syst Engn Dept, WiPNET, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Gil Jimenez, Vctor P.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Perez Fontan, Fernando] Univ Vigo, Signal Theory & Commun Dept, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain; [Singh, Mandeep Jit] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Space Sci Ctr ANGKASA, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Al-Maatouk, Qusay] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Digital Technol & Art, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England; [Al-Saegh, Ali M.] Al Mamoon Univ Coll, Dept Comp Technol Engn & Commun Engn, Baghdad 10001, Iraq; [Al-Jumeily, Dhiya] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Artificial Intelligence, Liverpool L3 5UX, Merseyside, England",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidade de Vigo; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Staffordshire University; Liverpool John Moores University,"Al-Jumaily, A (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Comp & Commun Syst Engn Dept, WiPNET, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",eng.majeed75@gmail.com; aduwati@upm.edu.my; vgil@ing.uc3m.es; fpfontan@uvigo.es; mandeep@ukm.edu.my; alyani@upm.edu.my; qusay.almaatouk@staffs.ac.uk; ali.alsaegh84@gmail.com; d.aljumeily@ljmu.ac.uk,"Mohammed, Ali/I-7532-2015; Al-Jumaily, Abdulmajeed/AAU-2478-2021; Al-Jumaily, Abdulmajeed/L-6204-2017; Al-Maatouk, Qusay/K-5516-2019","Mohammed, Ali/0000-0001-8095-5293; Al-Jumaily, Abdulmajeed/0000-0001-7777-6075; Al-Jumaily, Abdulmajeed/0000-0001-7777-6075; Sali, Aduwati/0000-0002-1692-6516; GIL JIMENEZ, VICTOR PEDRO/0000-0001-7029-1710; Al-Jumeily OBE, Professor Dhiya/0000-0002-9170-0568; Al-Maatouk, Qusay/0000-0003-4654-9464; Perez Fontan, Fernando/0000-0002-0783-7562","BIDANET: Parametric Big Data Analytics over Wireless Networks [UPM.RMC.800-3/3/1/GPB/2021/9696300, 9696300]; IGNITE -Interference Modeling for 5G and FSS Coexistence at mmWave with Climate Change Considerations in the Tropical Region [FRGS/1/2021/TK0/UPM/01/1]; IRENE (MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE) [PID2020-115323RB-C33]; MFOC, Madrid Flight on Chip Innovation Cooperative Projects Comunidad of Madrid - HUBS 2018/Madrid Flight on Chip","BIDANET: Parametric Big Data Analytics over Wireless Networks; IGNITE -Interference Modeling for 5G and FSS Coexistence at mmWave with Climate Change Considerations in the Tropical Region; IRENE (MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE); MFOC, Madrid Flight on Chip Innovation Cooperative Projects Comunidad of Madrid - HUBS 2018/Madrid Flight on Chip","This work was supported in part by the BIDANET: Parametric Big Data Analytics over Wireless Networks under Grants UPM.RMC.800-3/3/1/GPB/2021/9696300 and Vot No. 9696300, in part by IGNITE -Interference Modeling for 5G and FSS Coexistence at mmWave with Climate Change Considerations in the Tropical Region under Grant FRGS/1/2021/TK0/UPM/01/1 for the financial assistance in the measurement campaign, in part by IRENE under Grant PID2020-115323RB-C33 (MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE), and in part by MFOC, Madrid Flight on Chip Innovation Cooperative Projects Comunidad of Madrid -HUBS 2018/Madrid Flight on Chip.

Among these, low-frequency variations can substantially modify the performance of a wind power plant during its lifetime. In recent years, other temporal scales such as the short-term variability or the climatological conditions of wind and the corresponding generated power have been investigated in depth. However, the study of longer decadal and multidecadal variations is still in its early stages. In this work, the wind power output long-term variability is analysed for two locations in Spain, during the period 1871-2009. This is attained by computing the annual wind speed probability density functions derived from an ensemble of atmospheric sea level pressure data set through a statistical downscaling based in evolutionary algorithms. Results reveal significant trends and periodicities in multidecadal bands including 13, 25 and 46years, as well as significant differences among both sites. The impact of the leading large-scale circulation patterns (NAO, EA, SCAND and AMO) on wind power output and its stationarity is analysed. Results on both locations show non-stationary significant and opposite seasonal couplings with these forcings. Finally, the long-term variability of the reconstructed Weibull parameters of the annual wind speed distributions is used to derive a linear model to estimate the annual wind power.","[Kirchner-Bossi, N.; Garcia-Herrera, R.] UCM, Dept Phys Earth Astron & Astrophys 2, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Herrera, R.] CSIC UCM, IGEO, Inst Geociencias, Madrid, Spain; [Prieto, L.] Iberdrola Renovables Energia, Dept Energy Resource, Madrid, Spain; [Trigo, R.

Such objects are ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. They are often characterized by analyzing theoretically the results of laboratory, in situ, or remote-sensing measurements of the scattering of light and other electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic scattering and absorption by particles can also affect the energy budget of a discrete random medium and hence various ambient physical and chemical processes. In either case electromagnetic scattering must be modeled in terms of appropriate optical observables, i.e., quadratic or bilinear forms in the field that quantify the reading of a relevant optical instrument or the electromagnetic energy budget. It is generally believed that time harmonic Maxwell's equations can accurately describe elastic electromagnetic scattering by macroscopic particulate media that change in time much more slowly than the incident electromagnetic field. However, direct solutions of these equations for discrete random media had been impracticable until quite recently. This has led to a widespread use of various phenomenological approaches in situations when their very applicability can be questioned. Recently, however, a new branch of physical optics has emerged wherein electromagnetic scattering by discrete and discretely heterogeneous random media is modeled directly by using analytical or numerically exact computer solutions of the Maxwell equations. Therefore, the main objective of this Report is to formulate the general theoretical framework of electromagnetic scattering by discrete random media rooted in the Maxwell Lorentz electromagnetics and discuss its immediate analytical and numerical consequences. Starting from the microscopic Maxwell Lorentz equations, we trace the development of the first-principles formalism enabling accurate calculations of monochromatic and quasi-monochromatic scattering by static and randomly varying multiparticle groups. We illustrate how this general framework can be coupled with state-of-the-art computer solvers of the Maxwell equations and applied to direct modeling of electromagnetic scattering by representative random multi-particle groups with arbitrary packing densities. This first-principles modeling yields general physical insights unavailable with phenomenological approaches. We discuss how the first-order-scattering approximation, the radiative transfer theory, and the theory of weak localization of electromagnetic waves can be derived as immediate corollaries of the Maxwell equations for very specific and well-defined kinds of particulate medium. These recent developments confirm the mesoscopic origin of the radiative transfer, weak localization, and effective medium regimes and help evaluate the numerical accuracy of widely used approximate modeling methodologies.

These strong inflows are known to be forced by persistent westerly wind conditions. In this study, MBIs are considered as subset of LVCs transporting with the large water volume a big amount of highly saline and oxygenated water into the Baltic Sea. Since the early 1980s the frequency of MBIs has dropped drastically from 5 to 7 events to only one inflow per decade, and long lasting periods without MBIs became the usual state. Only in January 1993,2003 and December 2014 MBIs,occurred that were able to interrupt the stagnation periods in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea. However, in spite of the decreasing frequency of MBIs, there is no obvious decrease of LVCs. The Landsort sea level is known to reflect the mean sea level of the Baltic Sea very well, and hence LVCs have been calculated for the period 1887-2015 filtering daily time series of Landsort sea surface elevation anomalies. The cases with local minimum and maximum difference resulting in at least 60 km(3) of water volume change excluding the volume change due to runoff have been chosen for a closer study (1948-2013) of characteristic pathways of deep cyclones. The average duration of LVCs is about 40 days. During this time, 5-6 deep cyclones move along characteristic storm tracks. Furthermore, MBIs are characterized by even higher cyclonic activity compared to average LVCs. We obtained four main routes of deep cyclones which were associated with LVCs, but also with the climatology. One is approaching from the west at about 56-60 degrees N, passing the northern North Sea, northern Denmark, Sweden and the Island of Gotland. A second broad corridor of frequent cyclone pathways enters the study area north of Scotland between 60 and 66 degrees N turning north-eastwards along the northern coast of Scandinavia. This branch bifurcates into smaller routes. One at about 62 degrees N passing Oslo, southern Sweden and entering the central Baltic Sea, and another less frequent one at about 65 degrees N, crossing Scandinavia south-eastwards passing the Sea of Bothnia and entering Finland. The conditions for LVCs to happen are temporal clustering of deep cyclones in certain trajectory corridors. We also found an increasing linear trend of the number of deep cyclones for the period 1950-2010. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Number concentrations of submicrometer aerosol particles and trace gas mixing ratios derived by the CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) measurement system on flights between Germany and South-East Asia were used for this analysis. Four cluster analysis methods were applied to a test data set and their capability of separating the data points into scientifically reasonable clusters was assessed. The best method was applied to seasonal data subsets for summer and winter resulting in five cluster or air mass types: stratosphere, tropopause, free troposphere, high clouds, and boundary layer influenced. Other source clusters, like aircraft emissions could not be resolved in the present data set with the used methods. While the cluster separation works satisfactory well for the summer data, in winter interpretation is more difficult, which is attributed to either different vertical transport pathways or different chemical lifetimes in both seasons. The geographical distribution of the clusters together with histograms for nucleation and Aitken mode particles within each cluster are presented. Aitken mode particle number concentrations show a clear vertical gradient with the lowest values in the lowermost stratosphere (750-2820 particles/cm(3) STP, minimum of the two 25% - and maximum of the two 75%-percentiles of both seasons) and the highest values for the boundary-layer-influenced air (4290-22 760 particles/cm(3) STP). Nucleation mode particles are also highest in the boundary-layer-influenced air (1260-29 500 particles/cm(3) STP), but are lowest in the free troposphere (0-450 particles/cm(3) STP). The given submicrometer particle number concentrations represent the first large-scale seasonal data sets for the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere over the Eurasian continent.","[Koeppe, M.; Hermann, M.; Heintzenberg, J.; Wiedensohler, A.] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Brenninkmeijer, C.

Management practices have largely been developed and implemented by experts using technical means based on designing systems that can be predicted and controlled. In recent years, stakeholder involvement has gained increasing importance. Collaborative governance is considered to be more appropriate for integrated and adaptive management regimes needed to cope with the complexity of social-ecological systems. The paper presents a concept for social learning and collaborative governance developed in the European project HarmoniCOP ( Harmonizing COllaborative Planning). The concept is rooted in the more interpretive strands of the social sciences emphasizing the context dependence of knowledge. The role of frames and boundary management in processes of learning at different levels and time scales is investigated. The foundation of social learning as investigated in the HarmoniCOP project is multiparty collaboration processes that are perceived to be the nuclei of learning processes. Such processes take place in networks or communities of practice and are influenced by the governance structure in which they are embedded. Requirements for social learning include institutional settings that guarantee some degree of stability and certainty without being rigid and inflexible. Our analyses, which are based on conceptual considerations and empirical insights, suggest that the development of such institutional settings involves continued processes of social learning. In these processes, stakeholders at different scales are connected in flexible networks that allow them to develop the capacity and trust they need to collaborate in a wide range of formal and informal relationships ranging from formal legal structures and contracts to informal, voluntary agreements.","[Pahl-Wostl, Claudia] Univ Osnabruck, D-4500 Osnabruck, Germany; [Craps, Marc; Dewulf, Art; Taillieu, Tharsi] Katholieke Univ, Princeton, NJ USA; [Mostert, Erik] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2600 AA Delft, Netherlands; [Tabara, David] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University Osnabruck; Delft University of Technology; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Pahl-Wostl, C (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, D-4500 Osnabruck, Germany.",,"Mostert, Erik/L-2711-2014; Craps, Marc/AAA-6223-2020; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020","Mostert, Erik/0000-0002-9546-0522; Craps, Marc/0000-0001-6835-5287; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644",,,,,70,352,355,3,219,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

However, unprecedented global warming presents fundamental alterations to the ecological functions (e.g., carbon uptake) and biophysical variables (e.g., leaf area index) of forests. The quantification of forest carbon uptake, gross primary productivity (GPP), as the largest carbon flux has a direct consequence on carbon budget estimations. Part of this assimilated carbon stored in leaf biomass is related to the leaf area index (LAI), which is closely linked to and is of critical significance in the water cycle. There already exist a number of models to simulate dynamics of LAI and GPP; however, the level of complexity, demanding data, and poorly known parameters often prohibit the model applicability over data-sparse and large domains. In addition, the complex mechanisms associated with coupling the terrestrial carbon and water cycles poses a major challenge for integrated assessments of interlinked processes (e.g., accounting for the temporal dynamics of LAI for improving water balance estimations and soil moisture availability for enhancing carbon balance estimations). In this study, we propose a parsimonious forest canopy model (PCM) to predict the daily dynamics of LAI and GPP with few required inputs, which would also be suitable for integration into state-of-the-art hydrologic models. The light use efficiency (LUE) concept, coupled with a phenology submodel, is central to PCM (v1.0). PCM estimates total assimilated carbon based on the efficiency of the conversion of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation into biomass. Equipped with the coupled phenology submodel, the total assimilated carbon partly converts to leaf biomass, from which prognostic and temperature-driven LAI is simulated. The model combines modules for the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters based on pedotransfer functions and vertically weighted soil moisture, considering the underground root distribution, when soil moisture data are available. We test the model on deciduous broad-leaved forest sites in Europe and North America, as selected from the FLUXNET network. We analyze the model's parameter sensitivity on the resulting GPP and LAI and identified, on average, 10 common sensitive parameters at each study site (e.g., LUE and SLA). The model's performance is evaluated in a validation period, using in situ measurements of GPP and LAI (when available) at eddy covariance flux towers. The model adequately captures the daily dynamics of observed GPP and LAI at each study site (Kling-Gupta efficiency, KGE, varies between 0.79 and 0.92). Finally, we investigate the cross-location transferability of model parameters and derive a compromise parameter set to be used across different sites. The model also showed robustness with the compromise single set of parameters, applicable to different sites, with an acceptable loss in model skill (on average +/- 8 %). Overall, in addition to the satisfactory performance of the PCM as a stand-alone canopy model, the parsimonious and modular structure of the developed PCM allows for a smooth incorporation of carbon modules to existing hydrologic models, thereby facilitating the seamless representation of coupled water and carbon cycle components, i.e., prognostic simulated vegetation leaf area index (LAI) would improve the representation of the water cycle components (i.e., evapotranspiration), while GPP predictions would benefit from the simulated soil water storage from a hydrologic model.","[Bahrami, Bahar; Hildebrandt, Anke; Thober, Stephan; Rebmann, Corinna; Samaniego, Luis; Rakovec, Oldrich; Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany; [Hildebrandt, Anke] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Geosci, Terr Ecohydrol, Burgweg 11, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Fischer, Rico] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Leipzig, Germany; [Rakovec, Oldrich] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague 16500, Czech Republic",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bahrami, B (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany.",bahareh.bahrami@ufz.de,"Rakovec, Oldrich/N-5512-2015; Samaniego, Luis/G-8651-2011; Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013","Rakovec, Oldrich/0000-0003-2451-3305; Samaniego, Luis/0000-0002-8449-4428; Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037; Rebmann, Corinna/0000-0002-8665-0375; Fischer, Rico/0000-0002-0482-0095; Hildebrandt, Anke/0000-0001-8643-1634; Bahrami, Bahar/0000-0002-8744-2754",,,,,146,0,0,2,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Located on the coastal strip of some 20 km width along the Mediterranean coast of modern northwestern Egypt covering the north-eastern part of the region known in antiquity as Marmarica, the area receives winterly rainfalls of up to 140 mm. Further south, precipitation decreases quickly and desert conditions become more pronounced. Bedrocks are predominantly calcareous, soils are loamy, stony, calcareous, and shallow, except in relief sinks with sedimentary deposits. The land rises from the coast up to 230 ma.s.l. on the Marmarica Plateau in a sequence of zonal northsloping plains and scarps the northern parts of which are dissected and drained by wadis. Agriculturally suitable areas comprise some 9% of the coastal zone and adjacent tablelands. Overland flow controls the discharge dynamics and is the main source of wadi runoff and hence agricultural water supply. The land use pattern is scattered because cropping areas depend mainly on suitability of soils and the generation of runoff harvest, which are closely interrelated because of the arid water and sediment regime. The patchiness of runoff generation increases further south where aridity is higher and topography inhibits greater drainage patterns. The abundance of cisterns, many of them originally Greco-Roman, is strong evidence that tableland overland flows occur and are frequently disconnected from larger drainage systems. Abandoned ancient rainwater harvesting and watershed management systems are abundant all over the region and incorporate the hydrological experience of the former inhabitants, having been dated with OSL and pottery mainly from Greco-Roman times. While the region prospered some two millenia ago, the ancient water management schemes are generally abandoned today. One of the most outstanding features of the ancient systems was the systematic harvesting of tableland and valley slope overland flow above the wadi beds. Part of this strategy was to separate the remote parts of large natural watersheds from the local parts by shallow stone bunds on the tableland. The collected tableland overland flow irrigated terraced fields on the tableland (lairum). The remaining water harvesting areas, mainly valley slopes, were obviously sufficient to supply water for small tributary wadis, large side terraces and the floodplains of large wadis. The artificial disconnection of local runoff areas from remote parts of the northern watersheds is hydrologically well adapted to the runoff dynamics in the flat landscape of the northern Marmarica because it protected valleys from low frequency high magnitude runoff events which are generated mainly on the remote parts of large catchments but which are inefficient in terms of water harvesting. Terracing and water harvesting structures are frequently buried in well-sorted, fine-grained sediment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

From this point of view, these new tools are now essential in monitoring operations for vegetation and non-renewable resources, especially in developing countries. In today's literature a series of 262 spectral indices are defined to evaluate the vegetation health for a specific area. For the vast majority of these infrared spectral index values are included. Infrared recording devices are quite expensive. In this respect, the possibility of using only the visible domain should be experienced in order to reduce the operational costs. The main hypothesis comes from the fact that any changes in vegetation status cannot be reduced and described only by the infrared domain changes. This study presents the results of a general aim: to design, to investigate and to confirm a specific analysis method that uses only the visible RGB spectra by using historical recordings. With this main objective of getting a method with a minimal operational cost, in this regard a combination of two classical techniques was tested - satellite image monitor analysis and UAV high resolution images use. The further exposed method in this paper suggests the joining of the two monitoring methods in successive phases: in the first step resolution suitable satellite images were used in order to succeed in building a forest model.

A multivariate regression analysis showed the presence of statistically significant negative trends of NDVI (low vegetation activity) in the coverage of mangrove forest, mangrove forest with pickleweed, and pickleweed; however, we did not found any meteorological variable (built time series of average minimum and maximum temperatures, and of accumulated rainfall) that controlled the observed trends. A pixel-by-pixel spatially distributed analysis of the temporal trends of NDVI, complemented by digitalization through photo interpretation of the shrimp farms present in the study area, showed a spatial relationship between the zones of greatest loss of vegetation activity (1990-2010) and the areas with greater proliferation of shrimp farms in the study area. Our study demonstrated the applicability of NDVI for the environmental assessment of mangroves. The relationship between changes in remote sensing indices and environmental variables allows for an efficient evaluation of the main environmental impacts, which can be used for coastal planning and management.

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis are conducted on 118 potsherds that date to the late Yangshao culture (5500-4900 a BP), early Majiayao culture (5300-4800 a BP) and Qijia culture (4400-3600 a BP). The fragments were gathered from 66 archeological sites in Gansu and Qinghai regions, northwest China. The composition of Red Clay and loess from Gansu and Qinghai provinces is examined and compared with that of pottery clay. Our result shows that during the late Yangshao and early Majiayao periods, most potsherds were made from local clay which contains distinct regional elemental signals. During the Qijia period, on the other hand, there is little difference in the elemental composition of pots found in different regions. Those results suggest that during the Qijia period, communities living in Gansu and Qinghai exchanged ceramics or clay to make those pieces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We conduct a meta-analysis of recent review papers on resilience from all relevant fields to distill key themes emanating from both research and practice. These themes reflect prevalent debates, trends and insights from the thousands of underlying papers. The seven themes are: 1) the distinction between resilience as a system trait, process, or outcome; 2) the importance of resilience as a strategy for dealing with uncertainty; 3) a shift from understanding resilience to active resilience building; 4) the incorporation of transformation into resilience; 5) the increasingly normative interpretation of resilience; 6) the growing emphasis on measuring and evaluating resilience; and 7) the mounting critiques of the resilience agenda demanding attention. We discuss each in detail and find that they help explain both why resilience has attracted widespread attention, but also why it is an increasingly contested concept. We offer several steps to engage in productive dialogue across differences in resilience interpretations and conclude that this interand transdisciplinary dialogue is the difficult and necessary work that must be done, if resilience scholarship and practice is to advance in productive ways in the future.","[Moser, Susanne] Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Hadley, MA 01035 USA; [Meerow, Sara] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Arnott, James; Jack-Scott, Emily] Aspen Global Change Inst, Basalt, CO USA; [Arnott, James] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Moser, S (corresponding author), Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Hadley, MA 01035 USA.",promundi@susannemoser.com,"Meerow, Sara/J-8037-2019; Arnott, James/O-1029-2015","Moser, Susanne/0000-0001-6375-895X; Arnott, James/0000-0003-3989-6724; Meerow, Sara/0000-0002-6935-1832",,,,,71,45,46,12,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We evaluate the applicability of general models, emphasize social circumstances and particularities, and highlight the importance of differing spatiotemporal scales from interregional perspectives that address millennia-long changes across continents to local choices during human lifetimes. We consider why agriculture appears so much later than it does throughout the eastern Mediterranean and argue that the traditionally rigid distinction between the origins and spread of agriculture oversimplifies transitions along the southern Red Sea in which agriculture in some ways diffused to, and in other ways, uniquely originated in Southwest Arabia and the Horn of Africa.

In most cases, humor is used by educators while students act as consumers. However, this does not exploit the full potential of humor for environmental education. This article shows how humor can be applied as a distinct learning method and what outcomes and effects can be achieved. Our method draws on approaches from comedy-writing schools, thus bridging this community of practice to environmental education. It provides students with an understanding of the basics of humor, empowers them with practices to develop their own humorous texts, and guides them towards high-quality comedy scripts. We implemented several master courses at the Vienna University of Economics and Business based on this method. In 2021, we assessed the effects on students' sustainability knowingness, attitudes, and behavior and analyzed qualitative outcomes. It was revealed that humor can play a pivotal role in environmental education as it fosters critical thinking and creativity, helps students cope with emotionally difficult topics, and supports them in becoming agents of change.","[Spoerk, Angelo; Martinuzzi, Andre; Findler, Florian; Vogel-Poeschl, Heike] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Managing Sustainabil, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Spork, A (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Managing Sustainabil, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",angelo.spoerk@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,84,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

The combination of those aspects can upgrade the indoor conditions leading to the creation ofan appealing workspace where the well fair of the occupants is established. In this line of approach, an integrated evaluation of the indoor environmental parameters was conducted in office buildings, located in Thessaloniki, Greece, based on the occupants' comfort sensation. Main goal of the study is the determination of the existing correlations between the perceived comfort sensation and a variety of environmental parameters considered in building rating certification schemes. Those correlations can outline the weight of every aspect based on the occupants' view and also help the policy makers to accomplish the vision of an environmental sustainable, not only concerning the energy consumption but also the occupants, building.","[Antoniadou, Panagiota; Giama, Effrosyni; Papadopoulos, Agis M.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Antoniadou, P (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Thessaloniki, Greece.",pantoniadou@auth.gr,"Papadopoulos, Agis/AAO-3274-2021; Papadopoulos, Agis/AAG-5174-2020; GammaIotaAlphaMuAlpha, EpsilonUpsilonPhiRhoOmicronSigmaUpsilonNuEta/AAO-3254-2021","Papadopoulos, Agis/0000-0002-4470-8903; ",RESEARCH PROJECT FOR EXCELLENCE IKY/SIEMENS; IKY/State Scholarships Foundation,RESEARCH PROJECT FOR EXCELLENCE IKY/SIEMENS; IKY/State Scholarships Foundation,"The survey and the study are carried out within the framework of the research project Identification and Evaluation of the perceived level of comfort in office buildings using hybrid, personalized models.

An enhanced modeling and forecasting of these extremes, which can provide a tangible basis for flood early warning procedures and mitigation measures over the Mediterranean, is one of the fundamental motivations of the international Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) program. The predictability bounds set by multiple sources of hydrological and meteorological uncertainty require their explicit representation in hydrometeorological forecasting systems. By including local convective precipitation systems, short-range ensemble prediction systems (SREPSs) provide a state-of-the-art framework to generate quantitative discharge forecasts and to cope with different sources of external-scale (i.e., external to the hydrological system) uncertainties. The performance of three distinct hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPSs) for the small-sized Serpis River basin is examined as a support tool for early warning and mitigation strategies. To this end, the Flash-Flood Event-Based Spatially Distributed Rainfall-Runoff Transformation-Water Balance (FEST-WB) model is driven by ground stations to examine the hydrological response of this semiarid and karstic catchment to heavy rains. The use of a multisite and novel calibration approach for the FEST-WB parameters is necessary to cope with the high nonlinearities emerging from the rainfall-runoff transformation and heterogeneities in the basin response. After calibration, FEST-WB reproduces with remarkable accuracy the hydrological response to intense precipitation and, in particular, the 12 October 2007 flash flood. Next, the flood predictability challenge is focused on quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs). In this regard, three SREPS generation strategies using the WRF Model are analyzed. On the one side, two SREPSs accounting for 1) uncertainties in the initial conditions (ICs) and lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) and 2) physical parameterizations are evaluated. An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is also designed to test the ability of ensemble data assimilation methods to represent key mesoscale uncertainties from both IC and subscale processes. Results indicate that accounting for diversity in the physical parameterization schemes provides the best probabilistic high-resolution QPFs for this particular flash flood event. For low to moderate precipitation rates, EnKF and pure multiple physics approaches render un-distinguishable accuracy for the test situation at larger scales. However, only the multiple physics QPFs properly drive the HEPS to render the most accurate flood warning signals. That is, extreme precipitation values produced by these convective-scale precipitation systems anchored by complex orography are better forecast when accounting just for uncertainties in the physical parameterizations. These findings contribute to the identification of ensemble strategies better targeted to the most relevant sources of uncertainty before flash flood situations over small catchments.","[Amengual, A.; Carrio, D.

Measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) columns from the GOME and MOPITT satellite instruments, respectively, are used in conjunction with the GEOS-CHEM global model of transport and tropospheric chemistry to identify the major events of long range transport that reach Europe over the course of summer 2000. Sensitivity model simulations are used to analyse observed O-3 distributions with respect to the impact of long range transport events. For that purpose, we used in- situ O-3 observations taken at the mountain site of Jungfraujoch as well as O-3 vertical profiles taken in the vicinity of central European cities. Over the course of summer 2000, we identified 9 major episodes of transatlantic pollution transport; 7 events are associated with transient cyclones while 2 events occur through zonal transport ( e. g. by advection in the strong low-level westerly winds established in summer between the Azores anticyclone and transient cyclones). We find that on average three episodes occur per month with the strongest ones being in June. The number and frequency of long range transport events that reach Europe are driven by the position and strength of the Azores anticyclone. Model sensitivity simulations indicate that the summer mean North American O-3 contribution ranges from 3 to 5 ppb ( 7 - 11%) in the planetary boundary layer and 10 to 13 ppb ( 18 - 23%) in the middle and upper troposphere. During particular episodes, North American sources can result in O3 enhancements up to 25 - 28 ppb in the layer between 800 - 600 hPa and 10 - 12 ppb in the boundary layer. The impact of the zonal transport events on O-3 distribution over Europe is more clearly seen below 700 hPa as they tend to transport pollution at lower levels while the events associated with transient cyclones are more likely to have an impact on the middle and upper troposphere (i.e. above 600 hPa). The air mass origins found in the GEOS-CHEM model are clearly confirmed by back trajectory analyses. During most of the 9 events, a strong contribution in North American O-3 is in general associated with only little European O-3 and vice-versa ( in particular at the Jungfraujoch). A substantial North American contribution (e.g., 30% or higher) to O-3 over Europe does not always result in pronounced O-3 enhancements in the observations during our period of study.","Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Modelisat Chim Atmospher, Lausanne, Switzerland; Observ Midi Pyrenees, Lab Aerol, F-31400 Toulouse, France; Dalhousie Univ, Dept Phys & Atmospher Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada; Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Dalhousie University; Harvard University; Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; Smithsonian Institution; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Guerova, G (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Modelisat Chim Atmospher, Lausanne, Switzerland.",guergana.guerova@epfl.ch,"Guerova, Guergana/D-1943-2013; Martin, Randall/A-2051-2008; Martin, Randall/C-1205-2014","Guerova, Guergana/0000-0001-5638-3387; Martin, Randall/0000-0003-2632-8402; Sprenger, Michael/0000-0002-9317-8822",,,,,40,42,42,0,13,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

The study focuses on low grade heat sources from a paper mill located on a British coastal area which presents a large quantity of recoverable waste heat at low temperature (< 100 degrees C). Two scenarios are considered: (i) low grade heat is used directly to feed the desalination process, (ii) low grade heat is upgraded using a heat pump coupled with a desalination system. In the first scenario, a Humidification Dehumidification process was identified as a suitable technology due to its low operating temperature. In the second scenario, the low grade heat temperature was upgraded using a hybrid absorption heat pump and subsequently used to feed a Multiple Effect Distillation desalination system. These two cases were compared in terms of performances and economics. For both cases, a payback period of less than 10 years could be obtained for water price equal to 2 per tonnes of water. This is comparable to the price of home water supply. Environmental aspects were also discussed from the results of a full Lifecycle assessment. Low grade heat utilisation in both cases reduced the Global Warming Potential in comparison with fossil fuel powered systems, but toxicological impacts appeared higher in comparison to a system using natural gas.

Increasing urban water demand and uncertain future climatic conditions in the Andes present major water governance challenges for the coastal regions of Peru. An understudied dimension of Peruvian water governance is how scale framing shapes the way problems are defined, and solutions are pursued. Here, we aim to strengthen the understanding of scale framing as it relates to highland-coastal interactions in central Peru between 2004 and 2015. By analysing this period of significant water governance reforms, we identify five prominent water-related frame dimensions and three differently scaled policy storylines and reveal how they developed and intersected over time. The storylines, supported by particular visualisations, either foreground 'urbanshed'-level investment in water supply infrastructure, community-level cultural restoration for improved local agricultural production, or nationwide watershed-level financial mechanisms for highland ecosystem conservation. Our study shows how the intersection of these storylines at different moments during the policy process often had a strengthening effect, creating a coalition of actors who were then able to generate sufficient momentum and support within the Peruvian government for the implementation of conservation-based watershed investments.","[Grainger, Sam; Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Grainger, Sam; Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Grainger, Sam] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hommes, Lena] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Karpouzoglou, Timos; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Karpouzoglou, Timos] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Stockholm, Sweden; [Perez, Katya] Consortium Sustainable Dev Andean Ecoreg CONDESAN, Lima, Peru",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of Leeds; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Royal Institute of Technology,"Grainger, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.grainger@leeds.ac.uk,"Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Karpouzoglou, Timos/P-6216-2015; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Karpouzoglou, Timos/0000-0001-9568-9813; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Grainger, Sam/0000-0003-0116-5758","NERC [NE/K010123/1, NE/K010239/1, NE/K010182/1] Funding Source: UKRI",NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,68,7,7,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

However, flood impacts on urban road connectivity are not yet well assessed due to inaccurate simulation of flood processes in urban areas where high-resolution data for drainage networks and gauged hydrological data are insufficient. Thus, this study assesses flood impacts on road network connectivity in an urban area of southern China through joint modeling of 1-D hydrodynamic processes in drainage networks and 2-D flood inundation processes on roads using MIKE Urban and MIKE 21. High-resolution DEM images of 5 m and a drainage network of 5635 pipelines were used for urban hydrological simulation. Flood depths were gauged for model calibration and validation by recruited volunteers in the context of citizen science. The results show that road network connectivity decreases as rainfall increases. More than 40% of road connectivity is lost in the study area when a 1-in-100-year return period rainfall occurs. The study results can help to inform more adaptive strategies for local flood control. The study methods are also applicable to improving urban hydrological modeling in broader regions.","[Zhou, Ruitao; Zheng, Hang; Liu, Yueyi; Wan, Wenhua] Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Civil Engn, Dongguan 523808, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Guanti] Dongguan Shigu Sewage Treatment Co Ltd, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China",Dongguan University of Technology,"Zheng, H (corresponding author), Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Civil Engn, Dongguan 523808, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhenghang00@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51909035, 52179009, U2040206]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51909035, 52179009 and U2040206).",,69,0,0,10,10,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,7-Oct,2022,1,,,,,,16866,10.1038/s41598-022-20882-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20882-5,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,5D7NM,36207408,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000865124900117,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data reveal a distinct upper tropospheric ozone maximum above eastern North America and centered over the southeastern USA. Recurring each year, the location and strength of the ozone maximum is influenced by the summertime upper tropospheric anticyclone that traps convectively lofted ozone, ozone precursors and lightning NOx above the southeastern USA. The North American summer monsoon that flows northward along the Rocky Mountains is embedded within the western side of the anticyclone and also marks the westernmost extent of the ozone maximum. Removing the influence from stratospheric intrusions, median ozone mixing ratios (78 ppbv) in the upper troposphere (> 6 km) above Alabama, near the center of the anticyclone, were nearly twice the level above the U. S. west coast. Simulations by an atmospheric chemistry general circulation model indicate lightning NOx emissions led to the production of 25-30 ppbv of ozone at 250 hPa above the southern United States during the study period. On the regional scale the ozone enhancement above the southeastern United States produced a positive all-sky adjusted radiative forcing up to 0.50 W m(-2).","[Cooper, O. R.; Trainer, M.; Oltmans, S.

It remains unclear, however, whether nascent pastoralism in Arabia focused on specialised cattle herding, intensive caprine husbandry, or more extensive forms of sheep, goat and cattle management. Here, the role of Bos in Neolithic animal exploitation systems in the Arabian Peninsula is re-examined in the context of fisher-hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting the coasts of the Arabian Gulf, agro-pastoralist settlements located in the Jordanian highlands, and hunter-herder communities in adjacent Jordanian steppe (badia). By the late sixth millennium BC, cattle from southern Mesopotamia were imported to the Arabian littoral via Ubaid exchange networks but remained a relatively unimportant part of local hunter-gatherer-herder subsistence for at least a millennium. New zooarchaeological evidence indicating cattle herding in the Jordanian highlands by the late eighth millennium BC suggests a southern transmission route originating out of Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlements and the subsequent spread of cattle along the Sarawat mountains into the interior or down the relatively arid Red Sea coast via land or boat. Cattle eventually played a central role in the symbolic and ritual lives of herders in southern Arabia, but the use of the term 'cattle pastoralism' to describe early Neolithic subsistence systems in the region is premature.","[Makarewicz, Cheryl A.] Univ Kiel, Inst Prehist & Protohist Archaeol, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Makarewicz, CA (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Prehist & Protohist Archaeol, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",c.makarewicz@ufg.uni-kiel.de,,,Kiel University,Kiel University,Kiel University,,62,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0905-7196,1600-0471,,ARAB ARCHAEOL EPIGR,Arab.

This presents opportunities and challenges for understanding the role of new technologies in sustainability research. This article focuses on a suite of technologies termed Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) developed for communicating observations and simulation of environmental processes. A strength of EVOs is that they are open and decentralised, thus democratising flow and ownership of information between multiple actors. However, EVOs are discussed rarely beyond their technical aspects. By evaluating the evolution of EVOs, we illustrate why it is timely to engage with policy and societal aspects as well. While first generation EVOs are primed for scientists, second generation EVOs can have broader implications for knowledge co-creation and resilience through their participatory design.","[Karpouzoglou, Timothy; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zulkafli, Zed; Grainger, Sam; Buytaert, Wouter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Zulkafli, Zed] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Grainger, Sam; Buytaert, Wouter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Hannah, David M.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Wageningen University & Research; Imperial College London; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Imperial College London; University of Birmingham,"Karpouzoglou, T (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",timothy.karpouzoglou@wur.nl,"Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Hannah, David M./B-9221-2015; Buytaert, Wouter/D-9912-2011; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Karpouzoglou, Timos/P-6216-2015; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Hannah, David M./0000-0003-1714-1240; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Karpouzoglou, Timos/0000-0001-9568-9813; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Grainger, Sam/0000-0003-0116-5758; Zulkafli, Zed/0000-0001-6271-8593","UK Research Council NERC/ESRC/DFID ESPA programme [NE-K010239-1]; UK NERC project [NE/I00200/1]; ESPA project [NE/I004017/1]; NERC [NE/K010204/1, NE/K010239/1, NE/K010123/1, NE/I004017/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K010204/1, NE/K010123/1, NE/K010239/1, NE/I004017/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Research Council NERC/ESRC/DFID ESPA programme; UK NERC project; ESPA project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge funding received from the UK Research Council NERC/ESRC/DFID ESPA programme (project NE-K010239-1, 'Adaptive governance of mountain ecosystem services for poverty alleviation enabled by environmental virtual observatories' Mountain-EVO).

We explore possible loess deposits in the Mure River Valley of western Romania, providing a regional signal of increased aridity during the mid-late Holocene. This proposed aridity may be responsible for the abandonment of Middle Bronze Age tell settlements along the major drainages of the eastern Carpathian Basin (Pannonian plain). This hypothesis centers on a proposed aeolian deposit (the Pecica deposit), a ca. 5080 cm thick, relatively homogeneous, gray layer blanketing the top of the Bronze Age tell of PecicaSanul Mare. Comparing the morphological, geochemical, and physical characteristics of this specific tell deposit with two representative profiles near the site containing glaciogenic calcareous loess and potential Holocene loess deposits developed in Chernozems, we find significant similarities to support this hypothesis. We then review various forms of proxy data published from elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe suggesting a warming trend during this period. The temporal placement of the Pecica deposit is bracketed using diagnostic artifacts, radiocarbon dates, and the degree of soil development, suggesting a period of increased aridity likely occurring soon after the 17th century B.C.

These consequences include high fertilizer production energy demand, on-field greenhouse gas emissions, and eutrophication. Additionally, inefficient fertilizer use is responsible for billions of dollars in annual economic losses in the form of resource loss as well as environmental burdens, Furthermore, the unsustainability of current fertilization practices and the reliance upon finite resources calls into question the ability of agriculture to meet projected increases in global demand. Herein, critical fertilizer system inefficiencies are highlighted and quantified with a new proposed metric, atom conversion efficiency (ACE), which captures inefficiencies of primary nutrient atoms (N and P) at each stage of the fertilizer life cycle, from synthesis to farm gate, for the model crop, corn. Conversion efficiencies for the most common forms of N and P used in conventional fertilizers range from 5% (diammonium phosphate) to 10% (ammonium nitrate). These low system efficiency values motivate advancements in agriculture sustainability through (i) improvements in the conversion of the raw forms of N and P into fertilizers, (ii) enhancement of nutrient use efficiency (NUE), and (iii) nutrient form selection, signaling an opportunity for advancement through innovative technologies.","[Urso, Joshua H.; Gilbertson, Leanne M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3700 OHara St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Gilbertson, LM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3700 OHara St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",leanne.gilbertson@pitt.edu,,"Gilbertson, Leanne M/0000-0003-3396-4204",Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the Swanson School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh,Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the Swanson School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh,The authors acknowledge the generous funding support from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the Swanson School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and Sarah Urso for creation of the TOC and abstract art.,,125,23,23,1,44,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Recently, specialists have suggested that the ideal research design involving aDNA would include multiple independent lines of evidence. In this paper, we adopt a transdisciplinary approach integrating aDNA with archaeological, biogeochemical, and historical data to investigate six individuals found in two cemeteries that date to the Late Horizon (1400 to 1532 CE) and Colonial (1532 to 1825 CE) periods in the Chincha Valley of southern Peru. Genomic analyses indicate that these individuals are genetically most similar to ancient and present-day populations from the north Peruvian coast located several hundred kilometers away. These genomic data are consistent with 16th century written records as well as ceramic, textile, and isotopic data. These results provide some of the strongest evidence yet of state-sponsored resettlement in the pre-Colonial Andes. This study highlights the power of transdisciplinary research designs when using aDNA data and sets a methodological standard for investigating ancient mobility in complex societies.","[Bongers, Jacob L.] Univ East Anglia, Sainsbury Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Bongers, Jacob L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Cotsen Inst Archaeol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Nakatsuka, Nathan] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [O'Shea, Colleen] Fine Arts Museums San Francisco, Conservat Dept, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Harper, Thomas K.] Penn State Univ, Dept Anthropol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Tantalean, Henry] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Escuela Profes Arqueol, Lima 15081, Peru; [Stanish, Charles] Univ S Florida, Inst Adv Study Culture & Environm, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Fehren-Schmitz, Lars] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz UCSC Paleogen, Dept Anthropol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Fehren-Schmitz, Lars] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, UCSC Genom Inst, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of East Anglia; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Bongers, JL (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sainsbury Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Bongers, JL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Cotsen Inst Archaeol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;Stanish, C (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Inst Adv Study Culture & Environm, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",J.Bongers@uea.ac.uk; stanish.charles@gmail.com,,"Harper, Thomas Kelley/0000-0002-4969-1653; Tantalean, Henry/0000-0002-3087-7968; Bongers, Jacob/0000-0003-1633-7620; Stanish, Charles/0000-0002-5236-8996",Institute of Field Research; Cotsen Institute of Archaeology; Provost Office of the University of South Florida; University of California Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives Catalyst Grant [UC-17-445724]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1144087]; Ford Foundation Fellowship Program; National Geographic Young Explorers Grant Program [9347-13]; Sigma Xi; NSF [BCS-1523293]; University of California; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM007753]; Andrew W.

Here we review the evidence for spatial and temporal variability in lithic (stone tool) technologies relative to the predictions of two major hypotheses: 1) that a single successful dispersal occurred 60-50 thousand years ago (ka), marked by a trail of geometric/microlithic technologies, and 2) that multiple dispersals occurred, beginning much earlier (probably in Marine Isotope Stage [MIS] 5), associated with Middle Palaeolithic technology in its early phase. Our results show that Late Pleistocene geometric/microlithic technologies exhibit significant temporal and regional differences between each other. These differences suggest independent, convergent origins for these technologies, which are likely to have been repeatedly re-invented. In contrast, we identify similarities between East African lithic technologies from MIS 8 onwards and Middle Palaeolithic assemblages as far east as India by MIS 5. That this constellation of technological features - particularly an emphasis on centripetal Levallois reduction reflecting interchangeable preferential and recurrent methods, along with particular retouched forms such as points - transcends ecologies and raw material types suggests that it is unlikely to entirely reflect technological convergence (analogy). Our results indicate an early onset of multiple dispersals out of Africa. The hypothesis of an early onset to successful dispersal is entirely consistent with the possibility of further subsequent (post-MIS 5) dispersals out of Africa. Testing such hypotheses through quantified comparative lithic studies and interdisciplinary research is therefore likely to significantly advance understanding of the earliest H. sapiens dispersals.

The overarching assumption in this analysis is that the frequency of dates is proportional to the magnitude of past human activity. Thus, the distribution of summed or otherwise summarized dates is used to extrapolate population density and mobility patterns. There are, however, a number of underlying assumptions associated with this analysis that workers address to varying degrees and which, if false and not critically accounted for, will introduce bias, misrepresent the magnitude of activity, and ultimately prove misleading in archaeological interpretations. In this regard, research has so far mainly focused on correcting for the effects of time-dependent degradation of archaeological sites and constituent materials, calibration irregularities, and the efficacy of the statistical methods used. Assumptions directly related to sample processing in radiocarbon dating, however, are less discussed in 'C-14-dates-as-data' analyses. It is, for example, assumed that all carbonaceous materials will yield sufficient, endogenous carbon for radiocarbon measurement. Yet sample failure in radiocarbon dating is common and contingent on, largely, deterministic factors such as post-depositional environment. Sets of radiocarbon dates analyzed, therefore, represent successful measurements independent of reliability. In this work, we discuss the biases introduced by challenges in radiocarbon processing and their impact on C-14-dates-as-data studies.","[Becerra-Valdivia, Lorena; Higham, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Leal-Cervantes, Rodrigo] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England; [Wood, Rachel] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Radiocarbon Facil, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Australian National University,"Becerra-Valdivia, L (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",lorena.becerravaldivia@arch.ox.ac.uk,"; Wood, Rachel/K-5577-2016","Becerra-Valdivia, Lorena/0000-0001-5501-5347; Wood, Rachel/0000-0002-1694-3295","Clarendon Fund Scholarship, University of Oxford; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D014077/1]; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling, University of Oxford [EP/L015803/1]; NERC [NE/D014077/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Clarendon Fund Scholarship, University of Oxford; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling, University of Oxford(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","Without implying their agreement with the content of this article, we thank Christopher Bronk Ramsey, Emma Henderson (Oxford), David Chivall (Oxford) and Eileen Jacob (Oxford) for their assistance, as well as Jaime Swift (Oxford) and Katerina Douka (MPI-SHH, Jena) for enriching discussions on the topic.

We determined indicators for soil quality changes in the DOK long-term comparison trial that was initiated in 1978. This replicated field trial comprises organic and integrated (conventional) farming systems that are typical for Swiss agriculture. Livestock based bio-organic (BlOORG), bio-dynamic (BIODYN) and integrated farming systems (CONFYM) were compared at reduced and normal fertilization intensity (0.7 and 1.4 livestock units, LU) in a 7 year crop rotation. A stockless integrated system is fertilized with mineral fertilizers exclusively (CONMIN) and one control treatment remained unfertilized (NOFERT). The CONFYM system is amended with stacked manure, supplemental mineral fertilizers, as well as chemical pesticides. Manure of the BIOORG system is slightly rotted and in BIODYN it is composted aerobically with some herbal additives. In the third crop rotation period at normal fertiliser intensity soil organic carbon (C-org, w/w) in the plough layer (0-20 cm) of the BIODYN system remained constant and decreased by 7% in CONFYM and 9% in BIOORG as compared to the starting values. With no manure application C-org-loss was severest in NOFERT (22%), followed by CONMIN together with the systems at reduced fertiliser intensity (14-16%). Soil pH tended to increase in the organic systems, whereas the integrated systems had the lowest pH values. At the end of the third crop rotation period in 1998 biological soil quality indicators were determined. Compared to soil microbial biomass in the BIODYN systems the CONFYM soils showed 25% lower values and the systems without manure application were lower by 34%. Relative to the BIODYN soils at the same fertilization intensity dehydrogenase activity was 39-42% lower in CONFYM soils and even 62.% lower in soils of CONMIN. Soil basal respiration did not differ between farming systems at the same intensity, but when related to microbial biomass (qCO(2)) it was 20% higher in CONFYM soils and 52% higher in CONMIN as compared to BIODYN, suggesting a higher maintenance requirement of microbial biomass in soils of the integrated systems. The manure based farming systems of the DOK trial are likely to favour an active and fertile soil. Both, C-org and biological soil quality indicators were clearly depending on the quantity and quality of the applied manure types, but soil microbial biomass and activities were much more affected than C-org.

Stable carbon isotope studies can give novel insights into these issues. In this review we provide an overview of an emerging picture of plant-soil-atmosphere C fluxes, as based on C isotope studies, and identify processes determining related C isotope signatures. The first part of the review focuses on isotopic fractionation processes within plants during and after photosynthesis. The second major part elaborates on plant-internal and plant-rhizosphere C allocation patterns at different time scales (diel, seasonal, interannual), including the speed of C transfer and time lags in the coupling of assimilation and respiration, as well as the magnitude and controls of plant-soil C allocation and respiratory fluxes. Plant responses to changing environmental conditions, the functional relationship between the physiological and phenological status of plants and C transfer, and interactions between C, water and nutrient dynamics are discussed. The role of the C counterflow from the rhizosphere to the aboveground parts of the plants, e. g. via CO2 dissolved in the xylem water or as xylem-transported sugars, is highlighted. The third part is centered around belowground C turnover, focusing especially on above-and belowground litter inputs, soil organic matter formation and turnover, production and loss of dissolved organic C, soil respiration and CO2 fixation by soil microbes. Furthermore, plant controls on microbial communities and activity via exudates and litter production as well as microbial community effects on C mineralization are reviewed. A further part of the paper is dedicated to physical interactions between soil CO2 and the soil matrix, such as CO2 diffusion and dissolution processes within the soil profile. Finally, we highlight state-of-the-art stable isotope methodologies and their latest developments. From the presented evidence we conclude that there exists a tight coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes involved in C cycling and C isotope fluxes in the plant-soil-atmosphere system. Generally, research using information from C isotopes allows an integrated view of the different processes involved. However, complex interactions among the range of processes complicate or currently impede the interpretation of isotopic signals in CO2 or organic compounds at the plant and ecosystem level. This review tries to identify present knowledge gaps in correctly interpreting carbon stable isotope signals in the plant-soil-atmosphere system and how future research approaches could contribute to closing these gaps.","[Brueggemann, N.] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Bio & Geosci, Agrosphere Inst IBG 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Gessler, A.; Kayler, Z.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Inst Landscape Biogeochem, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Keel, S.

The concept of resilience has introduced a way to explore solutions to some important problems in the building industry. However, much of the work that has taken place to date represents activities generally assigned to risk management, which is discussed as being inherently insufficient for sustaining the functions of the built environment under stresses. This commentary considers the opportunities and limitations for mainstreaming resilience into building industry processes and actors. Barriers include indeterminate analytical meaning, event and performance uncertainty, immature regulatory standards setting, and untested enterprise economics. Further, the multiple outcomes of recovery and the relationship between building recovery and adaptation are discussed and, along with economics of resilience investments, a research need highlighted.

They are a problem that occurs globally requiring an integrated and coordinated scientific understanding, leading to regional responses and solutions. Given that these natural phenomena will never be completely eliminated, an improved scientific understanding of HAB dynamics coupled with monitoring and ocean observations, facilitates new prediction and prevention strategies. Regional efforts are underway worldwide to create state-of-the-art HAB monitoring and forecasting tools, vulnerability assessments, and observing networks. In the United States, these include Alaska, Pacific Northwest, California, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Maine, Great Lakes, and the United States Caribbean islands. This paper examines several regional programs in the United States, European Union, and Asia and concludes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. At the same time, successful programs require strong coordination with stakeholders and institutional sustainability to maintain and reinforce them with new automating technologies, wherever possible, ensuring integration of modeling efforts with multiple regional to national programs. Recommendations for scaling up to a global observing system for HABs can be summarized as follows: (1) advance and improve cost-effective and sustainable HAB forecast systems that address the HAB-risk warning requirements of key end-users at global and regional levels; (2) design programs that leverage and expand regional HAB observing systems to evaluate emerging technologies for Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) in order to support interregional technology comparisons and regional networks of observing capabilities; (3) fill the essential need for sustained, preferably automated, near real-time information from nearshore and offshore sites situated in HAB transport pathways to provide improved, advanced HAB warnings; (4) merge ecological knowledge and models with existing Earth System Modeling Frameworks to enhance end-to-end capabilities in forecasting and scenario-building; (5) provide seasonal to decadal forecasts to allow governments to plan, adapt to a changing marine environment, and ensure coastal industries are supported and sustained in the years ahead; and (6) support implementation of the recent calls for action by the United Nations Decade 2010 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to develop indicators that are relevant to an effective and global HAB early warning system.","[Anderson, Clarissa R.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, Southern Calif Coastal Ocean Observing Syst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA;

Efforts to prevent this cultural loss are severely constrained by a poor understanding of the geographical patterns and drivers of extinction risk. We quantify the global distribution of language extinction risk-represented by small range and speaker population sizes and rapid declines in the number of speakers-and identify the underlying environmental and socioeconomic drivers. We show that both small range and speaker population sizes are associated with rapid declines in speaker numbers, causing 25% of existing languages to be threatened based on criteria used for species. Language range and population sizes are small in tropical and arctic regions, particularly in areas with high rainfall, high topographic heterogeneity and/or rapidly growing human populations. By contrast, recent speaker declines have mainly occurred at high latitudes and are strongly linked to high economic growth. Threatened languages are numerous in the tropics, the Himalayas and northwestern North America. These results indicate that small-population languages remaining in economically developed regions are seriously threatened by continued speaker declines. However, risks of future language losses are especially high in the tropics and in the Himalayas, as these regions harbour many small-population languages and are undergoing rapid economic growth.","[Amano, Tatsuya; Sutherland, William J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Sandel, Brody; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Eager, Heidi] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Sch Archaeol, Oxford OX1 2HU, England; [Eager, Heidi] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Bulteau, Edouard] Ecole Polytech, F-91120 Palaiseau, France; [Dalsgaard, Bo; Rahbek, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Davies, Richard G.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Cambridge; Aarhus University; University of Oxford; Cornell University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; University of Copenhagen; University of East Anglia,"Amano, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",amatatsu830@gmail.com,"Rahbek, Carsten/L-1129-2013; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Davies, Richard/H-7447-2019; Amano, Tatsuya/E-7367-2010","Rahbek, Carsten/0000-0003-4585-0300; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Amano, Tatsuya/0000-0001-6576-3410; Dalsgaard, Bo/0000-0003-2867-2805; Sutherland, William/0000-0002-6498-0437",European Commission [PIIF-GA-2011-303221]; Chair Modelisation Mathematique et Biodiversite (VEOLIAsimilar toEcole Polytechniquesimilar toMNHNsimilar toF-X); Carlsberg Foundation; Arcadia Fund; Danish National Research Foundation; European Research Council [ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Chair Modelisation Mathematique et Biodiversite (VEOLIAsimilar toEcole Polytechniquesimilar toMNHNsimilar toF-X); Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); Arcadia Fund; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"T.A. was supported by the European Commission's Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship Programme (PIIF-GA-2011-303221), E.B. by the Chair Modelisation Mathematique et Biodiversite (VEOLIA similar to Ecole Polytechnique similar to MNHN similar to F-X), B.D. by the Carlsberg Foundation and W.J.S. by the Arcadia Fund.

The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA - ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances ((rho) over cap (w)). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in (rho) over cap (w)(560) and (rho) over cap (w)(664) were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15-30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20-30% uncertainties in (rho) over cap (w)(490 <= lambda <= 743 nm) yielded 25-70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems.","[Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Pahlevan, Nima; Smith, Brandon] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc SSAI, Lanham, MD USA; [Mangin, Antoine; Martin-Lauzer, Francois-Regis] ACRI ST, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan V.] Geosensing & Imaging Solut Consultancy, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; [Alikas, Krista; Ligi, Martin] Univ Tartu, Tartu Observ, Tartumaa, Estonia; [Arai, Kohei] Saga Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Saga, Japan; [Barbosa, Claudio] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Instrumentat Lab Aquat Syst LabISA, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Belanger, Simon; Pan, Yanqun] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Grp BOREAS & Quebec Ocean, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Binding, Caren] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Bresciani, Mariano; Giardino, Claudia] CNR IREA, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm, Naples, Italy; [Gurlin, Daniela] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Madison, WI USA; [Fan, Yongzhen] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Phys & Engn Phys, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Harmel, Tristan] Geosci Environm Toulouse GET, Toulouse, France; [Hunter, Peter; Spyrakos, Evangelos; Tyler, Andrew] Univ Stirling, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Earth & Planetary Observat Sci EPOS, Stirling, Scotland; [Ishikaza, Joji] Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res ISEE, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Kratzer, Susanne] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci DEEP, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lehmann, Moritz K.] Xerra Earth Observat Inst, Alexandra, New Zealand; [Lehmann, Moritz K.] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Ma, Ronghua] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Olmanson, Leif] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Oppelt, Natascha] Univ Kiel, Dept Geog, Earth Observat & Modelling, Kiel, Germany; [Pan, Yanqun] ARCTUS, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Peters, Steef] Water Insight, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Reynaud, Nathalie] INRAE, UR RECOVER Pole ECLA, Aix En Provence, France; [de Carvalho, Lino A.

However, digitalization has historically increased environmental impacts at local and planetary scales, affecting labor markets, resource use, governance, and power relationships. Here we study the past, present, and future of digitalization through the lens of three interdependent elements of the Anthropocene: (a) planetary boundaries and stability, (b) equity within and between countries, and (c) human agency and governance, mediated via (i) increasing resource efficiency, (ii) accelerating consumption and scale effects, (iii) expanding political and economic control, and (iv) deteriorating social cohesion. While direct environmental impacts matter, the indirect and systemic effects of digitalization are more profoundly reshaping the relationship between humans, technosphere and planet. We develop three scenarios: planetary instability, green but inhumane, and deliberate for the good. We conclude with identifying leverage points that shift human-digital-Earth interactions toward sustainability.","[Creutzig, Felix; Milojevic-Dupont, Nikola; Wagner, Felix] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Creutzig, Felix; Hintz, Marie Josefine; Milojevic-Dupont, Nikola; Wagner, Felix; Zekar, Aicha; Zumwald, Marius] Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany; [Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bai, Xuemei] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Edwards, Paul N.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Int Secur & Cooperat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hintz, Marie Josefine] ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil, Berlin, Germany; [Hintz, Marie Josefine; Kaack, Lynn H.] Hertie Sch, Berlin, Germany; [Kilkis, Siir] Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey, Ankara, Turkey; [Kunkel, Stefanie] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Luers, Amy] Microsoft, Seattle, WA USA; [Rejeski, Dave] Environm Law Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Renn, Jurgen; Rosol, Christoph; Turnbull, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Hist Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Rolnick, David] McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rolnick, David] Mila Quebec AI Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rosol, Christoph] Haus Kulturen Welt, Berlin, Germany; [Russ, Daniela] Univ Toronto, Sociol Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Verdolini, Elena] Univ Brescia, Dept Law, Brescia, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm, Milan, Italy; [Wilson, Charlie] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England",Technical University of Berlin; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Australian National University; Stanford University; Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK); Microsoft; Max Planck Society; McGill University; University of Toronto; University of Brescia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Oxford,"Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",creurzig@mcc-berlin.net,"Kilkis, Siir/E-5934-2015; Bai, Xuemei/A-5443-2012","Kilkis, Siir/0000-0003-3466-3593; Bai, Xuemei/0000-0001-6556-8041",European Research Council under the European Union [853487],European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"This review is dedicated to Naftali Tishby (1952-2021), who not only created the information theoretic groundwork of state-of-the-art digitalization but also advanced the understanding of optimal constrained information processing action-perception learning loops relevant for evolutionary survival.

This study investigated the application of the neutral thermal sensation and it questions the reliability of any study that solely relies on neutral thermal sensation. Although thermal-neutrality has already been questioned, still most thermal comfort studies only use this measure to assess thermal comfort of the occupants. In this study, the connection of the occupant's thermal comfort with thermal-neutrality was investigated in two separate contexts of Norwegian and British offices. Overall, the thermal environment of four office buildings was evaluated and 313 responses (three times a day) to thermal sensation, thermal preference, comfort, and satisfaction were recorded. The results suggested that 36% of the occupants did not want to feel neutral and they considered thermal sensations other than neutral as their comfort condition. Also, in order to feel comfortable, respondents reported wanting to feel different thermal sensations at different times of the day suggesting that occupant desire for thermal comfort conditions may not be as steady as anticipated. This study recommends that other measures are required to assess human thermal comfort, such as thermal preference.Practical application: This study questions the application of neutral thermal sensation as the measure of thermal comfort. The findings indicate that occupant may consider other sensations than neutral as comfortable. This finding directly questions the standard comfort zone (e.g. ASHRAE Standard 55) as well as the optimum temperature, as many occupants required different thermal sensations at different times of the day to feel comfortable. These findings suggest that a steady indoor thermal environment does not guarantee thermal comfort and variations in the room temperature, which can be controlled by the occupant, need to be considered as part of the building design.","[Shahzad, Sally] Univ Derby, Dept Mech Engn & Built Environm, Derby, England; [Brennan, John; Theodossopoulos, Dimitris] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Sch Architecture & Landscape Architectu, Edinburgh Coll Art, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Calautit, John K.] Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham, England; [Hughes, Ben R.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Derby; Edinburgh College of Art; University of Edinburgh; University of Nottingham; University of Sheffield,"Shahzad, S (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Markeaton St Bldg, Derby DE22 3AW, England.",sally.shahzad@gmail.com,"Calautit, John Kaiser/M-6994-2019","Shahzad, Sally/0000-0003-2425-776X",,,,,46,37,37,5,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-6244,1477-0849,,BUILD SERV ENG RES T,Build Serv.

A particular case is represented by the Mithraeum of Marino Laziale, located a few kilometers away from Rome and accidentally discovered in the 1960s. The uniqueness of the discovery was the presence of a well-preserved painting of the Mithraic scene (II century A.D.) probably due to the oblivion of the place of worship over the centuries as well as the isolation from the outdoor environment. Unfortunately, despite a recent complete restoration and recovery of the archaeological area, which ended in 2015, the area was never open to the visitors and only two years after completing the works it was no longer safe to use. Hence, the need for a new planning of interventions starting from the deep knowledge of this cultural heritage and from the analysis of past incorrect actions to arrive at the opening-without any risk for the archaeological findings and visitors-and management of this site, never exposed to the public. Therefore, since 2018 a diagnostic campaign and microclimate monitoring have been started. The data collected during the two years of investigations have been fundamental to assess the conservation state of the hypogeal environment and the potential risks for the preservation of the three paintings (the Mithraic scene and two dadophores). Long-term monitoring of indoor environmental conditions assumes the role of an essential tool for the planning of preventive conservation strategies but also for the control of the site after its opening to the visitors. Furthermore, the characterization of the microclimate is non-invasive, sufficiently economical and accurate. In this paper, the characterization of surfaces in the Mithraic gallery through optical microscopy, UV fluorescence/imaging techniques, FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD and the microclimatic parameters variation in the presence or absence of visitors are used to define the strategies for the opening and fruition of the Mithraeum. The strategies for the sustainable fruition of this unique archaeological site have been defined through a conservation protocol approved by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and necessary for the site managers and curators of the Municipality of Marino Laziale to finally support its opening.","[Luvidi, Loredana] Natl Res Council Italy, CNR, ISPC, Inst Heritage Sci, Area Ric Roma 1, I-00010 Rome, Italy; [Prestileo, Fernanda] Natl Res Council Italy, CNR, ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Area Ric Roma 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [De Paoli, Michela] Conservat Scientist Freelance Marino Laziale Rome, I-00047 Rome, Italy; [Riminesi, Cristiano; Manganelli Del Fa, Rachele; Magrini, Donata; Fratini, Fabio] Natl Res Council Italy, CNR, ISPC, Inst Heritage Sci, I-50019 Florence, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze del Patrimonio Culturale (ISPC-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze del Patrimonio Culturale (ISPC-CNR),"Luvidi, L (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy, CNR, ISPC, Inst Heritage Sci, Area Ric Roma 1, I-00010 Rome, Italy.",loredana.luvidi@cnr.it; fernanda.prestileo@cnr.it; michela.depaoli82@gmail.com; cristiano.riminesi@cnr.it; rachele.manganellidelfa@cnr.it; donata.magrini@cnr.it; fabio.fratini@cnr.it,"MANGANELLI DEL FA, RACHELE/Q-1008-2018; Riminesi, Cristiano/B-4584-2015","MANGANELLI DEL FA, RACHELE/0000-0002-4767-5684; LUVIDI, LOREDANA/0000-0001-8437-1527; Prestileo, Fernanda/0000-0002-6471-7786; Riminesi, Cristiano/0000-0002-9419-3653",,,,,64,0,0,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2571-9408,,HERITAGE-BASEL,Heritage,DEC,2021,4,,,,4264,4285,,10.3390/heritage4040235,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/heritage4040235,,,22,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,YA4EH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000738288000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study included tree-ring width (TRW) chronologies from 22 stands located in four southeastern (SE) European countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria), which were grouped into three wetness groups (WGs): dry (<650 mm), moderate (650-750 mm), and wet (>750 mm), following the annual sum of precipitation. High correlation strengths dur -ing the intensive growth period-late spring and early summer months (April to June) was noted, which was op-posite to the trend in late summer months. Variations in detrended TRW (TRWi) sensitivity to SM were also observed among the WGs. Specifically, the TRWi chronologies from the dry and wet WGs provided a greater number of significant correlations (p < 0.01) than trees from the moderate WG did. In wetter stands, TRWi cor-related more negatively in the wettest (spring) months, while the correlation was weaker in summer months; these trends were opposite to those of trees growing in drier conditions that had the strongest responses to SM. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) based on 38 variables indicated that the fit for SM and radial growth was as strong as the fits for other traditionally measured parameters (temperature, precipitation, and river water level) and calculated drought indices (standardized precipitation index and the Ellenberg index) and TRW. Additionally, radial growth chronologies from drier sites had stronger fits with surrounding environmental factors. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SM can potentially be used as a reliable remote sensing indicator of the soil wetness in oak forests, which affects tree productivity and radial growth patterns and provides a new opportunity in dendrochronology research on larger scales.

Shellfish cultivation is one of the largest sectors of aquaculture and one of the few food productions that have the potential capacity of acting as carbon sink. In fact, >90 % of bivalve shells are calcium carbonate (CaCO3), synthetized during biocalcification process, which incorporates a molecule of CO2. Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum, Adams & Reeves, 1850) and Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Lamarck, 1819) are two of the major groups of cultivated shellfish. Our aim was to assess the potential role of those two bivalve species in the overall marine carbon balance using an ecosystem approach, and to evaluate if they can be definitely regarded as carbon sink. The contribution to CO2 emissions (as CO2 eq./kg of fresh products) due to mollusk farming has been also calculated as carbon-source term by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is nowadays the most shared and accepted tool for evaluating the environmental impacts of aquaculture productions. As a case study, the Sacca di Goro coastal lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) has been considered, because it is the premier site in Europe for clam farming, and one of the most important for mussels. Our study has shown that for each kilogram of harvested and packaged clams and mussels, shell formation throughout the mollusk growth allows to permanently capture 254 and 146 g of CO2, in the face of 22 and 55 g CO2 eq. emitted for farming, respectively. As a result, clams and mussel aquaculture could be considered as a carbon sink, with a net carbon capture capacity of 233 and 91 g CO2/kg of fresh product, respectively. In a wider context, bivalve aquaculture could be included in the carbon trading system and played a role towards the carbon-neutral economy.","[Tamburini, Elena; Lanzoni, Mattia; Castaldelli, Giuseppe] Univ Ferrara, Dept Environm & Prevent Sci, Ferrara, Italy; [Turolla, Edoardo] Ist Delta Ecol Applicata, I-44124 Ferrara, Italy; [Moore, David] Univ Manchester, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Sch Biol Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Ferrara; University of Manchester,"Tamburini, E (corresponding author), Via L Borsari 46, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",tme@unife.it,,,"Emilia-Romagna Region, Fauna and Fisheries Service [241/90]","Emilia-Romagna Region, Fauna and Fisheries Service","The project was financed partly by the Emilia-Romagna Region, Fauna and Fisheries Service, within the Convention Ex Art. 15 of Law N. 241/90, entitled Assessment andmapping of productivity for bivalvemollusc aquaculture in the Sacca di Goro and the stretch of coastline fromLido di Volano to Lido delle Nazioni.",,99,1,1,16,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

At this site, glacial deposits (till and outwash gravels) referable to the Anglian Lowestoft Formation fill a subglacial channel cut in Chalk bedrock. Above these glacial deposits a series of interglacial sediments occurs, consisting of limnic, tufaceous and colluvial silts, lacking pollen but rich in shells, ostracods and vertebrates. Lower Palaeolithic flint artefacts of Acheulian character have also been recovered, including refitting examples. Charred material is abundant at certain horizons and many of the bones have been burned. Several discrete areas of burnt sediment are interpreted as hearths. The molluscan fauna comprises some 78 taxa and includes species of considerable zoogeographical and biostratigraphical importance. The land snail assemblage from the tufa consists of woodland taxa with no modern analogue, including species that are either extinct (e.g. Zonitoides sepultus) or which no longer live in Britain (e.g. Platyla polita, P. sitnilis, Neniatlantapauli). This is also the type locality of Retinella (Lyrodiscus) skertchlyi, which belongs to a subgenus of zonitid land snail now living only on the Canary Islands. There are indications from this fauna ('the Lyrodiscus biome') that the climate was wetter and perhaps warmer than the present day. The vertebrate fauna is also noteworthy with species of open habitats, such as rabbit (Oryctolagus cf. cuniculus), and of closed forest, such as squirrel (Sciurus sp.) and garden dormouse (Eliornys quercinus) present at different times. The occurrence of southern thermophiles, such as Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus), indicates temperatures warmer than those of eastern England today. The upper levels include much material reworked from the interglacial sediments, although there is clear faunal evidence for climatic deterioration. Both the molluscan and vertebrate faunas suggest correlation of the interglacial sediments with the Hoxnian. Uranium series dates from the tufa (similar to 455 ka BP), TL dates from burnt flints (414 +/- 30 ka BP) and a range of amino acid racentization data all support correlation of this interglacial with MIS 11. However, four OSL dates from sand beneath the interglacial sequence yield a mean age of 261 +/- 31 ka BP, far younger than all other age determinations and far younger than implied by the biostratigraphy. Archaeologically the site is unusual in showing prolonged human occupation within closed deciduous forest and evidence for controlled use of fire in a Lower Palaeolithic context. Biostratigraphical correlations with other Lower Palaeolithic sites support the suggestion that Acheulian and Clactonian industries both occurred in southern Britain during the same substage of the Hoxnian, although not necessarily at precisely the same time. The characteristics of the MIS I I interglacial in Britain are discussed in the light of evidence from Beeches Pit and elsewhere. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The economic basis for this significant social change has long been debated, particularly concerning the role of olive cultivation in the island's agricultural systein. With the aim of studying vegetation changes and human management to understand the landscape history from Late Neolithic to Bronze Age, two palaeoenvironmental records have been studied at Kouremenos marsh, near the site of Palaikastro (Eastern Crete). Pollen, NPP and charcoal particles analyses evidenced seven phases of landscape change, resulting from different agricultural and pastoral practices and the use of fire probably to manage vegetation. Moreover, the Kouremenos records show the importance of the olive tree in the area. They reflect a clear trend for its increasing use and exploitation from 3600 cal yr BC (Final Neolithic) to the Early Minoan period, that is coeval with an opening of the landscape. The increase of Olea pollen was due to the expansion of the tree and its management using pruning and mechanical cleaning. The onset of olive expansion at c. 3600 cal yr BC places Crete among the first locales in the eastern Mediterranean in the management of this tree. Between c. 2780 and 2525 cal yr BC the landscape was largely occupied by olive and grasslands, coinciding with an increase in grazing practices. The high Olea pollen percentages (40-45%) suggest an intensive and large-scale exploitation of the olive tree. The results suggest that a complex and organized landscape with complementary land uses and activities was already in place since the Final Neolithic. The notable expansion of olive trees suggests the relevance of olive exploitation in the socio-economic development of Minoan towns of eastern Crete. Other crops, such as cereals and vine, and activities such as grazing have also played an important role in the configuration of the past landscape. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the 27-day variations in the solar forcing parameters such as solar ultraviolet and galactic cosmic rays become more prominent when the solar activity is high, it is expected that the signal of the 27-day period in meteorological phenomena may wax and wane according to the changes in the solar activity level. In this study, we examine in detail the intensity variations in the signal of the 27-day solar rotational period in thunder and lightning activity from the 18th to the 19th centuries based on 150-year-long records found in old diaries kept in Japan and discuss their relation with the solar activity levels. Such long records enable us to examine the signals of solar rotation at both high and low solar activity levels. We found that the signal of the solar rotational period in the thunder and lightning activity increases as the solar activity increases. In this study, we also discuss the possibility of the impact of the long-term climatological conditions on the signals of the 27-day period in thunder/lightning activities.","[Miyahara, Hiroko] Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, 1-736 Ogawa Cho, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878505, Japan; [Kataoka, Ryuho] Natl Inst Polar Res, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Kataoka, Ryuho] Sch Multidisciplinary Sci, Dept Polar Sci, Sokendai 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Mikami, Takehiko; Hirano, Junpei] Teikyo Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, 359 Ohtsuka, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920395, Japan; [Zaiki, Masumi] Seikei Univ, Fac Econ, 3-3-1 Kichijoji Kitamachi, Musashino, Tokyo 1808633, Japan; [Yoshimura, Minoru] Univ Yamanashi, Fac Educ, 4-4-37 Takeda, Kofu, Yamanashi 4008510, Japan; [Aono, Yasuyuki] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan; [Iwahashi, Kiyomi] Natl Inst Japanese Literature, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1900014, Japan",Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan; Teikyo University; Seikei University; University of Yamanashi; Osaka Metropolitan University,"Miyahara, H (corresponding author), Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, 1-736 Ogawa Cho, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878505, Japan.",miyahara@musabi.ac.jp,"KATAOKA, RYUHO/AAJ-4570-2020; Miyahara, Hiroko/GPX-4725-2022","Miyahara, Hiroko/0000-0001-6787-443X; Aono, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-6950-4341","JSPS KAKENHI [15H05816, 25287051]; Center for the Promotion of Integrated Sciences of SOKENDAI; Project to Build an International Collaborative Research for Pre-modern Japanese Texts; curators of the Hachioji City Historical Museum; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25287051] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Center for the Promotion of Integrated Sciences of SOKENDAI; Project to Build an International Collaborative Research for Pre-modern Japanese Texts; curators of the Hachioji City Historical Museum; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank Mr. Yoshimi Fukuma for providing the data set of thunder and lightning events in Edo obtained from the diaries kept by the Hirosaki Domain.

In this study which is designed according to qualitative research method, document analysis technique is used. A total of 362 news related to school security problems with the keyword of school in the 2017-2018 academic year constitute the data of this study which is accessed from the search engines of Hurriyet and Sabah newspapers. In the analysis of the data, content analysis was performed to determine the dimensions of the events that reflect the news about school security problems. In the content analysis, in accordance with the sub-objectives of the research; Analyzes were made based on the topics related to physical, psycho-social and external threats which are reflections of school safety problems. As a result of the analysis in regard to the physical security of schools; four different categories were reached: building, transportation, hygiene factors and security related to infrastructure. Building category is divided into two sub-categories namely outdoor and indoor categories. Outdoor category involves structural problems of the buildings while the indoor category deals with the emergency situation. In the case of psycho-social security, the events in newspapers were collected in five different categories as violence, abuse, suicide, substance abuse and security events related to negligence. In the sub-dimension of psycho-social security, it is observed that most of the security incidents are seen in the category of violence and abuse in schools; It is interesting to note that in these categories, harming of others and sexual harassment are the most intense security incidents in schools. Finally, events related to external threats in the schools were collected in seven different categories as follows: school environment events, school environment structure and system, abuse, psychological attacks, terrorism, burglary and violence. It is possible to say that the school-related incidents as a result of the sale of drugs and unhealthy foods and the theft of schools' equipment are the most common external threats.","[Kahraman, Hilal; Semin, Fatma Koybasi; Ugurlu, Celal Teyyar] Dr Sivas Cumhuriyet Univ, Egitim Fak, Temel Egitim Bolumu, Sivas, Turkey",,"Kahraman, H (corresponding author), Dr Sivas Cumhuriyet Univ, Egitim Fak, Temel Egitim Bolumu, Sivas, Turkey.",hilalyucelkahraman@gmail.com; koybasi.fatma@gmail.com; celalteyyar@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,5,KARABUK UNIV,KARABUK,"MAIN CAMPUS, BALIKLARKAYASI, KARABUK, 00000, TURKEY",2147-0626,,,TARIH KULT SANAT ARA,Tarih Kult.

Our baseline study of delta C-13 in tooth enamel and bone collagen from wombats that inhabited semi-arid, savannah, temperate and alpine environments in eastern Australia documented an offset of 5.2 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand and 12.9 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand from the animal's diet, respectively. Marsupial wombats are obligate grazers, whose teeth grow continuously. Sequential microanalysis of delta C-13 and delta O-18 along the length of wombat incisors yielded a time-series of isotopic variation. The microprofiles of wombat tooth delta O-18 are highly variable between and within sites. Notwithstanding, the delta O-18 values were relatively high in wombat teeth from and and semi-arid sites, and significantly lower in those from southern temperate and coastal regions. In contrast, the delta C-13 of wombat tooth enamel correlates well with the local environmental setting and the seasonality of C-3 and C-4 grass growth. In areas with marked seasonal changes in the proportions of winter C-3 and summer C-4 grasses, wombat microprofile delta C-13 Values varied by up to 8 parts per thousand. Importantly, at sites with predominantly C-3 or C-4 grasses all year, variations in microprofile delta C-13 values are small (< 1.9 parts per thousand), indicating that the relatively large seasonality in delta C-13 we observe in wombat teeth must be primarily controlled by changes in diet, rather than animal-specific factors. This study shows that microprofiling of delta C-13 in wombat incisors, in particular, provides a high level of isotopic detail which is not available from time-averaged isotope records from bone collagen, or bulk analysis of isotopes in tooth enamel. Wombat teeth are common in the Quaternary fossil record and, as such, they have the potential to be outstanding archives of palaeoecological information. For example the delta C-13 of fossil wombat teeth could be used to define the changing proportions of C-3 and C-4 grasses in wombat diets through the Quaternary, which in turn reflect changes in the seasonality of precipitation, summer temperatures, and possible ecosystem modification by human activities.

Methods: Broilers were assigned to four treatment groups according to a 2x2 factorial design between 22 to 42 d of age (80 broilers per treatment, 4 replications). Broilers were divided into two main groups as feeding type (ad-libitum [AL] and intermittent [IF] for 6 h daily) and sub-groups as water temperature (normal [NW], 24.9 degrees C and cold [CW], 16.4 degrees C). Heat treatment was applied between 11.00 to 17.00 h daily between 22 to 42 d of age. Results: Live weight at 6th wk was not affected by feeding type and water temperature, but the live weight was significantly higher in IF chickens at the 5th wk (p<0.05). Average weekly gain of IF broiler chickens were higher compared to AL group at 4, 5, and 6 wk of age (p< 0.05). Although feeding type did not affect feed intake in 4 and 5th wk, feed intake was higher in IF chickens at 6th wk (p<0.01). In addition, feeding type and water temperature did not affect feed conversion ratio and interactions were not significant (p>0.05). Water temperature had no significant effect on heart, liver, gizzard, and abdominal fat percentages (p>0.05). Conclusion: It is concluded that IF increased the average weekly gain in chickens reared under daily heat stress for 6 h between 22 to 42 d of age. IF in hot environmental conditions slightly increased performance without adversely affecting health, welfare, and physiological traits, whereas CW implementation had no significant effect on performance. It can also be said that IF suppresses a sudden increase in body temperature depending on age and live weight.","[Erensoy, Kadir; Sarica, Musa; Aslan, Resul] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Agr Fac, Dept Anim Sci, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Noubandiguim, Moise] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey; [Noubandiguim, Moise] Natl High Inst Sci & Tech, Inst Natl Super Sci & Tech Abeche INSTA, Abeche 40823, Chad",Ondokuz Mayis University; Ondokuz Mayis University,"Erensoy, K (corresponding author), Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Agr Fac, Dept Anim Sci, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkey.",kadir.erensoy@omu.edu.tr,"ERENSOY, Kadir/AHC-0152-2022","ERENSOY, Kadir/0000-0002-7479-6203",Ondokuz Mayis University Project Office [PYO.ZRT.1901.18.014],Ondokuz Mayis University Project Office(Ondokuz Mayis University),"Authors thank the technical and administrative staff working at Eskisehir Gecit Kusagi Agricultural Research Institute, where breeding and selection applications of the pure lines used in the production of Anadolu-T broiler chickens were carried out.

Javits Convention Center Green Roof (JJCC Green Roof) was investigated in the field, as well as in the laboratory in order to determine its ability to insulate a building. An instrumented replica of the green roof cross section was developed to elucidate the inner-workings of the system. During the course of a year a total of twelve field monitoring campaigns were conducted to measure temperatures with 249 images collected at sixteen different locations (eight exterior and eight interior). During this first sequence of measurements, the north green roof had already been completed, while the south green roof was gradually being installed. Additional field imaging was performed on two separate days in August (on 08/08/15,08/22/15), and on one day in January (on 01/22/16) between sunrise and sunset (generating an additional 850 images). To isolate the thermal performance of individual components of the roof structure, a physical model of the roof was constructed in a laboratory, instrumented with thermistors, and subjected to a heat lamp. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was used to investigate physical relationships revealed by the field and laboratory observations, and represents the experimental data well. The results indicate that the construction of the green roof significantly reduces heat flux through the convention center roof. The mean internal and external temperatures on the north and south sections of the roof on the first monitoring day (when the north green roof was complete, but the south green roof had not yet been installed) and the last monitoring day (when both north and south green roof sections were complete) are provided to support the insulating value of the green roof layers. The mean exterior temperature on the south roof on the first day of monitoring was 53.9 degrees C and 37 degrees C on the north roof. The mean exterior temperature on the south roof on the last day of monitoring was 24 degrees C and the north roof 28 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While biology has inspired thermal design before, biomimetic translation of leaf morphology into structural aspects of heat exchangers remains largely unaddressed. One determinant of plant thermal endurance against environmental exposure is leaf shape, which modulates the leaf boundary layer, transpiration, evaporative cooling, and convective exchange. Here, we lay the research groundwork for the extraction of design principles from leaf shape relations to heat and mass transfer. Leaf role models were identified from an extensive literature review on environmentally sensitive morphology patterns and shape-dependent exchange. Addressing canopy sun-shade dimorphism, sun leaves collected from multiple oak species exceeded significantly in margin extension and shape dissection. Abstracted geometries (i.e., elongated; with finely toothed edges; with few large-scale teeth) were explored with paper models of the same surface area in a controlled environment of minimal airflow, which is more likely to induce leaf thermal stress. For two model characteristic dimensions, evaporation rates were significantly faster for the dissected geometries. Shape-driven transfer enhancements were higher for the smaller models, and finely toothed edges reached local cooling up to 10 degrees C below air temperature.

This study assessed the improvement opportunities with RTC of three NBS-related techniques commonly applied in urban drainage with different spatial scales: green roof, bioretention and detention basin and the remaining challenges to integrate both methods. Additionally, our investigations showed that the main difficulties reported involve the planning and monitoring stages of the RTC system. All of the studied devices can benefit from RTC. It is possible to observe that, despite the good results reported in the literature, the application of RTC to NBS studies on urban drainage are very recent.

The first method (EF) was run with an air diffusion cathode for H2O2 generation and boron-doped diamond (BDD) as an anode. The second method (EC) was conducted with mild steel electrodes. The applied processes' performance was monitored by the removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) along with the total Cr in addition to the electric energy consumption (EEC). To achieve the allowable discharge limits in aquatic media, a hybrid 2 h EF-5 h EC process was applied to treat tannery wastewater, based on the optimization results of every single method, achieving (88.1 +/- 4.8)% COD removal rate with total elimination of Cr. In addition, the results of other parameters evolution such as pH, turbidity and the concentration of ions were discussed. As a result, the global EEC of the hybrid treatment was reduced to about 1.7 times. Finally, precipitate and sludge generated at the end of each treatment were examined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis to determine their crystalline structure for valorization or reuse possibilities.","[Rezgui, Soumaya; Ghazouani, Mouna; Bousselmi, Latifa; Akrout, Hanene] Ctr Water Res & Technol CERTE, Lab Wastewaters & Environm, Technopk Borj Cedria,Tourist Rd Soliman,BP 273, Nabeul 8020, Tunisia",,"Akrout, H (corresponding author), Ctr Water Res & Technol CERTE, Lab Wastewaters & Environm, Technopk Borj Cedria,Tourist Rd Soliman,BP 273, Nabeul 8020, Tunisia.",soumaya.rezgui@insat.rnu.tn; mouna-ghazouani@hotmail.com; latifa.bousselmi@certe.rnrt.tn; hanene.akrout@certe.rnrt.tn,,"Bousselmi, Latifa/0000-0002-0699-4806","National Agency for the Promotion of Scientific Research in Tunisia; Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; Ramp;I project: Sustainable coastal groundwater man-agement and pollution reduction through innovative governance in a changing climate - Sustain-COAST; national agencies mentioned below under the PRIMA section II Program; Horizon 2020, the European Unions Program for Research and Innovation","National Agency for the Promotion of Scientific Research in Tunisia; Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; Ramp;I project: Sustainable coastal groundwater man-agement and pollution reduction through innovative governance in a changing climate - Sustain-COAST; national agencies mentioned below under the PRIMA section II Program; Horizon 2020, the European Unions Program for Research and Innovation","This work was supported by the National Agency for the Promotion of Scientific Research in Tunisia, and the contract objective (projects Smart electrochemistry at the service of the environment; depollution and innovative interfaces and Advanced oxidation processes) of Water Researches and Technologies Center (CERTE) supported by the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.

This areas used for green field are inactive in terms of environmental respect. The usage of the storage fields is critical for Istanbul where the empty lands are limited. Methane comes out from landfill and is controlled with different methods. Electricity is generated after the process of collecting, transferring, and burning of methane gas. Consuming methane gas in the plants leads to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases by conversion of methane to carbon dioxide, and increase economic benefits by energy generation. Considering the environmental and economic benefits, maximum efficiency of the production plant should be aimed. Therefore, exposition of waste heat created in the plant to air is a serious problem. This high capacity heat has a potential. Otherwise, it will cause environmental problems in addition to economical lose. Seasonal flower raise in greenhouse is a high cost business. The biggest portion of this cost is caused by heating and use of fertilizer. Coal and natural gas are used to heat the greenhouses. Fossil fuels used for this goal are costly and not environmentally friendly. This work is involved in the project of Use of waste heat produced at energy production plant in greenhouses supported by the Istanbul Development Agency. Goal of this project is to create a system that has environmental and economic benefits based on the utilization of waste material and heat in agriculture and energy sectors. In this project, the process of utilization of waste gas emerged in the IBB Odayeri Landfill, and establishment of seasonal flower greenhouses. Heat calculations of proposed greenhouse have been performed. The required amount of heat has been determined considering the heat loss of each material, and volume based heat loss caused by air change. Flue Gas emission has been as a result of electricity generation from landfill gas. Flue Gas emission measurement and analysis are done for the evaluation of landfill gas. Thermal calculations for the recovery of gas at 470 degrees C are done. Exhaust gas emissions of CO, CO2, O-2, SO2, NO, NO2 and NOx are determined with Electrochemical Cell Method while Speed and Flow Determination in chimney was carried out with the S-Type Pitot Tube Method. System alternatives for the use of the waste heat from chimneys and Air-water heat exchangers are investigated. Economizer, heat exchanger dimensions and material types are determined by considering the results of the analysis and the amount of the energy needed. Water which is heated by waste heat recovery unit will be delivered to the greenhouse by pumps. Heat transmission system designed to minimize the heat losses. The optimal hot water supply will be provided by the automation system in the greenhouse. After identification of product which will be grown and installation area of the hothouse, the installation has started. Fully automated air conditioning, irrigation and fertilization system have been designed to ensure the proper conditions for products proposed to grown in greenhouse. High temperature flue gas emission is provided from Landfill Gas Energy Production Plant. Significant economic benefits will be gained with evaluation of this gas. Greenhouses, in our country and around the world become an important agricultural activity and heating costs appears to be the biggest constraint for the development of this sector. Considering the heating process greenhouse are installed in geothermal areas and hot climate regions of our country. In winter heating generally inadequate or cannot be done at all. This project brings many solutions for the waste management problems. Unused landfill areas, unvalued waste heat, greenhouse area shortages, and unemployment issues of municipalities and businesses are discussed in a holistic manner in this project.","[Enc, Volkan; Kasirga, Musa] ISTAC AS, Istanbul Cevre Yonetimi Sanayi & Ticaret AS, Sisli, Turkey",ISTAC,"Enc, V (corresponding author), ISTAC AS, Istanbul Cevre Yonetimi Sanayi & Ticaret AS, Sisli, Turkey.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,KARABUK UNIV,KARABUK,"MAIN CAMPUS, BALIKLARKAYASI, KARABUK, 00000, TURKEY",2147-0626,,,TARIH KULT SANAT ARA,Tarih Kult.

Given that eradication of invasive species is not usually a practical option, conservationists may attempt to limit their impacts through the designation and management of protected areas. Here, we investigate the effect of marine protected areas on the habitat suitability of an invasive species, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). By modelling its environmental niche space in the Baltic Sea, we demonstrated that gobies prefer shallow, warmer waters, sheltered from significant wave action. They are more likely to be found near areas of intense shipping, this being their primary method of long-distance dispersal. Comparison of the goby's occurrences inside/outside protected areas indicated that suitable habitats within protected areas are more resistant to the round goby's invasion compared to adjacent unprotected areas, however the opposite is true for suboptimal habitats. This has important ecosystem management implications with marine conservation areas providing mitigation measures to control the spread of round goby in its optimal habitats in the Baltic Sea environment. Being subjected to reduced human impacts, native species within protected areas may be more numerous and diverse, helping to resist invasive species incursion.","[Holmes, Mark] Univ Namur, Res Unit Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Namur, Belgium; [Kotta, Jonne] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Persson, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Biol Aquat Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Sahlin, Ullrika] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",University of Namur; University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; Lund University; Lund University,"Holmes, M (corresponding author), Univ Namur, Res Unit Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Namur, Belgium.",mark.holmes@unamur.be; jonne@sea.ee; anders.persson@biol.lu.se; ullrika.sahlin@cec.lu.se,"Kotta, Jonne/B-5542-2009","Kotta, Jonne/0000-0002-4970-6755; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-0273-0483",BONUS MARES project - European Union,BONUS MARES project - European Union,"Thanks to Jacob Hoyer of the Danish Meteorological Institute, and Martin Ismus of AquaBiota for data contributions, as well as to the reviewers for their feedback.

Larval survival and recruitment of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were found to be heavily impaired by end-of-century levels of ocean acidification. Here, we analysed larval growth among 35-36 days old surviving larvae, along with organ development and ossification of the skeleton. We combined CO2 treatments (ambient: 503 mu atm, elevated: 1,179 mu atm) with food availability in order to evaluate the effect of energy limitation in addition to the ocean acidification stressor. As expected, larval size (as a proxy for growth) and skeletogenesis were positively affected by high food availability. We found significant interactions between acidification and food availability. Larvae fed ad libitum showed little difference in growth and skeletogenesis due to the CO2 treatment. Larvae under energy limitation were significantly larger and had further developed skeletal structures in the elevated CO2 treatment compared to the ambient CO2 treatment. However, the elevated CO2 group revealed impairments in critically important organs, such as the liver, and had comparatively smaller functional gills indicating a mismatch between size and function. It is therefore likely that individual larvae that had survived acidification treatments will suffer from impairments later during ontogeny. Our study highlights important allocation trade-off between growth and organ development, which is critically important to interpret acidification effects on early life stages of fish.","[Stiasny, Martina H.; Mittermayer, Felix H.; Reusch, Thorsten B.

First defined from its type site localities near Alesund, Western Norway, the Vedde Ash has now been traced across much of northern and central Europe, into northwest Russia, within North Atlantic marine sediments and into the Greenland ice cores. The Vedde Ash is thought to derive from an eruption of the Katla volcano in Iceland that occurred midway through the Younger Dryas/Greenland Stadial 1 (GS-1), similar to 12.1 ka BP. Visible and cryptotephra deposits of the Vedde Ash have been found in numerous stratified sites with robust chronologies, which allow its age to be constrained and its dispersal to be mapped. The eruption must have been highly explosive, however few proximal outcrops have been confirmed and this crucial ash layer remains almost exclusively distally-described and characterised using major element glass compositions. The widespread distribution, stratigraphic associations and consistent major element glass chemistry have led the Quaternary tephrochronological community to see the Vedde Ash as a robust and unique chronological marker layer for the last Glacial to Interglacial Transition (similar to 10-18 ka BP). Here we present new glass analyses of the Vedde Ash from multiple sites around the dispersal area, using a full suite of compositional analysis, including for the first time, single-grain trace element data. These data demonstrate the strong compositional coherence of Vedde Ash deposits. However, comparison with major, minor, and trace element compositional data from several other distally-described Icelandic tephras reveals that both before and after the Younger Dryas chronozone, there were eruptions that generated widespread tephra layers that have comparable glass shard compositions to the Vedde Ash. This implies that these numerous events not only hail from the same volcanic system, but that the melts share similar crystallisation trends and mixing patterns prior to eruption. It seems therefore that composition alone is insufficient for the correlation of some widespread tephra layers: good stratigraphic information and/or robust dating control are also essential.

The objectives are to evaluate cooling and energy performance of this system and formulate a numerical model based on measurements. Experimentation has been carried out using commercial servers. A substantial instrumentation has been conducted at different scales (servers, rack and exchanger). Several tests have been made with different sets of parameters like water inlet temperature or power dissipated by servers. In each case, the heat exchanger has removed more than 90% of electrical power consumed by the rack (with no chiller use). Furthermore, promising results are obtained with this system, especially the reduction of energy consumption of cooling part compared to traditional air cooling. Finally, the rack and heat exchanger are simplified into two numerical models which can predict temperature outputs as a function of defined inputs (water and air flow rate and temperature, power dissipation). Validation tests have been carried out with different sequences of measure and numerical models have given satisfactory results. They will be duplicated to compute the impact of this cooling system at a data center room scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the incidence and ecological factors associated with marine debris ingestion in Procellariiformes by examining seabirds collected at a global seabird hotspot, the Australasian - Southern Ocean boundary. We examined marine debris ingestion trends in 1734 individuals of 51 Procellariform species, finding significant variation in the incidence of marine debris abundance among species. Variation in the incidence of marine debris ingestion between species was influenced by the taxonomy, foraging ecology, diet, and foraging range overlaps with oceanic regions polluted with marine debris. Among the ecological drivers of marine debris ingestion variability in Procellariiformes, we demonstrate that the combination of taxonomy, foraging method, diet, and exposure to marine debris are the most important determinants of incidence of ingestion. We use these results to develop a global forecast for Procellariiform taxa at the risk of highest incidence of marine debris ingestion. We find seabirds that forage at the surface; especially by surface seizing, diving and filtering, those with a crustacean dominant diet, and those that forage in or near marine debris hotspots are at highest risk of debris ingestion. We predict that family with the highest risk are the storm petrels (Hydrobatidae and Oceanitidae). We demonstrate that the greater the exposure of high-risk groups to marine debris while foraging, the greater the incidence and number of marine debris items will be ingested.","[Roman, Lauren; Wilcox, Chris; Hardesty, Britta Denise] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Roman, Lauren; Hindell, Mark] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Bell, Elizabeth] Wildlife Management Int, Blenheim, New Zealand; [Hindell, Mark] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst CRC, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Roman, L (corresponding author), CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Roman, L (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",lauren.roman@utas.edu.au,"Roman, Lauren T/K-3804-2015","Roman, Lauren T/0000-0003-3591-4905; Hindell, Mark/0000-0002-7823-7185","Auckland War Memorial Museum; Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital; Australian Museum; Australian Seabird Rescue Inc; BirdLife Australia; BirdLife Tasmania; Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary; Currumbin Sanctuary Wildlife Hospital; Department of Conservation (New Zealand); Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (QLD Australia); Department of Environment and Science (QLD Australia); Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS Australia); Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA Australia); Friends of Shorebirds SA; Holistic Vets Tauranga; Melbourne Museum; Moreton Bay Research Station; Ornithological Society of New Zealand; Pelican and Seabird Rescue; Queensland Museum; RSPCA QLD Wildlife Hospital; South Australian Museum; Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery; Te Papa Museum; University of Queensland; University of Western Australia; Wildlife Management International; BirdLife Australia's Australian Bird Environment Foundation; Australian Wildlife Society; Ecological Society of Australia's Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment","Auckland War Memorial Museum; Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital; Australian Museum; Australian Seabird Rescue Inc; BirdLife Australia; BirdLife Tasmania; Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary; Currumbin Sanctuary Wildlife Hospital; Department of Conservation (New Zealand); Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (QLD Australia); Department of Environment and Science (QLD Australia); Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS Australia); Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA Australia); Friends of Shorebirds SA; Holistic Vets Tauranga; Melbourne Museum; Moreton Bay Research Station; Ornithological Society of New Zealand; Pelican and Seabird Rescue; Queensland Museum; RSPCA QLD Wildlife Hospital; South Australian Museum; Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery; Te Papa Museum; University of Queensland(University of Queensland); University of Western Australia; Wildlife Management International; BirdLife Australia's Australian Bird Environment Foundation; Australian Wildlife Society; Ecological Society of Australia's Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment","The authors would like to acknowledge the following Australian and New Zealand organizations who have supported this project, provided facilities and storage, and assisted with the collection of seabirds for this study: Auckland War Memorial Museum, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, Australian Museum, Australian Seabird Rescue Inc, BirdLife Australia, BirdLife Tasmania, Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, Currumbin Sanctuary Wildlife Hospital, Department of Conservation (New Zealand), Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (QLD Australia), Department of Environment and Science (QLD Australia), Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS Australia), Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA Australia), Friends of Shorebirds SA, Holistic Vets Tauranga, Melbourne Museum, Moreton Bay Research Station, Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Pelican and Seabird Rescue, Queensland Museum, RSPCA QLD Wildlife Hospital, South Australian Museum, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Te Papa Museum, University of Queensland, University of Western Australia and Wildlife Management International.

These sediments are dated by the C-14 method in the case of organic remains, by counting annual laminations in lacustrine facies, and by dendrochronological method in the case of fluvial sediments. The existence of well dated profiles enables to reconstruct various climatic parameters like amplitudes of seasonal temperatures, types and frequency of extreme rainfalls and floods and, finally, to distinguish rare rapid changes and most frequent gradual ones. This reconstruction is based on the analogous effects of various types of present-day rainfalls. The current authors present a critical review of existing chronostratigraphic divisions starting from simple millennial division by Mangerud based on Scandinavian palynological stratigraphy of peat-bogs and Starkel's concept based on fluctuations in rainfall and runoff regime reflected in fluvial and other facies of continental deposits. In the last decades, the calibration of C-14 dates allowed a new approach to be used for the construction of the probability distribution function of these dates in various facies or types of sediments, which formed a background for distinguishing and correlating climatic phases and defining boundaries between them. These approaches have been creating new opportunities for revision of the existing chronostratigraphy. The aim of this paper is to present a revised version of chronostratigraphic division based on climatic fluctuations reflected in various facies of sediments on the territory of Poland and discuss their correlation with other European regions and global climatic changes.","[Michczynska, Danuta J.; Pazdur, Anna] Silesian Tech Univ, Inst Phys, GADAM Ctr Excellence, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland; [Starkel, Leszek] Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Dept Geomorphol & Hydrol Mt & Uplands PAS, PL-31018 Krakow, Poland; [Krapiec, Marek] Univ Sci & Technol, AGH, Fac Geol Geophys & Environm Protect, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Margielewski, Wlodzimierz] Inst Nat Conservat PAS, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Nalepka, Dorota] W Szafer Inst Bot PAS, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland",Silesian University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; AGH University of Science & Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; W.

State environmental and interstate water authorities take different approaches to managing these withdrawals. In the Upper Ohio River Basin, which covers the western third of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection requires that all water sources used for development have an approved water management plan. For surface water sources the plans stipulate the amount and timing of withdrawals from each source as a function of annual streamflow statistics. Neighboring regulatory authorities and some environmental groups now favor the use of monthly streamflow statistics to establish the conditions for water withdrawals. Our analysis indicates that, given the state of flow measurement data in the Upper streamflow statistics are more likely to prevent water withdrawals during the driest times of the year when aquatic ecosystems are most stressed, and to result in fewer and smaller occurrences of computed low-flow ecodeficits.","[Mitchell, Austin L.; Small, Mitchell; Casman, Elizabeth A.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Casman, EA (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave,Baker Hall 129, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",casman@andrew.cmu.edu,,"Casman, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5617-6521","Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM), Department of Engineering and Public Policy; National Science Foundation [SES-0345798]; Carnegie Mellon University; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; John and Claire Bertucci Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0949710] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM), Department of Engineering and Public Policy; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Carnegie Mellon University; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); John and Claire Bertucci Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We express our thanks to Jeanne VanBriesen for her insightful feedback throughout the drafting of this paper.

For the global chemistry model, the NASA LaRC-University of Wisconsin Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) with a global ozone assimilation framework was used. RAQMS simulation results were downscaled with a RAQMS-CMAQ linkage tool (RAQ2CMAQ) to provide dynamic lateral boundary conditions for regional air quality simulations with the EPA Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model. We performed two sets of CMAQ simulations; (1) with the predefined lateral boundary condition profile representing relatively clean air conditions in the eastern-half of the United States, and (2) with the lateral boundary conditions generated from RAQMS 6 hourly analyses, for the 1999 Southern Oxidant Study (SOS-99) period (15 June-14 July 1999). When compared and evaluated with available ozone soundings and nation wide surface observations (AIRS/EPA) in U. S., CMAQ simulations with the lateral boundary condition from the predefined profile failed to simulate the so-called chemical tropopause'' above which O-3 concentration rapidly increases with height. On the other hand, the simulations with the lateral boundary condition provided with the global RAQMS output not only improved diurnal variations and daily maxima of surface O-3 concentrations, but also produced better agreement with the vertical structure of O-3 measured in the middle and upper troposphere. The tracer mode CMAQ simulations showed that, at the upper troposphere, more than 85% of the O-3 concentration difference associated with the lateral BCs was caused by the transport and diffusion processes.","[Song, C. -K.; Byun, D.

Trend estimates can be derived from population surveys or models, but both methods are associated with sources of uncertainty. Many Arctic-breeding shorebirds are thought to be declining based on migration and/or overwintering population surveys, but data are lacking to estimate the trends of some shorebird species. In addition, for most species, little is known about the stage(s) at which population bottlenecks occur, such as breeding vs. nonbreeding periods. We used previously published and unpublished estimates of vital rates to develop the first large-scale population models for 6 species of Arctic-breeding shorebirds in North America, including separate estimates for 3 subspecies of Dunlin. We used the models to estimate population trends and identify life stages at which population growth may be limited. Our model for the arcticola subspecies of Dunlin agreed with previously published information that the subspecies is severely declining. Our results also linked the decline to the subspecies' low annual adult survival rate, thus potentially implicating factors during the nonbreeding period in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. However, our trend estimates for all species showed high uncertainty, highlighting the need for more accurate and precise estimates of vital rates. Of the vital rates, annual adult survival had the strongest influence on population trend in all taxa. Improving the accuracy, precision, and spatial and temporal coverage of estimates of vital rates, especially annual adult survival, would improve demographic model-based estimates of population trends and help direct management to regions or seasons where birds are subject to higher mortality.","[Weiser, Emily L.; Ward, David H.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Lanctot, Richard B.; Saalfeld, Sarah T.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Migratory Bird Management, Anchorage, AK USA; [Brown, Stephen C.] Manomet Inc, Manomet, MA USA; [Gates, H.

Thus, any decision making is directly related to analytical procedures and management of a wide range of information (technological, environmental, economic and social). Multi-criteria analysis is a valuable tool, which is suitable to assemble and to manage many variables (quantitative as well as qualitative ones), assessed in different ways, thus offering reliable support for decision making. This analysis scopes to facilitate the photovoltaic (PV) integration in buildings, which combines benefits from shading, power generation, and esthetics. This paper performs a multi-criteria analysis of monocrystalline PV panels mounted on typical south facing shading devices of office buildings in the Mediterranean region. In total, thirteen different options of shading devices were assessed against a series of criteria which include PV panels' energy production, buildings' energy optimization criteria (heating-cooling-lighting loads) and users' comfort criteria (outdoor view-glare-esthetic aspects). Six different rankings were obtained by the analysis, each one reflecting the priorities and interests of different economic and social groups involved in the design and promotion of integrated PV systems in buildings. The analysis revealed that Brise soleil full facade is the most proper shading device when the PV system is mounted on it; in contrary Canopy inclined double or Louvers horizontal inwards inclined or Simple window seem to be the least suitable.

However, the satellite can only provide 2-D land surface temperature (LST) and not complete surface temperature (T-c) which integrates the horizontal and vertical urban surface temperatures. The thermal anisotropy is very much prominent in the urban system; therefore, T-c may be more important than the 2-D LST for SUHII study. Furthermore, the 3-D LST measurement of a real urban is limited. In this letter, we measured a building's 3-D surface temperatures in Beijing, China, and the roof temperature (T-roof) was assumed as satellite measurement. The SUHII using Troof (SUHII_T-roof) and T-c (SUHII_T-c), as well as air urban heat island intensity (AUHII) were compared. Results showed that: 1) the building's thermal anisotropy was evident with 18 K between roof and north wall at noon; 2) SUHII_T-c during the day was actually a cold island, while SUHII_T-roof was a heat island, caused by the different diurnal variation of T-c and T-roof; and 3) The SUHII_T-roof has diurnal maximum value in daytime and minimum value in nighttime, which is opposite to AUHII. However, the diurnal pattern of SUHII_T-c is similar to AUHII which is like the shape of a spoon. This letter preliminarily explores the building's thermal anisotropy on SUHII and could be an important reference for urban SUHII study at microscale.","[Li, Nana] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Li, Nana] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaoma] Hunan Agr Univ, Sch Landscape Architecture & Art Design, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China","China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS; Hunan Agricultural University","Li, NN (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China.;Li, NN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",nnli@ium.cn; lxm733@163.com,"Li, Nana/A-9922-2014","Li, Nana/0000-0001-9151-7803","Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science [OFSLRSS201803]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [IUMKY201902, IUMKY202002]","Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",This work was supported in part by the Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science under Grant OFSLRSS201803 and in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. IUMKY201902 and IUMKY202002).,,33,3,4,9,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

The analysis of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs in natural records evidenced how the adoption of farming and new sedentary settlement patterns resulted in major landscape transformation on extra-local or regional scales in the Western Mediterranean, affecting sclerophyllous and riparian forests in North Corsica, Mediterranean maquis in South Corsica, and oak forests in NE Iberia. In addition, palynology has been confirmed as a relevant source of data to address the local palaeoenvironmental evolution in lakes, wetlands, and archaeological sites, providing evidence of the presence of flocks (spores of coprophilous fungi), and changes in hydrology (salinity, dryness/wetness, aquatic/palustrine phases) and in geomorphology (soil erosion indicators). Finally, the spatial analysis of pollen and NPP intra-site distribution is presented here as a valuable tool to assess the social use of space in archaeological sites. In that sense, archaeopalynology has provided detailed information about site formation processes, social use of space, and the use of plants and fungi in the site of La Draga (Girona, Spain).","[Revelles, Jordi] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Revelles, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Revelles, J (corresponding author), Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain.;Revelles, J (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain.",jordi.revelles@gmail.com,"Revelles, Jordi/F-4212-2016","Revelles, Jordi/0000-0003-4803-9513","Juan de la Cierva-Formacion contract (FJC2017) (MCINN, Spain), in the research group GAPS [2017 SGR 836]; MCINN in the programme of Units of Excellence 'Maria de Maeztu' [CEX2019-000945-M]; PCR Approchegeoarcheologique des paysages de Corse al'Holocene, entre mer etinterieur des terres.

In extreme environments such as the high Alpine main ridge and adjacent areas, highly adaptive subsistence strategies were required to exploit natural resources available in the subalpine and alpine zones. Such strategies were determined by changing environmental, social, and economic conditions. To investigate the relationships between settlement dynamics, human impact, and Holocene climatic changes, we studied the valleys of the Silvretta Massif in the central Eastern Alps between the Paznaun (Austria) and Lower Engadine valleys (Switzerland). We are presenting new archaeological, palaeoecological, and pedological evidence of continuous human activities from the Early Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age (similar to 5,500-800 BC). This evidence sheds new light on the beginnings of intensified human impact on the high mountainous landscape, i.e. activities beyond Mesolithic hunting along the timberline. Archaeological data suggest a shift in subsistence strategies from hunting to herding at the end of the Neolithic Period (similar to 2,800-2,500 BC). While palaeoecological data confirm this trend, they also indicate potentially earlier human and livestock impact through forest clearances by fire and grazing from about 4,200 BC onwards. In addition to archaeological sites and peat bogs, soils in high-altitude regions prove to be appropriate archives indicating former vegetation cover, shifts of timberline altitudes as well as disturbance of soil formation by human activity such as by slash-and-burn and by livestock grazing.","[Kothieringer, Katja; Walser, Christoph; Lambers, Karsten] Univ Bamberg, Inst Archaeol Heritage Sci & Art Hist, Digital Geoarchaeol Grp, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany; [Dietre, Benjamin; Haas, Jean Nicolas] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Bot, Res Grp Palynol & Archaeobotany, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Reitmaier, Thomas] Archaeol Serv Canton Grisons, CH-7000 Chur, Switzerland",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; University of Innsbruck,"Kothieringer, K (corresponding author), Univ Bamberg, Inst Archaeol Heritage Sci & Art Hist, Digital Geoarchaeol Grp, Kranen 14, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",katja.kothieringer@uni-bamberg.de; christoph.walser@uni-bamberg.de; benjamin.dietre@uibk.ac.at; Thomas.Reitmaier@adg.gr.ch; Jean-Nicolas.Haas@uibk.ac.at; karsten.lambers@uni-bamberg.de,"Haas, Jean Nicolas/I-8835-2018","Lambers, Karsten/0000-0001-6432-0925; Dietre, Benjamin/0000-0002-9959-3613",Herzog Sellenberg Foundation; Dr. Erich Ritter Foundation (Germany),Herzog Sellenberg Foundation; Dr. Erich Ritter Foundation (Germany),"The research for this study was generously supported by the Herzog Sellenberg Foundation and the Dr. Erich Ritter Foundation (Germany) within the framework of their joint funding program Climate Change in the Alps: Junior Research Groups.

In the present article the structure of a Research and Development publicly funded inter-organizational project with its deliverables and milestones is analysed, since it can enhance the development of real eco-innovation. In particular the technical and managerial experience gained during EU-funded FP7 project called HarWin (Harvesting solar energy with multifunctional glass-polymer windows) is reported. The project aimed at designing innovative smart windows with polymer-glass composite glazing and framing. As Life Cycle Assessment has been increasingly explicitly required in R&D projects, efforts have been dedicated to enlarge knowledge on the development of specific tailored LCA methods and tools and on the application of LCA in inter-organizational R&D projects in general. The specific method developed and systematically tested within the project to assess the environmental burden associated to the life cycle of windows at the R&D stage is reported. The specific tool that has been developed to allow environmental data gathering and direct involvement of the design team in the environmentally conscious design of the window is also described, highlighting its experienced benefits. The management of the HarWin project has been analysed and, reported in order to identify strengths and weaknesses for the integration of environmental aspects and of LCA in particular.

Estimates of the global ocean contribution to N2O emissions average 21% (range: 10 to 53%). Ongoing environmental changes such as warming, deoxygenation and acidification are affecting oceanic N2O cycling and emissions to the atmosphere. International activities over the last decades aimed at improving estimates of global N2O emissions, including (i) the MarinE MethanE and NiTrous Oxide database (MEMENTO) for archiving of quality-controlled data, and (ii) a recent large-scale inter-laboratory comparison by Working Group 143 of the Scientific Committee on Ocean Research (SCOR). To reduce uncertainties in oceanic N2O emission estimates and to characterize the spatial and temporal variability in N2O distributions in a changing ocean, we propose the establishment of a harmonized N2O Observation Network (N2O-ON) combining discrete and continuous data from various platforms. The network will integrate observations obtained by calibrated techniques, using time series measurements at fixed stations and repeated hydrographic sections on voluntary observing ships and research vessels. In addition to exploiting existing oceanographic infrastructure, we propose the establishment of central calibration facilities in selected international laboratories to improve accuracy, and ensure standardization and comparability of N2O measurements. Final data products will include a harmonized global N2O concentration and emission fields for use in model validation and projections of future oceanic N2O emissions, to inform the global research community and policy makers.","[Bange, Hermann W.; Arevalo-Martinez, Damian L.; Kock, Annette] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiei, Kiel, Germany; [de la Paz, Mercedes] Ctr Oceanograf A Coruna, IEO, La Coruna, Spain; [Farias, Laura] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2, Dept Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile; [Kaiser, Jan] Univ East Anglia, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Law, Cliff S.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Law, Cliff S.] Univ Otago Dunedin, Dept Chem, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Rees, Andrew P.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Rehder, Gregor] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res Warnemunde, Dept Menne Chem, Rostock, Germany; [Tortell, Philippe D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Upstill-Goddard, Robert C.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Wilson, Samuel T.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Universidad de Concepcion; University of East Anglia; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; University of British Columbia; Newcastle University - UK; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Bange, HW (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiei, Kiel, Germany.",hbange@geomar.de,"Arévalo-Martínez, Damian Leonardo/AAH-5325-2020; de la Paz, Mercedes/Y-4285-2019; Kaiser, Jan/D-3327-2009","Arévalo-Martínez, Damian Leonardo/0000-0003-2933-1586; de la Paz, Mercedes/0000-0002-9267-930X; Kaiser, Jan/0000-0002-1553-4043; Tortell, Philippe/0000-0003-0212-2151; Wilson, Samuel/0000-0002-7289-0909",SCOR - United States National Science Foundation [OCE-1840868]; EU FP7 project InGOS [284274]; FONDAP [1511009]; FONDECYT [1161138]; INICIO project [CTM2015-74510-JIN]; United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K002473/1]; BONUS INTEGRAL Project - BONUS (Art 185); EU; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Swedish Research Council Formas; Academy of Finland; Polish National Centre for Research and Development; Estonian Research Council; Kiel Data Management Team at GEOMAR,SCOR - United States National Science Foundation; EU FP7 project InGOS; FONDAP; FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); INICIO project; United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); BONUS INTEGRAL Project - BONUS (Art 185); EU(European Commission); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Polish National Centre for Research and Development; Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Kiel Data Management Team at GEOMAR,"We thank SCOR for its generous support of WG 143 activities which were funded, in part, by a grant from the United States National Science Foundation (Grant OCE-1840868) to SCOR.

A map of the areas having the highest probabilities of occurrence of megalithic monuments was developed, and showed that megalithic monuments are located in relatively accessible areas having gentle gradients and low terrain ruggedness close to the fluvial network, with wide U-shaped glacial valleys being the preferred locations. The altitudinal distribution showed one concentration of dolmens and stone circles at relatively low elevation (1250-1400 m a.s.l.) in the mid montane belt, and another at high elevation, at approximately the level of the timberline (1750-1900 m a.s.l.) adjacent to the alpine belt. Today, both areas are pastures that have historically sustained livestock, the traditional economic basis of Pyrenean valleys. The map showing the probability of occurrence of megalithic monuments in the study area suggests that a number of potentially favorable areas were largely inaccessible or too far from the main livestock routes, and remained forested until the Middle Ages. These findings and a variety of archaeological studies contribute to propose that the first shepherds: (i) understood the altitudinal organization of mountain areas; (ii) used the best accessible flat areas in the mid montane belt in late spring and early summer; and (iii) used the upper subalpine/alpine belt in summer.","[Montes, Lourdes] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Univ Ciencias Ambientales, Area Prehist, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Sebastian, Maria] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Univ Ciencias Ambientales, Area Didact Ciencias Sociales, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Domingo, Rafael] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Univ Patrimonio & Humanidades, Area Prehist, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Begueria, Santiago] Consejo Super Invest Cient EEAD CSIC, Estn Expt Aula, Campus Aula,POB 13-034, Zaragoza 50080, Spain; [Garcia-Ruiz, Jose M.] Consejo Super Invest Cient IPE CSIC, Inst Pirena Ecol, Campus Aula,POB 13-034, Zaragoza 50080, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE),"Montes, L (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Inst Univ Ciencias Ambientales, Area Prehist, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.",lmontes@unizar.es,"Beguería, Santiago/A-7269-2010; García-Ruiz, José M./D-4535-2012; SEBASTIAN LOPEZ, MARIA/E-2283-2015","Beguería, Santiago/0000-0002-3974-2947; García-Ruiz, José M./0000-0002-8535-817X; SEBASTIAN LOPEZ, MARIA/0000-0002-7646-0826","MINECO-AEI/FEDER, Spain/EU [HAR2017-85023-P, CGL2015-65569-R, PID2019-105983RB-100]; Aragon Government [H14_17R, E02_17E]","MINECO-AEI/FEDER, Spain/EU; Aragon Government(Gobierno de Aragon)","This research was supported by the ESPAS (CGL2015-65569-R), the MANMOUNT PID2019-105983RB-100) and the Gaps and Sites (HAR2017-85023-P) projects, funded by the MINECO-AEI/FEDER, Spain/EU; and by the Research Groups from the Aragon Government (H14_17R and E02_17E).

To do this, we start by defining 'futures', and, more specifically, the different kinds of futures at stake in changing landscapes. We discuss how rapid environmental change not only puts immediate pressure on identifying alternative futures for landscapes, but also threatens to unsettle patterns of attachment to the landscape. We then explore different ways of managing tensions and consider strategies that have been used for breaking down binary divisions that may stymie informed and integrated decision-making. We conclude by adapting a five-point framework that incorporates uncertainty and environmental change when making decisions about landscape futures.","[Bartolini, Nadia; DeSilvey, Caitlin] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, England",University of Exeter,"Bartolini, N (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, England.",n.bartolini@exeter.ac.uk,,,Landscape Research Group,Landscape Research Group,This work was kindly supported by the Landscape Research Group in its call for a commissioned review on Landscape Futures.

A cold northern city of China was chosen as the research city. The coupling relationships of 30 points between the urban morphology and Outdoor Environment Performance (OEP) at the pedestrian level were analyzed at different scales. Then five different function blocks of education, commerce, industry, residence and parks were selected as the ENVI-met simulation models. The results indicate that an area of 500 m range represents the suitable range to analyze the OEP, block size, building density, building height and green space are closely related. The simulation results indicate that air temperature, relative humidity and wind environment differ in land-use categories and urban forms. Urban forms significantly affect human health and comfort at the pedestrian level. This study proposes appropriate urban arrangements and building layouts to lessen the effects of UHIs in various land-use categories. This study contributes to architectural design and urban planning at the 500 m range of the city block.

While previous work has focused on decision rules based on adaptive expectations, the present work expands this analysis by explicitly incorporating customers' attitude toward risk to study the impact of risk aversion on the collective behavior and the average system sojourn time. The customers' decision process is modeled using adaptive expectations and incorporating the uncertainty involved in these expectations. Customers update their expectations based on their own experience and that of their neighbors. Simulation analysis is used to compare the aggregated behavior for different degrees of customer risk aversion. Risk-neutral customers base their decisions only on their expected sojourn time, while risk-averse customers account for uncertainty by estimating an upper bound of the sojourn times. The results indicate that the more risk-averse the customers, the longer the transient period, and the more slowly the system converges to an almost stable average sojourn time. Systems where customers have an intermediate level of risk aversion achieve the worst average sojourn times.","[Delgado-Alvarez, Carlos A.] Politecn Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid, Fac Business, Carrera 48 7-151, Medellin, Colombia; [van Ackere, Ann] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC, Quartier UNIL Dorigny Batiment Anthropole, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Larsen, Erik R.] Aarhus Univ Business & Social Sci, Dept Management, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",University of Lausanne; Aarhus University,"Delgado-Alvarez, CA (corresponding author), Politecn Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid, Fac Business, Carrera 48 7-151, Medellin, Colombia.",cadelgado@elpoli.edu.co; ann.vanackere@unil.ch; erik.larsen@mgmt.au.dk,,"Delgado Alvarez, Carlos Arturo/0000-0003-1311-7841","Swiss National Science Foundation [100012-116564, 100014-126584]",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grants 100012-116564 and 100014-126584).,,43,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0969-6016,1475-3995,,INT T OPER RES,Int.

Several analytical techniques were applied: Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). The results allowed to build a complex scenario in terms of exploitation of raw materials and technological choices. The raw materials indicate a volcanic environment and correspond to the geological settings of the territory of Samshvilde. The glazed ceramics were characterised as alkali, low alkali - low lead, lead, high lead and tin-opacified mixed-alkaline lead glazes.

HALOE measurements of HCl profiles show that this seasonal cycle in the column is controlled by the seasonal variations of the mass and composition of the lowermost stratosphere. The seasonal maxima are produced by wintertime downward transport of stratospheric air. We hypothesize that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle is quantitatively related to the strength of the stratospheric residual circulation and stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). We investigate this relationship using a multi-decadal simulation from the GSFC Chemistry and Transport Model driven by output from a general circulation model in which an STE trend exists. We also examine the ground-based record of HCl measurements at Jungfraujoch for evidence of a trend in the HCl seasonal amplitude that would be a signature of a long-term change in the stratospheric circulation.,"Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Catonsville, MD 21228 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Olsen, MA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Catonsville, MD 21228 USA.",olsen@code613-3.gsfc.nasa.gov,"Olsen, Mark/H-2329-2012; Stolarski, Richard/B-8499-2013; Douglass, Anne R/D-4655-2012","Olsen, Mark/0000-0002-6420-987X; Stolarski, Richard/0000-0001-8722-4012; ",,,,,18,1,1,0,2,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

In principle, the premise of interdisciplinarity may appear to have many strengths; yet, the extent to which interdisciplinarity is embraced by the current generation of academics, the benefits and risks for doing so, and the barriers and facilitators to achieving interdisciplinarity, represent inherent challenges. Much has been written on the topic of interdisciplinarity, but to our knowledge there have been few attempts to consider and present diverse perspectives from scholars, artists, and scientists in a cohesive manner. As a team of 57 members from the Canadian College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada (the College) who self-identify as being engaged or interested in interdisciplinarity, we provide diverse intellectual, cultural, and social perspectives. The goal of this paper is to share our collective wisdom on this topic with the broader community and to stimulate discourse and debate on the merits and challenges associated with interdisciplinarity. Perhaps the clearest message emerging from this exercise is that working across established boundaries of scholarly communities is rewarding, necessary, and is more likely to result in impact. However, there are barriers that limit the ease with which this can occur (e.g., lack of institutional structures and funding to facilitate cross-disciplinary exploration). Occasionally, there can be significant risk associated with doing interdisciplinary work (e.g., lack of adequate measurement or recognition of work by disciplinary peers). Solving many of the world's complex and pressing problems (e.g., climate change, sustainable agriculture, the burden of chronic disease, and aging populations) demands thinking and working across long-standing, but in some ways restrictive, academic boundaries. Academic institutions and key support structures, especially funding bodies, will play an important role in helping to realize what is readily apparent to all who contributed to this paper-that interdisciplinarity is essential for solving complex problems; it is the new norm. Failure to empower and encourage those doing this research will serve as a great impediment to training, knowledge, and addressing societal issues.","[Cooke, Steven; Nguyen, Vivian M.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Anastakis, Dimitry] Trent Univ, Hist Dept, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada; [Scott, Shannon D.] Univ Alberta, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad, Fac Nursing, 11405-87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada; [Turetsky, Merritt R.; Norris, D.

This cranium is more damaged than Minatogawa I and exhibits some clear post-mortem distortion. We reconstructed the endocranium of this specimen after correcting the distortion and breakage by combining digital and manual restoration procedures, and established a reliable estimate for its endocranial volume (ECV) to be around 1170 cc. As with the case of Minatogawa I, this result confirmed the suggestion of previous work that the Minatogawa series has small ECVs compared with modern Japanese and Jomon populations. Some dental and osteological conditions, such as heavy tooth wear as well as Harris's lines of the long bones, suggest a possibility that the small ECV of the Minatogawa people as well as their short stature might have been caused in part by a stunting of growth due to undernutrition and possibly a microevolutionary adaptation to the food-limited insular environments.","[Kubo, Daisuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kono, Reiko T.] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Anthropol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Museum of Nature and Science,"Kubo, D (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",dkubo@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17107006],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The authors thank Drs Gen Suwa (University Museum, The University of Tokyo) and Naomichi Ogihara (Keio University) for access to the collections under their care.

Archeological evidence suggests that both groups practised maize agriculture and pastoralism, but that their interaction zones differed significantly. Marine resources are common at Pica-Tarapaca sites, even those far from coast, while Atacama sites in the desert oases and precordilleran area seem to have directed their networks towards the highlands. Here we apply stable carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope analysis on human bone and enamel to test dietary patterns and residential mobility at two sites, Pica 8 and Quitor 6, representing the Pica-Tarapaca and Atacama cultures, respectively. Our results show that diet at the two sites indeed differed: significant but variable consumption of marine resources and maize is indicated at Pica 8, despite being an inland site, while diet at Quitor 6 was based mainly on terrestrial resources. The use of seabird guano and llama dung as fertilizers and extreme aridity may have contributed to the high nitrogen isotope values observed in Pica 8 humans. The O-18 values in Pica 8 individuals are generally lower than for Quitor in spite of its greater distance from the Andes. All three isotopes suggest the presence of at least five nonlocals in the 30 measured at Pica 8. This evidence for human mobility is consistent with the high levels of trade and interaction observed in the archeological record, and begins to quantify the degree of movement of specific individuals.

C-14 in tree rings and Be-10 in ice cores from polar regions are often used to retrieve accurate histories of galactic cosmic rays. However, the variation in C-14 produced in the atmosphere is strongly attenuated in the carbon cycle and the amplitude of decadal scale variations in tree rings is approximately 0.2 parts per thousand. In the case of Be-10 in ice cores, the variation remains at a relatively large amplitude; however, the records are accompanied by dating uncertainties. Another material that contains Be-10 is sediment in continental areas. Terrestrial carbonate deposits sometimes form clear annual layers; however, detailed analyses on such deposits have not yet been widely conducted. Therefore, we evaluate the possibility of retrieving information concerning the galactic cosmic ray flux from the terrestrial carbonate deposits. In this paper, we report our preliminary results obtained from the measurements of Be-10 in travertine and tufa samples from South China. We find that the Be-10 flux obtained from the travertines is comparable to the level produced by galactic cosmic rays and that travertines might have potential as a tool for investigating past cosmic-ray variations with annual resolution.","[Miyahara, Hiroko; Sakashita, Wataru; Xu, Hongyang] Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, Tokyo 1878505, Japan; [Horiuchi, Kazuho] Hirosaki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan; [Sakashita, Wataru] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Matsuzaki, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Univ Museum, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Xu, Hongyang; Zhou, Limin] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Limin] East China Normal Univ, Inst Ecochongming, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",Hirosaki University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; University of Tokyo; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Miyahara, H (corresponding author), Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, Tokyo 1878505, Japan.",miyahara@musabi.ac.jp,"Miyahara, Hiroko/GPX-4725-2022; Zhou, Li/GSE-4531-2022",,"JSPS KAKENHI [15K13488, 15H05816, 15K21709, 25287051, 25247082]; NSFC [41571040]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15K13488, 15H05816, 15K21709, 25287051, and 25247082.

Pollen records from terrestrial and marine sediment sequences reveal patterns not usually visible in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from archaeological sites alone and show that hominin evolution took place against a background of marked environmental change as forests expanded and contracted in concert with global and regional climatic shifts. It is rare to find archaeological material in stratigraphically long and continuous palaeoenvironmental sequences, yet this is what is needed to enable particular phases of hominin evolution to be securely associated with climatic and environmental changes. At the well-known Middle Pleistocene archaeological site of Ceprano in Italy we have been able to produce a pollen record from the sedimentary unit directly below the stratum of the hominin remains. The new pollen data from Ceprano are presented here in full for the first time and provide a detailed picture of interglacial vegetation development during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 13. This evidence contributes significantly to our knowledge of the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem responses to climatic change during this period and helps to further constrain the age of the hominin remains. New sites combining both archaeology and long, continuous high quality palaeoecological records would help clarify the relationship between hominin presence and palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions. In the meantime, better communication between the research communities can also go a long way to improving our understanding of the links between the two. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, we identified similar, coastal, middle-sized catchments to which conclusions from this study could be applicable. The first modelling scenario based on extrapolation of the existing trends affected the modelled nutrient loads by less than 5%. In the second scenario, measures included in RBMPs showed variable effectiveness, ranging from negligible for Slupia to 28% total P load reduction in Vantaanjoki. Adding spatially targeted measures to RBMPs (third scenario) would considerably improve their effectiveness in all three catchments for both total N and P, suggesting a need to adopt targeting more widely in the Baltic Sea countries.","[Piniewski, Mikolaj; Gielczewski, Marek; Marcinkowski, Pawel; Okruszko, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydrol Meteorol & Water Management, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Tattari, Sirkka; Koskiaho, Jari] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Olsson, Olle] Stockholm Environm Inst SEI, Linnegatan 87D, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Djodjic, Faruk] Univ Agr Sci Uppsala, Lennart Hjelms Vag 9, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ksiezniak, Marta] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Remote Sensing & Environm Assessment, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Finnish Environment Institute; Stockholm Environment Institute; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Piniewski, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydrol Meteorol & Water Management, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",Mikolaj_Piniewski@sggw.edu.pl; sirkka.tattari@ymparisto.fi; jari.koskiaho@ymparisto.fi; olle.olsson@sei.org; Faruk.Djodjic@slu.se; Marek_Gielczewski@sggw.edu.pl; Pawel_Marcinkowski@sggw.edu.pl; Marta_Ksiezniak@sggw.edu.pl; Tomasz_Okruszko@sggw.edu.pl,"Piniewski, Mikolaj/A-5159-2012; Marcinkowski, Paweł/AAE-2343-2022","Piniewski, Mikolaj/0000-0001-7930-4549; Marcinkowski, Paweł/0000-0002-6000-9758; Koskiaho, Jari/0000-0001-9337-7592",BONUS [185]; EU; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA; Academy of Finland; National Centre for Research and Development in Poland; BONUS Secretariat,"BONUS; EU(European Commission); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA(Vinnova); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); National Centre for Research and Development in Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); BONUS Secretariat","This work is a part of the BONUS RETURN project (www.bonusreturn.eu).BONUS RETURN project is supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS, Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA, Academy of Finland and National Centre for Research and Development in Poland.

All currently used volatile anaesthetics are ozone-depleting halogenated compounds. The use of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) allows to induce the effect of general anaesthesia by administering drugs only intravenously without the use of anaesthetic gases. This allows you to create a protocol that is safe not only for the patient, but also for doctors and the environment. However, so far, no anaesthetic protocol based on induction of anaesthesia with tiletamine-zolazepam without the need to maintain anaesthesia with anaesthetic gas has been developed. Our study showed that the use of this combination of drugs for induction does not require the use of additional isoflurane to maintain anaesthesia. Thanks to Dixon's up-and-down method we proved that with the induction of anaesthesia with tiletamine-zolazepam at a dose of 5 mg/kg the use of isoflurane is not needed to maintain anaesthesia in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Until now, this dose has been recommended by the producer for more diagnostic than surgical procedures or for induction of general anaesthesia. The maintenance was required with anaesthetic gas or administration of another dose of the tiletamine-zolazepam. The results obtained in this study will allow for a significant reduction in the consumption of isoflurane, a gas co-responsible for the deepening of the greenhouse effect, having a negative impact on patients and surgeons. These results are certainly the first step to achieving a well-balanced and safe TIVA-based anaesthetic protocol using tiletamine-zolazepam, the obvious goal of which will be to maximize both the safety of the patient, people involved in surgical procedures, and the environment itself. Being aware of the problem of the greenhouse effect, we are committed to reducing the consumption of anaesthetic gases by replacing them with infusion agents.","[Lachowska, Sonia; Antonczyk, Agnieszka; Tunikowska, Joanna; Kielbowicz, Zdzislaw] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Dept & Clin Surg, Pl Grunwaldzki 51, PL-50366 Wroclaw, Poland; [Godniak, Martyna] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, Midlothian, Scotland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; University of Edinburgh,"Lachowska, S (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Dept & Clin Surg, Pl Grunwaldzki 51, PL-50366 Wroclaw, Poland.",sonia.lachowska@upwr.edu.pl,"Antończyk, Agnieszka/A-2707-2017","Antończyk, Agnieszka/0000-0003-2065-4223; Lachowska, Sonia/0000-0003-0773-2768",Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences,Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences,"The research is co-financed under the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019.

In culturally diverse social contexts, virtually every person experiences intercultural contact on a daily basis. It is essential to understand that there must be both cultural diversity and equity in social participation for true multiculturalism to exist in these settings. Beyond its core definition, it is clear that multiculturalism is a complex concept encompassing many dimensions and meanings. First, the term is understood to describe a demographic fact, indicating the existence of cultural diversity in a society. Second, multiculturalism refers to the policies and programs that are in place to manage intercultural relations and acculturation. Third, multiculturalism refers to psychological phenomena, including individual attitudes and ideologies that accept or reject the demographic, civic and policy features of multiculturalism. This chapter considers Canadian multiculturalism policy, examining how the multiple meanings of multiculturalism vary around the world. Within this framework, I highlight the psychological processes and outcomes of multiculturalism, particularly in connection with acculturation, adaptation and intercultural relations and consider whether these processes and outcomes differ for dominant and non-dominant groups. I suggest some ways in which to enhance the positive outcomes of intercultural contact and the resultant acculturation outcomes. Finally, this chapter sets the stage for the presentation of the other chapters in this volume. It elaborates three hypotheses derived from Canadian multiculturalism policy: the multiculturalism, integration and contact hypotheses.","[Berry, John] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Sci Educ Lab Sociocultural Res, Moscow, Russia; [Berry, John] Queens Univ, Dept Psychol, Kingston, ON, Canada",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Queens University - Canada,"Berry, J (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Sci Educ Lab Sociocultural Res, Moscow, Russia.;Berry, J (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Psychol, Kingston, ON, Canada.",jwberry@hse.ru,,,Russian Science Foundation [15-1800029]; Russian Science Foundation [15-18-00029] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 15-1800029).,,72,8,9,0,7,"LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM",MOSCOW,"UL MAKHOVAYA, DOM 11, STROENIE 9, MOSCOW, 125009, RUSSIA",2074-6857,2307-2202,,PSYCHOL RUSS,Psychol.

This study is focused on an experimental analysis of a transparent insulation facade (TIF) concept and the options for the prediction of its performance using building energy simulation (BES) modelling. A TIF prototype based on a transparent insulation material (TIM) and a selective absorber is tested and compared with a nonselective type of absorber. An experimental study was conducted involving full-scale climatic chamber and dynamic outdoor tests. The proposed TIF concept with a selective absorber and its solar effective layers provides the same thermal performance as conventional types of thermal insulation. As the TIM integration is potentially limited by overheating phenomena, a maximum cooling energy load obtained by dynamic outdoor conditions provides its real outdoor performance. The results show that a significant difference is measured when compared with the nonselective absorber type. Finally, a detailed comparative investigation of the thermal performance of both TIFs was conducted using the BES method. When applying the low-e functionality of the solar absorber, significant limitations were found specifically concerning the surface radiant heat exchange with the low emissivity surface affecting the air cavity enclosed zone.

The oxidation behavior of the two materials, which was studied in air at temperatures ranging from1000 to 1300 degrees C, was observed to be anisotropic and the materials exhibited a better oxidation resistance along a direction transverse to the c-axis. The correlation between the overall parabolic rate constant and oxidation temperature of both textured materials was characterized, providing new insights into the oxidation kinetics. The results indicate that the texturing has a negligible influence on the creep behavior in the assessed temperature range of 1000-1200 degrees C in air, for the applied stresses ranging from 40 to 80 MPa. In this stress regime, the creep behavior of textured Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2 appears to be controlled by grain boundary sliding. This behavior can be rationalized based on a model for superplastic deformation, indicating pure-shear motion under stationary conditions accommodated by lattice or grain-boundary diffusion.","[Li, Xiaoqiang; Schwaiger, Ruth; Malzbender, Juergen] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, Microstruct & Properties Mat IEK 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Xie, Xi; Yang, Rui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Met Res, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Gonzalez-Julian, Jesus] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Yang, Rui] ShanghaiTech Univ, Sch Creat & Art, Ctr Adapt Syst Engn, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China; [Schwaiger, Ruth] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Energy Engn Mat, D-52056 Aachen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Metal Research, CAS; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; ShanghaiTech University; RWTH Aachen University","Li, XQ (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, Microstruct & Properties Mat IEK 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany.;Yang, R (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Met Res, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",xi.li@fz-juelich.de; ryang@imr.ac.cn,"Schwaiger, Ruth/Q-4178-2016","Schwaiger, Ruth/0000-0001-8940-2361; Li, Xiaoqiang/0000-0003-1113-0364",China Scholarship Council of China [201808440373]; Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) under the MAXCOM project [03SF0534],China Scholarship Council of China(China Scholarship Council); Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) under the MAXCOM project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors would like to thank Dr. E.

The DPSIR framework is used for describing the cause-and-effect relationship between environmental im-pacts of transportation sector, and the X-Matrix to reveal the correlations between factors related to environ-mental impacts of transportation in the form of DPSIR framework and quantify causal relationships and dynamics between them. The results show that while indicators of 'Driving forces' and 'Pressures' categories have strong correlations, the correlations between indicators of Pressures-States and States-Impacts seem to be rather me-dium and weak. Urbanization rate, population growth rate, transportation GDP per capita and illiteracy rate are main driving forces that put pressures on the environment.

This study was designed to evaluate the capabilities and uncertainties of current CTMs simulations for Asia and to provide multi-model estimates of pollutant distributions. These models were run by 14 independent groups working in China, Japan, South Korea, the United States and other countries/regions. Compared with the previous phase of MICS-Asia (MICS-Asia II), the evaluation with observations was extended from 4 months to 1 full year across China and the western Pacific Rim. In general, model performance levels for O-3 varied widely by region and season. Most models captured the key patterns of monthly and diurnal variation of surface O-3 and its precursors in the North China Plain and western Pacific Rim but failed to do so for the Pearl River Delta. A significant overestimation of surface O-3 was evident from May to September/October and from January to May over the North China Plain, the western Pacific Rim and the Pearl River Delta. Comparisons drawn from observations show that the considerable diversity in O-3 photochemical production partly contributed to this overestimation and to high levels of inter-model variability in O-3 for North China. In terms of O-3 soundings, the ensemble average of models reproduced the vertical structure for the western Pacific, but overestimated O-3 levels to below 800 hPa in the summer. In the industrialized Pearl River Delta, the ensemble average presented an overestimation for the lower troposphere and an underestimation for the middle troposphere. The ensemble average of 13 models for O-3 did not always exhibit superior performance compared with certain individual models in contrast with its superior value for Europe. This finding suggests that the spread of ensemble-model values does not represent all of the uncertainties of O-3 or that most MICS-Asia III models missed key processes. This study improved the performance of modeling O-3 in March at Japanese sites compared with MICS-Asia II. However, it overpredicted surface O-3 concentrations for western Japan in July, which was not found by MICS-Asia II. Major challenges still remain with regard to identifying the sources of bias in surface O-3 over East Asia in CTMs.","[Li, Jie; Kong, Lei; Ge, Baozhu; Zhang, Meigen; Wang, Zhe; Wang, Zifa] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Boundary Layer Phys & Atmospher Chem LA, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China;

While citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientific practice, developments in sensing technology, data processing and visualization, and communication of ideas and results, are creating a wide range of new opportunities for public participation in scientific research. This paper reviews the state of citizen science in a hydrological context and explores the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional ways of scientific data collection and knowledge generation for hydrological sciences and water resources management. Although hydrological data collection often involves advanced technology, the advent of robust, cheap, and low-maintenance sensing equipment provides unprecedented opportunities for data collection in a citizen science context. These data have a significant potential to create new hydrological knowledge, especially in relation to the characterization of process heterogeneity, remote regions, and human impacts on the water cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected in citizen science experiments is potentially very different from those of traditional monitoring networks. This poses challenges in terms of their processing, interpretation, and use, especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge, the quantification of uncertainties, and their role in decision support. It also requires care in designing citizen science projects such that the generated data complement optimally other available knowledge. Lastly, using 4 case studies from remote mountain regions we reflect on the challenges and opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented citizen science in water resources management, the role of scientific knowledge in the decision-making process, and the potential contestation to established community institutions posed by co-generation of new knowledge.","[Buytaert, Wouter; Zulkafli, Zed; Grainger, Sam; Pandeya, Bhopal] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Skempton Bldg,South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Buytaert, Wouter; Grainger, Sam] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Buytaert, Wouter] Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambiental, Quito, Ecuador; [Zulkafli, Zed] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Serdang, Malaysia; [Acosta, Luis; De Bievre, Bert] CONDESAN, Lima, Peru; [Alemie, Tilashwork C.; Steenhuis, Tammo] Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Water Resources Engn, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Bastiaensen, Johan; Van Hecken, Gert] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [Bhusal, Jagat; Paudel, Deepak; Sharma, Keshav] Soc Hydrol & Meteorol SOHAM Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Hannah, David M.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Dewulf, Art; Karpouzoglou, Timothy] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Foggin, Marc; Hergarten, Christian; Isaeva, Aiganysh; Zhumanova, Munavar] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Tilahun, Seifu; Van Hecken, Gert] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Bahir Dar University; University of Antwerp; University of Birmingham; Wageningen University & Research; American University of Central Asia; Cornell University,"Buytaert, W (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Skempton Bldg,South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",w.buytaert@imperial.ac.uk,"Foggin, Marc/W-3277-2019; Hannah, David M./B-9221-2015; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022; Karpouzoglou, Timos/P-6216-2015; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020","Foggin, Marc/0000-0002-2663-6715; Hannah, David M./0000-0003-1714-1240; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Karpouzoglou, Timos/0000-0001-9568-9813; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Van Hecken, Gert/0000-0001-8496-3194; Zhumanova, Munavar/0000-0001-6690-5361; Grainger, Sam/0000-0003-0116-5758; Zulkafli, Zed/0000-0001-6271-8593","UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE -K010239-1, NE/I004017/1]; Ecuadorian Government (SENESCYT Prometeo programme); NERC [NE/K010182/1, NE/K010077/1, NE/K010123/1, NE/K010204/1, NE/K010239/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Ecuadorian Government (SENESCYT Prometeo programme); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The research consortium to which the authors belong is funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council project NE -K010239-1 (Mountain-EVO).

Data from nine University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS) infrasonic arrays are supplemented by three additional arrays in Nevada, operated by Southern Methodist University (SMU). In this study, the detection procedure is based on an adaptive F-detector (AFD) that accounts for both correlated and uncorrelated noise by capturing the time-varying background noise conditions. The adaptation of the detector, characterized by time varying linear remapping of the F-distribution (C-value), depends on the background noise level at the arrays including weather conditions with seasonal variations and local site effects. The infrasound detection catalog consists of 580,177 signals, depending on time and space as well as data availability at individual stations. Based on the Ground-to-Space (G2S) specifications, the number of detections is shown to be correlated with seasonal variations in the stratospheric winds, illustrating the time varying nature of infrasound propagation. These seasonal variations of infrasound detections include the number of detections, correlation value, occurrences in time, phase velocity, and azimuth. The majority of events occur during working hours, Monday through Friday, suggesting a human cause. Based on the automatic detection results, we reviewed the waveforms generated from the known repeated sources such as Dugway Testing Ground (DTG) and Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) in Utah, and New Bomb (NB) in Nevada. In order to validate the automatic infrasound detection catalog, we document the celerities of automatic infrasound arrivals during the summer and winter using the seismic origin times of NB explosions. Infrasound propagation is dependent on the seasonal variation of wind conditions as well as source location and array distribution.","[Park, Junghyun; Stump, Brian W.] So Methodist Univ, Roy M Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Park, J (corresponding author), So Methodist Univ, Roy M Huffington Dept Earth Sci, POB 750395, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",junghyunp@smu.edu,,"Park, Junghyun/0000-0001-6370-6877","Air Force Research Laboratory [FA8718-08-C-0008]; Department of Energy, NNSA [DE-AC52-09NA293255]","Air Force Research Laboratory; Department of Energy, NNSA(National Nuclear Security AdministrationUnited States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory under Contract FA8718-08-C-0008 and the Department of Energy, NNSA, under Contract DE-AC52-09NA293255.

It explores relationships between the sites' spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics, human history, and the natural environment. The results indicate that the numbers and proportions of the sites, and the frequency of their occurrence, exhibited an inverted V-shaped change trend during six historical periods. The high in the east and low in the west spatial distribution pattern of the first three periods shifted to the one the high in the west and low in the east during the latter three periods, demonstrating a change in the spatial center of gravity of human activities. The sites were mainly distributed on slopes of grades 1-5, with their proportions increasing from 75% during the Spring and Autumn Period (770 BC-476 BC)-Qin Dynasty (221 BC-207 BC) to 93.75% during the Qing Dynasty-Modern period. The concentrated distribution of site elevations shifted from grades 4-8 during the Spring and Autumn Period-Qin Dynasty, and the Western Han (206 BC-8)-Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), to grades 1-4 during the latter three periods. The number of sites showed a shifting trend from high-elevation mountains and hills to low-elevation plains, and from high slopes to low slopes. In particular, the sites exhibited a special moist evolutionary pattern of migration from middle and upstream areas to downstream areas, as opposed to the migration pattern of sites located in typical arid areas. The study also considered factors influencing the distribution and spatiotemporal evolution of cultural sites, notably, human factors and natural factors.","[Wang Fang; Yang Zhaoping; Shi Hui; Wang Zhaoguo; Zhao Xingyou; Qin Wenmin; Wu Wenjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Wang Fang; Shi Hui; Wang Zhaoguo; Qin Wenmin; Wu Wenjie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Luan Fuming] Lishui Univ, Sch Business, Lishui 323000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xiong Heigang] Beijing Union Univ, Coll Art & Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li Dong] Xinjiang Univ Finance & Econ, Tourism Sch, Urumqi 830012, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Lishui University; Beijing Union University; Xinjiang University of Finance & Economics","Yang, ZP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",13579801764@163.com; yangzp@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"National Science and Technology Pillar Program [2012BAH48F01]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists [2013T2Z0004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41171165, 41301204]",National Science and Technology Pillar Program; Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Foundation: National Science and Technology Pillar Program, No.2012BAH48F01; Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists, No.2013T2Z0004; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41171165; No.41301204",,49,8,9,3,26,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

In aquatic pelagic systems, thiamin is mainly produced by bacteria and phytoplankton and is transferred to fish and birds via zooplankton, but there is no general consensus on when or why this transfer is disrupted. We focus on the occurrence in salmon (Salmo salar) of a thiamin deficiency syndrome (M74), the incidence of which is highly correlated among populations derived from different spawning rivers. Here, we show that M74 in salmon is associated with certain large-scale abiotic changes in the main common feeding area of salmon in the southern Baltic Sea. Years with high M74 incidence were characterized by stagnant periods with relatively low salinity and phosphate and silicate concentrations but high total nitrogen. Consequently, there were major changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton, with, e.g., increased abundances of Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, Diatomophyceae and Euglenophyceae and Acartia spp. during high M74 incidence years. The prey fish communities also had increased stocks of both herring and sprat in these years. Overall, this suggests important changes in the entire food web structure and nutritional pathways in the common feeding period during high M74 incidence years. Previous research has emphasized the importance of the abundance of planktivorous fish for the occurrence of M74. By using this 27-year time series, we expand this analysis to the entire ecosystem and discuss potential mechanisms inducing thiamin deficiency in salmon.","[Majaneva, Sanna; Fridolfsson, Emil; Legrand, Catherine; Lindehoff, Elin; Majaneva, Markus; Nilsson, Jonas; Hylander, Samuel] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst EEMiS, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kalmar, Sweden; [Majaneva, Sanna] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway; [Majaneva, Sanna] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Lysekil, Sweden; [Margonski, Piotr] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Gdynia, Poland; [Majaneva, Markus] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU Univ Museum, Trondheim, Norway; [Rubene, Gunta] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm BIOR, Fish Resources Res Dept, Riga, Latvia; [Wasmund, Norbert] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Warnernunde, Germany","Linnaeus University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; National Marine Fisheries Research Institute; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health & Environment BIOR; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde","Majaneva, S (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst EEMiS, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kalmar, Sweden.;Majaneva, S (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway.;Majaneva, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway.",sanna.majaneva@gmail.com,"Fridolfsson, Emil/AAC-7762-2020; Margonski, Piotr/M-2169-2015","Fridolfsson, Emil/0000-0003-4871-7441; Majaneva, Markus/0000-0003-3884-2548; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236; Margonski, Piotr/0000-0002-8767-1880",Swedish research council FORMAS [215-2012-1319]; Strong Research Environment ECOCHANGE (Ecosystem dynamics in the Baltic Sea in a changing climate); Carl Trygger Foundation; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Linnaeus University Centre for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial Model Systems (EEMiS); Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS [185]; EU; Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden),Swedish research council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Strong Research Environment ECOCHANGE (Ecosystem dynamics in the Baltic Sea in a changing climate); Carl Trygger Foundation; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Linnaeus University Centre for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial Model Systems (EEMiS); Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS; EU(European Commission); Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden)(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The study was financially supported by the Swedish research council FORMAS (grant number 215-2012-1319, https://www.formas.se) (to SH), the Strong Research Environment ECOCHANGE (Ecosystem dynamics in the Baltic Sea in a changing climate; https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/ecochange/) (to CL), Carl Trygger Foundation (to SH; https://www.carltryggersstiftelse.se/), The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (to SH; https://www.kva.se/), and the Linnaeus University Centre for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial Model Systems (EEMiS; https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/linnaeusuniversity-centre-for-ecology-and-evolution-in-microbial-model-systems/).MC was funded by the BONUS INSPIRE project supported by the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185; https://www.bonusportal.org/) and jointly by the EU and the Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden; https://www.formas.se).Polish zooplankton data were collected within the National Monitoring Programme, and permission to use them was granted by the Chief Inspector of Environmental Protection (http://www.gios.gov.pl).The authors do not have any competing interests.

This article describes urban spatial resilience by identifying a set of urban spatial factors that may affect resilience and by linking spatial elements and resilience characteristics. The theoretical framework of urban spatial resilience has been divided into five dimensions here, urban spatial scale resilience, urban spatial structure resilience, urban spatial form resilience, urban spatial function resilience, and urban spatial network resilience.

The aim of the study was to determine how the sensitivity to ozone in ambient air of these two species would differ between monocultures and mixtures in terms of growth and visible foliar injury development. Ambient ozone concentrations were consistently higher from the end of April to the middle of October in 2003 than in 2004 with seasonal peaks and means reaching 147 and 50 parts-per-billion (ppb) in 2003 compared to 124 and 40 ppb in 2004. Ambient AOT40 (ozone concentration accumulated over a threshold of 40 ppb during daylight hours with global radiation >50 W m(-2)) values from the end of April to the middle of October reached 48.3 and 26.8 parts-per-billon hours (ppm h) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. In general, Viburnum was a stronger competitor than beech over the course of this 2-year study. Seedlings of Viburnum benefited from interspecific competition in terms of both height growth and above-ground biomass accumulation at the expense of beech seedlings, which showed significantly reduced growth in the mixture as compared to the monoculture. However, as this was only the case for Viburnum growing in the charcoal-filtered treatment, ozone seemed to counteract the beneficial effect of interspecific competition on above-ground biomass accumulation in Viburnum, while at the same time decreasing relative biomass allocation to roots. Foliar sensitivity of the two species was also altered under interspecific competition suggesting that results based on seedlings of single species grown in monocultures may significantly over- or under-estimate foliar sensitivity to ozone. These results demonstrate that competition is an important factor affecting plant responses to ozone stress, but the direction and severity of these effects depend on the interacting species.

These methods have a moderate frequency of success, but difficulties are often encountered with (a) secondary crystallisation, (b) the presence of incompletely burnt limestone or limestone aggregate, and (c) more complex hydraulic mortars (e.g. pozzolana or cocciopesto mortars). An alternative approach to isolating CO2 from mortar involves thermal decomposition of the sample. A new ramped pyroxidation (RPO) facility has recently been constructed at the 14CHRONO Centre. In RPO, samples are incrementally heated, with CO2 produced as the sample undergoes thermal decomposition in the presence (oxidation) or absence (pyrolysis) of oxygen. The CO2 evolved from different temperature fraction are collected cryogenically and radiocarbon dated. This method was applied to several lime mortars with expected ages to investigate if CO2 fractions only associated with the setting of the lime binder could be isolated. For all samples tested, positive results were obtained. All but the first of six CO2 fraction taken during the earlier stages of thermal decomposition were in statistical agreement and could be combined to provide an age that was in excellent agreement with the expected ages (for an Irish medieval round tower, and for a Finnish medieval castle and church). The lowest temperature fraction, not in statistical agreement, is significantly earlier and attributed to contamination from charcoal or coke from lime production. Positive results were also obtained from a piece of mortar that had undergone no pre-treatment. Modelling examining the potential of RPO to isolate lime binder CO2 fractions, where either limestone (or incompletely burnt limestone) or secondary re-crystallised calcite are present as contaminants, further demonstrate the suitability of the approach.","[Barrett, Gerard Thomas; Keaveney, Evelyn; Reimer, Paula J.] Queens Univ Belfast, 14CHRONO Ctr Climate Environm & Chronol, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Lindroos, Alf] Abo Akad Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Turku, Finland; [Donnelly, Colm] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Community Archaeol, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Elmwood Ave, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Daugbjerg, Thomas Schroder; Olsen, Jesper] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Ams Ctr AARAMS, Dept Phys & Astron, Aarhus, Denmark; [Ringbom, Asa] Abo Akad Univ, Art Hist, Turku, Finland",Queens University Belfast; Abo Akademi University; Queens University Belfast; Aarhus University; Abo Akademi University,"Barrett, GT (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, 14CHRONO Ctr Climate Environm & Chronol, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",g.barrett@qub.ac.uk,"Olsen, Jesper/F-1656-2013; Daugbjerg, Thomas/HHC-0811-2022","Olsen, Jesper/0000-0002-4445-5520; Keaveney, Evelyn/0000-0002-1726-4446; Daugbjerg, Thomas Schroder/0000-0002-5563-8744",School of Natural and Built Environment (QUB),School of Natural and Built Environment (QUB),"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

In this study we apply singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to detect trends and oscillations in annual and seasonal time series of surface air temperature ( SAT) and soil temperature (ST). We investigate soil temperatures at depths of 0.4, 1.6, and 3.2 m for five permafrost-occupied regions in Russia. We use SAT data for 1902 - 1995 and ST data for 1960 - 1990. The trends show an increase in annual SAT and ST from the end of the 1960s across all five regions, and this warming exceeds that of the preceding period in the Central Siberian Plateau and Transbaikalia. Oscillations in annual SAT and ST time series are coincident in the West Siberian Plain (7.7 year period) and in the western Central Siberian Plateau and Transbaikalia (2.7 year period). In general, on a seasonal basis, 2 - 3 year oscillations in ST and SAT are coincident during winter, spring, and autumn across the regions and are also evident in the annual ST time series in the Central Siberian Plateau and Transbaikalia. We also find a decadal oscillation (9.8 year period), which is coincident for winter SAT and ST, over the western Central Siberian Plateau only. Although summer SAT and ST oscillations ( 5 - 8 year periods) are coincident for all investigated territories ( except to the east of the Lena River), in the annual ST time series they are identified only for the West Siberian Plain. We document the degree to which SAT controls ST in each region and explore the causative factors for some of the dominant periods. The maximum effect of SAT increases on permafrost may be observed in the Central Siberian Plateau and Transbaikalia, while elsewhere the observed ST increases do not threaten permafrost areas.","Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia; Univ Colorado, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Russian Academy of Sciences; Pushchino Scientific Center for Biological Research (PSCBI) of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physicohemical & Biological Problems of Soil Science; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Chudinova, SM (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia.",chudinova@issp.psn.ru; oliverf@colorado.edu,"Barry, roger/A-7084-2009; ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020; Frauenfeld, Oliver W./ABE-9259-2020; Frauenfeld, Oliver W./AAE-1869-2020","/0000-0002-6079-2658; Barry, Roger/0000-0001-9239-0859; ZHANG, Tingjun/0000-0001-6974-9501",,,,,58,41,45,0,30,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9003,2169-9011,,J GEOPHYS RES-EARTH,J.

Given the large number and variety of ceramics unearthed from Shahr-i Sokhta, the provenance of these wares has remained a subject of controversy. Based on compositional data obtained from quantitative wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectroscopy studies and petrographic observations, findings from this study provide information that can be used to determine whether the ceramics from Shahr-i Sokhta were manufactured locally or were imported from elsewhere. We show here that the chemical components of a large group of ceramics with gray, red, and buff-colored bodies are similar to those found in local clay sources and kiln wasters, suggesting local production of these wares. However, one group of red and gray-colored wares demonstrated entirely different chemistry, suggesting a different origin. In support of the quantitative WDXRF data, petrofabric analysis of the first group of buff, gray, and red wares revealed poorly sorted basaltic clasts similar to those found randomly distributed in the matrix of local clays. By contrast, the non-local gray and red wares exhibited fine-grained clay bodies with sorted distribution of fine-grained quartz within the clay matrix.","[Eftekhari, Negar; Marrocchino, Elena; Vaccaro, Carmela] Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Block B,Room 107,Via Saragat,1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy; [Holakooei, Parviz] Art Univ Isfahan, Dept Objects Conservat & Archaeometry, Esfahan, Iran; [Vaccaro, Carmela] Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate CNR ISAC, Bologna, Italy",University of Ferrara; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR),"Eftekhari, N (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Block B,Room 107,Via Saragat,1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy.",negar.eftekhari@unife.it,"Marrocchino, Elena/AAJ-6316-2020; Vaccaro, Carmela/C-1324-2013","Marrocchino, Elena/0000-0001-7320-0327; Vaccaro, Carmela/0000-0002-4954-8697; Eftekhari, Negar/0000-0002-0879-6870",Universita degli Studi di Ferrara within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Universita degli Studi di Ferrara within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Ferrara within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,,40,1,1,1,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-9557,1866-9565,,ARCHAEOL ANTHROP SCI,Archaeol.

To constrain the climatic conditions capable of forming the valley networks, a hydrological model was used to analyze the valley incision depth and volume of eroded valleys. Because the absolute magnitudes of precipitation, runoff, and evaporation are uncertain, we have used the ratio of these quantities (the X-ratio) to express climatic conditions. The spatial distribution and strength of the correlations between (1) the estimated depth and volume of eroded material and (2) estimated flood magnitude and valley gradients were investigated as a function of the assumed X-ratio. We also conducted an analysis of conditions required to have appreciable discharge in selected valley networks, which provided the most definitive constraint on Martian paleoclimate. The other methods show a relatively weak dependency of incision depths and volumes upon the assumed X-ratio. The multiple regression analyses indicate that incision depth is strongly influenced by gradient and weakly related to modeled flood discharge. The factors determining relative depth of incision depend partly on the type of channel bed. However, postflow modification of the valley networks by mass wasting, cratering, aeolian infilling, and ice-related processes precludes direct determination of bed morphology. Our hydrological analyses suggest that climatic conditions on early Mars were at least as moist as those that occurred in the Great Basin region of the U.S. when large lakes were present during the Pleistocene in terms of the balance of runoff and lake evaporation.","[Matsubara, Yo; Howard, Alan D.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Gochenour, J.

Previous studies found two main genetic lineages of the species forming an eastern and a western clade. Chukar Partridges are raised in game farms and released to supplement natural populations for shooting in the USA, Canada, Greece, and Turkey. To explore intraspecific genetic structure, phylogeography, and possible genetic admixture events of A. chukar in Turkey, we genotyped individuals from fourteen wild and five captive populations at two mitochondrial and ten microsatellite DNA loci in. Wild and farmed Chukar Partridge samples were analyzed together to investigate possible influences of intraspecific hybridizations. We found that the farmed chukars, which mainly (85%) cluster into the eastern clade, and wild ones were genetically distinct. The latter could be separated into six management units (MUs), with partridges from Gokceada Island in the Aegean Sea forming the most divergent population. Intraspecific hybridization was detected between wild and captive populations. This phenomenon causes rampant introgression and homogenization.

Drifters drogued at 50m in the European Slope Current at the Hebridean shelf break follow a wide range of pathways, indicating highly variable Atlantic inflow to the North Sea. Slope Current pathways, timescales and transports over 1988-2007 are further quantified in an eddy-resolving ocean model hindcast. Particle trajectories calculated with model currents indicate that Slope Current water is largely recruited from the eastern subpolar North Atlantic. Observations of absolute dynamic topography and climatological density support theoretical expectations that Slope Current transport is to first order associated with meridional density gradients in the eastern subpolar gyre, which support a geostrophic inflow towards the slope. In the model hindcast, Slope Current transport variability is dominated by abrupt 25-50% reductions of these density gradients over 1996-1998. Concurrent changes in wind forcing, expressed in terms of density gradients, act in the same sense to reduce Slope Current transport. This indicates that coordinated regional changes of buoyancy and wind forcing acted together to reduce Slope Current transport during the 1990s. Particle trajectories further show that 10-40% of Slope Current water is destined for the northern North Sea within 6 months of passing to the west of Scotland, with a general decline in this percentage over 1988-2007. Salinities in the Slope Current correspondingly decreased, evidenced in ocean analysis data. Further to the north, in the Atlantic Water conveyed by the Slope Current through the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC), salinity is observed to increase over this period while declining in the hindcast. The observed trend may have broadly compensated for a decline in the Atlantic inflow, limiting salinity changes in the northern North Sea during this period. Proxies for both Slope Current transport and Atlantic inflow to the North Sea are sought in sea level height differences across the FSC and between Shetland and the Scottish mainland (Wick). Variability of Slope Current transport on a wide range of timescales, from seasonal to multi-decadal, is implicit in sea level differences between Lerwick (Shetland) and Tershavn (Faroes), in both tide gauge records from 1957 and a longer model hindcast spanning 1958-2012. Wick-Lerwick sea level differences in tide gauge records from 1965 indicate considerable decadal variability in the Fair Isle Current transport that dominates Atlantic inflow to the northwest North Sea, while sea level differences in the hindcast are dominated by strong seasonal variability. Uncertainties in the Wick tide gauge record limit confidence in this proxy.","[Marsh, Robert; Haigh, Ivan D.] Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Cunningham, Stuart A.; Inall, Mark E.; Porter, Marie] Scottish Marine Inst, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Moat, Ben I.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; UHI Millennium Institute; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Marsh, R (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",rma@noc.soton.ac.uk,"/I-4835-2014; Moat, Ben/C-1288-2011","/0000-0002-1624-4275; Moat, Ben/0000-0001-8676-7779","Scottish Association for Marine Science; UK National Environment Research Council (NERC) programme FASTNEt (NERC) [NE/I030224/1]; NERC project UKOSNAP (NERC) [NE/K010700/1]; EU; NERC through the RAPID-AMOC Climate Change (RAPID) programme; Natural Environment Research Council [noc010012] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I030224/1, NE/L003287/1, NE/P013740/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Scottish Association for Marine Science; UK National Environment Research Council (NERC) programme FASTNEt (NERC); NERC project UKOSNAP (NERC); EU(European Commission); NERC through the RAPID-AMOC Climate Change (RAPID) programme; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Robert Marsh acknowledges the support of a 2013 Research Bursary awarded by the Scottish Association for Marine Science.

Here, we introduce a synthesis strategy for a stable Fe-based electrocatalyst, which was realized by defect-free encapsulation of Fe nanoparticles using a two-dimensional (2D) phenazine-based fused aromatic porous organic network (Aza-PON). The resulting Fe@Aza-PON catalyst showed electrocatalytic activity (half-wave potential, 0.839 V; Tafel slope, 60 mV decade(-1)) comparable to commercial Pt on activated carbon (Pt/C, 0.826 V and 90 mV decade-1). More importantly, the Fe@Aza-PON displayed outstanding stability (zero current loss even after 100 000 cycles) and tolerance against contamination (methanol and CO poisoning). In a hybrid Li-air battery test, the Fe@Aza-PON demonstrated performance superior to Pt/C.","[Kim, Seok-Jin; Mahmood, Javeed; Han, Gao-Feng; Kim, Seong-Wook; Jung, Sun-Min; Baek, Jong-Beom] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Ctr Dimens Controllable Organ Frameworks, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Kim, Changmin; Kim, Guntae] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Zhu, Guomin; De Yoreo, James J.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Phys Sci Div Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [De Yoreo, James J.] Univ Washington, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Baek, JB (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Ctr Dimens Controllable Organ Frameworks, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.;Kim, G (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",gtkim@unist.ac.kr; jbbaek@unist.ac.kr,"Jung, Sun-Min/D-4662-2017; Han, Gao-Feng/C-6152-2016; MAHMOOD, JAVEED/E-4898-2015; Mahmood, Javeed/F-8837-2019; Baek, Jong-Beom/E-5883-2010; Jung, Sun-Min/AGO-6204-2022; Kim, Seok-Jin/V-1517-2017; Zhu, Guomin/AAH-3785-2021; Kim, Guntae/F-7186-2010","Jung, Sun-Min/0000-0002-8196-1748; Han, Gao-Feng/0000-0001-5943-0492; MAHMOOD, JAVEED/0000-0002-9159-3336; Mahmood, Javeed/0000-0002-9159-3336; Baek, Jong-Beom/0000-0003-4785-2326; Jung, Sun-Min/0000-0002-8196-1748; Kim, Seok-Jin/0000-0002-6052-547X; Kim, Guntae/0000-0002-5167-0982","Creative Research Initiative (CRI) [2014R1A3A2069102]; BK21 Plus [10Z20130011057]; Science Research Center (SRC) [2016R1A5A1009405]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [2015R1A2A1A1A10055886, 2016M1A2940910]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Basic Energy Science (BES), Division of Materials Science and Engineering, at PNNL; DOE [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","Creative Research Initiative (CRI); BK21 Plus; Science Research Center (SRC); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Basic Energy Science (BES), Division of Materials Science and Engineering, at PNNL(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by the Creative Research Initiative (CRI, 2014R1A3A2069102), BK21 Plus (10Z20130011057), Science Research Center (SRC, 2016R1A5A1009405), Mid-Career Researcher (2015R1A2A1A1A10055886), and Climate Change (2016M1A2940910) programs through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea.

Yet, how changes in community composition influence the structure of food webs over time and space remains elusive. Using ecological network analysis, we assessed how food web structure changed across six distinct areas of the North Sea over a sixteen-year time-period. We used multivariate analyses to disentangle and compare spatio-temporal dynamics in community composition (i.e. changes in species abundances) and food web structure (i.e. changes in network properties). Specifically, we assessed how changes in community composition were reflected in food web structure. Our results revealed a strong spatial coupling between community composition and food web structure along a south-north gradient. However, the temporal covariation between community composition and food web structure depended on the spatial scale. We observed a temporal mismatch at regional scale, but a strong coupling at local scale. In particular, we found that community composition can be influenced by hydro-climatic events over large areas, with diverse effects manifesting in local food web structure. Our proposed methodological framework quantified and compared spatio-temporal changes in community composition and food web structure, providing key information to support effective management strategies aimed at conserving the structure and functioning of ecological communities in times of environmental change.","[Frelat, Romain] Wageningen Univ & Res WUR, Aguaculture & Fisheries Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kortsch, Susanne; Nordstroem, Marie C.; Olivier, Pierre E.

On-line coupled into a meso-scale weather forecast model (MM5), its performance and improvements for aerosol chemical and optical simulations have been evaluated using the observations data of aerosols/gases from the intensive observations and from the CMA Atmosphere Watch network, plus aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from CMA Aerosol Remote Sensing network (CARSNET) and from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Targeting Beijing and North China region from July 13 to 31, 2008, when a heavy hazy weather system occurred, the model captured the general variations of PM10 with most of the data within a factor of 2 from the observations and a combined correlation coefficient (r) of 0.38 (significance level = 0.05). The correlation coefficients are better at rural than at urban sites, and better at daytime than at nighttime. Chemically, the correlation coefficients between the daily-averaged modelled and observed concentrations range from 0.34 for black carbon (BC) to 0.09 for nitrates with sulphate, ammonium and organic carbon (OC) in between. Like the PM10, the values of chemical species are higher for the daytime than those for the nighttime. On average, the sulphate, ammonium, nitrate and OC are underestimated by about 60, 70, 96.0 and 10.8%, respectively. Black carbon is overestimated by about 120%. A new size distribution for the primary particle emissions was constructed for most of the anthropogenic aerosols such as BC, OC, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium from the observed size distribution of atmospheric aerosols in Beijing. This not only improves the correlation between the modelled and observed AOD, but also reduces the overestimation of AOD simulated by the original model size distributions of primary aerosols. The normalised mean error has been reduced to 62% with the CARSNET observations and 76% with MODIS, from the original 111% and 143%, respectively. The factors resulting in the underestimation of aerosol concentrations and other discrepancies in the model are explored, and improvements in enhancing the model performance are proposed from the analysis. It is found that the accuracy in meteorological predictions plays a critical role on the simulation of the occurrence and accumulation of heavy pollution episode, especially the circulation winds and the treatment of Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL).","[Zhou, Chun-Hong; Gong, Sunling; Zhang, Xiao-Ye; Liu, Hong-Li; Xue, Min; An, Xing-Qin; Che, Hui-Zheng; Zhang, Yang-Mei; Niu, Tao] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Chem, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chun-Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gong, Sunling] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Cao, Guo-Liang] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology","Zhou, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Chem, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhouch@cma.gov.cn,"Che, Huizheng/N-1645-2019; CHE, Huizheng/B-1354-2014; ZHANG, Xiao-Ye/C-8707-2012","CHE, Huizheng/0000-0002-9458-3387; ZHANG, Xiao-Ye/0000-0003-1802-3385","National Basic Research Program (973) of China [2011CB403404]; CAMS Basic Research Project [2010Z001, 2010Z002]",National Basic Research Program (973) of China(National Basic Research Program of China); CAMS Basic Research Project,"The authors wish to thank for the financial support from the National Basic Research Program (973) of China (2011CB403404), CAMS Basic Research Project (2010Z001, 2010Z002) for this work.",,69,61,64,2,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1600-0889,,,TELLUS B,Tellus Ser.

The innovation of the current study revolves around the development of tree-based ML models, including Rotation Forest (ROF), Alternating Decision Tree (ADTree), and Random Forest (RF) via binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), to estimate flood susceptibility in the Maneh and Samalqan watershed, Iran. Therefore, to implement the models, 370 flood-prone locations in the case study were identified (2016-2019). In addition, 20 hydrogeological, topographical, geological, and environmental criteria affecting flood occurrence in the study area were extracted to predict flood susceptibility. The area under the curve (AUC) and a variety of other statistical indicators were used to evaluate the performances of the models. The results showed that the RF-BPSO (AUC=0.935) has the highest accuracy compared to ROF-BPSO (AUC=0.904), and ADTree-BPSO (AUC=0.923). In addition, the findings illustrated that the chance of flooding in the center of the area in question is greater than in other points due to lower elevation, lower slope, and proximity to rivers. Therefore, the ensemble framework proposed here can also be used to predict flood susceptibility maps in other regions with similar geo-environmental characteristics for flood management and prevention.","[Eslaminezhad, Seyed Ahmad] Univ Tehran, Dept Surveying & Geomat Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran 1417466191, Iran; [Eftekhari, Mobin] Islamic Azad Univ, Mashhad Branch, Civil Engn Water & Hydraul Struct, Mashhad 9187147587, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Azma, Aliasghar] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Fac Infrastruct Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Kiyanfar, Ramin] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Art & Architecture, Shiraz 193954697, Iran; [Akbari, Mohammad] Univ Birjand, Dept Civil Engn, Birjand 9717434765, Iran",University of Tehran; Islamic Azad University; Dalian University of Technology; Payame Noor University; University of Birjand,"Akbari, M (corresponding author), Univ Birjand, Dept Civil Engn, Birjand 9717434765, Iran.",moakbari@birjand.ac.ir,"Azma, Aliasghar/AAC-5191-2021; Eftekhari, Mobin/W-7167-2018","/0000-0001-7587-3779; Akbari, Mohammad/0000-0002-6882-874X; Azma, Aliasghar/0000-0001-6565-6578; kiyanfar, Ramin/0000-0002-1583-0985; Eftekhari, Mobin/0000-0002-1031-1270",,,,,93,0,0,6,8,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

This process is characterized mainly by (i) approaching smallholders to ascertain the livelihood assets that are relevant to them, how they could be understood as being at risk, and how their at-risk situation should be measured and interpreted; and (ii) using drawings and stories as a combined research tool for refreshing memory in the process of data collection. The differentiated research process showed that (i) including local knowledge and interpretation of risk from the beginning of the assessment tool construction results in an easier application in the field; (ii) drawing and storytelling as a combined tool on the one hand helped participants to provide detailed information about facts, feelings, and social dynamics, and on the other hand allowed us to indirectly assess their willingness to collaborate and the strategies to do so; and (iii) popular or innovative strategies, involving tangible and intangible resources, identified through every step, proved to be a link between local resilience and risk management capabilities.","[Alexandra Galarza-Villamar, Julissa; Leeuwis, Cees; Cecchi, Francesco] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Alexandra Galarza-Villamar, Julissa; Mariela Parraga-Lema, Cinthia] ESPOL Polytech Univ, Fac Ciencias Vida, Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, ESPOL, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Maribel Pila-Quinga, Geovanna] Agron & Vet Sans Frontieres, Quito, Ecuador",Wageningen University & Research; Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral,"Galarza-Villamar, JA (corresponding author), POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",julissa.galarzavillarnar@wur.nl,,,"SENESCYT (Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion); ESPOL (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral)","SENESCYT (Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion); ESPOL (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral)","This study was funded by the SENESCYT (Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion) and ESPOL (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral) through a grant to postgraduate studies, and it was developed as part of the InunDaule project, carried out by AVSF (Agronomes et Veterinaires Sans Frontieres) in Ecuador.

With a projected increase in extreme precipitation as well as an ongoing urbanization, pluvial flood damage is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, further insights, especially on the adverse consequences of pluvial floods and their mitigation, are needed. To gain more knowledge, empirical damage data from three different pluvial flood events in Germany were collected through computer-aided telephone interviews. Pluvial flood awareness as well as flood experience were found to be low before the respective flood events. The level of private precaution increased considerably after all events, but is mainly focused on measures that are easy to implement. Lower inundation depths, smaller potential losses as compared with fluvial floods, as well as the fact that pluvial flooding may occur everywhere, are expected to cause a shift in damage mitigation from precaution to emergency response. However, an effective implementation of emergency measures was constrained by a low dissemination of early warnings in the study areas. Further improvements of early warning systems including dissemination as well as a rise in pluvial flood preparedness are important to reduce future pluvial flood damage.","[Roezer, Viktor; Schroeter, Kai; Kreibich, Heidi] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Mueller, Meike] Deutsch Ruckversicherung AG, Hansaallee 177, D-40549 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Bubeck, Philip; Kienzler, Sarah; Thieken, Annegret; Pech, Ina] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Buchholz, Oliver] Hydrotec GmbH, Bachstr 62-64, D-52066 Aachen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Potsdam,"Rozer, V (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",vroezer@gfz-potsdam.de; meike.mueller@deutscherueck.de; bubeck@uni-potsdam.de; kienzler@uni-potsdam.de; thieken@uni-potsdam.de; ina.pech@uni-potsdam.de; kai.schroeter@gfz-potsdam.de; O.Buchholz@hydrotec.de; heidi.kreibich@gfz-potsdam.de,"Schröter, Kai/B-1482-2013; Thieken, Annegret Henriette/B-1946-2017; Bubeck, Philip/ABA-2750-2020; Kreibich, Heidi/G-9408-2012","Schröter, Kai/0000-0002-3173-7019; Thieken, Annegret Henriette/0000-0001-7068-2615; Bubeck, Philip/0000-0001-5163-5290; Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; Rozer, Viktor/0000-0002-2883-5347",project EVUS-Real-Time Prediction of Pluvial Floods and Induced Water Contamination in Urban Areas (BMBF) [03G0846B]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [0330701C]; University of Potsdam; German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG,project EVUS-Real-Time Prediction of Pluvial Floods and Induced Water Contamination in Urban Areas (BMBF); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); University of Potsdam; German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG,"The research presented in this paper was mainly conducted under the framework of the project EVUS-Real-Time Prediction of Pluvial Floods and Induced Water Contamination in Urban Areas (BMBF, 03G0846B).

The dust module treats dust-emission processes based on the saltation-bombardment theory. A global soil texture database is used to determine the size distribution of parent soils. Erodibility factors for vegetation cover, snow cover, land-use type, and soil type are considered. Dry and wet deposition processes are dependent on particle size. To obtain a climatological global dust emission, deposition, and spatial distribution, we performed a 25-year simulation which is assimilated to the 1979-2003 condition, using a nudging scheme. The simulated annual mean global emission flux and atmospheric dust load (with 0.2 <= D <= 20 mu m) are 2149 (1817-2339) Tg yr(-1) and 17.9 (15.6-20.4) Tg. The surface concentrations and depositions are compared with observed data, and the dust emission flux is compared with previous model studies. The model reproduces the simulated seasonal variation of dust concentration at stations near East Asian dust sources, where most previous models have underestimated the amounts and amplitudes. The global simulation results indicate that the quantitative estimation of the dust budget is sensitive to the size distribution of the emitted dust.","Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Tanaka, TY (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan.",yatanaka@mri-jma.go.jp,,"Tanaka, Taichu Yasumichi/0000-0003-0600-2122",,,,,66,78,80,0,10,METEOROLOGICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"C/O JAPAN METEOROLOGICAL AGENCY 1-3-4 OTE-MACHI, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100-0004, JAPAN",0026-1165,2186-9057,,J METEOROL SOC JPN,J.

The results show that properties connected to combined sewer systems are much more exposed to pluvial flood damage than properties connected to separated sewer systems, with the ratio of the number of claims being close to three. The analysis of building-specific variables shows no clear statistical relationships to the damage costs. To further the understanding of damage costs caused by urban pluvial flooding, it is necessary to extend the group of explanatory variables to include information about the socio-economic background of households, the actual value of assets in basements and the precautionary measures taken by house owners.","[Mobini, Shifteh; Nilsson, Erik; Larsson, Rolf] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Andreas] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Andreas] Lund Univ, GIS Ctr, Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Div Risk Management & Societal Safety, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; North West University - South Africa,"Mobini, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",shifteh.mobini@tvrl.lth.se; erik.nilsson@tvrl.lth.se; andreas.persson@nateko.lu.se; per.becker@risk.lth.se; Rolf.larsson@tvrl.lth.se,,"Mobini, Shifteh/0000-0002-3365-7346; Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461","Formas (The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning) [942-2015-149]","Formas (The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This study was supported by a grant from Formas (The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning), No. 942-2015-149 (Sustainable Urban Flood Management).",,89,6,6,4,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The methods used to collect data were farmer surveys (n = 60), focus group discussions (n = 4) and key informants interviews (n = 15). The results showed that the respondents had a positive perception on using low-quality irrigation water for vegetable production. The reported benefits include availability of water throughout the year, highest soil and crop nutrients in irrigation water, less costs of buying commercial fertilizers, vegetable production all year round, sustainable income generation from selling vegetables and also jobs creation in the community among farmers and vegetable sellers. Findings from Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test score on farmers perception scales indicate an association between the source of low-quality water used and the respondents' sex. Accordingly, female farmers had higher positive perception on the benefits of low-quality water compared to male farmers. Higher perception score was also observed among farmers who used polluted river water in irrigation vegetable production compared to farmers who used wastewater. Since low-quality irrigation water is a good strategy of coping with scarcity of freshwater for communities which have no alternative source of irrigation water, the study recommends multi-sectorial agencies across the country to be involved in formulating policies and creating health promotion awareness for safe use of low-quality water for benefit maximization and health risk reduction.","[Mayilla, Winfrida; Ngowi, Helena] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Vet Med & Publ Hlth, POB 3015, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Keraita, Bernard; Konradsen, Flemming] Univ Copenhagen, Sect Global Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Magayane, Flavianus] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Agr Educ & Extens, Morogoro, Tanzania",Sokoine University of Agriculture; University of Copenhagen; Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Mayilla, W (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Vet Med & Publ Hlth, POB 3015, Morogoro, Tanzania.",winfridam@yahoo.com; bernard.keraita@sund.ku.dk; h_ngowi@yahoo.com; flko@sund.ku.dk; fmagayane@suanet.ac.tz,,"Konradsen, Flemming/0000-0003-1036-6949; Mayilla, Winfrida/0000-0002-7651-7036",Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Safe Water for Food (SaWaFo) project,Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Safe Water for Food (SaWaFo) project,"This research is part of a Ph.D., funded by Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Safe Water for Food (SaWaFo) project.

In the study area (SW Libya), a solid C-14 chronology dates the occupation of Early Acacus H/G between 9800 and 8900 BR It is likely that the colonization by these small groups of specialized hunter-gatherers was rapid, entering unfamiliar areas characterized by the presence of lakes and ponds. Whether or not the very first re-entry was a uniquely Holocene phenomenon is still debated, we favour an arrival from the North considering current palaeoenvironmental, archaeological and possibly genetic evidences. The archaeological record consists of around ninety sites: surface occurrences and a few excavated sequences standing as regional and supra-regional references. Sites are located on different geomorphological contexts and are task-specifically organized. Subsistence relied on specialized hunting of Barbary sheep and on some vegetal species. The provenance and circulation of lithic raw materials reveals a high mobility, at a regional but also at a wider scale. Tool-kits are light, bladelet-based, curated and dominated by backed armatures. Early Acacus occupation reveals strong differences compared to the subsequent Late Acacus phase (8900-7400 BP) when a profound reorganization in the subsistence-settlement system, featuring an increase in the delayed use of resources - i.e. corralling of Barbary sheep and storage of wild cereals - occurred. In this work we present an overview of the Early Acacus archaeological data, with an emphasis on the territorial analysis of lithic assemblages. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Seasonal declines might drive selection for early breeding, with implications for other stages of the annual cycle. Alternatively, selection on the phenology of nonbreeding stages could constrain timing of the breeding season and lead to seasonal changes in reproductive performance. We studied 25 taxa of migratory shorebirds (including five subspecies) at 16 arctic sites in Russia, Alaska, and Canada. We investigated seasonal changes in four reproductive traits, and developed a novel Bayesian risk-partitioning model of daily nest survival to examine seasonal trends in two causes of nest failure. We found strong seasonal declines in reproductive traits for a subset of species. The probability of laying a full four-egg clutch declined by 8-78% in 12 of 25 taxa tested, daily nest survival rates declined by 1-12% in eight of 22 taxa, incubation duration declined by 2.0-2.5% in two of seven taxa, and mean egg volume declined by 5% in one of 15 taxa. Temporal changes were not fully explained by individual variation. Across all species, the proportion of failed nests that were depredated declined over the season from 0.98 to 0.60, while the proportion abandoned increased from 0.01 to 0.35 and drove the seasonal declines in nest survival. An increase in abandonment of late nests is consistent with a life-history tradeoff whereby either adult mortality increased or adults deserted the breeding attempt to maximize adult survival. In turn, seasonal declines in clutch size and incubation duration might be adaptive to hasten hatching of later nests.

Scientific tools should play an essential role of providing the evidence base to assess the impacts of alternative policy options. To identify the contribution of research funding for IA tool development, this paper analysed the variety of IA tools designed in projects funded by European Framework Programmes (FPs) 6 and 7. The paper is based on project information available on the European Cordis website, individual project websites and a verification of the results by the project coordinators. We analysed the projects from the interests of IA practitioners as tool users (European policy and impact areas addressed by the tools, jurisdictional application levels and tool categories). Out of the 7.781 projects funded in FP6 and FP7, 203 could be identified that designed tools for the IA process. Nearly half of them applied to environmental, agricultural and transport policy areas. Within these areas, the tools primarily addressed environmental impact areas, less economic and least social impact areas. The IA tools focused on European policies. Models represented the largest tool category, whereas approximately half of the tools could not be clearly categorized. Concerning our analysis criteria, the tool descriptions available on the internet were often unclear and thus may limit the application potential of the tools because of a mismatch of technical terms and categorisation criteria between tool providers and tool users. Future IA tools require a joint political and scientific typology and a narrowing of the gaps, e.g., with view to multi-jurisdictional application and a clear reference to the steps of the IA process.

Many cities remain beset by political, infrastructural, social, or economic fragility, with crisis arguably becoming an increasingly present condition of urban life. While acknowledging the intense vulnerabilities that cities can face, this article contends that innovative, flexible, and often ground-breaking policies, practices, and activities designed to manage and overcome fragility can emerge in cities beset by crisis. We argue that a deeper understanding of such practices and the knowledge emerging from contexts of urban crisis may offer important insights to support urban resilience and sustainable development. We outline a simple conceptual representation of the interrelationships between urban crisis and knowledge production, situate this in the context of literature on resilience, sustainability, and crisis, and present illustrative examples of real-world practices. In discussing these perspectives, we reflect on how we may better value, use, and exchange knowledge and practice in order to address current and future urban challenges.","[Hoelscher, Kristian] Peace Res Inst Oslo PRIO, N-0186 Oslo, Norway; [Geirbo, Hanne Cecilie] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Fac Technol Art & Design, Dept Comp Sci, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Harboe, Lisbet] Oslo Sch Architecture & Design, Inst Urbanism & Landscape, N-0175 Oslo, Norway; [Petersen, Sobah Abbas] SINTEF Digital, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO); Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Oslo School of Architecture & Design; SINTEF,"Hoelscher, K (corresponding author), Peace Res Inst Oslo PRIO, N-0186 Oslo, Norway.",hoelscher@prio.org; Hanne.Cecilie.Geirbo@oslomet.no; lisbet.harboe@aho.no; Sobah.Petersen@sintef.no,,,"Research Council of Norway [259906]; SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway","Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway(SINTEF)","FundingThis research was funded by the Research Council of Norway, grant number 259906.

The development of a real-time warning system could provide timely information to initiate flood management protocols, thereby reducing impacts. Therefore, we developed an innovative real-time flood forecasting system (RTFlood system) and applied it to the Ramkhamhaeng polder in Bangkok, which is particularly vulnerable to flash floods. The RTFlood system consists of three modules. The first module prepared rainfall input data for subsequent use by a hydraulic model. This module used radar rainfall data measured by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and developed forecasts using the TITAN (Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, Analysis, and Nowcasting) rainfall model. The second module provided a real-time task management system that controlled all processes in the RTFlood system, i.e., input data preparation, hydraulic simulation timing, and post-processing of the output data for presentation. The third module provided a model simulation applying the input data from the first and second modules to simulate flash floods. It used a dynamic, conceptual model (PCSWMM, Personal Computer version of the Stormwater Management Model) to represent the drainage systems of the target urban area and predict the inundation areas. The RTFlood system was applied to the Ramkhamhaeng polder to evaluate the system's accuracy for 116 recent flash floods. The result showed that 61.2% of the flash floods were successfully predicted with accuracy high enough for appropriate pre-warning. Moreover, it indicated that the RTFlood system alerted inundation potential 20 min earlier than separate flood modeling using radar and local rain stations individually. The earlier alert made it possible to decide on explicit flood controls, including pump and canal gate operations.","[Chitwatkulsiri, Detchphol; Miyamoto, Hitoshi] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 3-7-5 Toyosu,Koto Ku, Tokyo 1358548, Japan; [Irvine, Kim Neil] Thammasat Univ Rangsit Campus, Fac Architecture & Planning, Khlong Luang 12121, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Pilailar, Sitang] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Loc, Ho Huu] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Engn & Technol, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand",Shibaura Institute of Technology; Kasetsart University; Asian Institute of Technology,"Chitwatkulsiri, D (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 3-7-5 Toyosu,Koto Ku, Tokyo 1358548, Japan.",na20109@shibaura-it.ac.jp; miyamo@shibaura-it.ac.jp; kim.irvine@ap.tu.ac.th; fengstpl@ku.ac.th; hohuuloc@ait.ac.th,,"Miyamoto, Hitoshi/0000-0003-3368-5715; ho, loc/0000-0002-8300-6699",PCSWMM Professional 2D educational software from Computational Hydraulics International (CHI),PCSWMM Professional 2D educational software from Computational Hydraulics International (CHI),The authors sincerely thank the Drainage and Sewerage Department of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration for providing data and necessary information for the research.

Market liberalization and increasing share of new renewable energy sources, with associated increase in price volatility, are profoundly reshaping hydropower operations in many countries where these developments have already taken place. In this evolving context, some European countries are phasing out nuclear power plants and looking for alternatives to replace the lost production share. Hydropower is one of the candidates, particularly in water-abundant hydrological regions, where large storage hydropower systems contribute a big share of the production. Yet, shifting current revenue-oriented operations toward a production-maximizing strategy might come to the cost of a reduction in income for hydropower companies. In this paper, we specifically explore trade-off between maximizing hydropower electricity production and revenue in deregulated markets. We focus on a case study in the Swiss Alps that can be considered as paradigmatic of most hydropower systems in mountainous regions worldwide. We developed a stochastic biobjective optimal control problem, which allows the design alternative hydropower operating strategies differently balancing electricity production and revenue maximization, accounting for both the variability of reservoir inflow and electricity price. Our results show that a production-driven operation might have strong consequences on the hydropower company income, suggesting that there is a low rate of substitution between the two objectives in the current energy market situation. The proposed approach can support policy makers in analyzing the dualism production/revenue in any hydropower system under complex natural and socioeconomic constraints and represents a benchmark to test different types of mechanisms to promote favorable economic conditions to hydropower companies to increase electricity production.","[Anghileri, Daniela; Burlando, Paolo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Anghileri, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",daniela.anghileri@sccer-soe.ethz.ch; andrea.castelletti@polimi.it; paolo.burlando@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020; Anghileri, Daniela/AAN-2177-2020","Anghileri, Daniela/0000-0001-6220-8593",Innosuisse,Innosuisse,This research is part of the activities of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER-SoE) with the support of Innosuisse.

Different scenarios were considered, using purchasing-power parity and different rates of water saving in 13 representative countries around the world. Moreover, the contingent valuation method was applied to assess the willingness of people to pay for such a system. The payback period for the constructed wetlands varies between 1 and over 20 years, depending on the scenario chosen, with about 47% of the scenarios presenting a positive NPV in 20 years. Generally, greywater treatment systems have economic viability mainly in low and medium investment scenarios, like using a handmade tank, when considering tax incentives, or when pumping costs are ignored. Considering foreseeable stress on water supply systems, governments should encourage the implementation of greywater reuse systems, seeking to improve access of the population to water and sanitation. In relation to contingent valuation, 65% of the respondents indicated a willingness to pay about US$630 for the greywater treatment system, but the most desirable value would be between about US$160 and US$470, indicating that people are more interested in low cost systems. No correlation was found between socioeconomic indicators and the willingness to pay for the system.","[de Simone Souza, Hugo Henrique; Paulo, Paula Loureiro; Boncz, Marc Arpad] Fed Univ Mato Grosso do Sul UFMS, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog FAENG, POB 549, BR-79002970 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul,"Paulo, PL (corresponding author), Fed Univ Mato Grosso do Sul UFMS, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog FAENG, POB 549, BR-79002970 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",hugohenriquesouza@gmail.com; paula.paulo@ufms.br; marc.boncz@ufms.br,"Paulo, Paula/AFR-8815-2022; boncz, marc/V-3191-2019","Paulo, Paula/0000-0002-8091-6486; Boncz, Marc/0000-0001-7618-8685",CAPES; FINEP [01.12.0112-00],CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FINEP(Financiadora de Inovacao e Pesquisa (Finep)),Authors acknowledge the Brazilian funding agencies CAPES and FINEP for their financial support.

The rock panels were classified as metamorphic rocks (gneiss), containing quartz, plagioclase, orthoclase, microcline and muscovite. Such minerals were also found in the paints, though the red drawings also showed the presence of Fe-oxides, which were practically absent in the white ones where kaolinite was recognized. A consistent amount of Ca-oxalates was found to be well distributed through the white and red pigments, suggesting its origin in the organic binder used to properly spread the pigments onto the rock panels. Thus, the 14C ages on the Ca-oxalates are to be considered as the age of the paint. The 68% probability time intervals of calibrated ages for the white and red pigments were in cal 2880-2280 BCE and 1390-1010, respectively, demonstrating > 1000 years time gap between them. This difference was also pronounced in motifs of complexity. The red drawings (attributable to settled or semi-settled societies) are richer in styles, forms and patterns than the white ones, the latter being likely related to a nomadic population as also suggested by the simpler drawing techniques. Our results have important implications for integrating semiotics and anthropologic studies, to delimit the boundaries of a homogeneous cultural area and shedding new light on human settlement dynamics and change from nomadic lifestyle to settling during the Late Stone Age in East Africa.","[Pecchioni, E.; Vaselli, O.] Univ Florence, Dept Earth Sci, Via G La Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Vaselli, O.] CNR, IGG Inst Geosci & Earth Resources, Via G La Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Ricci, M.; Lofrumento, C.] Univ Florence, Chem Dept Ugo Schiff, Via Lastruccia 3-13, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Levchenko, V.; Williams, A.] ANSTO, Ctr Accelerator Sci, Locked Bag 2001, Kirrawee Dc, NSW 2232, Australia; [Giamello, M.; Scala, A.] Univ Siena, Dept Phys Earth & Environm Sci, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Turchetta, B.] INDIRE Univ Florence, Italian Univ Line, Via M Buonarroti 10, I-50122 Florence, Italy",University of Florence; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR); University of Florence; Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation; University of Siena,"Pecchioni, E (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Earth Sci, Via G La Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",elena.pecchioni@unifi.it,"Vaselli, Orlando/A-4268-2016; Ricci, Marilena/M-5192-2016","Ricci, Marilena/0000-0001-7894-7737; Vaselli, Orlando/0000-0001-8121-4438; pecchioni, elena/0000-0003-1231-8625","radiocarbon laboratory; University of Tuscia, Italy; National Museum of Uganda","radiocarbon laboratory; University of Tuscia, Italy; National Museum of Uganda","NIL and AW acknowledge the help of radiocarbon laboratory staff and financial support for the Centre for Accelerator Science at ANSTO, where the measurements were done, through the Australian National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).

Aerosol optical depth at 0.55 mu m was retrieved in pixels identified as being cloud-free ocean. In pixels identified as containing clouds from single-layered, low-level cloud systems over oceans, the following pixels cloud properties were retrieved: 0.64-mu m cloud optical depth, droplet effective radius, cloud layer altitude, pixel-scale fractional cloud cover, column liquid water amount and column droplet concentration. Aerosol and cloud properties were averaged in 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude-longitude regions. Regions that contained clouds were limited to those in which all the clouds were part of a single-layered, low-level cloud system. Aerosol and cloud properties were compared only in 1 degrees regions that had sufficient numbers of both cloud-free pixels that yielded aerosol retrievals and cloudy pixels that yielded retrievals of cloud properties within a single overpass. The comparisons were collected in 5 degrees x 5 degrees latitude-longitude regions to determine trends. Within each 5 degrees region the cloud properties were similar from year to year, permitting the data to be composited for all 5 years. Aerosol optical depth decreased systematically with time, probably as a result of the increase in solar zenith angle due to the precession of the satellite orbit. Within the 5 degrees regions, as aerosol optical depth increased, droplet effective radius decreased, cloud optical depth increased, and droplet column number concentration increased, qualitatively consistent with the trends expected for the aerosol indirect effect. In some regions, liquid water path decreased as aerosol optical depth increased, contrary to the trends expected for the suppression of drizzle. Within each 5 degrees region, clouds in clean air, as indicated by their collocation with relatively small aerosol optical depths, had larger droplets and smaller cloud optical depths than clouds in polluted air, as indicated by their collocation with relatively large aerosol optical depths. On average, the aerosol indirect radiative forcing for overcast conditions was about twice as large as the direct radiative forcing for cloud-free conditions. In most of the 5 degrees regions increases in cloud liquid water with increasing aerosol optical depth enhanced the ratios by 20 - 30% over those calculated from the changes in droplet effective radius and an assumption of constant cloud liquid water. In some 5 degrees regions, however, like those just to the west of the Iberian peninsula, the column amount of cloud liquid water decreased with increasing aerosol optical depth.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Coakley, JA (corresponding author), Dept Environm Engn, Bldg Res Inst, 1 Tehara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050802, Japan.",coakley@coas.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,32,13,13,0,1,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Some forms of soil carbon, or organic matter, are more stable and have a longer residence time in soil than others. Relative differences in stability have often been derived from shifts in delta C-13 (which is bound to a vegetation change from C3 to C4 type) or through C-14-dating (which is bound to small sample numbers because of high measurement costs). Here, we propose a new concept based on the increase in delta N-15 and the decrease in C:N ratio with increasing stability. We tested the concept on grasslands at different elevations in the Swiss Alps. Depending on elevation and soil depth, it predicted mineral-associated organic carbon to be 3 to 73 times more stable than particulate organic carbon. Analysis of C-14-ages generally endorsed these predictions.","[Conen, F.; Seth, B.; Alewell, C.] Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Zimmermann, M.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Leifeld, J.] Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Basel; University of Edinburgh,"Conen, F (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, Bernoullistr 30, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",franz.conen@unibas.ch,"Zimmermann, Michael/F-7547-2010; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Alewell, Christine/K-5104-2016","Zimmermann, Michael/0000-0002-5162-2008; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Conen, Franz/0000-0003-4821-5775; Alewell, Christine/0000-0001-9295-9806",,,,,29,44,45,3,62,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2008,1,,,,123,128,,10.5194/bg-5-123-2008,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-5-123-2008,,,6,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,258HN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000252859100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we exploit sub-fossil New Zealand kauri trees to report the first securely dated, decadally-resolved atmospheric radiocarbon (C-14) record spanning GS-1. By precisely aligning Southern and Northern Hemisphere tree-ring C-14 records with marine C-14 sequences we document two relatively short periods of AMOC collapse during the stadial, at similar to 12,920-12,640 cal BP and 12,050-11,900 cal BP. In addition, our data show that the interhemispheric atmospheric C-14 offset was close to zero prior to GS-1, before reaching 'near-modern' values at similar to 12,660 cal BP, consistent with synchronous recovery of overturning in both hemispheres and increased Southern Ocean ventilation. Hence, sustained North Atlantic cooling across GS-1 was not driven by a prolonged AMOC reduction but probably due to an equatorward migration of the Polar Front, reducing the advection of southwesterly air masses to high latitudes. Our findings suggest opposing hemispheric temperature trends were driven by atmospheric teleconnections, rather than AMOC changes.","[Hogg, Alan] Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Lab, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Southon, John; Noronha, Alexandra] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Turney, Chris; Palmer, Jonathan] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk; Staff, Richard] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Fenwick, Pavla] Gondwana Tree Ring Lab, POB 14, Canterbury 7546, New Zealand; [Boswijk, Gretel] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Friedrich, Michael; Kromer, Bernd] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, INF 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Friedrich, Michael] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Bot, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Helle, Gerhard] GFZ German Res Ctr GeoSci, Dendrochronol Lab, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Hughen, Konrad] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jones, Richard] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Reynard, Linda] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wacker, Lukas] HPK, Lab Ion Beam Phys, H29,Otto Stern Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Waikato; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Oxford; University of Auckland; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University Hohenheim; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Exeter; Harvard University,"Hogg, A (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Lab, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand.;Turney, C (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",alan.hogg@waikato.ac.nz; c.turney@unsw.edu.au,"Palmer, Jonathan G/J-7834-2012; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/A-3277-2012; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/AAQ-2227-2021; Reynard, Linda M./AFQ-9581-2022; Turney, Chris S M/P-8701-2018; Noronha, Alexandra/C-6814-2015","Palmer, Jonathan G/0000-0002-6665-4483; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Reynard, Linda M./0000-0001-5732-1532; Turney, Chris S M/0000-0001-6733-0993; Boswijk, Gretel/0000-0003-3583-7575; Noronha, Alexandra/0000-0002-8728-2770; Helle, Gerhard/0000-0001-9988-6638; Friedrich, Michael/0000-0003-1614-0959; Staff, Richard/0000-0002-8634-014X","Ministry for Business, Innovation AMP; Employment (MBIE) [PROP-20224-SFK-UOA]; Royal Society of New Zealand grant; Australian Research Council [FL100100195, DP0664898]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H009922/1, NE/I007660/1, NER/A/S/2001/01037, NE/H007865/1]; Ministry for Business, Innovation AMP; Employment (MBIE) [PROP-20224-SFK-UOA]; Royal Society of New Zealand grant; Australian Research Council [FL100100195, DP0664898]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H009922/1, NE/I007660/1, NER/A/S/2001/01037, NE/H007865/1]; NERC [NE/H009922/1, NE/I007660/1, NE/H007865/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Ministry for Business, Innovation AMP; Employment (MBIE); Royal Society of New Zealand grant(Royal Society of New Zealand); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Ministry for Business, Innovation AMP; Employment (MBIE); Royal Society of New Zealand grant(Royal Society of New Zealand); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank Mr A.

As the applications for such systems are increasing, it was necessary to analyse in detail data for materials which are already available to improve their thermal performance. In this paper the experimental campaign was based on the detailed characterization of the equivalent thermal conductivity parameters of several representative polycarbonate panels. The dependence of the equivalent thermal conductivity on the temperature and different angles of inclination are analyzed. Increasing the angle of the investigated polycarbonate panels changed the thermal conductivity parameters to a very minor degree. On the other hand, the effect of temperature on the thermal properties is proved to be significant and the conversion temperature coefficient is provided in this regard. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical analysis is employed to validate three-dimensional CFD models and simulate the thermal performance of low-e panels for it to theoretically improve their overall thermal parameters. When applying low-e functionality, depending on the type of polycarbonate panel, the equivalent thermal conductivity was found to range from 0.03750 W/(m.K) to 0.04172 W/(m.K), representing a reduction ranging from 43% to 24%.","[Cekon, Miroslav; Sikula, Ondrej] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Brno, Czech Republic; [Cekon, Miroslav] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Civil Engn, Bratislava, Slovakia",Brno University of Technology; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava,"Cekon, M (corresponding author), Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Brno, Czech Republic.",cekon.m@fce.vutbr.cz,"Sikula, Ondrej/J-4390-2012; Čekon, Miroslav/P-7277-2015","Sikula, Ondrej/0000-0002-7661-0732; Čekon, Miroslav/0000-0002-6128-3943","Czech Science Foundation in Czechia [GA 20-00630S]; Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [VEGA 1/0680/20]","Czech Science Foundation in Czechia; Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This research was supported by Czech Science Foundation in Czechia, project GA 20-00630S Climate responsive components integrated in energy and environmentally efficient building envelope, and by project No. VEGA 1/0680/20 supported the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.

The study focuses on formaldehyde and ozone, and a budget analysis was set up for interpreting the importance of different processes, namely emission, chemistry, transport and deposition, for three different areas (urban, downwind, suburban) around the Milan metropolitan region. In addition, a sensitivity study was carried out based on 11 different VOC emission scenarios. The results of the budget study show that the strongest O-3 production rate (4 ppbv/hour) occurs in the downwind area of the city of Milan, and that accumulated O3 is transported back to Milan city during nighttime. More than 80% of the HCHO concentration over the Milan metropolitan region is secondary, i. e., photochemically produced from other VOCs. The sensitivity study shows that the emissions of isoprene are not, on average, a controlling factor for the peak concentrations of O3 and HCHO over the model domain because of very few oak trees in this region. Although the paraffinic (PAR) emissions are fairly large, a 20% reduction of PAR yields only 1.7% of HCHO reduction and 2.7% reduction of the O3 peak. The largest reduction of O3 levels can be obtained by reduced xylene (XYL) emissions. A 20% reduction of the total anthropogenic VOC emissions leads to 15.5% (20.3 ppbv) reduction of O3 peak levels over the Milan metropolitan region.","Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway; Norwegian Inst Air Res, Kjeller, Norway; Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, Villigen, Switzerland; Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab Aerol, UMR 5560, Toulouse, France; Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Res Ctr Karlsruhe, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem Atmospher Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; World Meteorol Org, Environm Div, AREP, Geneva, Switzerland; Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich, Germany",University of Oslo; Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Gothenburg; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Liu, L (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway.",,"Prevot, Andre S.

Several such emission models exist, but their differences need to be systematically compared. This paper compares the basic theories of two models: the multiple-layer Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) model and the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS). By comparing the mathematical formulation side by side, three major differences were identified: 1) by assuming that the scattered intensity is mostly (96%) in the forward direction, the HUT model simplifies the radiative transfer equation in 4p space into two one-flux equations, whereas MEMLS uses a two-flux theory; 2) the HUT scattering coefficient is much larger than the one of MEMLS; and 3) MEMLS considers the trapped radiation inside snow due to internal reflection by a six-flux model, which is not included in HUT. Simulation experiments indicate that the large scattering coefficient of the HUT model compensates for its large forward scattering ratio to some extent, but the effects of one-flux simplification and the trapped radiation still result in different TB simulations between the HUT model and MEMLS. The models were compared with observations of natural snow cover at Sodankyla, Finland; Churchill, Canada; and Colorado, USA. No optimization of the snow grain size was performed. It shows that the HUT model tends to underestimate TB for deep snow. MEMLS with the physically based improved Born approximation performed best among the models, with a bias of -1.4 K and a root-mean-square error of 11.0 K.","[Pan, Jinmei; Durand, Michael] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Pan, Jinmei; Durand, Michael] Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Sandells, Melody] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Sandells, Melody] Engn & Sci Ltd, Ctr Open Res CORES, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE39 2JA, Tyne & Wear, England; [Lemmetyinen, Juha; Pulliainen, Jouni; Kontu, Anna] Finish Meteorol Inst, Art Res Ctr, Sodankyla 99600, Finland; [Kim, Edward J.] NASA, Hydrospher & Biospher Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Derksen, Chris] Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Derksen, Chris] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; University of Reading; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Waterloo,"Pan, JM; Durand, M (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Pan, JM; Durand, M (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Sandells, M (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.;Sandells, M (corresponding author), Engn & Sci Ltd, Ctr Open Res CORES, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE39 2JA, Tyne & Wear, England.;Lemmetyinen, J; Pulliainen, J; Kontu, A (corresponding author), Finish Meteorol Inst, Art Res Ctr, Sodankyla 99600, Finland.;Kim, EJ (corresponding author), NASA, Hydrospher & Biospher Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.;Derksen, C (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.;Derksen, C (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",pan.290@osu.edu; durand.8@osu.edu; melody.sandells@coresscience.co.uk; juha.lemmetyinen@fmi.fi; ed.kim@nasa.gov; jouni.pulliainen@fmi.fi; anna.kontu@fmi.fi; chris.derksen@ec.gc.ca,"Durand, Michael Thomas/D-2885-2013; Pulliainen, Jouni/Y-4810-2019; Derksen, Chris/S-9828-2017; Kontu, Anna/O-8886-2014; Lemmetyinen, Juha/B-3739-2016; Sandells, Melody/AAO-4664-2020","Durand, Michael Thomas/0000-0003-2682-6196; Pulliainen, Jouni/0000-0003-1157-2920; Derksen, Chris/0000-0001-6821-5479; Kontu, Anna/0000-0001-6880-6260; Lemmetyinen, Juha/0000-0003-4434-9696; Sandells, Melody/0000-0002-4120-5163; Pan, Jinmei/0000-0003-2726-771X; KIM, Edward J./0000-0002-9828-4624",China Scholarship Council; NASA New Investigator Program [NNX13AB63G]; National Centre for Earth Observation Project [R8/H12/82 NERC],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); NASA New Investigator Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Centre for Earth Observation Project,"This work was supported in part by the China Scholarship Council (2012-2016), by the NASA New Investigator Program under Grant NNX13AB63G, and by the National Centre for Earth Observation Project (R8/H12/82 NERC).",,54,26,26,2,22,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

Here we report and interpret an observation from boreal ecosystems in the Lena River basin, Sakha Republic (Yakutia), Russian Federation. Different types of permafrost soil (0-30cm depth) were sampled along transects (60-150 m length) from the forest edge towards the centre of four separate thermokarst depressions under grassland. The average values of delta N-15 were remarkably similar within three transects, but differed systematically between them. Three findings point towards fire being the cause of the observed pattern. First, the spatial extent of systematic differences in soil delta N-15 coincides with the extent of typical fire scars in the region. Second, soil enrichment in N-15 is larger in the proximity of settlements, where fire is generally more frequent than in more remote places. Third, there is a significant positive correlation between delta N-15 values and the ratio of black C to total N. These findings point towards fire having a marked impact on soil delta N-15 and, accordingly, on the N cycle of this cold and dry ecosystem.

The streak was latitudinally narrow (similar to 0.5 degrees GLAT), zonally elongated (>10 degrees GLON), and vertically extended for several hundred kilometers. Inside the streak, as observed by CHAMP, the deviation of the magnetic field from the background is greater in the zonal component than in the meridional component. This observation is consistent with the zonally extended nature of the streak, as confirmed by TIMED/GUVI optical observations. The field-aligned current (FAC) direction is generally upward (downward) at the equatorward (poleward) edge of the streak. We discuss the time history of observed features. We suggest the following scenario of the streak formation. A storm-enhanced density (SED) was generated before 19 h local time by a sub-auroral polarization stream (SAPS). The SED gradually separated from the poleward-retreating region of strong westward plasma drift and turned into an electron density enhancement fossil (EDEF). This EDEF at mid-latitude (about 40 degrees S MLAT) practically co-rotated with the Earth for more than 10 h through the night till dawn. We suggest that the enhanced plasma pressure was counter-balanced by magnetic pressure gradient and kept stable over many hours. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An appropriate model is key for the optimal operation of the plant. Conventional prediction techniques are not good enough to produce the desired results and determination of the suitable structure of using either fuzzy, artificial neural network or adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system becomes cumbersome. This article proposed the application of advanced machine learning methodologies, for example, extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) for modeling the Bunus regional sewage treatment plant. These advanced machine learning methods were also compared with conventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Observed data from the Bunus regional wastewater treatment plant was used for the modeling. The simulation results indicated that the ELM model performed better than the SVM and ARIMA models with a decrease in mean absolute percentage error by 19% and 29% than SVM and ARIMA models respectively. As the choice of input parameters often affects the modeling performance different combinations of input variables were selected. It was observed that influent biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, ammonium iron (NH4) were able to model the process better than other input parameter combinations.","[Quoc Bao Pham] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Environm Qual Atmospher Sci & Climate Change Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Quoc Bao Pham] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Gaya, M.

This paper presents the development and evaluation of the Gender for Energy Security (GENS) codesign toolkit, which was made to facilitate the design of gendered energy innovations for informal urban settlements. The toolkit was developed by applying the Design Research Methodology (DRM) and is grounded in the findings of a literature review, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in two informal urban settlements. The toolkit aimed to support codesign processes by providing its users with knowledge about the gendered energy scene in informal urban settlements and facilitating idea generation for gendered urban energy innovations. The evaluation of the GENS codesign toolkit was conducted during a one-day multistakeholder codesign workshop in Nairobi, Kenya. During the testing, we found that the toolkit was successful in facilitating energetic discussions, helping its users to learn about the gender-energy nexus in informal urban settlements and generate original ideas for gendered energy innovations. The toolkit is an addition to the current tools, handbooks and manuals on mainstreaming gender in the energy sector, with a unique focus on informal urban settlements and supporting idea generation.","[Petrulaityte, Aine; Ceschin, Fabrizio] Brunel Univ London, Brunel Design Sch, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Musango, Josephine Kaviti; Anditi, Christer] Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Publ Leadership, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Mwiti, Betty Karimi] Univ Nairobi, Sch Art & Design, POB 29053-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Njoroge, Peris] Univ Nairobi, Inst Climate Change & Adaptat, Box 29053-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",Brunel University; Stellenbosch University; University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi,"Ceschin, F (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Brunel Design Sch, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",aine.petrulaityte@brunel.ac.uk; fabrizio.ceschin@brunel.ac.uk; josephine.musango@spl.sun.ac.za; mwiti.bk@uonbi.ac.ke; christeranditi@gmail.com; perisnjoroge764@gmail.com,"Anditi, Christer/GRS-8210-2022","Mwiti, Betty/0000-0002-3724-061X; Musango, Josephine Kaviti/0000-0001-9635-0002",National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa; Newton Fund through the British Council [SARCHI18076349612],National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); Newton Fund through the British Council,"This research was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa and the Newton Fund through the British Council, grant number SARCHI18076349612.",,51,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,10,,,,,,6291,10.3390/su14106291,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14106291,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1R3KH,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000803271500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their traditional costumes have distinctive regional styles and represent strong cultural diversity. This research deconstructs the Chiang costume and examines its elements. Here, we clarified the status of the current heritage value of the Chiang costume and the main factors affecting its spatial differentiation. The spatial differentiation pattern of Chiang costume heritage values was determined and correlated with natural factors. The research suggests the following: (1) Chiang embroidery is the most important element of the Chiang costume in terms of heritage, whereas the Shibi costume has the lowest heritage value, illustrating that the heritage value of the costume is closely related to its practicality and how much it is worn in daily life. (2) Natural factors (temperature > elevation > precipitation) best explain the spatial differentiation of Chiang costume heritage values. (3) The heritage values of the Chiang costume in the study area show distinct spatial differentiation, increasing with elevation. Finally, the research method (identification of elements, establishment of the element list, clarification of current heritage status, clarification of the driving force, and finally determination of pattern) can be applied to studies of other ethnic cultures to improve monitoring and management of regional cultural heritage conditions.","[An, Yi-da; Wang, Qing; Yan, Wei-po; Guo, Ya-lin] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Resource, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yi, Xin] Commun Univ Shanxi, Dept Art & Design, Jinzhong City 030619, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Yan, Wei-po] Sichuan Acad Environm Policy & Planning, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwest University of Science & Technology - China; Communication University of Shanxi,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Resource, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",qingw@imde.ac.cn,,"An, yida/0000-0002-3366-9101",Science Press (China) project Research on Settlement Ecosystem and Cultural Heritage in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River,Science Press (China) project Research on Settlement Ecosystem and Cultural Heritage in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River,We appreciate the support provided by the Science Press (China) project Research on Settlement Ecosystem and Cultural Heritage in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River.''

Stunted children have altered gut bacterial communities with higher proportions of Proteobacteria, a phylum with several known human pathogens. Despite the links between an altered gut microbiota and stunting, the role of bacteriophages, highly abundant bacterial viruses, is unknown. Here, we describe the gut bacterial and bacteriophage communities of Bangladeshi stunted children younger than 38 months. We show that these children harbor distinct gut bacteriophages relative to their non-stunted counterparts. In vitro, these gut bacteriophages are infectious and can regulate bacterial abundance and composition in an age-specific manner, highlighting their possible role in the pathophysiology of child stunting. Specifically, Proteobacteria from non-stunted children increased in the presence of phages from younger stunted children, suggesting that phages could contribute to the bacterial community changes observed in child stunting.","[Mirzaei, Mohammadali Khan; Taguer, Mariia; Maurice, Corinne F.] McGill Univ, Microbiol & Immunol Dept, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Khan, Md Anik Ashfaq; Ghosh, Prakash; Chowdhury, Rajashree; Mondal, Dinesh] Int Ctr Diarrhea Dis Res Bangladesh, Nutr & Clin Serv Div, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Taranu, Zofia E.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, ACRD, Montreal, PQ H2Y 2E7, Canada; [Ru, Jinlong; Deng, Li] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Virol, D-85764 Bavaria, Germany; [Ru, Jinlong; Deng, Li] Tech Univ Munich, D-85764 Bavaria, Germany; [Kabir, Md Mamun] Icddr B, Infect Dis Div, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh",McGill University; International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR); Environment & Climate Change Canada; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Technical University of Munich; International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR),"Maurice, CF (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Microbiol & Immunol Dept, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada.",corinne.maurice@mcgill.ca,"Khan, Md Anik Ashfaq/ABA-7789-2021; Khan Mirzaei, Mohammadali/ABB-9778-2021","Khan, Md Anik Ashfaq/0000-0003-2963-7649; Khan Mirzaei, Mohammadali/0000-0003-2801-4474; Maurice, Corinne/0000-0001-7187-3472; Ru, Jinlong/0000-0002-6757-6018",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1139814]; Canada Research Chair Program [950-230748 X-242502]; EU ERC StG [803077/PHARMS],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Canada Research Chair Program(Canada Research Chairs); EU ERC StG,"This work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1139814) and the Canada Research Chair Program (950-230748 X-242502) to C.F.M.

The main motivation of the current investigation is to develop a new advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model for GWL simulation. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) optimized by Improved Alpha-Guided Grey Wolf optimization (IA-GWO) algorithm is proposed in this study for reliable prediction of GWL in an intensively irrigated region of Northwest Bangladesh. Natural and anthropogenic factors including rainfall, evapotranspiration, groundwater abstraction, and irrigation return flow were considered as input variables for the development of the models. The efficacy of the proposed model was compared with standalone ANFIS and ANN models and their hybrid versions using particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) models. Both standard statistical metrics and visual inspection of scatter plots, violin plots, and Taylor diagrams were employed for performance evaluation. Thirty-one years (1981-2011) monthly groundwater level data were used for the calibration and validation of the models. The results revealed the better performance of ANFIS-IA-GWO with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.06-0.11 and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.96-0.98 compared to ANFIS-PSO (NRMSE -0.38-0.55 and KGE -0.70-0.86) and ANN-IA-GWO (NRMSE -0.42-0.57 and KGE -0.75-0.91) and ANN-PSO (NRMSE -0.50-0.63 and KGE -0.63-0.83).

As with most shuttle launches, the three main engines injected about 350 t of water vapor between 100 and 115 km off the east coast of the United States during its ascent to orbit. We follow the motion of this exhaust with a variety of satellite and ground-based data sets and find that (1) the shuttle water vapor plume spread out horizontally in all directions over a distance of 3000 to 4000 km in 18 h, (2) a portion of the plume reached northern Europe in 21 h to form polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) that are brighter than over 99% of all PMCs observed in that region, and (3) the observed altitude dependence of the particle size is reversed with larger particles above smaller particles. We use a one- dimensional cloud formation model initialized with predictions of a plume diffusion model to simulate the unusually bright PMCs. We find that eddy mixing can move the plume water vapor down to the mesopause near 90 km where ice particles can form. If the eddy diffusion coefficient is 400 to 1000 m(2)/s, the predicted integrated cloud brightness is in agreement with both satellite and ground-based observations of the shuttle PMCs. The propellant mass of the shuttle is about 20% of that from all vehicles launched during the northern 2011 PMC season. We suggest that the brightest PMC population near 70 degrees N is formed by space traffic exhaust.","[Stevens, Michael H.; Englert, Christoph R.] USN, Res Lab, Div Space Sci, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Lossow, Stefan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Lossow, Stefan] Chalmers, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Fiedler, Jens; Baumgarten, Gerd; Luebken, Franz-Josef] Inst Atmospher Phys, Kuhlungsborn, Germany; [Hallgren, Kristofer; Hartogh, Paul] Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; [Hallgren, Kristofer] Inst Atmospher Phys, Kuhlungsborn, Germany; [Randall, Cora E.] Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Randall, Cora E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lumpe, Jerry] Computat Phys Inc, Boulder, CO USA; [Bailey, Scott M.] Virginia Polytech & State Univ, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Niciejewski, R.] Univ Michigan, Space Phys Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Meier, R.

However, there is no consensus on early H. sapiens demographic structure, or its effects on intra-African dispersals. Here, we show how a patchwork of ecological corridors and bottlenecks triggered a successive budding of populations across the Sahara. Using a temporally and spatially explicit palaeoenvironmental model, we found that the Sahara was not uniformly ameliorated between similar to 130 and 75 thousand years ago (ka), as has been stated. Model integration with multivariate analyses of corresponding stone tools then revealed several spatially defined technological clusters which correlated with distinct palaeobiomes. Similarities between technological clusters were such that they decreased with distance except where connected by palaeohydrological networks. These results indicate that populations at the Eurasian gateway were strongly structured, which has implications for refining the demographic parameters of dispersals out of Africa.

A classical Chinese garden (Lingering Garden) located south of the Yangtze River, China was selected as the study area. The microclimate parameters of the garden, including air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, as well as the standard effective temperature (SET*) were obtained using field-measurement-validated ENVI-met model simulations. The water bodies, trees, and buildings in the garden were redesigned by varying their coverage or density. The microclimate parameters and SET* values of the redesigned scenarios were then compared with those of the actual garden. The results indicated that the garden generally exhibited a modification effect. A number of available design strategies were proposed. The microclimate and thermal comfort of a classical Chinese garden can generally be improved by increasing the water coverage and decreasing the building coverage, as well as optimizing the tree coverage. The SET* value can be decreased by more than 1 degrees C on hot summer days if the water body coverage is increased from 10% to 40%; the SET* value can be reduced by approximately 0.5 degrees C if the tree coverage is increased from 35% to 70%, while the SET* value is approximately 0.25 degrees C lower for 15% tree coverage than it is for of 35% tree coverage. In addition, the difference of SET* values between the cases of 10% and 30% building coverage can reach as much as 1 degrees C. Therefore, various landscape elements should be comprehensively considered in order to achieve more comfortable thermal conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Archaeozoological and archaeobotanical evidence indicates that these hunter-gatherers exploited tropical forest resources, yet the contribution of these resources to their overall subsistence strategies has, as in other Late Pleistocene rainforest settings, remained relatively unexplored. We build on previous work in this tropical region by applying both bulk and sequential stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis to human and faunal tooth enamel from the sites of Batadomba-lena, Fa Hien-lena, and Balangoda Kuragala. Tooth enamel preservation was assessed by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. We use these data to produce a detailed stable isotope ecology for Late Pleistocene-Holocene foragers in Sri Lanka from similar to 36-29,000 to 3000 cal. years BP, allowing us to test the degree of human tropical forest resource reliance over a considerable time period. Given that non-human primates dominate the mammalian assemblages at these sites, we also focus on the stable isotope composition of three monkey species in order to study their ecological preferences and, indirectly, human hunting strategies. The results confirm a strong human reliance on tropical forest resources from similar to 36-29,000 cal. years BP until the Iron Age similar to 3 cal. years BP, while sequential tooth data show that forest resources were exploited year-round. This strategy was maintained through periods of evident environmental change at the Last Glacial Maximum and upon the arrival of agriculture. Long-term tropical forest reliance was supported by the specialised capture of non-human primates, although the isotopic data revealed no evidence for niche distinction between the hunted species. We conclude that humans rapidly developed a specialisation in the exploitation of South Asia's tropical forests following their arrival in this region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The quantification of soil erosion was performed on hill slope scale (2 center dot 20 m) for three different land use types: hayfields, pastures with dwarf shrubs and pastures without dwarf shrubs with three replicates each. Erosion rates during growing season were measured with sediment traps between June 2006 and November 2007. Long-term soil erosion rates were estimated based on Cs- 137 redistribution. In addition, soil moisture and surface flow were recorded during the growing season in the field and compared to model output. We chose the WEPP model (Water Erosion Prediction Project) to simulate soil erosion during the growing season. Model parameters were determined in the field (slope, plant species, fractional vegetation cover, initial saturation level), by laboratory analyses (grain size, organic matter) and by literature study. The WEPP model simulates sheet erosion processes (interrill and splash erosion processes, please note that no rill erosion occurs at our sites). Model output resulted in considerable smaller values than the measured erosion rates with sediment traps for the same period. We attribute the differences to observed random gravity driven erosion of soil conglomerates. The Cs-137 measurements deliver substantially higher mean annual erosion rates, which are most likely connected to snow cover related processes such as snow gliding and avalanche activities.","[Konz, N.; Baenninger, D.; Alewell, C.] Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Konz, N.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Konz, M.] ETH, Inst Environm Engn Hydrol & Water Resources Manag, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nearing, M.] ARS, USDA, Natl Soil Eros Res Lab, W Lafayette, IN USA",University of Basel; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; ETH Zurich; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Konz, N (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, Bernoullistr 30, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",n.konz@gmx.ch,"Alewell, Christine/K-5104-2016","Alewell, Christine/0000-0001-9295-9806",State Secretariat for Education and Research (SER),State Secretariat for Education and Research (SER),"This work was financially supported by the State Secretariat for Education and Research (SER), in the framework of the European COST action 634: On- and Off-site Environmental Impacts of Runoff and Erosion.",,34,20,21,1,26,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

This is due mainly to their relationship, both with the comfort of their occupants and with energy efficiency. The adaptive thermal comfort theory addresses this problem by linking the indoor comfort temperature with the outside temperature. This idea represents a relaxation in the presence of strict set-point temperatures. This results in a greater tolerance of the indoor environment and thus, in a wider range of acceptability on the part of the occupants of the buildings. Nonetheless, and although previous studies have been carried out on naturally ventilated buildings, there are no standards or application guides for hybrid buildings. This study shows the applicability of the adaptive model to hybrid buildings. An adaptive model for hybrid buildings is proposed, valid for both the free-running and air-conditioned modes, based on a field study carried out in the southwestern region of Spain. A total of 4.243 responses in mixed mode buildings and a total of 891 in air-conditioned building were collected over the period of a year. The comfort temperature in hybrid buildings was observed at an average operative temperature of 23.6 degrees C. The results show the energy-saving potential of hybrid buildings, without foregoing the comfort of their occupants, and show that it would be possible to implement a law that optimizes the operation of conditioning systems and which would undoubtedly lead to greater energy efficiency in such buildings.

Pygmy perches are minature percichthyid fishes from temperate southern Australia of significant conservation concern, with five of the seven described species being threatened nationally. The present paper examines the plight of Yarra pygmy perch Nannoperca obscura, and variegated pygmy perch N. variegata, and discusses the progress of national (and State) recovery-plan actions. Threats and risks to these species are considerable; however, overall, few recovery actions have been completed and the status of many populations is unknown following the recent 'millenium drought'. Habitat restoration, fish rescues, environmental water delivery and research into distribution, ecology and population dynamics are largely driven by individuals within singular local management authorities. Like many small fishes, they receive less attention than do larger ones and a cross-jurisdictional national recovery team is required to prioritise, coordinate and implement conservation efforts before the continued persistence of these species can be assured. These two small fishes are representative of many similar species and the lessons from the present case study may be applied elsewhere throughout the world.","[Saddlier, Stephen; Koehn, John D.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, Heidelberg, Vic 3083, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia",Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research (ARI),"Saddlier, S (corresponding author), Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, 123 Brown St, Heidelberg, Vic 3083, Australia.",steve.sadd@yahoo.com,,"Hammer, Michael/0000-0002-0981-4647",,,,,126,24,24,3,40,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

The track was exposed to drift on 18 February 2017, over a length of 10 km, in the district of Dhahran in the capital of Dammam. Flooding caused the train to drift off its track and resulted in damage to lives, property, and infrastructure. This resulted from human interventions in the preplanning land uses and changing the morphology of the land by encroaching on the valleys, which resulted in the loss of the environmental and ecological balance in the study area. In order to achieve these goals, land-use changes in the study area were monitored by analyzing successive images from the GEO-I-1 satellite with a resolution of 60 cm for the years 2011 and 2017, before and after the train drift, using the maximum likelihood classification process provided in ERDAS IMAGINE 2016. GIS was used in the processing of 1 m digital elevation models to extract the morphological changes of the wadies between 2011 and 2017. A hydrological model (HEC-HMS) was used in calculating the (flood) hydrograph curve of the wadies basins and estimating the calculation of flood water quantities and its flow rates based on the Soil Conservation Services (SCS) Unit Hydrograph Method. Rain depth was analyzed and estimated for different return periods. The HEC-RAS hydraulic modeling program was employed in developing a 2D model to calculate the velocity, depth, and spread of the flood in order to apply the risk matrix method.","[Abdelkarim, Ashraf] Minist Housing, Res Ctr, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia; [Gaber, Ahmed F.

Although it is not always possible to find suitable macrofossils for 14C dating, microfossils, notably plant pollen, are a viable alternative. Obtaining preserved pollen samples of known provenance and of sufficient quantity for dating by 14C AMS is, however, challenging because of time-consuming methods of extraction and purification and possible contamination from other organic material. Here we report a new, rapid and straightforward method using flow cytometry (FCM) to distinguish, sort and collect sufficient quantities of fossil pollen with minimal contamination from lake sediments for radiocarbon dating. Using this approach, we demonstrate 14C AMS ages that date back to at least 40ka BP. While future work may be required to refine purification methodologies for different sample types and to precisely quantify the dating limit of this approach, FCM dating of microfossils shows considerable promise in generating robust geochronological frameworks for sequences that have previously proved problematic.

Two different chiral peptidomimetic scaffolds were introduced on the tail region of non-selective type II kinase inhibitor GNF-7 to enhance the selectivity. Kinome-wide selectivity profiling analysis showed that type II kinase inhibitor 7a potently inhibited Lck kinase with great selectivity (IC50 of 23.0 nM). It was found that 7a and its derivatives possessed high selectivity for Lck over even structurally conserved all Src family kinases. We also observed that 7a inhibited Lck activation in Jurkat T cells. Moreover, 7a was found to alleviate clinical symptoms in DSS-induced colitis mice.

The effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2, 4. 6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP) on the surface properties of the silver-filled asymmetric membrane were investigated for antibacterial application. The dispersion of silver nanoparticles (Ag) and silver content on membrane surface were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). respectively. Results showed that smaller silver particles were formed in PES membranes when PVP and TAP were added during dope preparation. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), it is found that silver leaching has been significantly reduced up to 57% and 63% upon the addition of PVP and TAP respectively. The improved silver dispersion on membrane surfaces was able to enhance the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as evidenced by larger inhibition ring in agar diffusion method. The filtration of E. coli suspension (optical density =0.31 at lambda = 600 nm) carried out on prepared membranes proved that PES-AgNO3 with TAP as dispersant appeared to inhibit almost 100% bacterial growth in rich medium. Hence, overall results showed the potential of PES-AgNO3 with TAP to be used for antibacterial applications especially in water treatment. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This Perspective comparatively assesses indirect CO- and direct CO2-based solar strategies and identifies the conditions under which the former becomes economically viable. The intermittency of renewable electricity requires the deployment of energy-storage technologies as global energy grids become more sustainably sourced. Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) and intermittently generated renewable hydrogen to stored products such as methanol (MeOH) allows the cyclic use of carbon and addresses the challenges of storage energy density, size and transportability as well as responsiveness to energy production and demand better than most storage alternatives. Deploying this storage solution efficiently and at scale requires the optimization of production conditions to ensure predictable and maximum long-term process performance. Key to enabling this solution is the generation of highly productive syngas that is rich in carbon monoxide (CO) via reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) or solid-oxide electrolysis cell technologies. The focus herein is the RWGS reaction as it enables a solar-to-fuel efficiency of around 10% that can be deployable at a commercial scale. The need for a higher-efficiency route to renewable MeOH is discussed, and a comparative technoeconomic analysis of two solar-derived MeOH (solar MeOH) strategies is presented: the solar-CO-rich (based on the solar-RWGS process) and the solar-direct-CO2 routes.","[Tountas, Athanasios A.; Sain, Mohini M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ozin, Geoffrey A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sain, Mohini M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Ozin, GA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON, Canada.",g.ozin@utoronto.ca,,,"Ford Motor Canada; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (MRI); Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure (MEDI); Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change's (MOECC) Best in Science (BIS) Award; Ministry of Research Innovation and Science (MRIS) Low Carbon Innovation Fund (LCIF); Imperial Oil; University of Toronto's Connaught Innovation Fund (CIF), Connaught Global Challenge (CGC) Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ontario Centre of Excellence Solutions 2030 Challenge Fund","Ford Motor Canada; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (MRI)(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure (MEDI); Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change's (MOECC) Best in Science (BIS) Award; Ministry of Research Innovation and Science (MRIS) Low Carbon Innovation Fund (LCIF); Imperial Oil; University of Toronto's Connaught Innovation Fund (CIF), Connaught Global Challenge (CGC) Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ontario Centre of Excellence Solutions 2030 Challenge Fund","Thank you to X.

A distinction is made between mechanistic and statistical models, and the relative merits of each are considered. The question of when do aquatic systems models provide accurate and useful predictions? is addressed, implying some guidelines for model development. It is proposed that, in general, ecological models only provide management-relevant predictions of the behaviour of real systems when there are strong physical (as opposed to chemical or ecological) drivers. Developments over the past 15 years have included changes in technology, changes in the modelling community and changes in the context in which modelling is conducted: the implications of each are briefly discussed. Current trends include increased uptake of best practice guidelines, increasing integration of models, operationalisation, data assimilation, development of improved tools for skill assessment, and application of models to new management questions and in new social contexts. Deeper merging of statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches through such techniques as Bayesian Melding, Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and surrogate modelling is identified as a key emerging area. Finally, it is suggested that there is a need to systematically identify areas in which our current models are inadequate. We do not yet know for which categories of problems well-implemented aquatic systems models can (or cannot) be expected to accurately predict observational data and system behaviour. This can be addressed through better modelling and publishing practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to put forward a simple guideline that companies can follow and guide them in achieving their carbon emission targets, as well as obtaining attractive supply chain savings. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a literature review and benchmarking this paper proposes a methodology based on three pillars: 1) Corporate Carbon Strategy; 2) Carbon emission roadmap; and 3) Implementation and tracking. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques were used in order to create a green strategy and support the decision-making processes to select the most interesting alternatives for carbon emission reduction and supply chain savings. The supply chain of a metallurgical company is used to illustrate the case study where the proposed methodology is used. The criteria used for the carbon alternatives selection was based on three factors: 1) the supply chain cost of the alternative; 2) carbon emission impact in terms of CO2 tonnes; and 3) marketing effect. Findings: The paper identifies some specific steps for developing a Green Supply Chain Strategy. The case study developed, demonstrates the importance of following a proper methodology based on a set of steps, it also demonstrates that some alternatives focus on improving the supply chain, such as the facilities location, can also improve the key performance indicator related with carbon emission. Originality/value: The study provides guidance for manufacturing companies in implementing their Green Supply Chain Strategy.","[Pinto Taborga, Carola; Lusa, Amaia; Maria Coves, Anna] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Taborga, CP (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain.",cpintotaborga@gmail.com; amaia.lusa@upc.edu; anna.maria.coves@upc.edu,,"Lusa, Amaia/0000-0002-1408-6496",MINECO/FEDER [DPI2015-67740-P],MINECO/FEDER,This paper was supported by the project DPI2015-67740-P(MINECO/FEDER).,,49,3,3,5,24,OMNIASCIENCE,BARCELONA,"TERRASSA, BARCELONA, 00000, SPAIN",2013-8423,2013-0953,,J IND ENG MANAG-JIEM,J.

This shift leads to more reduced conditions and changes in the biogeochemical function of the sediments. By combining imaging techniques for O-2 (planar optodes) and irrigation patterns (rhodamine WT and brilliant blue), we investigated the relationship between irrigation and O-2 dynamics in burrows of M. viridis. The investigated animals shifted between 2 modes of ventilation: ciliary pumping for 77% of the time and muscular pumping for 23% of the time. On average, muscular pumping was induced every 0.4 h. During ciliary pumping, oxic water was pumped into blind-ended burrows and into the surrounding sediment, inducing an upward porewater transport of O-2-depleted water. This pattern was reversed during muscular pumping. The 2 pumping modes induced oscillating O-2 penetration along the burrow wall and along the primary sediment-water interface. The average net downward irrigation rate, including both pumping modes, amounted to 11.1 x 10(-3) +/- 2.4 x 10(-3) ml min(-1). The estimated average oxic sediment volume was 2.1 +/- 0.5 cm(3) per burrow, and the burrow-specific O-2 consumption was 45.6 +/- 18.1 nmol min(-1). M. viridis burrows and the ambient sediment are relatively O-2 depleted, with intensified rates of O-2 consumption, compared to similar-sized native N. diversicolor. The complex O-2 dynamics induced a unique microenvironment that must favor meiofauna and microbial communities that are tolerant to oxic-anoxic oscillations or that have the ability to migrate along with the pulsing oxic-anoxic interface.","[Jovanovic, Zeljko; Larsen, Morten; Quintana, Cintia Organo; Kristensen, Erik; Glud, Ronnie N.] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Larsen, Morten; Glud, Ronnie N.] Dunstaffnage Marine Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Larsen, Morten; Glud, Ronnie N.] CO Greenland Inst Natl Resources, Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Nuuk 3900, Greenland; [Glud, Ronnie N.] Art Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus Univ C, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; UHI Millennium Institute; Greenland Institute of Natural Resources; Aarhus University,"Glud, RN (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",rnglud@biology.sdu.dk,"Quintana, Cintia Organo/B-7797-2012","Quintana, Cintia Organo/0000-0002-3022-6145; Glud, Ronnie N./0000-0002-7069-893X; Kristensen, Erik/0000-0001-7259-0132","Faculty of Science at the University of Southern Denmark; Danish Council for Independent Research [FNU-12-125843, DNRF53]; European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-20100224]; Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland [GCRC6507]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H017216/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/H017216/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Faculty of Science at the University of Southern Denmark; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We acknowledge financial support from the Faculty of Science at the University of Southern Denmark, the Danish Council for Independent Research (FNU-12-125843, DNRF53), European Research Council Advanced Grants (ERC-2010-AdG-20100224) and the Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland (GCRC6507).

Efficient planning to meet building energy needs while increasing operational, economic, and environmental efficiency requires accurate, high spatial resolution information on energy consumption. Such information is difficult to acquire and most models for estimating residential building energy consumption require detailed knowledge of individual homes and communities which are unlikely to be available at a large scale. To address this need, we introduce a methodology for automatically estimating individual building energy consumption from overhead imagery (e.g. satellite, aerial) and demonstrate the effect of spatial aggregation for further improving accuracy. We use a three-step estimation process by which we (1) automatically segment buildings in overhead imagery using a convolutional neural network and classify them by type (residential or commercial), (2) extract features (e.g. area, perimeter, building density) from those identified residential buildings, and (3) use random forests regression to estimate building energy consumption from those features. The predictive capability of this approach is evaluated in two locations: Gainesville, Florida, and San Diego, California. The building detector correctly identifies 84% and 88% of buildings in Gainesville and San Diego, respectively. The type of building is classified successfully 99% of the time for residential buildings and 74% of the time for commercial buildings. With residential buildings identified, this approach predicted individual building-level energy consumption with an R-2 of 0.28 and 0.38 for Gainesville and San Diego, respectively. Aggregating the energy consumption estimates across small neighborhoods of size 200 x 200 m and 1000 x 1000 m in Gainesville results in an R-2 of 0.91 and 0.97, respectively. We also explore the sensitivity of estimates in San Diego and Gainesville to the training data and its size. Our results suggest that using overhead imagery to estimate the size of buildings has a higher predictive power in estimating residential building energy consumption than common alternatives.","[Streltsov, Artem; Bradbury, Kyle] Duke Univ, Energy Initiat, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Malof, Jordan M.; Huang, Bohao; Bradbury, Kyle] Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Streltsov, A (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Energy Initiat, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",artem.streltsov@duke.edu,"Bradbury, Kyle/ABB-6748-2021","Bradbury, Kyle/0000-0001-9847-0243",National Science Foundation [OIA-1937137],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the work of the 2016 Data+ and 2016-2017 Bass Connections team at Duke University who laid the foundation of this work, identifying some of the datasets used in this study and putting together the first approach to the energy consumption estimation process.

We achieve this by evaluating flood risk and intervention targeting strategies across a case study in Bristol (UK) using data types generally available for preliminary option assessment. We investigate opportunities for mitigating flood damages within catchments using PFR and evaluate two targeting strategies: Installing PFR across strategic areas of a catchment and targeting interventions at specific high-risk properties. We find that individually targeting PFR is more effective than focusing resources on specific high-risk areas. Targeting pluvial flood measures at individual properties across our case study provides an average annual benefit per property of approximately 750 pound more than applying zonal targeting, supporting use of high-resolution modelling in surface water management, and highlighting the applicability of PFR to manage damages at specific high-risk properties which may not fall under the protection of community level defences. A similar approach provides the best outcomes for fluvial targeting; however, the hazard is more concentrated and so a zonal targeting approach may be more acceptable. Overall, we find resistance based PFR an effective intervention to mitigate damages, however complementary strategies are required when managing extreme flooding.","[Webber, James L.; Chen, Albert S.; Djordjevic, Slobodan; Evans, Barry] Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Stevens, John] Bristol City Council, Bristol, Avon, England; [Henderson, Rob] Wessex Water, Bristol, Avon, England; [Evans, Barry] Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand",University of Exeter; Massey University,"Webber, JL (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter, Devon, England.",j.webber2@exeter.ac.uk,"Chen, Albert S./E-2735-2010; Djordjevic, Slobodan/P-8853-2015","Chen, Albert S./0000-0003-3708-3332; Evans, Barry/0000-0003-1316-2087; Webber, James/0000-0002-1158-4895; Djordjevic, Slobodan/0000-0003-1682-1383","European Commission [244047, 700174]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/P011217/1]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"European Commission, Grant/Award Numbers: 244047, 700174; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/P011217/1",,88,1,1,9,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-318X,,,J FLOOD RISK MANAG,J.

Many studies have shown that aquatic macrophytes play a significant role in controlling eutrophication, but only few of these studies are ecosystem based. In this paper, we applied a mass-balance ecosystem model to a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Datong, China) as a case study with the aims of evaluating the status of ecosystem restoration via the recovery of aquatic vegetation and providing adaptive management suggestions. Results showed that the ecosystem was immature with weak energy flows and nutrient cycling largely due to the excessive submerged macrophytes and the lack of fish as consumer. In the early stages of restoration, the number of fish should be reduced, and aquatic vegetation needs to be recovered to mitigate eutrophication. When the aquatic vegetation community tends to be stable, herbivorous and omnivorous fish should be moderately stocked, and dead aquatic macrophytes should be harvested to maintain the healthy and sustainable development of the ecosystem. This study provided insights for the ecological restoration of shallow eutrophic lakes and revealed the urgent need for ecosystem-based restoration.","[Zhu, Konghao; Zhang, Min] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Fisheries, Freshwater Aquaculture Collaborat Innovat Ctr Hub, Hubei Prov Engn Lab Pond Aquaculture, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yao] CCCc Shanghai Waterway Engn Design & Consulting C, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunhua] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Ctr Lake Engn & Technol, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol China, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Huazhong Agricultural University; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS","Zhang, M (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Fisheries, Freshwater Aquaculture Collaborat Innovat Ctr Hub, Hubei Prov Engn Lab Pond Aquaculture, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China.",zhukonghao98@outlook.com; bigyao1988@163.com; lichunhua@craes.org.cn; xujun@ihb.ac.cn; zhm7875@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,"Zhu, Konghao/0000-0001-9515-0025",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFD0900904]; International Cooperation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [152342KYSB20190025]; National Natural Science Foundations of China [31872687]; Water Pollution Control and Management Project of China [2018ZX07208005],National Key R&D Program of China; International Cooperation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundations of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Water Pollution Control and Management Project of China,"This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFD0900904), the International Cooperation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 152342KYSB20190025), the National Natural Science Foundations of China (Grant No. 31872687), and theWater Pollution Control and Management Project of China (Grant No. 2018ZX07208005).",,70,8,10,19,75,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2020,8,,,,,,2141,10.3390/w12082141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082141,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,NH3UV,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000564599500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This performance is an order of magnitude greater than photomethanation rates achieved over control samples made of nanostructured RuO2 on silicon wafers. The high absorption and unique light-harvesting properties of the silicon photonic crystal across the entire solar spectral wavelength range coupled with its large surface area are proposed to be responsible for the high methanation rates of the RuO2 photocatalyst.

Size distributions allow us to integrate aerosol number over any size range expected to be effective cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and to provide definition of a proxy for CCN (CCNproxy). Because of the internally mixed nature of most accumulation mode aerosol and the relationship between their measured volatility and solubility, this CCNproxy can be linked to the optical properties of these size distributions at ambient conditions. This allows examination of the relationship between CCNproxy and the aerosol spectral radiances detected by satellites. Relative increases in coarse aerosol (e.g., dust) generally add only a few particles to effective CCN but significantly increase the scattering detected by satellite and drive the Angstrom exponent (alpha) toward zero. This has prompted the use of a so-called aerosol index (AI) on the basis of the product of the aerosol optical depth and the nondimensional alpha, both of which can be inferred from satellite observations. This approach biases the AI to be closer to scattering values generated by particles in the accumulation mode that dominate particle number and is therefore dominated by sizes commonly effective as CCN. Our measurements demonstrate that AI does not generally relate well to a measured proxy for CCN unless the data are suitably stratified. Multiple layers, complex humidity profiles, dust with very low a mixed with pollution, and size distribution differences in pollution and biomass emissions appear to contribute most to method limitations. However, we demonstrate that these characteristic differences result in predictable influences on AI. These results suggest that inference of CCN from satellites will be challenging, but new satellite and model capabilities could possibly be integrated to improve this retrieval.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Div Atmospher Environm, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Kapustin, VN (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, 1000 Pope Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kapustin@soest.hawaii.edu; tclarke@soest.hawaii.edu; yohei@hawaii.edu; showell@soest.hawaii.edu; verab@soest.hawaii.edu; teruyuki@ccsr.u-tokyo.ac.jp; hakiko@nies.go.jp,"Nakajima, Teruyuki/H-2370-2013","Nakajima, Teruyuki/0000-0002-9042-504X",,,,,63,29,30,1,13,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The analysis was facilitated by the Parallel Sensitivity and Auto-Calibration tool (parsac) and included a screening step with the density-based Borgonovo's method followed by in-depth analysis with both Borgonovo's and the variance-based Sobol' methods. The Borgonovo's method proved efficient in ranking the most influential parameters and its results were corroborated by the Sobol' method. For total phosphorus and total nitrogen, parameters related to the benthic-pelagic coupling and phytoplankton, were particularly important for the shallower lakes, whereas the most important parameters for total nitrogen were related mainly to the benthic-pelagic coupling in the deepest lake. For chlorophyll a, phytoplankton and zooplankton parameters were most influential. We conclude that lake morphology shapes the parameter sensitivity of lake ecosystem models.","[Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann; Bolding, Karsten; Nielsen, Anders; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Coll, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bolding, Karsten; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res SDC, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bolding, Karsten; Bruggeman, Jorn] Bolding & Bruggeman ApS, Asperup, Denmark; [Bruggeman, Jorn] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Res & Implementat, Ankara, Turkey","Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University","Andersen, TK (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",tka@bios.au.dk,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019","Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201; Bruggeman, Jorn/0000-0003-2493-2323; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Bolding, Karsten/0000-0001-8465-3196","research project on process-based lake ecosystem models; Danish Environmental Protection Agency; Danish Council for Independent Research through the CASHFISH project; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research; TUBITAK, BIDEB 2232 program [118C250]","research project on process-based lake ecosystem models; Danish Environmental Protection Agency; Danish Council for Independent Research through the CASHFISH project; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research; TUBITAK, BIDEB 2232 program(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","This work was supported partly by a research project on process-based lake ecosystem models supported by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, by the Danish Council for Independent Research through the CASHFISH project and Ph.D. funding by the Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research.

The lack of observations is a major obstacle. The Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) field campaign collected unprecedented observations from air-, land-, and ship-based platforms from October 2011 to February 2012. Here we provide an overview of the aircraft observations in DYNAMO, which captured an MJO initiation event from November to December 2011. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3D aircraft was stationed at Diego Garcia and the French Falcon 20 aircraft on Gan Island in the Maldives. Observations from the two aircraft provide a unique dataset of three-dimensional structure of convective cloud systems and their environment from the flight level, airborne Doppler radar, microphysics probes, ocean surface imaging, global positioning system (GPS) dropsonde, and airborne expendable bathythermograph (AXBT) data. The aircraft observations revealed interactions among dry air, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), convective cloud systems, and air-sea interaction induced by convective cold pools, which may play important roles in the multiscale processes of MJO initiation. This overview focuses on some key aspects of the aircraft observations that contribute directly to better understanding of the interactions among convective cloud systems, environmental moisture, and the upper ocean during the MJO initiation over the tropical Indian Ocean. Special emphasis is on the distinct characteristics of convective cloud systems, environmental moisture and winds, air-sea fluxes, and convective cold pools during the convectively suppressed, transition/onset, and active phases of the MJO.","[Chen, Shuyi S.; Kerns, Brandon W.; Judt, Falko; Savarin, Ajda] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Guy, Nick] Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Jorgensen, David P.] NOAA, Natl Severe Storms Lab, Norman, OK 73069 USA; [Delanoe, Julien; Viltard, Nicolas] Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, LATMOS, Guyancourt, France; [Zappa, Christopher J.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Lee, Chia-Ying] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA",University of Miami; University of Wyoming; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Chen, SS (corresponding author), Univ Miami, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",schen@rsmas.miami.edu,"Judt, Falko/Q-8380-2016; Judt, Falko/AAI-1997-2019","Judt, Falko/0000-0001-7710-9862; Judt, Falko/0000-0001-7710-9862; Zappa, Christopher J/0000-0003-0041-2913",NOAA [NA11OAR4310077]; NSF [AGS1062242]; ONR [N000141110562],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research),"We thank our colleagues at the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC; Jim McFadden, the pilots, aircraft crew, and flight directors) and the NCAR Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL; Jim Moore, Jose Meitin, Scot Loehrer, and others), who provided critical support for operating the aircraft from Diego Garcia and Gan during DYNAMO.

Assessment of these aims requires quantitative environmental evaluation. So far, evaluation of CCU is based on ad hoc criteria such as the amount of CO2 utilized, simplified CO2 balances or CO2 storage duration. Albeit these criteria may be useful for very early stages of potential research pathways, we show that they are insufficient as basis for decisions on implementations and that they may lead to even qualitatively wrong environmental evaluation of CCU. Therefore, a holistic evaluation using life-cycle assessment (LCA) is mandatory. However, the application of LCA to CCU is subject to methodological pitfalls: (i) utilized CO2 might intuitively be considered as negative GHG emissions; (ii) since CCU usually generates products both in the capture and in the utilization process, choices exist how to allocate emissions to the individual products and (iii) CO2 storage duration is not reflected in traditional LCA. To avoid the existing pitfalls, we provide a systematic framework for LCA of CCU in which (i) the utilized CO2 is correctly considered as regular feedstock with its own production emissions; (ii) recommendations for obtaining product-specific LCA results for CCU processes are given and (iii) the CO2 storage duration is incorporated into a time-resolved global warming metric. The developed framework is illustrated by simplified LCA of CO2 capture from the atmosphere and from coal power plants, and of CO2 utilization for methanol and polymer production. Overall, the presented framework allows for the sound environmental evaluation of CCU.","[von der Assen, Niklas; Jung, Johannes; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Lehrstuhl Tech Thermodynam, D-52062 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"von der Assen, N (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Lehrstuhl Tech Thermodynam, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",andre.bardow@ltt.rwth-aachen.de,"von der Assen, Niklas/V-6288-2019; Bardow, André/C-5446-2009","Bardow, André/0000-0002-3831-0691; von der Assen, Niklas/0000-0001-8855-9420",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01RC1005B],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work has been carried out within the project Dream Production - CO<INF>2</INF> as building block for polymers (01RC1005B).

The benefit of collaborative partnerships has been established as a beneficial mechanism to spread evidence-supported protocols in medicine and has been experimented with through Breakthrough Series Collaboratives in child welfare. Interagency collaborative teams to lead dissemination of evidence-informed practice in child welfare are now beginning to be examined as a method to scale-up practices more quickly. This article will use Family Connections, a multifaceted, community-based service program that works with families to help them meet the basic needs of their children and prevent child maltreatment as a case study for how collaborative partnerships can aid in dissemination.

The processes depicted are generally highly complex, spatially and temporally variable, subject to high degrees of uncertainty, and non-linearly impacted by anthropogenic actions. Conceptual illustrations necessarily simplify these processes, but also often suffer from a preventable lack of visual clarity, and/or are based on implicit assumptions that are mismatched to key conclusions in published literature. In this Innovative Viewpoint paper, we highlight considerations of conceptual and visual clarity relevant to illustrations in earth and environmental sciences. Using the water cycle as an example, we examine a range of conceptual illustrations of this process to assess what ideas they convey. An exploratory survey of 32 water cycle diagrams shows that they tend to depict generalized, well-defined processes. Anthropogenic influences are included and/or implied in only half the diagrams, and none depict uncertainty in any form. The concept of the water cycle conveyed by these diagrams is therefore not quite the same as the concept of the water cycle as understood by hydrologists. This mismatch may negatively impact decision-making related to water resources management, because the parties involved may unknowingly hold significantly different conceptual models of the processes at work. Other concepts in the earth and environmental sciences may be susceptible to similar issues. Our analysis highlights the importance of carefully assessing the assumptions and simplifying choices inherent in the process of translating a concept into an illustration. We conclude with an example of how these issues can be remedied by presenting a modified water cycle diagram designed to address common misconceptions associated with dryland systems, account for uncertainty in fluxes, and include key anthropogenic effects. A general list of best practices, many of which were used to develop this diagram, is included to help increase awareness among environmental researchers of strategies for increasing the conceptual and visual clarity of illustrations.","[Fandel, Chloe A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, 1133 James E Rogers Way,POB 210011, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Breshears, David D.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [McMahon, Ellen E.] Univ Arizona, Sch Art, POB 210002,1031 N Olive Rd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Fandel, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, 1133 James E Rogers Way,POB 210011, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",cfandel@email.arizona.edu,"Breshears, David D/GSN-3920-2022; Breshears, David D./B-9318-2009","Breshears, David D./0000-0001-6601-0058",NSF Critical Zone Observatories [EAR-1331408]; University of Arizona/NASA Space Grant Graduate Scholarship Program,NSF Critical Zone Observatories(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); University of Arizona/NASA Space Grant Graduate Scholarship Program,"This work was supported in part by NSF Critical Zone Observatories (EAR-1331408), as well as by the University of Arizona/NASA Space Grant Graduate Scholarship Program.

This study focuses on embayed beaches, which are physiographic units where the incident hydrodynamic conditions determine the interrelation between the beach profile and planform, resulting in a characteristic beach-planform curvature. This article presents a new equilibrium shoreline evolution model. It is a reduced-complexity model based on the integration of cross-shore, planform and rotation equilibrium-based models, and it is exclusively applicable to embayed beaches. This new approach obtains the entire beach coastline evolution over time scales spanning months, several years or decades. In contrast, previous similar models needed to discretize the beach into transects or stretches to evaluate the entire embayed shoreline beach evolution, and this process represents a significant computational cost. The proposed model has been applied to the Collaroy-Narrabeen embayment, Australia and shows overall good performance. The results demonstrate that the model successfully achieves the general erosion-accretion trend along with beach orientation variability of the entire shoreline and the dry beach area evolution at a qualitative and quantitative level. Nevertheless, observations in different sites with diverse beach characteristics and wave conditions are needed to widely validate the proposed model.","[Jaramillo, Camilo; Jara, Martinez Sanchez; Gonzalez, Mauricio; Medina, Raill] Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, Avda Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; IHCantabria - Instituto de Hidraulica Ambiental de la Universidad de Cantabria,"Jaramillo, C (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, Avda Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain.",jaramilloc@unican.es; jara.martinez@unican.es; mauricio.gonzalez@unican.es; raul.medina@unican.es,"CARDONA, CAMILO JARAMILLO/AAO-9110-2020; Medina, Raul/L-2456-2014","CARDONA, CAMILO JARAMILLO/0000-0002-0021-1014; Medina, Raul/0000-0002-0126-2710","Society for the Regional Development of Cantabria, SODERCAN group [ID16-IN-045]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [BIA2017-89491-R]","Society for the Regional Development of Cantabria, SODERCAN group; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Society for the Regional Development of Cantabria, SODERCAN group under Grant ID16-IN-045, SMC2020 Project, and the support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness under Grant BIA2017-89491-R Beach-Art Project.

This article presents an environmental assessment of a lithium-ion traction battery for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, characterized by a composite cathode material of lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide Li(NixCoyMn1-x-y)O-2. Composite cathode material is an emerging technology that promises to combine the merits of several active materials into a hybrid electrode to optimize performance and reduce costs. In this study, the environmental assessment of one battery pack (with a nominal capacity of 11.4 kWh able to be used for about 140,000 km of driving) is carried out by using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology consistent with ISO 14040. The system boundaries are the battery production, the operation phase and recycling at the end of life, including the recovery of various material fractions. The composite cathode technology examined besides a good compromise between the higher and the lower performance of NMC and LMO cathodes, can present good environmental performances. The results of the analysis show that the manufacturing phase is relevant to all assessed impact categories (contribution higher than 60%). With regard to electricity losses due to battery efficiency and battery transport, the contribution to the use phase impact of battery efficiency is larger than that of battery transport. Recycling the battery pack contributes less than 11% to all of the assessed impact categories, with the exception of freshwater ecotoxicity (60% of the life cycle impact). The environmental credits related to the recovery of valuable materials (e.g. cobalt and nickel sulphates) and other metal fractions (e.g. aluminium and steel) are particularly relevant to impact categories such as marine eutrophication, human toxicity and abiotic resource depletion. The main innovations of this article are that (1) it presents the first bill of materials of a lithium-ion battery cell for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a composite cathode active material; (2) it describes one of the first applications of the life cycle assessment to a lithium-ion battery pack for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a composite cathode active material with the aim of identifying the hot spots of this technology and providing useful information to battery manufacturers on potentially improving its environmental sustainability; (3) it evaluates the impacts associated with the use phase based on primary data about the battery pack's lifetime, in terms of kilometres driven; and (4) it models the end-of-life phase of the battery components through processes specifically created for or adapted to the case study.

The method uses a 3D time-dependent computational ash dispersion model, a set of wind fields, and more than 100 thickness measurements of the CI tephra deposit. Results reveal that the CI eruption dispersed 250-300 km(3) of ash over similar to 3.7 million km(2). The injection of such a large quantity of ash (and volatiles) into the atmosphere would have caused a volcanic winter during the Heinrich Event 4, the coldest and driest climatic episode of the Last Glacial period. Fluorine-bearing leachate from the volcanic ash and acid rain would have further affected food sources and severely impacted Late Middle-Early Upper Paleolithic groups in Southern and Eastern Europe.

The Silvretta Massif harbors more than 230 archaeological sites above 2000 m a.s.l. on a total area of 550 km(2), from the Mesolithic period to Modern Times, but received little attention in these matters up to recently. The Fimba Valley within the Silvretta area - with 47 known archaeological sites (6 prehistoric, 21 from the Medieval and/or Modern Times, 20 undated) located over an area of 62 km(2) - provides evidence of a broad range of former human presence, as well as peat records allowing the reconstruction of Holocene climatic change and anthropogenic impact on past vegetation. Here, we present a high resolution, multiproxy study (including pollen, cryptogam spores, and non-pollen palynomorphs) on a 177-cm-long radiocarbon dated peat core from the Las Gondas Bog in the Fimba Valley (2363 m a.s.l.). Palynological evidence adds and confirms previous dendrochronological results, revealing extensive high Pinus cembra (Arolla pine) stands around the bog at 10,400 cal BP and between ca. 8600-6700 cal. BP, more than 300 altitudinal meters above today's timberline, and belonging therefore to the highest population known for Central Europe. In addition, our palaeoecological results correlate well with the archaeologically known human impact during the Neolithic, Iron Age and Medieval periods. The exploitation of alpine landscape resources (cultivation of cereals in the valleys) and livestock grazing (in the subalpine and alpine areas) has therefore a long tradition going back at least for 6200 years in the Silvretta region.

Its suitability is assessed using the annually resolved lacustrine sediments of Lake Suigetsu (Japan) for which there is high-resolution ITRAX mu XRF core scanning data, and a detailed crypto-tephrostratigraphy (formerly established via density separation techniques). The studied core sections contain 10 visible and 30 cryptotephra markers that span a range of glass concentrations (from 1000 to >20 000 shards per gram of dried sediment) and compositions (basalts, trachy-andesites, phonolites, trachytes and rhyolites), thus providing an ideal case study. The ITRAX core scanner produced recognisable mu XRF elemental responses for the visible ash layers, including those just 1 mm thick. However, just 10% of the cryptotephra layers could be unequivocally identified. Although this study demonstrates that mu XRF core scanning should not be used as an independent method within a similar geological setting, we show it can provide a powerful tool alongside traditional techniques. Where detected, mu XRF profiles can verify and refine cryptotephra positions (here to a sub-millimetre resolution), and help establish reworking signatures. These insights create possibilities for ultra-precise synchronisation of records, improved chronological modelling and help generate more complete eruption histories.

The relationship between these iron oxyhydroxide polymorphs and their photocatalytic properties was explored by examining the extent of methylene blue (MB) degradation by each polymorph under visible-light irradiation. Feroxyhyte exhibited the best photocatalytic properties and degraded 85% of the MB dye in five hours. In comparison, goethite, akaganeite, and lepidocrocite degraded only 40%, 35%, and 30% of the MB in five hours, respectively. To understand this trend, the surface area, particle size and shape, and electronic band properties were systematically studied and discussed. It was found that the rate of MB degradation relates mainly to the surface area of the FeOOH polymorphs more than any other factor.

Despite the global awareness of atoll island vulnerability, little is known about the physical processes that control wave induced flooding on reef environments. To resolve the primary controls on wave-driven flooding at present and future sea levels, we present a globally applicable method for calculating wave overtopping thresholds on reef coastlines. A unique dataset of 60,000 fully nonlinear wave transformation simulations representing a wide range of wave energy, morphology and sea levels conditions was analysed to develop a tool for exploring the future trajectory of atoll island vulnerability to sea-level rise. The proposed reef-island overtopping threshold (RIOT) provides a widely applicable first-order assessment of reef-coast vulnerability to wave hazards with sea-level. Future overtopping thresholds identified for different atoll islands reveal marked spatial variability and highlight distinct morphological characteristics that enhance coastal resilience.","[Beetham, E.; Kench, P.

Data on the interaction dynamics among fish species, the biological characteristics of the stocks, the biomass of the main predators, and the hydroclimatic environmental factors (Baltic Sea Index and sea surface temperature) were used in the analysis. The combination of random forest (Boruta algorithm) and sliding window approaches was tested on the simulated data and then used for the selection of relevant predictors and the optimal time window for real environmental variables. Sea surface temperature had a significant positive effect on the recruitment processes. Moreover, contrasting effects were observed in the mean Baltic Sea Index from two different time windows. The same environmental variable generated contrasting short-term and long-term effects on fish recruitment. This paper highlights the potential benefits of random forest and data mining applications for the incorporation of environmental factors in the assessment of stocks. The proposed analytical approach may be valuable for the investigations of complex environmental impacts in a broad range of ecological studies.","[Smolinski, Szymon] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland",National Marine Fisheries Research Institute,"Smolinski, S (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.",ssmolinski@mir.gdynia.pl,"Smoliński, Szymon/AAZ-1088-2020","Smoliński, Szymon/0000-0003-2715-984X","BONUS - EU [185]; BONUS - Academy of Finland [185]; BONUS - Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany [185]; BONUS - State Education Development Agency of Latvia [185]; BONUS - National Centre for Research and Development, Poland [185]; BONUS - Swedish Research Council Formas [185]","BONUS - EU; BONUS - Academy of Finland; BONUS - Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; BONUS - State Education Development Agency of Latvia; BONUS - National Centre for Research and Development, Poland; BONUS - Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This work resulted from the BONUS BLUEWEBS project, which has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU, the Academy of Finland, Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany, the State Education Development Agency of Latvia, the National Centre for Research and Development, Poland, and the Swedish Research Council Formas.

Here we present the first validation of a section of a spatially explicit CH4 emission inventory of Switzerland. The validation was done for the agriculturally dominated Reuss Valley using measurements from a low-flying aircraft (50-500 m above ground level). We distributed national emission estimates to a grid with 500 m cell size using available geostatistical data. Validation flux measurements were obtained using the eddy covariance (EC) technique and the boundary layer budgeting (BLB) approach that only uses the mean concentrations of the same aircraft transects. Inventory estimates for the flux footprint of the aircraft measurements were lowest (median 0.40 g CH(4)m(-2)s(-1)), and BLB fluxes were highest (1.02 g CH(4)m(-2)s(-1)) for the Reuss Valley, with EC fluxes in between (0.62 g CH(4)m(-2)s(-1)). Flux estimates from measurements and inventory are within the same order of magnitude, but measured fluxes were significantly larger than the inventory emission estimates. The differences are larger than the uncertainties associated with storage of manure, temperature dependence of emissions, diurnal cycle of enteric fermentation by cattle, and the limitations of the inventory that only covers 90% of all expected methane emissions. From this we deduce that it is not unlikely that the Swiss CH4 emission inventory estimates are too low.","[Hiller, Rebecca V.; Buchmann, Nina; Eugster, Werner] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hiller, Rebecca V.; Brunner, Dominik] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Hiller, Rebecca V.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Climate Serv, Zurich, Switzerland; [Neininger, Bruno] Airfield LSZN, MetAir AG, Airborne Observat, Hausen Am Albis, Switzerland; [Gerbig, Christoph] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Bretscher, Daniel] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kuenzle, Thomas] Meteotest, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Max Planck Society; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Eugster, W (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",eugsterw@ethz.ch,"Brunner, Dominik/GSI-5449-2022; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Brunner, Dominik/P-9520-2019; Gerbig, Christoph/L-3532-2013; Brunner, Dominik/A-1255-2009; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010","Brunner, Dominik/0000-0002-4007-6902; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Gerbig, Christoph/0000-0002-1112-8603; Brunner, Dominik/0000-0002-4007-6902; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741",Maiolica project of the Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES) of ETH,Maiolica project of the Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES) of ETH,"We thank the MetAir crew (Moritz Isler, Lorenz Muller, Dave Oldani, Boris Schneider, and Yvonne Schwarz) for their great effort during the measurement campaigns; Silas Hobi and Elke Hodson for their contribution to the spatially explicit CH<INF>4</INF> inventory of Switzerland; Hans-Rudolf Wettstein and his team for their support at the ETH Research Station Chamau; and Susanne Burri for her invaluable comments on the manuscript.

The emission perturbations at the global level, as well as over the HTAP2-defined regions of Europe, North America and East Asia, are first simulated by the global Composition Integrated Forecasting System (C-IFS) model from European Centre for Medium-Range-Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which provides boundary conditions to the various regional CTMs participating in AQMEII3. On top of the perturbed boundary conditions, the regional CTMs used the same set of perturbed emissions within the regional domain for the different perturbation scenarios that introduce a 20% reduction of anthropogenic emissions globally as well as over the HTAP2-defined regions of Europe, North America and East Asia. Results show that the largest impacts over both domains are simulated in response to the global emission perturbation, mainly due to the impact of domestic emission reductions. The responses of NO2, SO2 and PM concentrations to a 20% anthropogenic emission reduction are almost linear (similar to 20% decrease) within the global perturbation scenario with, however, large differences in the geographical distribution of the effect. NO2, CO and SO2 levels are strongly affected over the emission hot spots. O-3 levels generally decrease in all scenarios by up to similar to 1% over Europe, with increases over the hot spot regions, in particular in the Benelux region, by an increase up to similar to 6% due to the reduced effect of NOx titration. O-3 daily maximum of 8 h running average decreases in all scenarios over Europe, by up to similar to 1 %. Over the North American domain, the central-to-eastern part and the western coast of the US experience the largest response to emission perturbations. Similar but slightly smaller responses are found when domestic emissions are reduced. The impact of intercontinental transport is relatively small over both domains, however, still noticeable particularly close to the boundaries. The impact is noticeable up to a few percent, for the western parts of the North American domain in response to the emission reductions over East Asia. O-3 daily maximum of 8 h running average decreases in all scenarios over north Europe by up to similar to 5 %. Much larger reductions are calculated over North America compared to Europe. In addition, values of the Response to Extra-Regional Emission Reductions (RERER) metric have been calculated in order to quantify the differences in the strengths of non-local source contributions to different species among the different models. We found large RERER values for O-3 (similar to 0.8) over both Europe and North America, indicating a large contribution from non-local sources, while for other pollutants including particles, low RERER values reflect a predominant control by local sources. A distinct seasonal variation in the local vs. non-local contributions has been found for both O-3 and PM2:5, particularly reflecting the springtime long-range transport to both continents.","[Im, Ulas;

External wall insulation is an appropriate way of insulating homes, yet take-up is low. Householders may be unaware of the heat loss from uninsulated walls. In earlier research, seeing thermal images prompted the uptake of simple energy efficiency actions amongst householders. Thermal images were added to a standard letter to visualise heat transfer from a home before and after external wall insulation had been installed. A randomised controlled trial tested three types of letter (standard, standard plus thermal image showing problem, standard plus thermal images showing problem and solution) in 5483 UK households. The target outcome was the rate of telephone enquiries after exposure to the letters. Enquiry rates were low (1.6%) and did not differ between letter type. We discuss the null effect in relation to the target action (external wall insulation), the manner of presentation of the visuals (mass communication, letter through the door) and the ingredients of a persuasive intervention. Findings suggest that taking a key ingredient from an intervention and applying it in a different context may result in the loss of its impact.","[Goodhew, Julie; Pahl, Sabine; Boomsma, Christine] Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Pahl, Sabine] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [King, Katy] Behav Insights Team, London SW1H 9NP, England; [Sanders, Michael] Kings Coll London, London WC2B 6LE, England; [Elliott, Paul] Plymouth City Council, Low Carbon Team, Plymouth PL1 3BJ, Devon, England; [Fox, Matthew; Goodhew, Steve] Univ Plymouth, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth; University of Vienna; University of London; King's College London; University of Plymouth,"Goodhew, J; Pahl, S (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.;Pahl, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",julie.goodhew@plymouth.ac.uk; sabine.pahl@univie.ac.at; katy.king@bi.team; Michael.t.sanders@kcl.ac.uk; paul.elliott@plymouth.gov.uk; matthew.fox4@plymouth.ac.uk; christine.boomsma@rivm.nl; s.goodhew@plymouth.ac.uk,"Pahl, Sabine/AAT-1829-2021","Fox, Matthew/0000-0002-5578-8064; Goodhew, Steve/0000-0003-1227-217X; Pahl, Sabine/0000-0002-3799-6716",UK's ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL UNDER THE TRANSFORMING ENERGY DEMAND IN BUILDINGS THROUGH DIGITAL INNOVATION (TEDDI) [EP/K002465/1]; UK Research and Innovation through the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions [EP/R 035288/1]; DECC; Behavioural Insights Team,UK's ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL UNDER THE TRANSFORMING ENERGY DEMAND IN BUILDINGS THROUGH DIGITAL INNOVATION (TEDDI); UK Research and Innovation through the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions; DECC; Behavioural Insights Team,"This paper was produced as part of the eViz project (2012-2016; eviz.org.uk), funded by the UK's ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL UNDER THE TRANSFORMING ENERGY DEMAND IN BUILDINGS THROUGH DIGITAL INNOVATION (TEDDI) [grant number EP/K002465/1] led by S.P. and Pieter deWilde.

Twenty-six randomly selected environmental soil samples were analysed for natural radionuclide concentrations (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) using NaI(Tl) scintillator detector. The average concentration of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 was observed as 37, 59 and 430 Bq kg(-1), respectively, which exceeded the worldwide average of 33, 45 and 412 Bq kg(-1) reported by UNSCEAR (Sources and effects of ionizing radiation. Report to the general assembly with scientific annexes, New York, 2008). Radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), hazard indices (H-ex, H-in) and radioactivity level indices (Irr I-alpha,I- AUI) and Clark value were checked against their threshold limits, and their mean values were safely below the recommended criteria. This confirms the soil applicability for construction purposes. Indoor and outdoor dose rates (D), age-dependent annual effective doses (AED), organ-specific doses and lifetime attributable cancer risk (both cancer incidence and cancer mortality) were also computed. Strong positive correlation was established between radon/thoron exhalation rate and their parent radionuclides. Multivariate statistical technique was employed to explore spatial distribution of radionuclides and homogeneity between various radiological parameters.","[Kaur, Sarabjot; Mehra, Rohit] Dr BR Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Environm Monitoring & Assessment Lab, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar,"Mehra, R (corresponding author), Dr BR Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Environm Monitoring & Assessment Lab, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India.",mehrar@nitj.ac.in,"Mehra, Rohit/E-1661-2015","Mehra, Rohit/0000-0001-8925-5912","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India under INSPIRE fellowship [IF160030]","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India under INSPIRE fellowship","The authors are highly indebted for the financial support by Department of Science and Technology, Government of India under INSPIRE fellowship (IF160030).

Tree-ring records may be able to extend the relatively short observational record, but the extent to which these proxy reconstructions correspond to AO variability has yet to be explored in this region. Therefore, we present new tree-ring cellulose oxygen isotope (delta O-18) records from northeastern Japan (Akita, northern limit of EASM), spanning a.d. 1950 to 2003 which overlaps with the instrumental record. Tree-ring delta O-18 is used for reconstructing the past hydroclimate variability and allows us to consider whether tree-ring delta O-18 has the potential to clarify the longer-term interdecadal changes in the spring AO-EASM relationship. Measurements and analyses show that our tree-ring delta O-18 data sets have a significant negative correlation with May-June-July relative humidity, and the tree-ring delta O-18 in northeastern Japan also significantly correlates with the summer EASM index. Temporal comparisons between our record and observed monthly AO index indicate that reconstructed following early summer relative humidity significantly correlates to the previous March-April-May AO. This linkage changes on interdecadal timescales, and the linkage is relatively strong during early 1970s through early 1990s. Similar results are also obtained using a separate tree-ring delta O-18 record from a separate location about 200 km to the southeast, suggesting that tree-ring cellulose delta O-18 in northeastern Japan is indeed useful for better understanding the long-term teleconnection between the spring AO and EASM.","[Sakashita, Wataru; Miyahara, Hiroko] Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, Tokyo, Japan; [Sakashita, Wataru] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Ibaraki, Japan; [Sakashita, Wataru; Yokoyama, Yusuke; Aze, Takahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Biogeochem, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; [Obrochta, Stephen P.] Akita Univ, Grad Sch Int Resource Sci, Akita, Japan; [Ohyama, Motonari] Tohoku Univ, Bot Gardens, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Yonenobu, Hitoshi] Naruto Univ Educ, Coll Educ, Takashima, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Akita University; Tohoku University; Naruto University of Education,"Sakashita, W (corresponding author), Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, Tokyo, Japan.;Sakashita, W (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Ibaraki, Japan.;Sakashita, W; Yokoyama, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan.;Yokoyama, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan.;Yokoyama, Y (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Biogeochem, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.",wataru.sakashita@gmail.com; yokoyama@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Miyahara, Hiroko/GPX-4725-2022; Yonenobu, Hitoshi/AAB-1500-2021; Sakashita, Wataru/B-2542-2017","Yonenobu, Hitoshi/0000-0002-1596-7543; Yokoyama, Yusuke/0000-0001-7869-5891; Sakashita, Wataru/0000-0003-4731-224X; Obrochta, Stephen/0000-0001-9632-0372","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI program [JP15H05816, JP25287051, JP25247082, JP26247085, JP15KK0151, JP16K05571, JP26101002, JP16H03098, JP17H04492]; program for JSPS Research Fellows DC1 [JP12J10623]",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI program; program for JSPS Research Fellows DC1,"The authors are deeply grateful to Y.

Lower extremities muscles include: erector spinae, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius were concurrently measured for more than five hours of standing. Twenty male production workers in a metal stamping company participated as subjects in this study. The subjects were required to undergo questionnaire surveys and sEMG measurement. Results: Results of the questionnaire surveys found that all subjects experienced psychological fatigue due to prolonged standing jobs. Similarly, muscle fatigue has been identified through sEMG measurement. Based on the non-parametric statistical test using the Spearman's rank order correlation, the left erector spinae obtained a moderate positive correlation and statistically significant (r(s) = 0.552, p < 0.05) between the results of questionnaire surveys and sEMG measurement.

Inadequate water and sanitation services, compounded by exposure to flooding and climate change risks, expose inhabitants to environmental contamination causing poor health and wellbeing and degrading ecosystems. However, the exact nature and full scope of risks and exposure pathways between human health and the environment in informal settlements are uncertain. Existing models are limited to microbiological linkages related to faecal-oral exposures at the individual level, and do not account for a broader range of human-environmental variables and interactions that affect population health and wellbeing. Methods: We undertook a 12-month health and environmental assessment in 12 flood-prone informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia. We obtained caregiver-reported health data, anthropometric measurements, stool and blood samples from children < 5 years, and health and wellbeing data for children 5-14 years and adult respondents. We collected environmental data including temperature, mosquito and rat species abundance, and water and sediment samples. Demographic, built environment and household asset data were also collected. We combined our data with existing literature to generate a novel planetary health model of health and environment in informal settlements. Results: Across the 12 settlements, 593 households and 2764 participants were enrolled. Two-thirds (64.1%) of all houses (26.3-82.7% per settlement) had formal land tenure documentation. Cough, fever and diarrhoea in the week prior to the survey were reported among an average of 34.3%, 26.9% and 9.7% of children aged < 5 years, respectively; although proportions varied over time, prevalence among these youngest children was consistently higher than among children 5-14 years or adult respondents. Among children < 5 years, 44.3% experienced stunting, 41.1% underweight, 12.4% wasting, and 26.5% were anaemic. There was self-or carer-reported poor mental health among 16.6% of children aged 5-14 years and 13.9% of adult respondents. Rates of potential risky exposures from swimming in waterways, eating uncooked produce, and eating soil or dirt were high, as were exposures to flooding and livestock. Just over one third of households (35.3%) had access to municipal water, and contamination of well water with E. coli and nitrogen species was common. Most (79.5%) houses had an in-house toilet, but no houses were connected to a piped sewer network or safe, properly constructed septic tank. Median monthly settlement outdoor temperatures ranged from 26.2 degrees C to 29.3 degrees C, and were on average, 1.1 degrees C warmer inside houses than outside. Mosquito density varied over time, with Culex quinquefasciatus accounting for 94.7% of species. Framed by a planetary health lens, our model includes four thematic domains: (1) the physical/built environment; (2) the ecological environment; (3) human health; and (4) socio-economic wellbeing, and is structured at individual, household, settlement, and city/beyond spatial scales. Conclusions: Our planetary health model includes key risk factors and faecal-oral exposure pathways but extends beyond conventional microbiological faecal-oral enteropathogen exposure pathways to comprehensively account for a wider range of variables affecting health in urban informal settlements. It includes broader ecological interconnections and planetary health-related variables at the household, settlement and city levels.

In this comparative study, metabolic profiles of two New Zealand finfish, snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) and yellow-eyed mullet-YEM (Aldrichetta forsteri) that as juveniles share the same temperate coastal environments, were examined. Metabolic parameters (routine and maximum metabolic rates, and specific dynamic action-SDA) were investigated at a set of temperatures (13, 17, 21 degrees C) within the range juveniles both species experience annually. SDA was also determined for a range of different feed rations to investigate the effects of meal size on postprandial metabolic response. Temperature was a strong modulator of snapper and YEM metabolic profile (routine and maximum metabolic rates, and absolute and factorial aerobic scope). Metabolic rates increased with temperature in both species as did absolute scope in YEM, though for snapper, it was only greater at the highest temperature. Factorial scope behaved in the same fashion for the two species, being greatest at 13 degrees C. Both absolute and factorial scope were similar to twofold greater in YEM than in snapper across the entire temperature range. Temperature also affected SDA response in snapper, while in YEM, SDA parameters were largely unaffected when temperature increased from 17 to 21 degrees C. Snapper were able to consume a large range of meal sizes (0.5-3.0% body mass-BM) with meal sizes > 1% BM having a pronounced effect on numerous SDA parameters, whereas mullet appeared to consume more limited ration sizes (<= 1.0% BM). In both species, rations <= 1% BM produced similar changes in SDA parameters identifying comparable digestive bio-energetics. Overall, our metabolic characterisations demonstrate that both species can adjust to the variable temperate environmental temperatures and manage the energetic costs of digestion and feed assimilation. Yet, despite these general similarities, YEM's greater aerobic scope may point to better physiological adaptation to the highly variable temperate coastal environment than were observed in snapper.","[Flikac, Tomislav; Davison, William] Univ Canterbury, Biol Sci, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand; [Cook, Denham G.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Seafood Prod Grp, 293-297 Akersten St, Port Nelson 7043, New Zealand",University of Canterbury; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd,"Flikac, T (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Biol Sci, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand.;Cook, DG (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Seafood Prod Grp, 293-297 Akersten St, Port Nelson 7043, New Zealand.",tflikac@gmail.com; denham.cook@plantandfood.co.nz,"; Cook, Denham/J-2520-2018","Flikac, Tomislav/0000-0002-5455-3378; Cook, Denham/0000-0003-2532-4119",New Zealand Crown Research Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (PFR) special grant Wildfish 2030 [C11X1203],New Zealand Crown Research Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (PFR) special grant Wildfish 2030,"This work was supported by the New Zealand Crown Research Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (PFR) special grant Wildfish 2030 (Contract # C11X1203).

Changes in vegetation cover represent, to some extent, vegetation growth trends and are the consequence of a complex of different natural factors and human activities. Microtopography influences vegetation growth by affecting the amount of heat and moisture reaching the ground, a role that is more pronounced in subalpine areas. However, little research is concerned with the characteristics and dynamics of vegetation restoration in different microtopography types. The respective importance of the factors driving vegetation changes in subalpine areas is also not clear yet. We used linear regression and the Hurst exponent to analyze the trends in vegetation restoration and sustainability in different microtopography types since 2000, based on Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and identified potential driving factors of vegetation change and their importance by using Geographical Detector. The results show that: (1) The FVC in the region under study has shown an up-trend since 2000, and the rate of increase is 0.26/year (P = 0.028). It would be going from improvement to degradation, continuous decrease or continuous significant decrease in 47.48% of the region, in the future. (2) The mean FVC is in the following order: lower slope (cool), lower slope, lower slope (warm), valley, upper slope (warm), upper slope, valley (narrow), upper slope (cool), cliff, mountain/divide, peak/ridge (warm), peak/ridge, peak/ridge (cool). The lower slope is the microtopographic type with the best vegetation cover, and ridge peak is the most difficult to be afforested. (3) The main factors affecting vegetation restoration in subalpine areas are aspect, microtopographic type, and soil taxonomy great groups. The interaction between multiple factors has a much stronger effect on vegetation cover than single factors, with the effect of temperatures and aspects having the most significant impact on the vegetation cover changes. Natural factors have a greater impact on vegetation restoration than human factors in the study area. The results of this research can contribute a better understanding of the influence of different drivers on the change of vegetation cover, and provide appropriate references and recommendations for vegetation restoration and sustainable development in typical logging areas in subalpine areas.","[Feng, Yu; Bai, Maoyang; Peng, Peiha] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Juan; Peng, Peiha; Guan, Zengyan] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Qin] Chengdu OCI Med Devices Co Ltd, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Dan] Sichuan Tourism Univ, Sch Tourism & Culture Ind, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xian'an] Sichuan Tourism Univ, Coll Art, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Technology; Chengdu University of Technology; Sichuan Tourism University; Sichuan Tourism University,"Wang, J (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",id.wangjuan@foxmail.com,,,Biodiversity Survey and Assessment of the Shaluli Mountain System [80303-AZS023]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0505001],Biodiversity Survey and Assessment of the Shaluli Mountain System; National Key R&D Program of China,"This research was funded by the Biodiversity Survey and Assessment of the Shaluli Mountain System (No. 80303-AZS023) and the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFC0505001).

The aim of the research is to investigate the correlations between manifestation of the teaching style applied by coaches and motivation of their athletes for sport. The research raises a hypothesis that the teaching styles applied by coaches may be related to the motivation for sport in the athletes being trained. The research is based on the provisions of reproductive and productive teaching methods as well as the self-determination theory. The research involved 14-18-year-old swimmers and their coaches. Two questionnaires have been employed: description of the teaching style (Curtner-Smith et al., 2001; Hein et al., 2012) and sport motivation scale (SMS-II; Pelletier et al., 2013). Referring to the responses in relation to manifestation of the teaching style, the coaches have been divided into three groups. The one factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to test the research hypothesis. The research hypothesis was proven only partly. It was found that application of different teaching styles may have had effect on young athletes' external motivation only. It can be substantiated that the teaching style employed by swimming coaches and related both reproductive and reproductive teaching methods have no significant effect on young athletes' intrinsic motivation for sport in the coaching practise.","[Razmaite, Danguole; Grajauskas, Lauras] Vilnius Univ Siauliai Acad, Vilnius, Lithuania",,"Razmaite, D (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ Siauliai Acad, Vilnius, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,10,10,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2021,,,,,439,447,,10.17770/sie2021vol4.6414,http://dx.doi.org/10.17770/sie2021vol4.6414,,,9,"Art; Education & Educational Research; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),"Art; Education & Educational Research; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",BT4PF,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000833412300036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Multiple studies conclude that green spaces and waterbodies can reduce urban heat islands. However, previous studies often treat urban green spaces (UGSs) as static or limit the number of green spaces investigated within a city. Cognizant of these shortcomings, Landsat derived vegetation and land surface temperature (LST) metrics for 80 urban green spaces in Puebla, Mexico, over a 34-year (1986-2019) and a 20-year (2000-2019) period were studied. To create a photo library, 73 of these green spaces were visited and the available land cover types were recorded. Green spaces with Indian laurel were found to be much greener and vegetation index values remained relatively stable compared to green spaces with mixed vegetation cover. Similarly, green spaces with large waterbodies were cooler than those without water. These results show that larger green spaces were significantly cooler (p < 0.01) and that size can explain almost 30% of temperature variability. Furthermore, green spaces with higher vegetation index values were significantly cooler (p < 0.01), and the relationship between greenness and temperature strengthened over time.","[Gomez-Martinez, Filoteo; de Beurs, Kirsten M.; Koch, Jennifer; Widener, Jeffrey] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Koch, Jennifer] Univ Oklahoma, Data Inst Societal Challenges, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"de Beurs, KM (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",filogm@ou.edu; kdebeurs@ou.edu; jakoch@ou.edu; jwidener@ou.edu,"de Beurs, Kirsten/GQH-8453-2022","de Beurs, Kirsten/0000-0002-9244-3292; Koch, Jennifer/0000-0002-7067-2705",,,,,89,9,9,13,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,FEB,2021,2,,,,,,155,10.3390/land10020155,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10020155,,,25,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QN8MF,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000622705600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This site is characterized by rich fossil plant records of high taxonomic diversity, good preservation, and varied taphonomic mode. Palaeofloral analysis shows that the Ca' Viettone assemblage reflects a chronologically delimited and distinguishable stage of vegetation development in northern Italy (called Ca' Viettone Florenkomplex). Palaeomagnetic analyses show a dominant normal polarity that, however, seems to be the result of a remagnetization process due to secondary oxidation. Layers with no evidence of oxidation have registered a reverse polarity, which likely represents the original magnetization of the sediments. These results, in combination with biochronological indications, suggest that deposition of the succession preceded the Gilbert-Gauss reversal and took place during the final part of the Gilbert chron. This confirms a late Zanclean age for the rich Ca' Viettone palaeoflora and allows us to propose this locality both as reference for a regional Florenkomplex and as a representative example of terrestrial vegetation in Europe during the early Pliocene warm interval.","[Martinetto, Edoardo; Tema, Evdokia; Violanti, Donata; Ciuto, Marco; Zanella, Elena] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Irace, Andrea] CNR, Ist Geosci & Georisorse, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR),"Martinetto, E (corresponding author), Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",edoardo.martinetto@unito.it,,"Zanella, Elena/0000-0002-9508-7211; TEMA, Evdokia/0000-0002-4362-2630; Irace, Andrea/0000-0003-1400-8380",Fondi di Ateneo dell'Universita di Torino [MARE_RILO_1601],Fondi di Ateneo dell'Universita di Torino,"We thank Thomas Denk and Lutz Kunzmann for useful discussions and information on the biochronology of terrestrial plant assemblages.

Particles were collected on highly temporally and spatially resolved samples and investigated using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM). From morphology and elemental composition, particles were categorized in terms of seven groups: aggregated soot particles, mineral dust, sulphates (SO42-), sea-salt, tar balls/fly ash, rod-shaped particles associated With soot agglomerates, and those that could not be attributed to any of these groups. Refractive indices of aerosols were derived from chemical distributions obtained from SEM analysis and combined with in situ measurements of number-size distributions to determine optical properties of dry particles in the size range 0.1-3.5 mu m. Particles exhibited marked spatial and temporal variability in chemical composition. They were externally mixed with highly absorbing soot particles. From number concentrations, light extinction and absorption coefficient ranges were sigma(ep) = 19-755 Mm(-1) and sigma(ap) = 7-103 Mm(-1), respectively (at wavelength lambda = 550 nm). Single scattering albedo, omega(0), varied from 0.61 to 0.87 with a mean value of 0.72 +/- 0.08; this value was much lower than generally reported in the literature, a result that was attributed to high concentrations of highly absorbing soot (fractional number concentrations of up to 46% were observed in the SEM). The haze could be attributed to extinction of light by fine aerosols composed mainly of anthropogenic particles. High extinction coefficients and low single scattering albedo computed here demonstrate quantitatively the contributions of particulate matter to visibility reduction and the brown haze phenomenon in Cape Town.","Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Biogeochem, Mainz, Germany; Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa; Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Particle Chem, Mainz, Germany; Univ Witwatersrand, Climatol Res Grp, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",Max Planck Society; University of Johannesburg; Max Planck Society; University of Witwatersrand,"Gwaze, P (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Biogeochem, Mainz, Germany.",pgwaze2@yahoo.com,"Piketh, Stuart/AAS-8987-2021; Annegarn, Harold J/A-9127-2008; ANNEGARN, HAROLD/X-8746-2019","Annegarn, Harold J/0000-0001-6653-4679; Piketh, Stuart/0000-0002-2804-879X",,,,,46,6,6,0,11,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

It has been suggested that this may affect the surface temperatures at high latitudes by modulating tropospheric circulation. Motivated by such results, we compare here the wintertime energetic electron precipitation (EEP) with North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and surface air temperature (SAT) in the Northern Hemisphere. We use the recently recalibrated energetic electron data from the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector instrument of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Polar Orbiting Environment Satellites in two energy ranges (30-100keV and 100-300keV), the NAO index from NOAA, and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies surface temperature analysis for years 1980-2010. We find a statistically significant correlation between EEP and the NAO index and also between EEP and SAT in certain geographic regions. The strongest negative correlation is found in Northeast Canada/Greenland, while the strongest positive correlation is found in North Siberia/Barents Sea, in agreement with similar studies using global geomagnetic activity as a proxy for particle precipitation. We find higher correlation when the two winters (1984/1985 and 2003/2004) of unprecedentedly strong sudden stratospheric warmings are excluded. We also find that the different phases of quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO; observed at 30hPa) lead to dramatically different correlation patterns, with easterly QBO producing considerably stronger and spatially wider correlation and larger temperature response than westerly QBO.","[Maliniemi, V.; Asikainen, T.; Mursula, K.] Univ Oulu, Ctr Excellence Res, Dept Phys, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Seppala, A.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland",University of Oulu; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Maliniemi, V (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Ctr Excellence Res, Dept Phys, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",ville.maliniemi@oulu.fi,"Mursula, Kalevi/L-8952-2014; Seppälä, Annika/C-8031-2014","Mursula, Kalevi/0000-0003-4892-5056; Seppälä, Annika/0000-0002-5028-8220; Maliniemi, Ville/0000-0002-7556-7488","Academy of Finland [134547, 128189, 257403, 264994]; Thule Institute of the University of Oulu; ESPAS project by the European Commission; COST Action [ES1005]",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Thule Institute of the University of Oulu; ESPAS project by the European Commission; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"We thank NOAA NGDC for the MEPED data, NOAA CPC for the NAO and QBO data, and NASA GISS for the temperature data.

This is particularly relevant as mitigation is viewed increasingly as a vital action for which investments and the resulting benefits must be evaluated and justified. It is fundamental to determine which measures are the most effective in optimising the response to floods in local communities. The study analyses the current state of knowledge on flood mitigation and reviews what methodologies have been applied in order to assess mitigation effectiveness and positive cost-benefit ratio (CBR). The growing body of literature has shown that losses from natural hazards can be significantly reduced when one or more mitigation techniques are put into practice. Moreover, an effective response to floods requires the contribution of flood-prone households and their local community, known as the bottom-up approach, in order to apply risk management strategies to increase community resilience. The results demonstrate that effectiveness increases when integrated approaches are implemented. In particular, the combination of top-down and bottom-up solutions can provide the best results in terms of socio-economic assessments. The study found that the commitment of both public and private stakeholders was of vital importance in achieving good flood mitigation levels, thus, mitigation must be seen as a joint effort between these actors. The paper also provides key findings from literature and recommendations for further research.","[Genovese, Elisabetta] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Econ & Business Studies DISEI, Novara, Italy; [Thaler, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria","University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Genovese, E (corresponding author), Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Econ & Business Studies DISEI, Novara, Italy.",elisabetta.genovese@uniupo.it,"Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014","Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722; Genovese, Elisabetta/0000-0002-1691-4371",,,,,72,6,6,1,11,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2471-2132,,,AIMS GEOSCI,AIMS Geosci.,,2020,4,,,,459,472,,10.3934/geosci.2020025,http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/geosci.2020025,,,14,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,QC4NV,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000614810700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, since seawater desalination is the process consuming a large amount of energy, saving energy to produce freshwater is extremely important in various seawater desalination processes. Energy consumption of desalination process is evaluated by the index called specific energy consumption (SEC), which means the energy for producing 1 kg of freshwater. For this reason, the renewable energies have been applied to the seawater desalination for energy saving. Usually, in such a case, the solar energies are adopted to heat seawater, and to transport seawater and freshwater. In this study, for the further reduction of the SEC, the passive vacuum pipe based on the hydrostatic head was applied. This study was mainly focused on the freshwater production rates with the height of a passive vacuum pipe. From the theoretical calculations, the freshwater production rate was over 7% of the supplied seawater when the height of a vacuum pipe is 9.8 m and the seawater temperature is heated to 80 degrees C. This evaporating percentage is very high compared to other conventional thermal type desalination process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We have conducted calibrations using eight sites to determine and generalize parameters of the TRIPLEX. We also performed model validation using 66 independent data sets to examine the model accuracy and the generality of its application. Simulations were conducted for plots with large sample size from the boreal ecosystem atmosphere study (BOREAS) program, including the northern study area (NSA) near Thompson, Manitoba (55.7degrees N, 97.8degrees W) and the southern study area (SSA) near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan (53.7degrees N, 105.1degrees W). The calibrations and simulations emphasized on generating average parameters and initial statuses for applying a complex model in a broad region where site detailed information such as photosynthetic capacity, soil carbon, nutrient, soil water, and tree growth is not always available. A suggestion was presented regarding adjusting the sensitive parameter by estimating tree growth rate corresponding to different site conditions. The study actually presented a reasonable and balanced parameter generalization procedure that did not lead to a significant reduction of model accuracy, but did increase the model practicability. The comparison of observations and simulations produced a good agreement for tree density, mean tree height, DBH, soil carbon, above-ground and total biomass, net primary productivity (above-ground) and soil nitrogen in both short- and long-term simulation. Results presented here imply that the set of parameters generalized and suggested in this study can be used as basic referenced values, in which TRIPLEX can be applied to simulate the general site conditions of boreal forest ecosystems.

The simulation uses observed SSTs from 1949 to 1998 at the lower boundary. The atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) burden is interannually constant to artificially decouple the radiative influence from the SST forcing. A stronger SST gradient from the tropics through the middle latitudes results in a greater meridional temperature gradient in the subtropical troposphere. The upper tropospheric zonal winds increase consistent with the thermal wind relationship, and vertically propagating waves are refracted more poleward into the stratosphere. As a consequence, the stratospheric residual circulation is strengthened. This is manifest as a net annual mass STE increase of 2.7% per decade in the Northern Hemisphere and 2.0% per decade in the Southern Hemisphere. Likewise, the characteristic residence time of air in the lowermost stratosphere decreases by about a month. The STE trends and upper tropospheric temperature gradients are not significantly different in a second simulation that specifies an increasing GHG burden. The second simulation also shows that the radiative cooling from an increased GHG burden is greater in magnitude than the SST-induced dynamical warming in the polar stratosphere. The results of this study imply that the modeled circulation of the stratosphere can be significantly affected by the SSTs. It follows that the fidelity of simulations of the 21st century atmosphere strongly depends on the SSTs, whether prescribed or interactive.","Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD 20706 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Systems and Applications Inc,"Olsen, MA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, 5523 Res Pk Dr,Suite 320, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA.",olsen@hyperion.gsfc.nasa.gov,"Olsen, Mark/H-2329-2012","Olsen, Mark/0000-0002-6420-987X",,,,,29,36,37,2,23,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The model is evaluated using measurements obtained from upper-air soundings, AERONET sun photometers, various satellite instruments, and pyranometers. The simulated downward shortwave flux was overestimated when the effect of aerosols and clouds, on radiation, was neglected. The simulated downward shortwave radiation was 1 to 20 Wm(-2) closer to the observations when we included aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction in the simulation. The model usually underestimated particulate concentration for the few observations available. This is likely due to turbulent mixing, transport errors and the lack of dust emission/scheme and the secondary organic aerosol treatment in the model. The model efficiently captured the broad regional hotspots such as, higher aerosol optical depth over the northern parts of India, especially over the Indo-Gangetic basin and lower aerosol optical depth over southern parts of India. The regional distribution of aerosol optical depth agreed well with the AVHRR aerosol optical depth and the TOMS aerosol index pattern. The magnitude and wavelength-dependence of simulated aerosol optical depth was also similar to the AERONET observations across India. The difference in surface shortwave radiation between two simulations that included and neglected aerosol-radiation (aerosol-radiation-cloud) interactions were as high as-25 (-30) Wm(-1). The spatial variations of these differences were also compared with the AVHRR observation. This study suggests that the model is able to qualitatively simulate the distribution of particulates and its impact on radiation over India; however, additional measurements of particulate mass and composition are needed to fully evaluate the model performance.","[Fast, Jerome D.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Polade, Suraj D.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Reddy, M.

Emission inventories for 2000 and 2015 are used in a global Chemical Transport Model (CTM) to quantify environmental atmospheric impacts with particular focus on the Arctic region. Although we assume that ship emissions continue to increase from 2000 to 2015, reductions are assumed for some chemical components and regions because of implementation of new regulations. Current ship traffic (2000) is estimated to contribute significantly to coastal pollution. Norwegian coastal ship traffic is responsible for more than 1/3 and 1/6 of the Norwegian NOx and SO2 emissions, respectively. For these short- lived components the impact of Norwegian coastal emissions is regionally important. For most components the international ship transportation outside coastal waters dominates the effects. Ship emissions increase wet deposition in Scandinavia with 30-50% for nitrate and 10-25% for sulfate. In general, coastal regions with prevailing onshore winds show substantial increases in deposition of acid components. Maximum surface increase in ozone is in excess of 10 ppbv. Column ozone increases are also significant. Assuming no changes in nonshipping emissions, scenarios for shipping activities in 2015 lead to more than 20% increase in NO2 from 2000 to 2015 in some coastal areas. Ozone increases are in general small. Wet deposition of acidic species increases up to 10% in areas where current critical loads are exceeded. Regulations limiting the sulfur content in the fuel in the North Sea and English Channel will be an efficient measure to reduce sulfate deposition in nearby coastal regions. The expected oil and gas transport by ships from Norway and northwest Russia, sea transport along the Northern Sea Route and new Norwegian coastal gas power plants will have a significant regional effect by increases of acid deposition in north Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula. Augmented levels of particles in the Arctic are calculated, and thus the contribution from ship traffic to phenomena like Arctic haze could be increasing.","Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway; Det Norske Veritas, Hovik, Norway; Natl Ctr Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Bodo, Norway",University of Oslo; Nord University,"Dalsoren, SB (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway.",stigbd@geo.uio.no; eirik.sorgard@kpb.no,,"Dalsoren, Stig/0000-0002-6752-4728",,,,,76,72,74,3,57,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This waveform propagates toward the equator much more quickly (reaching the equator in 1.5-2.5 years) than the normal transit time (5-10 years) of the meridional overturning cell. The movements of the sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies that occurred before the 1997 and 2009 El Ninos can be clearly traced to the area south of 20 degrees N using the altimeter sea-level signals. Upon arriving near the Pacific equator, these warm water anomalies can contribute to the formation of the El Nino by lowering the depth of the thermocline. The time required for a subducted SST anomaly to drift 3000 km to the equator depends upon its initial location and on the distribution of the SST anomalies near the western coast of North America. The subducted warm SST anomalies observed before the El Ninos of 1982 and 1997 took 12 months to reach the equator. Longer drift times of 24 months were indicated for the 1972, 1986, 1993, 2003, 2006 and 2009 events. The thermocline depressions that drift toward the equator in the eastern Pacific are shown to be a major energy source for the onset of the El Nino in the central and eastern Pacific.

The results show that simulated density, H, DBH, litter pool, aboveground and total biomass are consistent with observed data collected through Zhejiang Province, suggesting that the TRIPLEX1.0 model is capable in simulating forest growth and biomass dynamics of subtropical forest ecosystems. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) between simulated values and yield measurements show a 0.91 variability for density, 0.86 for DBH, 0.83 for H, 0.89 for aboveground biomass and 0.91 for total biomass (except for litter pool that showed a 0.54 variability). The independent validations obtained by utilizing TRIPLEX1.0 demonstrate that the model offers competency while providing confidence when applying its ability to extrapolate outcomes at regional scales and its ability to withstand rigorous testing for simulating carbon storage in subtropical forest ecosystems.

Model predictions of sulfate, black carbon, primary organic carbon, other anthropogenic particulate matter, windblown mineral dusts, and sea salt are compared at two sites in south Asia where yearlong experimental observations are available from the Atmospheric Brown Cloud ( ABC) project. The model predictions are able to capture both the magnitude and seasonality of aerosols over Hanimaadhoo Observatory, Maldives. However, the model is not able to explain the seasonality at the Kathmandu Observatory; but the model does capture Kathmandu's observed annual mean concentration. The absence of seasonal brick kiln emissions within Kathmandu valley in the current inventory is a probable reason for this problem. This model study reveals high-anthropogenic aerosol loading over the Ganges valley even in the monsoonal months, which needs to be corroborated by experimental observations. Modeling results also show a high dust loading over south Asia with a distinct seasonality. Model results of aerosol monthly composition are also presented at five cities in south Asia. Total and fine-mode monthly aerosol optical depth along with contribution from each aerosol species is presented; the results show that the anthropogenic fraction dominates in the postmonsoon and the early dry season with major contributions from sulfate and absorbing aerosols. Model sensitivity studies of dry deposition velocity and wet scavenging efficiency show that model improvements are needed in the treatment of carbonaceous aerosol dry and wet removal processes. Modeled SO2 conversion rate constrained with sulfate observations at Hanimaadhoo suggests the need to increase model sulfate production rate during the dry season to account for probable sulfate production via heterogeneous pathways.","Univ Iowa, Ctr Global & Reg Environm Res, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Environm Chem & Technol Program, Madison, WI USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Iowa; University of Iowa; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Adhikary, B (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Ctr Global & Reg Environm Res, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",adhikary@cgrer.uiowa.edu; gcarmich@engineering.uiowa.edu; ytang@cgrer.uiowa.edu; ruby.leung@pnl.gov; yun.qian@pnl.gov; jjschauer@wisc.edu; eastone@wisc.edu; vramanathan@ucsd.edu; ramana@fiji.ucsd.edu,"qian, yun/A-5056-2010; qian, yun/E-1845-2011; Tang, Youhua/D-5205-2016; Leung, Ruby/F-9276-2018","Tang, Youhua/0000-0001-7089-7915; Leung, Ruby/0000-0002-3221-9467",,,,,49,72,72,1,31,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

As polluted groundwater flows towards the ocean, coastal ecosystems and coral reefs may also be affected. Pollution and the interaction between the coastal aquifer and the reef lagoon were assessed at a developing area (Puerto Morelos, NE Yucatan Peninsula) within the Mesoamerican Coral Reef System. Coastal environments along the land-sea gradient (wells, mangroves, beaches, submarine springs, the reef lagoon, and the open sea) were sampled. Silicate and salinity were used as tracers of groundwater and seawater, respectively. Their patterns evidence water flow and mixing among these coastal environments. High nitrate concentrations (268.6 mu M) and coliform bacteria densities indicate groundwater pollution in most of the wells sampled and also in mangroves, beaches, and submarine springs. Phosphorous content peaks (14.2 mu M) in mangroves, where it is likely released due to reducing conditions in the sediments. Nitrogen flux toward the lagoon reef through groundwater discharge is estimated at 2.4 ton N km(-1) year(-1) and phosphorous at 75 to 217 kg P km(-1) year(-1). These results provide evidence of the need for more detailed groundwater studies and for the integrated management of aquifers and coastal ecosystems in karstic regions.","[Merino-Ibarra, Martin] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Ecol Marina, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Coyoacan 04510, DF, Mexico; [Hernandez-Terrones, Laura; Rebolledo-Vieyra, Mario; Soto, Melina; Le-Cossec, Adrien] Ctr Invest Cient Yucatan, Unidad Quintana Roo, Unidad Ciencias Agua, Cancun 77500, Quintana Roo, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan,"Merino-Ibarra, M (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Ecol Marina, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Circuito Exterior S-N,Cd Univ, Coyoacan 04510, DF, Mexico.",mmerino@cmarl.unam.mx,"Monroy-Ríos, Emiliano/T-9564-2017","Monroy-Ríos, Emiliano/0000-0002-1959-7551; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/0000-0002-6690-3101",Global Environmental Fund,Global Environmental Fund(Smithsonian Institution),"We thank the authorities of the Comision Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas, particularly Daniela Guevara, director of Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Puerto Morelos, for their support.

An important step could include the design of nature-based solutions (NbSs) for introducing important ecological functions aiding human well-being and mitigating the loss of soil. In this study, we propose a methodology to analyse, in a spatial way, the effect of land use scenarios generated by urban planning in the provision of ecosystem services. The methodology analyses the variation of ecosystem services, considering the ecosystem services of the study area and their potential roles in changing the functions of planned urban actions as the starting point. One scenario of analysis includes the integration of NbSs into urban planning. The case study is that of a peri-urban area, characterized by an agroecosystem, which is intended for urban development in the municipality of Gallipoli, Southern Italy. The analysis highlights a low provision of ecosystem services by the agroecosystem, which has had the effect of important olive trees being destroyed by Xylella fastidiosa bacteria. Thus, the integration of NbSs and reducing the construction of buildings in the urban neighbourhood plan could improve the quantity of ecosystem services in the area. Moreover, the ecological design of ecosystem services could improve the typology of ecosystem services provision in the area in consideration of the starting points. Therefore, the analysis of the capacity to integrate ecosystem services in urban planning at the neighbourhood scale could be a tool of ecological urban design, useful to support the decision-making processes.","[Semeraro, Teodoro] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Scarano, Aurelia] CNR, Unit Lecce, Inst Sci Food Prod, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Pandey, Rajiv] Indian Council Forestry Res Educ ICFRE, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India",University of Salento; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Scienze delle Produzioni Alimentari (ISPA-CNR); Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE),"Scarano, A (corresponding author), CNR, Unit Lecce, Inst Sci Food Prod, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.;Pandey, R (corresponding author), Indian Council Forestry Res Educ ICFRE, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India.",teodoro.semeraro@unisalento.it; aurelia.scarano@ispa.cnr.it; pandeyr@icfre.org,"Scarano, Aurelia/J-5479-2019","SEMERARO, Teodoro/0000-0001-9239-9060; Scarano, Aurelia/0000-0002-8169-1514; Pandey, Rajiv/0000-0003-4849-775X",,,,,88,1,1,11,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,MAR,2022,1,,,,,,23,10.3390/urbansci6010023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6010023,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,0A9SM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000774285700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of UHI's research focuses on the large scale and uses remote sensing methods, which do not reflect the dynamic characteristics in detail and do not detect internal influencing factors of the green space cooling effect. Therefore, this study focused on Small Green Spaces (SGS), carrying out the measurement of the meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed, photosynthetic radiation) of the 16 sites in four types of coverage (Impervious surface; Shrub-grass; Tree-grass; Tree-shrub-grass) in a university campus. At the same time, the coverage characteristic parameters, such as Canopy Density (CD), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), Mean Leaf Angle (MLA), of each plot were analyzed and compared. The results showed that there were significant differences in temperature among different coverage types in SGS. The biggest difference was concentrated in the noon period when solar radiation is strongest during the day. The difference between the four types of coverage with vegetation at night was small. The maximum air temperature difference among the four types could reach 8.9 celcius and the maximum relative humidity difference was 28.5%. The cooling effect of the multi-layer vegetation-covered (Tree-shrub-grass) area was the largest compared to the impervious surface, indicating that tree cover was the core factor affecting the temperature. Temperature and relative humidity had a close correlation with surface coverage types and some plant community characteristics (such as CD and LAI). The cooling and humidifying effects of plants were also related to PAR and leaf angle. The results provide suggestions for green space management and landscape design.","[Li, Huawei; Ernest, Amoako-atta; Jombach, Sandor] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Landscape Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Landscape Planning & Reg Dev, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary; [Li, Huawei; He, Ruizhen; Lei, Yakai; Tian, Guohang] Henan Agr Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Meng, Handong] CMA Henan Key Lab Agrometeorol Support & Appl Tec, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Meng, Handong] Henan Prov Climate Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yuchen] Univ Szeged, Dept Climatol & Landscape Ecol, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Henan Agricultural University; Szeged University,"Jombach, S (corresponding author), Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Landscape Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Landscape Planning & Reg Dev, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary.;Tian, GH (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",li.huawei@phd.uni-szie.hu; menghd752@126.com; lykfjyl@163.com; lykfjyl@163.com; guoyuchen@geo.u-szeged.hu; ernestamoakoatta@gmail.com; jombach.sandor@tajk.szie.hu; tgh@henau.edu.cn,"AMOAKO-ATTA, ERNEST/AAE-9859-2022; AMOAKO-ATTA, ERNEST/ABJ-0290-2022","AMOAKO-ATTA, ERNEST/0000-0002-1734-0568; AMOAKO-ATTA, ERNEST/0000-0002-1734-0568","Henan Province Young Talent Support Project [2019HYTP033]; Henan Meteorological Science and Technology Research Project [KM201809, KM201810]; Henan Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation",Henan Province Young Talent Support Project; Henan Meteorological Science and Technology Research Project; Henan Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation,"This research was funded by Henan Province Young Talent Support Project (2019HYTP033), Henan Meteorological Science and Technology Research Project (KM201809, KM201810) and Henan Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation.",,77,5,5,17,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2020,8,,,,,,862,10.3390/atmos11080862,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11080862,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,NL8PI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000567670600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is one of the uncertain parameters of urban hydrology due to various microclimates. This study investigated the microclimate effects and irrigation water requirements of three landscape types in an arid region of Phoenix, AZ. The microclimate effect encompassed surface temperature, air temperature, and wind speed. The simulations of the three landscapes were conducted using ENVI-met software for the hottest day of the year (23 June 2011). The simulated model was validated using ground data. Results show that the mesic landscape induced cooling effects, both in the daytime and nighttime, by reducing surface and air temperatures. However, the mesic landscape showed high-water consumption because of a high leaf area density. The oasis landscape showed 2 degrees C more daytime cooling than the mesic landscape, but the nighttime warming (surface temperature) was comparable to the xeric landscape. The potential irrigation water requirement was 1 mm/day lower than the mesic landscape. Moreover, microclimate conditions varied spatially in each neighborhood. The xeric landscape showed lower wind speeds and air temperatures between the buildings. The wind speed variations in the three landscapes were inconclusive due to differences in building orientations and discrepancies in trees' heights. The findings can have implications for restricting the municipal irrigation budget. In addition, they can help water managers in choosing a landscape in urban areas.

By producing and analyzing the maps of the regions, an integrated approach to geomatics and hydraulic modelling is employed. The following maps are used: Flood-prone urbanity from 1988-2019, a flood risk map of Wadi Nu'man based on a risk matrix map, and a map of the proposed protection measures and alternatives in the study area. In order to achieve these goals, changes in the land use in the Wadi Nu'man basin were monitored by analyzing successive satellite images, taken by the US satellite, Landsat, in 1988, 1998, 2013, and 2019. Using a supervised classification, with the maximum likelihood method of ERDAS IMAGINE 2016, GIS was used in the production and analysis of soil maps, and geological and hydrological groups of drainage basins, as well as the hydrological model (HEC-HMS), were applied in calculating the hydrograph curve of the Wadi Nu'man basin. The flood water volumes and flow rates were estimated based on the SCS unit hydrograph, and the rain depth was analyzed and estimated for different periods. The hydraulic modeling program (HEC-RAS) was employed, when developing a two-dimensional model to calculate the speed, depth, and spread of the flood, in order to apply the risk matrix method. The recommendations based on this study give priority to the implementation of a flood prevention plan and the protection of infrastructure by maintaining the existing flood drainage facilities and establishing new drainage facilities to protect lives, property, and infrastructure.","[Abdelkarim, Ashraf] Minist Housing, Res Ctr, Urban Geog & Flood Risks, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia; [Gaber, Ahmed F.

In this paper, we provide a new soil assessment procedure that, with the help of a web based new decision tool (DT), allows to (i) rate potential soil threats through a computer engine that processes a detailed check list of vineyard and site specific characteristics, (ii) identify which potential threats are valid on the basis of physical and/or analytical vineyard assessment, (iii) propose through a decision engine best soil mitigation solutions according to real threats and (iv) evaluate soil's threats changes after the mitigation solution's implementation. All gathered data were also used for a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis and estimation of possible ecosystem services. Traditional (e.g combinations of tillage and native grassing) vs innovative soil management (SM) treatments were evaluated over three years (2017-2019) in nine test vineyards sited in the Parma and Piacenza provinces (Northern Italy). As expected, fraction of real-to-potential threat increased from 22% to 79% with increasing potential threat severity; however, potential threats classified as very likely (red color) had a 55% conversion rate into real threat, suggesting that summer drought and erosion threat assessment require more deepening. Overall, mitigation SM solutions consisting of a sown cover crop in mid-rows with the slashed sward either left on site and piled beneath the row or in temporary winter grassing followed by green manuring improved vine performances as compared to tillage and native grassing. SWOT analysis unleashed that the same SM solutions are well-perceived by growers who are still reluctant to incur additional costs for their implementation. A total ES benefit of 1454 (sic) ha(-1), with soil erosion containment accounting for 700 (sic) ha(-1), was estimated. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide grape growers with a tool allowing objective assessment of real soil threats. Albeit grapevine is taken as use case in this study, the same protocol is valuable in any orchard ecosystem organized in single rows separated by a mid row alley.","[Diti, I; Caffi, T.; Rossi, V; Gatti, M.; Poni, S.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Crop Prod, Piacenza, Italy; [Legler, S.

While qualitative observations of similarities between Arabian Middle Palaeolithic and African Middle Stone Age (MSA) assemblages have been made, these inferences remain untested and often situated within overly broad dichotomies (e.g., 'Africa' versus the 'Levant'), which distort concepts of geographic scale and subsume local variability. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that assemblages from Jubbah, in the Nefud Desert of northern Saudi Arabia are similar to MSA industries from northeast Africa. Based on the quantitative analysis of a suite of metric and morphological data describing lithic reduction sequences, our results show that early and late core reduction at Jubbah is distinct from equivalent northeast African strategies, perhaps as a result of raw material factors. However, specific techniques of core shaping, preparation and preferential flake production at Jubbah draw from a number of methods also present in the northeast African MSA. While two Jubbah lithic assemblages (JKF-1 and JKF-12) display both similarities and differences with the northeast African assemblages, a third locality (JSM-1) was significantly different to both the other Arabian and African assemblages, indicating an unexpected diversity of assemblages in the Jubbah basin during Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5, similar to 125-70,000 years ago, or ka). Along with evidence from southern Arabia and the Levant, our results add quantitative support to arguments that MIS 5 hominin demography at the interface between Africa and Asia was complex.

The sequence from the western part of the former Solent river system is one of the longest in Britain, with 18 mapped terrace aggraclations. A set of 23 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates aim to provide dated tie-points within the lower part of the sequence at five stratotype locations. These dates are replicated at single sites, providing age estimates for fewer members, but increasing the reliability for those members that have been dated. The results provide two reliably dated tie-points within the sequence and suggest that (i) the lowest six terrace aggraclations all postdate ca. 275 kyr (MIS 8), (ii) terraces may have aggraded during cold phases within the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7) and (iii) the interglacial deposits at Stone Point whose age has previously been contested are likely to be of lpswichian (last interglacial, MIS 5e) age. These findings are compared to previous age models in the western Solent basin, with which they agree in part. They may suggest that fluvial activity in the Solent was particularly dynamic during MIS 7.

Here, we present 54,045 annually precise dendrochronological felling dates from historical construction timber from across most of Europe between 1250 and 1699 CE to infer variations in building activity. We use geostatistical techniques to compare spatiotemporal dynamics in past European building activity against independent demographic, economic, social and climatic data. We show that the felling dates capture major geographical patterns of demographic trends, especially in regions with dense data coverage. A particularly strong negative association is found between grain prices and the number of felling dates. In addition, a significant positive association is found between the number of felling dates and mining activity. These strong associations, with well-known macro-economic indicators from pre-industrial Europe, corroborate the use of felling dates as an independent source for exploring large-scale fluctuations of societal well-being and demographic development. Three prominent examples are the building boom in the Hanseatic League region of northeastern Germany during the 13th century, the onset of the Late Medieval Crisis in much of Europe c. 1300, and the cessation of building activity in large parts of central Europe during armed conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648 CE). Despite new insights gained from our European-wide felling date inventory, further studies are needed to investigate changes in construction activity of high versus low status buildings, and of urban versus rural buildings, and to compare those results with a variety of historical documentary sources and natural proxy archives.","[Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier] Stockholm Univ, Dept Hist, Stockholm, Sweden;

The distinctive Methuselah's beard lichen (Usnea longissima Ach.) is an exception to this pattern of shared distributions, with very few ITR locations. Does this absence reflect dispersal limitations or climatic intolerance? To answer this question, we transplanted U. longissima thalli from the CTR to three ITR locations, assessing growth rates against reciprocal CTR transplants. Canopy microclimate measurements provided concurrent data on growth conditions. Growth rate responses (length, mass, and area) were evaluated after summer and full-year transplants. Notwithstanding extended drought conditions during the summer period, annual transplants at two of the three ITR locations supported growth rates comparable to those at the CM source U. longissima population, with summer dewfall and autumn rains being major ITR hydration sources. Thalli transplanted to a third ITR site (summer measurements only) in a location transitional to the drier interior plateau lost both mass and length. Based on these findings, we suggest that the absence of U. longissima from much of the ITR reflects the combined influence of dispersal limitations and requirements for stands with long site continuity and topographically induced summer wetting of thalli by dewfall.","[Strother, Ivy Evergreen; Coxson, Darwyn] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Goward, Trevor] Univ British Columbia, Beaty Biodivers Museum, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Coxson, D (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",darwyn.coxson@unbc.ca,,,University of Northern British Columbia; NSERC; Aleza Lake Research Forest,University of Northern British Columbia; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Aleza Lake Research Forest,"We thank the Aleza Lake Research Forest, the University of Northern British Columbia, and NSERC for funding support.

Yet time-since-last-fire (TSLF) is an important variable for explaining successional changes and subsequent carbon storage. The objective of this study was to predict the spatial variability of aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) as a function of TSLF and other environmental factors across the landscape at regional scales. ABC was predicted using random forest models, both at the sample-plot level and at the scale of 2-km(2) cells. This cell size was chosen to match the observed minimum fire size of the Canadian large fire database. The percentage variance explained by the empirical sample-plot level model of ABC was 50%. At that scale, TSLF was not significantly related to ABC. At the 2-km(2) scale, ABC was influenced mainly by the proportions of cover density classes, which explained 83% of the variance. Changes in cover density were related to TSLF at the same 2-km(2) scale, indicating that the increase in cover density following fire disturbance is a dominant mechanism through which TSLF acts upon ABC at the scale of landscapes.

The dating results indicated that the aggradation period for the sediments from below the M1 alluvial terrace can be correlated to the Weichselian upper Pleniglacial (MIS 2), which is in good agreement with the general chronostratigraphy of the Moselle terrace staircase. The ages were obtained from small aliquots of quartz and feldspars, using the single aliquot regenerative (SAR) protocol. The equivalent dose determination included a series of tests and the selection of the Minimum Age Model as the most appropriate statistical model. This made it possible to provide a reliable methodological background for further luminescence dating of fluvial sediments from the Moselle basin.","[Cordier, S.] Univ Paris Est Creteil Val de Marne, Dept Geog, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Cordier, S.] CNRS, UMR 8591, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Cordier, S.; Frechen, M.; Tsukamoto, S.] LIAG, Sect Geochronol & Isotope Hydrol 3, D-30655 Hannover, Germany",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Leibniz Institut fur Angewandte Geophysik (LIAG),"Cordier, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris Est Creteil Val de Marne, Dept Geog, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.",stephane.cordier@u-pec.fr,,"Tsukamoto, Sumiko/0000-0003-4626-4784",DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service),DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers for their comments which helped improve the manuscript.

No site between these two dates has yet been discovered in the area, and this chronological period has thus been interpreted as a gap in settlement from MIS 16 to MIS 12, two crucial phases of occupation in Western Europe. The record before the long glacial event MIS 12 has been traditionally associated with the onset of the Acheulean in Europe. From MIS 12, the record represents the earliest evidence of innovations, a clear shift in human evolution. Here, we compare these two levels (strata a and c), tracking the technological innovations during this time and combining technological analysis with geometric morphometrics with the use of 3D models comparison of the large cutting tools (LCTs). Stratum a yielded an Early Acheulean, one of the few evidences in Europe presents tools with mainly short shaping sequences on local millstone slabs, with special attention to tips, but with clear management of tool volume. Stratum c, dated to the MIS 11, differs in that both local millstone and flints from distant sources show longer shaping sequences, the use of soft hammers for several series of removals on tools, combined with final regularizing retouch on entire edges. The morphometric approach shows a morphological transition from oval to teardrop shapes for the thinnest tools. Our data suggest a clear technological filiation between strata a and c and in la Noira populations from MIS 16 and MIS 12, as suggested for innovations of core technologies and land-use patterns, and raise question on local human behavioural evolution over the Middle Pleistocene in Western Europe.","[Garcia-Medrano, Paula; Despriee, Jackie; Moncel, Marie-Helene] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Homme & Environm, UMR 7194, Paris, France; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula] British Museum, Dept Britain Europe & Prehist, Frank House,56 Orsman Rd, London N1 5QJ, England; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Natural History Museum London; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Garcia-Medrano, P (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Homme & Environm, UMR 7194, Paris, France.;Garcia-Medrano, P (corresponding author), British Museum, Dept Britain Europe & Prehist, Frank House,56 Orsman Rd, London N1 5QJ, England.;Garcia-Medrano, P (corresponding author), Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain.;Garcia-Medrano, P (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain.",pgarciamedrano@gmail.com,,,"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme as part of a Marie Sklodowska-Curie project, Western European Acheulean project, WEAP [748316]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence [CEX2019-000,945-M];  [ANR-19-CE27-0011]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme as part of a Marie Sklodowska-Curie project, Western European Acheulean project, WEAP; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); ","This research was supported by the project Understanding a threshold in Human evolution at 450-350 ka through the roots of Neanderthal behavior (Neandroots) (ANR-19-CE27-0011).; P.

The novice-expert problem arises when non-experts are confronted with (real or apparent) scientific disagreement, and when they don't know whom to trust. Because they are not able to gauge the content of expert testimony, they rely on imperfect heuristics to evaluate the trustworthiness of scientists. This paper investigates why some bodies of scientific knowledge become polarized along political fault lines. Laypeople navigate conflicting epistemic and social demands in their acceptance of scientific testimony; this might explain their deference to scientific fringe theories, which often goes together with denying established scientific theories. I evaluate three approaches to mitigate denialism: improving the message, improving the messenger, and improving the environment in which the message is conveyed.","[De Cruz, Helen] St Louis Univ, Danforth Chair Humanities, Philosophy, 3800 Lindell Blvd, St Louis, MO 63108 USA",Saint Louis University,"De Cruz, H (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Danforth Chair Humanities, Philosophy, 3800 Lindell Blvd, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",Helen.DeCruz@slu.edu,,"De Cruz, Helen/0000-0003-0139-3769",British Academy; American Philosophical Association; John Templeton Foundation,British Academy; American Philosophical Association; John Templeton Foundation,"Helen De Cruz holds the Danforth Chair in the Humanities at Saint Louis University.

Achieving this balance requires an understanding of the possible consequences of alternative future scenarios for a range of stakeholders. We employ an integrated economic and environmental planning approach to evaluate four alternative futures for the mega-diverse island of Borneo. We show what could be achieved if the three national jurisdictions of Borneo coordinate efforts to achieve their public policy targets and allow a partial reallocation of planned land uses. We reveal the potential for Borneo to simultaneously retain similar to 50% of its land as forests, protect adequate habitat for the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Bornean elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis), and achieve an opportunity cost saving of over US$43 billion. Such coordination would depend on enhanced information sharing and reforms to land-use planning, which could be supported by the increasingly international nature of economies and conservation efforts.","[Runting, Rebecca K.; Meijaard, Erik; Abram, Nicola K.; Wells, Jessie A.; Posssingham, Hugh P.; Wilson, Kerrie A.] Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Environm De, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Runting, Rebecca K.; Meijaard, Erik; Abram, Nicola K.; Wells, Jessie A.; Ancrenaz, Marc] Jalan WR Supratman, Borneo Futures Project, Ciputat 15412, Tangerang, Indonesia; [Runting, Rebecca K.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Meijaard, Erik; Gaveau, David L.

Although previous efforts mapped spatial patterns and produced facies models of large microbial lacustrine systems, details of the origins of microbialite fabrics are less well constrained. To address these unknowns, this study evaluates the influence of organic-matter source, abundance, and growth habit on Holocene microbialite fabrics. Integrated multi-scale analyses characterize fabrics of Holocene microbialites in a small (< 1 km(2)), shallow (< 1 m), hypersaline, alkaline lake on Crooked-Acklins Platform in the southern Bahamas. The results of analyses indicate systematic distribution of surface sediment across the lake, from various types of unlithified microbial mats to calcareous microbialites; bottom type relates to water depth. Spherules with laminae of radial aragonite are common in organic-rich mats, and can have competitive growth boundaries. Calcareous microbialites in the lake center can reach up to 60 cm tall and 2+ m across, and include macrofabrics and microfabrics that vary considerably, across micrometer to meter scales. Porosity varies from 43 to 59%, in pore types ranging from intra-fibrous (IF), breccia (BR), vuggy (VUG), intra-(WL) and inter-laminar (IL), digitate (DG), to branching (BRA). Microfabrics are not unique to individual macrofabrics, and organic-matter source is similar among fabrics. The abundance of organic matter and growth habit of organics on the outer parts of microbialites varies markedly among fabrics, suggesting that these parameters may control rock fabric. The occurrence of Mg silicates in association with these microbialites may favor preservation of the depositional pores. Although ultimate preservation is unknown, understanding the genesis of primary fabrics may provide insights into possible pore evolution in reservoir analogs.","[Hubert, Hannah L.; Rankey, Eugene C.; Omelon, Christopher] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Rankey, EC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",grankey@ku.edu,"Omelon, Christopher R/B-8520-2011","Omelon, Christopher R/0000-0003-4563-3189",Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium (KICC) at the University of Kansas; SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology),Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium (KICC) at the University of Kansas; SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology),"This research project was generously funded by the Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium (KICC) at the University of Kansas, Art Saller and Jennifer Lewis, and SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).

Two main factors may account for this high diversity: the complex orography and its role as refugia during past glaciations. We have investigated seven narrow endemics of Centaurea subsection Phalolepis from Anatolia by means of microsatellites and ecological niche modelling (ENM), in order to analyse genetic polymorphisms and getting insights into their speciation. Despite being narrow endemics, all the studied species show moderate to high SSR genetic diversity. Populations are genetically isolated, but exchange of genes probably occurred at glacial maxima (likely through the Anatolian mountain arches as suggested by the ENM). The lack of correlation between genetic clusters and (morpho) species is interpreted as a result of allopatric diversification on the basis of a shared gene pool. As suggested in a former study in Greece, post-glacial isolation in mountains would be the main driver of diversification in these plants; mountains of Anatolia would have acted as plant refugia, allowing the maintenance of high genetic diversity. Ancient gene flow between taxa that became sympatric during glaciations may also have contributed to the high levels of genetic diversity.","[Lopez-Pujol, Jordi; Lopez-Vinyallonga, Sara; Susanna, Alfonso; Garcia-Jacas, Nuria] Botan Inst Barcelona IBB CSIC ICUB, Pg Migdia S-N, ES-08038 Barcelona, Spain; [Ertugrul, Kuddisi; Uysal, Tuna; Tugay, Osman] Selcuk Univ, Fac Sci & Art, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey; [Guetat, Arbi] Northern Border Univ, Dept Biol, Coll Sci, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut Botanic de Barcelona (ICUB); Selcuk University; Northern Borders University,"Garcia-Jacas, N (corresponding author), Botan Inst Barcelona IBB CSIC ICUB, Pg Migdia S-N, ES-08038 Barcelona, Spain.",ngarciajacas@ibb.csic.es,"Ertugrul, Kuddisi/A-1122-2016; Susanna, Alfonso/C-1683-2013; Guetat, Arbi/AAA-2938-2019; Uysal, Tuna/AFJ-5212-2022; Garcia-Jacas, Núria/K-8910-2014","Ertugrul, Kuddisi/0000-0002-6463-2918; Susanna, Alfonso/0000-0003-4717-9063; Guetat, Arbi/0000-0002-9448-4071; Uysal, Tuna/0000-0001-9968-5633; Tugay, Osman/0000-0003-3980-7648; Garcia-Jacas, Nuria/0000-0003-1893-5122",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2010/18631]; Generalitat de Catalunya [Ajuts a Grups de Recerca Consolidats] [2014-SGR514-GREB],"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya [Ajuts a Grups de Recerca Consolidats](Generalitat de Catalunya)",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [project CGL2010/18631] and Generalitat de Catalunya [Ajuts a Grups de Recerca Consolidats 2014-SGR514-GREB].,,84,13,13,0,26,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,25-Nov,2016,,,,,,,37818,10.1038/srep37818,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep37818,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,EC9NT,27886271,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000388472000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased numbers of vectors and pathways have reduced the island's biotic isolation, increasing the risk of new introductions and their associated impacts on native biodiversity. It is likely that these risks are greater here than they are in continental MSs, where the native biodiversity is richer. A horizon scanning approach was used to identify the most likely invasive alien species (IAS) (with the potential to impact biodiversity) to arrive on the island of Ireland within the next ten years. To achieve this, we used a consensus-based approach, whereby expert opinion and discussion groups were utilised to establish and rank a list of 40 species of the most likely terrestrial, freshwater and marine IAS to arrive on the island of Ireland within the decade 2017-2027. The list of 40 included 18 freshwater, 15 terrestrial and seven marine IAS. Crustacean species (freshwater and marine) were taxonomically dominant (11 out of 40); this reflects their multiple pathways of introduction, their ability to act as ecosystem engineers and their resulting high impacts on biodiversity. Freshwater species dominated the top ten IAS (seven species out of ten), with the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) highlighted as the most likely species to arrive and establish in freshwaters, while roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (second) and the warm-water barnacle (Hesperibalanus fallax) (fifth), were the most likely terrestrial and marine invaders. This evidence-based list provides important information to the relevant statutory agencies in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to prioritise the prevention of the most likely invaders and aid in compliance with legislation, in particular the EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species (EU 1143/2014). Targeted biosecurity in both jurisdictions is urgently required in order to manage the pathways and vectors of arrival, and is vital to maintaining native biodiversity on the island of Ireland.","[Lucy, Frances E.; Davis, Eithne; Sheehan, Rory] Inst Technol, Ctr Environm Res Innovat & Sustainabil, Dept Environm Sci, Ash Lane, Sligo, Ireland; [Anderson, Roy] Royal Entomol Soc, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Booy, Olaf; Moore, Niall] GB Nonnat Species Secretariat, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Bradley, Ken; Mackie, Tim; Muir, Rose] Dept Agr Environm & Rural Affairs, Dundonald House,Upper Newtownards Rd, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Britton, J.

We conducted an experiment of free-air ozone fumigation with saplings of P uncinata fumigated with ambient O-3 (AOT40 May-Oct: 9.2 ppm h), 1.5 x O-3amb (AOT40 May-Oct: 19.2 ppm h), and 1.8 x O-3amb (AOT40 May-Oct: 32.5 ppm h) during two growing seasons. We measured chlorophyll content and fluorescence, visible injury, gas exchange, and above- and below-ground biomass. Increased exposures to ozone led to a higher occurrence and intensity of visible injury from O-3 and a 24-29% reduction of root biomass, which may render trees more susceptible to other stresses such as drought. P. uncinata is thus a species sensitive to O-3, concentrations of which in the Pyrenees are already likely affecting this species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, it investigates how army and navy officers stationed at Halifax and Bermuda on the North America and West Indies Station helped to create an imperial, militarized 'New World' region in the North Atlantic through zoogeography in the British post-emancipation era. The tracing of the boundary-line between the temperate (Nearctic) and tropical (Neotropical) North Atlantic involved designating Bermuda and Halifax as strategic winter and summer 'homes' on the Station, and highlighting the 'natural' connections between the two sites through mobile fauna, ocean currents, and weather systems. Making visible the geographic distribution of migratory animals, the Gulf Stream, and hurricanes - through maps, natural collections, sketches, and travel-writing - provided new ways of seeing and thinking about British imperial defence in the North Atlantic. This paper also considers the role of non-human mobilities in animating these regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesize that high stands of Lake Turkana reflect complex hydrological processes with variability in Atlantic and Indian Ocean-derived moisture into East Africa, ultimately linked to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Lake level rise was also amplified regionally by increased precipitation causing overflow from the adjacent Suguta and Chew Bahir basins, particularly during high stands at ca >8.5 ka and at 6.4 ka. The timing of transgressive and regressive events is constrained by C-14 dating of carefully selected lacustrine mollusks, incorporation of previous shell ages with sufficient elevational control, and OSL dating of quartz grains from littoral and sublittoral deposits by a multiple aliquot regeneration (MAR) approach. There was a high water level up to at least 70 m at >8.5 ka that probably reached the spillover limit similar to 100 m. A brief (<500 yr) high stand up to at least 50 m at ca 7 ka appears to be coincident with warm postglacial SSTs in the western Indian Ocean and thus may reflect a strengthened East African Monsoon, though some precipitation was probably derived from Atlantic sources as well. A pronounced high stand inferred at ca 6.4 ka, possibly up to 100 m, is associated with warming across the Indian Ocean and equatorward compression of the ITCZ, thus reflecting a strengthened East African Monsoon. A high stand occurred at ca 5.5-5.0 ka up to at least 80 m, with a precipitous drop in lake level by 4.6 ka. Evidence from relict Porr strand plain indicate that lake level was probably below 20 m since ca 4.5 ka, though there were two noticeable high stands up to 12-20 m at ca 830 years ago and <100 years, the latter age is consistent with the historic record.

Increasing support for renewables results in rising public service obligation tariffs to fund these policies. Photovoltaic prosumption could help lower the cost of developing renewables but may induce cross-subsidies between prosumers and other users of the network to compensate for the benefits. We show that such cross subsidies occur but are dependent on the self-consumption rate, which will remain low in the coming years. The regulator could fund these cross-subsidies by increasing the fixed component of the network tariff for prosumers only.","[Clastres, Cedric; Rebenaque, Olivier] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, UMR 5313, GAEL,INRA,Grenoble INP, CS 40700, F-38058 Grenoble 9, France; [Percebois, Jacques; Rebenaque, Olivier; Solier, Boris] Palais Brongniart, Climate Econ Chair, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France; [Percebois, Jacques; Solier, Boris] Univ Montpellier, ART Dev, UMR 5281, Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Rebenaque, O (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, UMR 5313, GAEL,INRA,Grenoble INP, CS 40700, F-38058 Grenoble 9, France.",olivier.rebenaque@chaireeconomieduclimat.org,,"Percebois, Jacques/0000-0002-2839-2208",,,,,47,14,14,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0957-1787,1878-4356,,UTIL POLICY,Util.

Integration of the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Transport model (HYSPLIT) and a solar radiative transfer model (CLIRAD-SW) allow us to simulate the spatial and temporal distributions of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols from biomass burning in the South Asian region. It also allows us to estimate further their aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing. We find that an anticyclone over Bay of Bengal dominates the transport of pollutants of the South Asian region. The monthly mean surface concentration of OC and BC is 1.1 mu g m(-3) in this region. Western Myanmar has the maximum value, with the concentration reaching 12.5 mu g m(-3). The monthly mean clear-sky direct shortwave radiative forcing ranges from -1.9 to 0.4 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere and from -0.5 to -12.0 W m(-2) at surface, resulting in an increase of the atmospheric heating rate from 0.01 to 0.3 degrees C day(-1). Owing to the spatial distributions of the aerosol optical depth ratio (OC/BC) and the surface albedo, there is a strong gradient of heating rate near the source regions, which may modify local circulations.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Chungli 320, Taiwan; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; NE States Coordinated Air Use Management, Boston, MA USA",National Central University; National Taiwan University,"Wang, SH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",nhlin@cc.ncu.edu.tw,"Wang, Sheng-Hsiang/F-4532-2010; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang/AAA-3905-2021","Wang, Sheng-Hsiang/0000-0001-9675-3135; ",,,,,72,46,46,1,8,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

We utilized a simple yet robust SCS method which is a well-known method to calculate runoff composed of simple calculation formula but proven to be able to do flood-prone area mapping effectively. Satellite rainfall dataset has been given as the main forcing factor in SCS formula to generate runoff values. The results of this research experiments have been successfully produced the map of the flood-prone areas in Java Island and therefore confirm that rainfall data is the primary forcing factor to develop flood hazard map rather than solely use topographic data. A combination between runoff and the other hydrological parameter such as flow accumulation might be useful to enhance the existing Java island flood index.

Among Leopardus, L. pardalis is the largest species, having an historical range that includes tropical and subtropical habitats from southern U.S.A. to southern South America but, as usual in the ocelot lineage, fossil remains that can be interpreted with certainty are restricted to the Late Pleistocene of southern U.S.A. and Brazil. Here we present a new record (a fragment of right maxillary plus zygomatic with P4-M1; incomplete left mandible with the coronoid process, part of c1 alveolus and p3-m1; isolated right c1) from the Late Pleistocene of Arroyo Toropi, Corrientes province, Argentina. The bearing level was dated with Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to 98.4 ka (Marine Isotopic Stage, MIS 5c). Present environmental requirements of L. pardalis and climatic reconstructions carried out here suggest a compatible scenario with MIS 5 for this fossil, which is concordant with the associated dating (ca. 98.4 ka). Leopardus pardalis appears to be part of a subtropical fauna, with Tayassu pecari and Euphractus sexcinctus, which inhabited the region during warm and wet climatic events of MIS 5c. Phytoliths and other vertebrates are congruent with its presence, since the inferred conditions are similar to the present one. The new record is relevant not only because it is the first fossil record of the species for the Pleistocene of Argentina, but also because it is placed 1800 km south of the closest accurately identified published fossil.","[Prevosti, Francisco J.] Univ Nacl La Rioja UNLaR, Museo Ciencias Antropol & Nat, Av Luis M Fuente S-N, RA-5300 La Rioja, Argentina; [Prevosti, Francisco J.; Mendez, Cecilia; Schiaffini, Mauro; Contreras, Silvina; Zurita, Alfredo E.; Luna, Carlos A.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Corrientes, Argentina; [Mendez, Cecilia; Contreras, Silvina; Zurita, Alfredo E.; Luna, Carlos A.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Litoral CECOAL, Lab Evoluc Vertebrados & Ambientes Cenozoi, Ruta 5,Km 2,5, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina; [Mendez, Cecilia; Contreras, Silvina; Zurita, Alfredo E.; Luna, Carlos A.] Univ Nacl Nordeste, Ruta 5,Km 2,5, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina; [Schiaffini, Mauro] UNPSJB, CONICET, CIEMEP, Ctr Invest Esquel Montana & Estepa Patagon, Gral Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Cirignoli, Sebastian] Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico CeIBA, Bertoni 85, Puerto Iguazu Misiones, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Mendez, C (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Corrientes, Argentina.;Mendez, C (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Litoral CECOAL, Lab Evoluc Vertebrados & Ambientes Cenozoi, Ruta 5,Km 2,5, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina.;Mendez, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Nordeste, Ruta 5,Km 2,5, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina.",ceci_crm@live.com,,,"SGCyT-UNNE [PI Q002/17]; ANPCyT-FONCYT [PICT 2017-0765, PICT 2015-966]; PUE-CONICET [229 20180100001]",SGCyT-UNNE; ANPCyT-FONCYT(ANPCyTFONCyT); PUE-CONICET,"The authors want to express gratitude to the authorities and people of Bella Vista, Corrientes.

However, climatic variability, globalisation and increasing ecomomic integration are making these landscapes more fragile with implications for present and future development. Using a pathways lens, we examine development trajectories in mountains and relate these to environmental and social-economic change currently taking place. We analyse and compare pathways in three case studies in Peru (Andes); Nepal (Himalayas); and Kyrgyzstan (Tien Shan). The paper highlights that development pathways in fragile mountain regions may be shifting in new directions, but because they emerge out of complex socio-environmental and historical contexts, there are also social risks associated with the articulation of future pathways, particularly in terms of social equity and sustainability. Building on different pathway approaches with their various strengths and weaknesses, this study examines the role of human agency and power, the role of historical and present context and feedbacks between social and ecological features in shaping future development pathways of mountain landscapes.","[Karpouzoglou, Timos] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Stockholm, Sweden; [Dewulf, Art; Cieslik, Katarzyna] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Perez, Katya] Consortium Sustainable Dev Andean Ecoreg CONDESAN, Lima, Peru; [Gurung, Praju; Regmi, Santosh] Soc Hydrologists & Meteorologists SOHAM Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Isaeva, Aiganysh] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Foggin, Marc] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Bastiaensen, Johan; Van Hecken, Gert] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy, Antwerp, Belgium; [Zulkafli, Zed] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Serdang, Malaysia; [Mao, Feng] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales; [Clark, Julian; Hannah, David M.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Chapagain, Prem Sagar] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geog, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Cieslik, Katarzyna] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Cieslik, Katarzyna] Wageningen Univ & Res, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; Wageningen University & Research; American University of Central Asia; University of British Columbia; University of Antwerp; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Cardiff University; University of Birmingham; Tribhuvan University; Imperial College London; University of Cambridge; Wageningen University & Research,"Karpouzoglou, T (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, Stockholm, Sweden.",timothy.karpouzoglou@abe.kth.se,"Hannah, David M./B-9221-2015; Cieslik, Katarzyna/GXF-9020-2022; Chapagain, Prem Sagar/AAI-5748-2020; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022; Karpouzoglou, Timos/P-6216-2015","Hannah, David M./0000-0003-1714-1240; Chapagain, Prem Sagar/0000-0001-7316-8769; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Karpouzoglou, Timos/0000-0001-9568-9813; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Foggin, Marc/0000-0002-2663-6715; Cieslik, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8240-0117"," [NE- K010239-1]; NERC [NE/K010123/1, NE/K010239/1, NE/P00038X/1, NE/K010182/1] Funding Source: UKRI",; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge funding received from theUK Research Council NERC/ESRC/DFID ESPA programme (project NE- K010239-1, 'Adaptive governance of mountain ecosystem services for poverty alleviation enabled by environmental virtual observatories' Mountain-EVO).",,49,3,4,3,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The core sediments were subdivided into two parts based on grain size: an upper (0-380cm depth) and lower part (>380cm depth). The lower part was deposited primarily by fluvial processes during an interglacial period [ marine isotope stage (MIS) 7] with warm and humid conditions. Conversely, the upper part was mainly deposited by aeolian processes during a cold and dry glacial period (MIS 6). Geochemical characteristics, represented by major, trace and rare earth element (REE) compositions, and textures of the Jeongokri core sediments show distinct differences between the upper and lower parts. The mineralogy and major, trace and REE compositions indicate that the influence of felsic source rocks (e. g. granite) was dominant in the lower sediments, which were derived from the Hantan River. In contrast, increased quartz content and the very fine and homogeneous grain size in the upper sediments indicate an aeolian origin. REE ratios and distribution patterns, and geochemical signatures indicate that these sediments were derived predominantly from Chinese loess deposits and partially from local sediments from the Korean Peninsula; the possible source area of the upper sediments is the northern part of the Yellow Sea basin. The Yellow Sea basin, having mixed geochemical signatures between Chinese loess and Korean-derived sediments, was exposed because of low sea levels during MIS 6. The exposed Yellow Sea basin was located in the path of winter-monsoon winds, which may have carried a great deal of airborne sediments from the basin to the Jeongokri area.

In a factorial field-plot experiment we investigated the role of soil-P status, band-applied manure and rainfall intensity on P losses from two Swiss grassland sites. Artificial rainfall was applied on each plot first at medium intensity using a sprinkler and then at high intensity using a watering can, simulating two different runoff conditions. Under both conditions, dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff increased linearly with water soluble P in the soil (WSP), but the extraction coefficients differed substantially between the two phases of runoff generation. It was 0.017 kg L-1 for runoff generated with the watering can (WCR), and 0.085 kg L-1 for runoff generated with the sprinkler (SR). Manure application increased DRP losses, but did not override the effect of soil P status. Phosphorus losses with runoff were more sensitive to soil P status for SR than for WCR. Reducing soil-P is therefore crucial to reduce runoff-P. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Within the framework of the work, the values of the permeability, diffusion, and solubility coefficients of pure gases in the temperature range of interest as well as the values of the permeability coefficient of the components of a CO2-N-2 binary gas mixture are determined using gas chromatographic analysis of the permeate flow. It is demonstrated in this work that the process of separation the most effectively occurs at room temperature in the case of a low concentration of carbon dioxide (up to 15 mol %) in the binary mixture. It is experimentally shown that the separation process is the most effective at a low temperature (273.15 K) in the rest of the range of concentrations of CO2. Further decrease in temperature does not make the process of separation of the mixture more effective throughout the entire considered range of concentrations of carbon dioxide.","[Smorodin, K.

Despite extensive archaeological research conducted in Korea over the last three decades, the lack of comparable pottery evidence from the early postglacial, let alone the terminal Pleistocene, on the Korean Peninsula remains an archaeological enigma. Rather than anticipating future discoveries, we feel that it is time to explain why early pottery does not appear on the Korean Peninsula and attempt to provide a workable hypothesis focusing on the spatio-temporal dynamics of mobile hunter-gatherer-fisher populations during periods of substantial environmental change. Summed probability distribution and kernel density estimation of radiocarbon dates clearly indicate significant population fluctuations: occupation density increased under cold and dry Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions and declined during warmer post-LGM and postglacial periods. We argue that a significant decline in population is the main reason why Pleistocene and postglacial pottery does not appear in Korea. On the other hand, the establishment of a Neolithic pottery tradition along Korea's coasts were likely associated with the 8.2 ka cooling event.","[Kim, Jangsuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Seong, Chuntaek] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Hist, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul 02447, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Kyung Hee University,"Seong, C (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Hist, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",jangsuk@snu.ac.kr; haeram@khu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A5A2A03043510],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",Kim's work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A5A2A03043510) .,,90,2,2,0,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1040-6182,1873-4553,,QUATERN INT,Quat.

Content analysis of titles, keywords and abstracts revealed that most of the research has focused on the study of green roofs. Previously this topic was dominated by water runoff analysis, while recent contributions acknowledge greenery as an effective microclimate mitigation strategy, especially in urban areas. The United States was the most productive country, representing almost 20 % of the total documents. Over 86 % of the relevant documents were published since 2009.

We focus on mesopelagic species, because they are most abundant, and on northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), because they are important commercial and forage fish species. Univariate models indicated that changes in the relative abundance, area occupied, center of gravity, and spatiotemporal variability of numerically dominant warm-water and cool-water-associated mesopelagic ichthyoplankton show strong species-specific differences. Multivariate models revealed that the warm-water-associated mesopelagic assemblage exhibits an increasing, nonmonotonic, secular trend of increasing relative abundance underlying interannual variability, suggesting a tropicalization of the southern California Current System. In contrast, the cool-water-associated mesopelagic assemblage shows mainly interannual variability, with little secular trend over the 65-year period. Correlation matrices of the modeled ichthyoplankton densities showed that the spatial distributions of northern anchovy and Pacific hake are highly correlated with cool-water mesopelagic ichthyoplankton, but Pacific sardine is spatially correlated with both warm- and cool-water-associated mesopelagic species. Declines of adult sardine, anchovy, and hake are occurring concurrently with tropicalization of the southern California Current System. The most parsimonious explanation for tropicalization of the ichthyoplankton is increased presence of Pacific Equatorial-influenced Water in the inshore southern California region. We modeled the distribution of ichthyoplankton in the southern California Current System from 1951 to 2016. We focus on abundant mesopelagic species and on northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), because they are important commercial and forage fish species. Single species models indicated that changes in abundance, area, distribution center, and variability of the most abundant mesopelagic ichthyoplankton associated with warm and cool water show strong differences between the species. Models of species groups revealed that the warm-water mesopelagic larval fishes exhibit a long-term trend of increasing relative abundance underlying year-to-year variability, suggesting tropicalization of the southern California Current System. In contrast, the cool-water mesopelagic larvae show mainly year-to-year variability, with little long-term trend. Correlations between the modeled species showed that the spatial distributions of northern anchovy and Pacific hake are highly correlated with cool-water mesopelagic larvae, but Pacific sardine is correlated with both warm- and cool-water-associated mesopelagic species. The spatial variability of hake over time is highly positively correlated with cool-water mesopelagics and with northern anchovy, but sardine fluctuate independently of the mesopelagics and both anchovy and hake. Declines of adult sardine, anchovy, and hake are occurring concurrently with tropicalization of the southern California Current System. The simplest explanation for more tropical ichthyoplankton is increased presence of Pacific Equatorial-influenced Water in the inshore southern California region.","[McClatchie, Sam; Drenkard, Elizabeth J.; Thompson, Andrew R.; Watson, William] NOAA, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gao, Jin; Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Fisheries Resource Assessment & Monitoring Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Drenkard, Elizabeth J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ciannelli, Lorenzo] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Bograd, Steven J.] NOAA, Div Environm Res, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Serv, Monterey, CA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Oregon State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"McClatchie, S (corresponding author), NOAA, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",smcclatchie@fishocean.info,"Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014; Bograd, Steven/AAA-4824-2021; Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019","Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Thompson, Andrew/0000-0002-1384-2229; Gao, Jin/0000-0001-7474-4684; McClatchie, Sam/0000-0002-4819-1964; Drenkard, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3817-5717",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries And The Environment (FATE) program; National Science Foundation Coastal SEES program [NSF OCE-1600283]; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1600283] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries And The Environment (FATE) program; National Science Foundation Coastal SEES program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Funding was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), Fisheries And The Environment (FATE) programs, and the National Science Foundation Coastal SEES program (NSF OCE-1600283 to Art Miller).

Classifying the status of newly expanded populations can be difficult, particularly when the timing and nature of the range expansion are unclear. Should native species in new habitats be considered invasive pests or actively conserved? Here, we present an analytical framework applied to an Australian marsupial, the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), a species that preys upon on an endangered parrot in Tasmania, and whose provenance was uncertain. Location: Tasmania, Australia. Methods: We conducted an extensive search of historical records for sugar glider occurrences in Tasmania. Source material included museum collection data, early European expedition logs, community observation records, and peer-reviewed and grey literature. To determine the provenance of the Tasmanian population, we sequenced two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene in Tasmanian animals (n=27) and in individuals across the species' native range. We then estimated divergence times between Tasmania and southern Australian populations using phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses. Results: We found no historical evidence of sugar gliders occurring in Tasmania prior to 1835. All Tasmanian individuals (n=27) were genetically identical at the three genes surveyed here with those individuals being 0.125% divergent from individuals from a population in Victoria. Bayesian analysis of divergence between Tasmanian individuals and southern Australian individuals suggested a recent introduction of sugar gliders into Tasmania from southern Australia. Main conclusions: Molecular and historical data demonstrate that Tasmanian sugar gliders are a recent, post-European, anthropogenic introduction from mainland Victoria. This result has implications for the management of the species in relation to their impact on an endangered parrot. The analytical framework outlined here can assist environmental managers with the complex task of assessing the status of recently expanded or introduced native species.","[Campbell, Catriona D.; Sarre, Stephen D.; Gruber, Bernd; MacDonald, Anna J.; Holleley, Clare E.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT, Australia; [Stojanovic, Dejan] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Medlock, Kathryn] Tasmanian Museum & Art Gallery, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Harris, Stephen] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Holleley, Clare E.] CSIRO, Australian Natl Wildlife Collect, Natl Res Collect Australia, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra; Australian National University; University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Campbell, CD (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT, Australia.",cat.campbell@canberra.edu.au,"MacDonald, Anna J/B-4462-2011; Holleley, Clare E/C-4629-2011; Stojanovic, Dejan/AAB-3113-2019","MacDonald, Anna J/0000-0003-2972-200X; Holleley, Clare E/0000-0002-5257-0019; Stojanovic, Dejan/0000-0002-1176-3244; Gruber, Bernd/0000-0003-0078-8179; Sarre, Stephen D./0000-0002-7158-2517; Campbell, Catriona/0000-0001-7983-1832",Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre [1.L.21]; Rocket Hub Crowd Funding; Institute for Applied Ecology,"Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Rocket Hub Crowd Funding; Institute for Applied Ecology","Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre, Grant/Award Number: 1.L.21; Rocket Hub Crowd Funding; Institute for Applied Ecology, Grant/Award Number: Directors Fund",,77,20,22,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Since the 1980 decision of the US Supreme Court, living organisms or part thereof (including genes) became patentable subject matter. Thereafter, large numbers of patents have been delivered to life forms, some of which resulting in conflicting situations in terms of novelty, applicability, or infringment of biopatents. To illustrate some of the situations involved, four specific cases are analysed in this article, in order to evaluate the limits of biopatentability: i) Sequencing the human genome. The improvement of DNA sequencing techniques paved the way for characterizing the entire human genome. in the early stages of the project, results were published. In 1988, however, patents were requested for Est, i.e. expressed sequence tags whose location or function were unknown. After a period of refusal, such patents were granted in the USA and later on in Europe, notwithstanding the opposition of a fraction of scientists who disputed their status of novelty, considering it was like unduely patenting knowledge. After a period of unrest, President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair called for the publication of the whole genome sequence to the benefit of mankind. This was done, thus precluding further patentability of the human genome; ii) The saga of Monsanto suing the farmer Schmeiser. Percy Schmeiser successfully cropped canola in Saskatchewan (Western Canada) during half a century. Tests conducted in the 1998 crop revealed a high resistance to the glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup, due to the prevalence of genes patented by Monsanto and Monsanto Canada Inc. As Schmeiser never purchased Roundup-resistant canola seeds, nor obtained a licence to use them, Monsanto brought an action for patent infringement. Schmeiser denied any intentional introduction of patented genes on his land, and accused Monsanto of inadequate confinement of its patented material. The trial judge found the patent to be valid and allowed the action, granting $CAN 19,832 compensation to Monsanto, together with $CAN 153,000 of judiciary costs. The Federal Court of Appeal affirmed the decision and Schmeiser brought the appeal to the Supreme Court. The Court split five to four on the matter. The five majority justices confirmed that the farmer was guilty of infringement for using patented canola without due authorization. Compensations were denied to Monsanto, however, because the company had elected accounting of profits as remedy. Considering that the appellant earned no profit from the invention, the Court ruled that the respondents were entitled to nothing on their claim of account. in view of this mixed result, it resolved that each party bear its own costs throughout. The four minority justices expressed views opposed to the majority ruling. They considered that plants, or their offspring, were unpatentable by law, so that a person skilled in the art Could not be expected to realize that patent protection of genes exends to standing crops. They therefore estimated that the lower Courts erred in considering gene patent infringement as applicable to plants and harvested grains. Furthermore, the complexity and nuances of innocent bystander protection, in the context of agricultural biotechnology, should be expressly considered by Parliament, because it can only be inadequately accommodated by the law in use; iii) Revocation of the US patent granted to the yellow bean variety Enola. In 1999, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patented a variety of common bean with yellow-coated seeds, under the name Enola. Originally, Enola parents had been bought on a market place in Mexico. After selection in Colorado State, Enola was patented. As yellow-seed beans are much appreciated by latinos, both in Mexico and in the United States, patenting Enola was challenged by Mexican bean growers, who argued the lack of novelty compared to yellow bean varieties previously cropped in their country. After a legal battle and further scientific evidence based on DNA comparison, it appeared that Enola could not be distinguished from hybrid yellow beans which preexisted in Mexico. In 2005, Enola patent was revocated for imprecision of the original request for patenting, and undue heterogeneity of parent and progeny seeds; iv) Revocation of the European patent granted to a process for the preparation of a fungicide from neem extracts. In 1994, the European Patent Office (EPO) patented a fungicide fraction extracted from neem, a tree originating from the Indian peninsula. Neem seed extracts had been used for many centuries in India, mainly as medicine, cosmetics, and control agents against fungi or insects. The patent, which had been granted jointly to Grace C degrees (New York) and to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), was challenged by a consortium of three ladies: a Belgian representative to the European parliament, together with an Indian NGO activist and an American NGO activist. In 2000, EPO revocated the patent for lack of inventivity, but the US government, together with Grace C degrees, called for appeal. Five years later, on march 8, 2005, the patent was made irrevocably void. The appeal body of EPO stated that patenting was denied to items previously known, including through local tradition. It should be noted that, during ten years, the neem marked had been in trouble as the result of the patent, thus inflicting indirect damage to the traditional users of neem extracts. It is concluded that patentability of living items should be clarified by including protection of intellectual property rights within the concept of bionomy, which covers the highly complex components interacting in biosphere governance. The mere application of regular patent rules to biological items in a climate of con-imoditization, resulted in undue patent delivery, which had either to be revocated (yellow-seed bean variety, fungicidal neem extracts), or to be retracted under political and ethical pressure (sequencing the human genome). Patent infrigment in open-field agriculture revealed very complex interactions, with split evaluation by judges in Court. Judiciarisation of this sector should receive due attention, in order to improve the coherence, both operational and legal, in protecting the mixed property rights involved. Time has come to solve the equation expressing relationships between these propert rights, when applied to genes, organisms, or crops within the complexity of open-field agricultural processes.",,,"Semal, J (corresponding author), Residence Echiquier,6 Blvd Dolez,Boite B41, Mons 7000, Belgium.",echiquier.jeansemal@euphonynet.be,,,,,,,14,2,3,3,68,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1166-7699,1777-5949,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

In particular, our approach considers time-coupling constraints which occur in the context of a production-inventory planning problem. We extend this problem with a comprehensive bidding formulation, which allows evaluating revenues and potential cost from the market participation, considering price uncertainties and uncertain activations of committed reserve capacity. This results in a multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear program, which explicitly considers the stage-wise revelation of information in our setup. To illustrate the capabilities of our approach, we apply our model to a real-world case study in which we investigate the participation of a cement plant in the German energy-only and reserve markets.

Here, we present the first evidence of terrestrial summer monsoon wind strength changes from Lake Rara, western Nepal, based on Mn/Ti ratios, a proxy for lake stratification. These data indicate a link between the Arabian Sea and the Himalayas, suggesting that centennial- to millennial-scale changes in wind strength occurred synchronously. Distinct similarity is also observed between Lake Rara and the southern part of China, which may support previous suggestions that the southern part of China is influenced by Indian summer monsoon.

This problem has to be addressed in a global environment where resources are constrained and diminishing, while at the same time raising standards of living for a growing population and preventing catastrophic climate change. Recent experience has shown that energy production is increasingly competing with other demands on the same resources, such as commodity chemicals production and food production, and all compete for water as a primary resource. In moving to a sustainable future, radical changes will have to take place in how we produce, transport and utilize energy and commodity chemicals. The solutions will be many and diverse, and highly dependent on geographic location and patterns of consumption. In many respects, chemical engineers, and process systems engineers in particular, are uniquely qualified to address this grand challenge. The design, optimization and operation of a diverse range of novel, highly integrated processes and supply chains is our core competence. Furthermore, process systems engineering tools, techniques and formulations are highly developed and ready to meet this challenge, so the creative application of the best of these will have a tremendous impact. On the other hand, new challenges and applications also spawn new formulations and tools. The purpose of this talk is to use several examples from ongoing projects in the Process Systems Engineering Laboratory at MIT to illustrate how the energy systems engineering challenge is fostering both the creative application of the state-of-the-art and new formulations and tools. Gasification of low-value carbonaceous feedstocks (e.g., coal, lignocellulosic biomass, oil shale, etc.) is a promising route to the polygeneration of electrical power, transportation fuels and chemicals. In order to reduce or even reverse carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, novel processes have to be invented with integrated carbon capture and sequestration. We have recently used PSE tools to invent a novel highefficiency process for power production from coal that almost eliminates the efficiency penalty of carbon capture and sequestration, and dramatically reduces the water consumption of the process. This process should be particularly attractive in water-stressed regions with large coal reserves, such as Northern China and the American West. The notion of polygeneration enables a plant to exploit fluctuations in prices and demands for several products (e.g., electrical power, transportation fuels) on several time scales. However, in this setting it is no longer optimal to design for a single steady state. Therefore, we are developing novel optimization formulations and algorithms for integrated design and operation that yield optimal profitability over a range of price and demand scenarios. The productivity of transportation fuels and chemicals from the aforementioned processes can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of a carbon-free hydrogen source, specifically water splitting using heat and/or electrical power from nuclear and solar sources. Moreover, large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced from current and future hydrogen demands. One of the most promising processes for the production of hydrogen using heat from a nuclear reactor is the sulfur-iodine (SI) thermo-chemical cycle. At the heart of this process is the Bunsen reactor, in which water, sulfur dioxide and iodine are combined to form sulfuric acid and hydrogen iodide. Due to a fortuitous liquid-liquid phase split, the sulfuric acid and hydrogen iodide can be separated and thermally decomposed to generate oxygen and hydrogen, respectively. The key to designing and optimizing this process is accurate thermophysical property models that can predict phase and chemical equilibrium of multi-electrolyte, multi-solvent solutions. This challenge has prompted us to develop a new version of the electrolyte-NRTL model suitable for such solutions, and large-scale optimization techniques to develop self-consistent thermodynamic databases for parameter estimation. In addition, the challenge of fitting binary parameters to such complex phase diagrams required us to propose a new formulation for the parameter estimation problem as a bilevel program; the inner programs determine the stable phase splits by Gibbs free energy minimization, and the outer program minimizes the least squares error. Solution of this formulation requires our recent developments in algorithms for the solution of bilevel programs with nonconvex inner programs. Moreover, this advance has very broad implications for how binary parameters should be fitted to any phase equilibrium data. The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is facilitating the development of novel supply chains that enable the exploitation of remote natural gas combined with carbon capture, sequestration and enhanced oil recovery. The implementation of these supply chains require novel process designs at several stages in the overall supply chain, and a common feature of these processes is the need for heat and power integration between streams at varying temperatures and pressures. This problem is considerably more complex than conventional heat integration, and leads to novel nonconvex optimization formulations that vary temperature and pressure levels simultaneously to find the optimal process design. These formulations have prompted us to develop the novel notion of global optimization of algorithms, in which the process model is evaluated as an algorithm, and the algorithm is relaxed directly in the global optimization procedure. Such advances are making these complex problems tractable within a deterministic global optimization framework. The quest for new sources of oil to meet ever-increasing demand is motivating the development of technologies for oil exploration and production in ultra-deep water (depths of one mile or more). At such depths of water, production facilities have to be located on the seabed and operated remotely. Due to the extreme costs associated with maintenance and repair of subsea production processes, an autonomous process must be designed that is guaranteed to be robust to input disturbances. These guarantees must be provided a priori at the design stage, which is motivating the development new formulations and optimization algorithms for robust process design. Finally, the design and operation of processes for the production of transportation fuels from biomass via fermentation is motivating new dynamic optimization formulations and algorithms. The bioreactor can be modeled using conventional differential equation formulations, but this must be coupled with predictive models of the response of the microorganism(s) to their environment. A common approach to this is a flux balance model that represents the behavior of a microorganism as a linear program ( LP); increasingly, large-scale flux balance models are being constructed from genomic data. The overall model is a system of differential equations with LPs embedded, which can be reformulated as an equivalent complementarity system, a type of hybrid (discrete/continuous) system. This motivates the development of novel simulation and optimization algorithms for such complementarity systems, in particular drawing on ideas and techniques from nonsmooth analysis.","MIT, Proc Syst Engn Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Barton, PI (corresponding author), MIT, Proc Syst Engn Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,0,3,3,0,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1570-7946,,978-0-444-53472-9,COMPUT-AIDED CHEM EN,,,2009,,,,,55,57,,,,,,3,"Engineering, Chemical; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BTP80,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000287727800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to understand how well the flumes reflected the nearby stream ecosystem, we compared species composition of macroinvertebrates and benthic algae between the flumes and the nearby stream from which the flumes were supplied with water. As single stressors, nutrient addition and an increased flow velocity from 1.3 to 2.8 cm s(-1) lead to an increase in the biomass of benthic algae, likely reflecting an improved transfer of nutrients into algal patches. However, the combined effect of flow and nutrient addition was smaller than the sum of both individual effects, likely because an increased biomass also was more susceptible to scouring. We found differences in macroinvertebrate and benthic algal taxon identity and abundance between stream and flumes. Since biodiversity is assumed to stabilize ecological functioning in response to disturbances and variation, we conclude that care should be taken in applying results from small scale experiments to stream ecosystems.","[Baekkelie, Knut Andreas E.; Petrin, Zlatko] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685 Torgard, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Schneider, Susanne C.; Hagman, Camilla H.

Recently, another occurrence of chytridiomycosis was reported in Euproctus platycephalus, the Sardinian brook newt, on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, but without any evidence of fatal disease. We report further evidence of the emergence of Bd on Sardinia and the first evidence of lethal chytridiomycosis outside of Spain. Unusual mortalities of the Tyrrhenian painted frog (Discoglossus sardus) were found at three sites in the Limbara mountains of northern Sardinia. Molecular and histological screens of corpses, frogs, and tadpoles from these sites revealed infection with Bd. Infection and mortality occurred at locations that are unusual in terms of the published habitat requirements of the pathogen. Given the endemicity, the IUCN Red List status of the amphibian species on Sardinia, and the occurrence of infection and mortality caused by chytridiomycosis, there is serious reason for concern for the impact that disease emergence may have on the conservation of the amphibians of the island.","[Bielby, Jon; Clare, Frances C.; Garner, Trenton W.

Moreover, a non-invasive method to analyze MPs, consisting in filtration after water sampling and analysis of the dried filter through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) 2D Imaging, using an FPA detector, was proposed. The non-invasiveness of analytical set-up reduces potential bias and allows subsequent analysis of the filter sample for determination of other classes of contaminants. MPs ranged from 0.0032 to 1.18 particle per m(3) of seawater, with a mean value of 0.17 +/- 034 particle m(-3), showing concentrations lower than those found in the oceans worldwide. MPs included fragments (mean 71.9 +/- 21.6%), fibers (mean 12.7 +/- 14.3%), and others (mean 15.4 +/- 12.8%). The presence of different types of MPs was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, with predominant abundance of polyethylene and polypropylene. The potential environmental impact arising from scientific activities, such as marine activities for scientific purposes, and from the sewage treatment plant, was also evidenced.

Marine mammals such as gray seals rely on extensive blubber layers for insulation and energy storage, making this tissue critical for survival and reproduction. This lipid rich blubber layer also accumulates hazardous fat soluble pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), that can directly impact adipose function or be mobilized during periods of negative energy balance or transferred to offspring to exert further impacts on target tissues or vulnerable life stages. To predict how marine mammals will respond to ecological and anthropogenic stressors, it is necessary to use process-based modelling approaches that integrate environmental inputs, full species life history, and stressor impacts with individual dynamics of energy intake, storage, and utilization. The purpose of this study was to develop a full lifecycle dynamic energy budget and individual based model (DEBIBM) that captured Baltic gray seal physiology and life history, and showcase potential applications of the model to predict population responses to select stressors known to threaten gray seals and other marine mammals around the world. We explore variations of three ecologically important stressors using phenomenological simulations: food limitation, endocrine disrupting chemicals that reduce fertility, and infectious disease. Using our calibrated DEB-IBM for Baltic gray seals, we found that continuous incremental food limitation can be more detrimental to population size than short random events of starvation, and further, that the effect of endocrine disruptors on population growth and structure is delayed due to bioaccumulation, and that communicable diseases significantly decrease population growth even when spillover events are relatively less frequent. One important finding is the delayed effect on population growth rate from some stressors, several years after the exposure period, resulting from a decline in somatic growth, increased age at maturation and decreased fecundity. Such delayed responses are ignored in current models of population viability and can be important in the correct assessment of population extinction risks. The model presented here provides a test bed on which effects of new hazardous substances and different scenarios of future environmental change affecting food availability and/or seal energetic demands can be investigated. Thus, the framework provides a tool for better understanding how diverse environmental stressors affect marine mammal populations and can be used to guide scientifically based management.","[Silva, Willian T.

So far, global carbon budget estimates have implicitly assumed that the transformation and lateral transport of carbon along this aquatic continuum has remained unchanged since pre-industrial times. A synthesis of published work reveals the magnitude of present-day lateral carbon fluxes from land to ocean, and the extent to which human activities have altered these fluxes. We show that anthropogenic perturbation may have increased the flux of carbon to inland waters by as much as 1.0 Pg C yr(-1) since pre-industrial times, mainly owing to enhanced carbon export from soils. Most of this additional carbon input to upstream rivers is either emitted back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4 Pg C yr(-1)) or sequestered in sediments (similar to 0.5 Pg C yr(-1)) along the continuum of freshwater bodies, estuaries and coastal waters, leaving only a perturbation carbon input of similar to 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) to the open ocean. According to our analysis, terrestrial ecosystems store similar to 0.9 Pg C yr(-1) at present, which is in agreement with results from forest inventories but significantly differs from the figure of 1.5 Pg C yr(-1) previously estimated when ignoring changes in lateral carbon fluxes. We suggest that carbon fluxes along the land-ocean aquatic continuum need to be included in global carbon dioxide budgets.","[Regnier, Pierre; Laruelle, Goulven G.; Lauerwald, Ronny; Goossens, Nicolas] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Ciais, Philippe; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] Lab Sci Climat & Environnement, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Mackenzie, Fred T.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gruber, Nicolas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Janssens, Ivan A.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2160 Antwerp, Belgium; [Lauerwald, Ronny; Hartmann, Jens] Inst Biogeochem & Marine Chem, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Andersson, Andreas J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Arndt, Sandra] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Arnosti, Carol] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Borges, Alberto V.] Univ Liege, Chem Oceanog Unit, Inst Phys B5, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Dale, Andrew W.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Gallego-Sala, Angela] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Godderis, Yves] Univ Toulouse 3, Observ Midipyrenees, CNRS, Geosci Environm Toulouse, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Heinze, Christoph] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Heinze, Christoph] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Heinze, Christoph] Uni Res, Uni Bjerknes Ctr, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Ilyina, Tatiana] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Joos, Fortunat; Spahni, Renato] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Joos, Fortunat; Spahni, Renato] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [LaRowe, Douglas E.] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Leifeld, Jens] Agroscope Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Meysman, Filip J.

This study examines transport-related CO2 emissions of TODs in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Individual-level CO2 emissions were calculated for three types of trips (home-based work, home based school, and home-based other non-work) of 31,101 residents living in TOD and non-TOD neighborhoods. Three multi-level models were estimated, one for each trip type, to identify the effects of TODs on CO2 emissions, controlling for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependency of the neighborhoods and other confounding effects. Findings show that TODs have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions for work and school trips, but not for other non-work trips in Dhaka.

Recently reprocessed LIMS data are compared to more recent measurements from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) to place the LIMS measurements in the context of current observations. The amount of NOx (NO + NO2) entering the stratosphere that has been created by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (EPP-NOx) has been quantified for the 1978-1979 and 2002-2003 through 2008-2009 Arctic winters. The NO2 enhancements in the LIMS data are similar to those in MIPAS and ACE-FTS data in the Arctic winters of 2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2006-2007, and 2007-2008. The largest enhancement by far is in 2003-2004 (similar to 2.2 Gmol at 1500 K), which is attributed to a combination of elevated EPP and unusual dynamics that led to strong descent in the upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere in late winter. The enhancements in 2005-2006 and 2008-2009, during which large stratospheric NOx enhancements were caused by a dynamical situation similar to that in 2003-2004, are larger than in all the other years (except 2003-2004) at 3000 K. However, by 2000 K the enhancements in 2005-2006 (2008-2009) are on the same order of magnitude as (smaller than) all other years. These results highlight the importance of the timing of the descent in determining the potential of EPP-NOx for reaching the middle stratosphere.","[Holt, L. A.; Randall, C. E.; Harvey, V.

The discovery of an important Icelandic tephrostratigraphic marker, the Askja-S, in the sedimentary records of both sites significantly extends the known ash dispersal from this Plinian eruption. Bayesian age-depth modelling of available radiocarbon (C-14) data from both sedimentary records allows us to further refine the depositional age of this ultra-distal tephra. In combination with age constraints on the tephra from other well-dated European sites, we produce an updated age for this key tephrostratigraphic marker of 10,824 +/- 97 cal yrs BP (95.4% range). The Askja-S tephra is stratigraphically positioned after the palaeoenvironmental proxy response to the Preboreal Oscillation at both sites. The widespread distribution of this tephra across Europe offers the potential to assess spatio-temporal variability of this climatic signal. The discovery of the Askja-S in lake records from the Southern Carpathians highlights the likelihood of finding other ultra-distal (Icelandic) cryptotephra marker layers within the region. Additionally, given the location of the Carpathian region, it offers the opportunity to further enhance and integrate tephrostratigraphic frameworks of north-western Europe with those of the Mediterranean and Anatolia regions, which will enable a more precise comparison of palaeoenvironmental archives across Europe.

The advance of globalised architectural models in historic villages represents a threat to this architecture. It is therefore necessary that we recognise the characteristics that define the vulnerability of these architectural models and establish tools to facilitate their management and conservation in risk situations. This research aims to develop a methodology that allows for the evaluation of the factors that condition the vulnerability of the vernacular architecture of two historic villages with populations of 2,500 to 50,000 inhabitants within the Amazonas region (Peru): Leymebamba and Chachapoyas. The analysed management model is based on the identification of preserved vernacular buildings and the recording of seven vulnerability variables (construction system, degree of conservation, heritage value, occupation, maintenance, fire vulnerability and structural modifications) according to building units and blocks. The study carried out breaks down the variability presented in the buildings catalogued as vernacular within the evaluated vulnerability contexts. Based on the identified casuistry, a list of key factors is proposed in order to generate guidelines for an urban management plan that articulates the historic value of the buildings and the current needs of the population.","[Arturo Diaz, Guillermo] Natl Univ Toribio Rodriguez Mendoza de Amazonas, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Chachapoyas, Peru; [Ortiz, Rocio; Moreno, Monica; Ortiz, Pilar] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera Km 1, ES-41013 Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Moreno, M (corresponding author), Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera Km 1, ES-41013 Seville, Spain.",mmorfal@upo.es,"Ortiz, Rocio/GLV-0886-2022; Ortiz, Rocio/L-3453-2014; Ortiz, Pilar/ABB-3015-2020","Ortiz, Rocio/0000-0002-0249-8821; Ortiz, Pilar/0000-0002-8547-7531; Moreno-Falcon, Monica/0000-0003-1178-1546","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BIA201564878-R]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [BIA201564878-R]; Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio, Junta de Andalucia [UPO-03]; FENIX (project of Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Programas Estatales de Generacion de Conocimiento y Fortalecimiento Cientifico y Tecnologico del Sistema de I+ D+i) [PID2019-107257RB-I00]; Consejeria de fomento, infraestructuras y ordenacion del territorio de la Junta de Andalucia [UPO. 20-01]; research teams TEP-199; Sanit-ARTE laboratory; State Program for the Promotion of Talent and its Employability in R+D+i of Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain [PTA2019-016882]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)(European CommissionSpanish Government); Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio, Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); FENIX (project of Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Programas Estatales de Generacion de Conocimiento y Fortalecimiento Cientifico y Tecnologico del Sistema de I+ D+i); Consejeria de fomento, infraestructuras y ordenacion del territorio de la Junta de Andalucia; research teams TEP-199; Sanit-ARTE laboratory; State Program for the Promotion of Talent and its Employability in R+D+i of Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain","This study has been carried out thanks to the methodology supported by the projects: Art-Risk (RETOS project of Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER), code: BIA201564878-R (MINECO/FEDER, UE)), Art-Risk cooperacion: Conservacion preventiva frente a rehabilitacion de urgencia del Patrimonio Arquitectonico mediante Investigacion sobre Riesgos y Vulnerabilidad frente al Cambio Climatico, desastres naturales y antropicos (project of Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio, Junta de Andalucia UPO-03), FENIX (project of Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Programas Estatales de Generacion de Conocimiento y Fortalecimiento Cientifico y Tecnologico del Sistema de I+ D+i, code: PID2019-107257RB-I00), Diagnostico y Catalogacion del Patrimonio Arquitectonico Andaluz mediante Analisis de Riesgos y vulnerabilidad (project of Consejeria de fomento, infraestructuras y ordenacion del territorio de la Junta de Andalucia UPO. 20-01),the research teams TEP-199 and Sanit-ARTE laboratory.

The mean mixing ratios of O3, CO, NOy, and daytime NO were 59 ppbv, 149 ppbv, 1.44 ppbv, and 71 pptv, respectively, which (except for NOy) were higher than those measured from a previous campaign in summer 2003, which is consistent with more frequent transport of anthropogenic pollution from central and eastern China in the measurement period of 2006 (55%) than that of 2003 (25%). The abnormally high values of NOy observed in 2003 were suspected to be due to the positive interference from ammonia (NH3) to the particular catalytic converter used in that study. Varied diurnal patterns were observed for the various NOy components. The ozone production efficiencies (Delta O-3/Delta NOz), which were estimated from the slope of the O-3-NOz scatterplot, were 7.7-11.3 for the polluted plumes from central and eastern China. The speciation of reactive nitrogen was investigated for the first time in the remote free troposphere in western China. PAN and particulate NO3- were the most abundant reactive nitrogen species at WLG, with average proportions of 32% and 31%, followed by NOx (24%) and HNO3 (20%). The relatively large contribution of particulate NO3- to NOy was due to the presence of high concentrations of NH3 and crustal particles, which favor the formation of particulate nitrate. An analysis of backward trajectories for the recent 10 years revealed that air masses from central and eastern China dominated the airflow at WLG in summer, suggesting strong impact of anthropogenic forcing on the surface ozone and other trace constituents on the Plateau.","[Xue, L.

During the stable state of 10/1992-06/1995 and 01/2002-12/2004, the KE jet was intense and had a northerly zonal mean path and a well-defined southern recirculation gyre. During the unstable state of 07/1995-12/2001 and 01/2005-present, the KE jet had a reduced eastward transport and a more southerly flow path. Transitions between the two dynamic states are caused by the basin-scale wind-stress curl forcing in the eastern North Pacific related to the Pacific decadal oscillations (PDOs) or the North Pacific Gyre Oscillations (NPGOs). During the positive PDO (or negative NPGO) phase, the intensified Aleutian Low generates negative SSH anomalies in the eastern North Pacific through Ekman divergence. As these wind-induced negative SSH anomalies propagate to the west as baroclinic Rossby waves, they weaken the zonal KE jet and shift its path southward. As its path is pushed southward (similar to 32 degrees N), the deep-reaching KE jet has to ride over the shallow Shatsky Rise, generating localized disturbances that lead to their subsequent development along the KE jet west of the Shatsky Rise. The sequence opposite to that listed above occurs when the PDO (NPGO) changes to its negative (positive) phase. After the KE system transitions from a stable to unstable state, the enhanced eddy interaction is found to strengthen both the southern recirculation gyre and quasi-stationary meanders along the KE's upstream path. This nonlinear eddy interaction is important in determining the amplitude of the observed decadal KE variability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This challenge is exemplified in the Sierra Nevada of California, where proposals to thin vegetation to reduce wildfire risks have been highly controversial, in part because vegetation treatments could adversely affect an imperiled population of the fisher (Martes pennanti) located in the southern Sierra Nevada. The fisher is an uncommon forest carnivore associated with the types of dense, structurally complex forests often targeted for fuel reduction treatments. Vegetation thinning and removal of dead-wood structures would reduce fisher habitat value and remove essential habitat elements used by fishers for resting and denning. However, crown-replacing wildfires also threaten the population's habitat, potentially over much broader areas than the treatments intended to reduce wildfire risks. To investigate the potential relative risks of wildfires and fuels treatments on this isolated fisher population, we coupled three spatial models to simulate the stochastic and interacting effects of wildfires and fuels management on fisher habitat and population size: a spatially dynamic forest succession and disturbance model, a fisher habitat model, and a fisher metapopulation model, which assumed that fisher fecundity and survivorship correlate with habitat quality. We systematically varied fuel treatment rate, treatment intensity, and fire regime, and assessed their relative effects on the modeled fisher population over 60 years. After estimating the number of adult female fishers remaining at the end of each simulation scenario, we compared the immediate negative effects of fuel treatments to the longer-term positive effect of fuel treatment (via reduction of fire hazard) using structural equation modeling. Our simulations suggest that the direct, negative effects of fuel treatments on fisher population size are generally smaller than the indirect, positive effects of fuel treatments, because fuels treatments reduced the probability of large wildfires that can damage and fragment habitat over larger areas. The benefits of fuel treatments varied by elevation and treatment location with the highest net benefits to fisher found at higher elevations and within higher quality fisher habitat. Simulated fire regime also had a large effect with the largest net benefit of fuel treatments occurring when a more severe fire regime was simulated. However, there was large uncertainty in our projections due to stochastic spatial and temporal wildfires dynamic and fisher population dynamics. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of projecting future populations in systems characterized by large, infrequent, stochastic disturbances. Nevertheless, these coupled models offer a useful decision-support system for evaluating the relative effects of alternative management scenarios; and uncertainties can be reduced as additional data accumulate to refine and validate the models.","[Scheller, Robert M.] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Scheller, Robert M.; Spencer, Wayne D.; Rustigian-Romsos, Heather; Syphard, Alexandra D.; Ward, Brendan C.; Strittholt, James R.] Conservat Biol Inst, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA",Portland State University,"Scheller, RM (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, POB 751, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",rmschell@pdx.edu,"Scheller, Robert M/B-3135-2009","Scheller, Robert M/0000-0002-7507-4499; Syphard, Alexandra/0000-0003-3070-0596",Pacific Southwest Region of the USDA Forest Service (Region 5),Pacific Southwest Region of the USDA Forest Service (Region 5),"Funding was provided by Pacific Southwest Region of the USDA Forest Service (Region 5), with guidance and support from Chris Knopp, Diane Macfarlane, Beth Pendleton, and Art Gaffrey.

An AMS-dated Holocene peat sequence in a palaeochannel in a natural depression (the Liereman), flanked by coversand ridges proved to be an exceptional and valuable archive of long-term vegetation dynamics in the Campine (N Belgium). Analyses of microfossils, such as pollen, spores and non-pollen palynomorphs, as well as macrofossils of plants and other organisms have given insight in the vegetation dynamics over the past 11,500 years. Grasslands developed during the Rammelbeek phase of the Preboreal at the expense of the birch woodlands that characterized the Friesland phase of the Preboreal. During the Preboreal the depression was eco-logically diverse with abundant resources for human subsistence, such as permanent fresh water, game and edible plants. However, to date no contemporaneous archaeological sites are known in the area. In the woodlands on the coversand ridges pines became the dominant regional vegetation towards the Boreal. The resulting lowering of ground water levels led to a decrease of the water availability and associated resources for hunter-gatherer societies. Yet, (early) Mesolithic hunter-gatherers settled in the area, however only temporarily. During the Atlantic coniferous forests were succeeded by mixed deciduous woodlands, while the freshwater availability decreased further. This possibly explains the near absence of middle and late Mesolithic sites in the Liereman area. From the Subboreal onward deciduous woodlands opened, probably as a result of human activity. Finally, through deforestation the area in and around the Liereman depression was partly cleared for agricultural purposes during the Subatlantic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Location Sixty-three natural protected areas in Asia, Africa and South and Central America. Methods We defined faunal communities by allocating species to ecological guilds and calculating proportional representation within each guild. Vegetation heterogeneity for each natural protected area was calculated from satellite images. The relationship between these ecospaces was calculated using canonical correlations analysis, redundancy analysis and principal components analysis. We expected that large, herbivorous mammals would be most strongly correlated with open areas. Convergence was tested by independently eliminating the effects of geography and vegetation heterogeneity on the structure of the mammal communities. We expected that vegetation would more strongly structure communities than geographical position. Results We show that the guild structure of communities across habitats is significantly correlated with vegetation heterogeneity. The highest correlation was between small, scansorial-arboreal secondary consumers and heavy tree cover. The first convergence analysis shows American communities distinguished from Asian and African communities; these latter communities show a remarkable convergence in structure. Historical factors only affected the continent whose mammals had experienced a long period of isolation. The second convergence analysis shows that almost all biomes have the same or very similar community structure regardless of continent. Main conclusions Communities from the same environments in different continents showed remarkable convergence. Communities from the same continents only converged when those continents shared a recent geological and biological history. These results suggest that historical and environmental factors are operating over different timescales. This study confirms that environmental reconstructions made on the basis of whole communities will accurately reflect the environment that the community lived in. However, reconstructions made for fossil sites in deep time need to take historical factors into consideration. Small, arboreal and scansorial secondary consumers show the strongest correlation with vegetation, correlating with continuous tree canopy cover. This relationship allows simple reconstructions of the amount of tree cover occurring in a landscape from the proportion of species from the community falling in this ecological guild.","[Louys, Julien; Bishop, Laura C.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Meloro, Carlo; Elton, Sarah] Univ Hull, Funct Morphol & Evolut Unit, Hull York Med Sch, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Ditchfield, Peter] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Sch Archaeol, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Hull; University of York - UK; University of Oxford,"Louys, J (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, James Parsons Bldg, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",j.louys@ljmu.ac.uk,"Meloro, Carlo/U-4527-2019; Louys, Julien/GLN-6714-2022","Meloro, Carlo/0000-0003-0175-1706; Louys, Julien/0000-0001-7539-0689; Bishop, Laura C/0000-0002-4216-8667","Leverhulme Trust [F/00, 754/C]",Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"We thank two anonymous referees and D.

This model is compiled by the Levenberg-Marquardt method for nonlinear multiparameter fitting and parameterized by V-SW, B-Z, SYM-H, and AE. Continuous and smooth magnetic local time dependence controlled mainly by the solar wind-driven convection electric field E-SW is also embedded in this model. Compared with previous empirical models based on our database, this new model improves the forecasting accuracy and capability for the global plasmapause. The diurnal, seasonal, and solar cycle variations of the plasmapause can be captured by the new model. The NSW-GDP model can potentially be used to forecast the global plasmapause shape with upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters and corresponding predicted values of SYM-H and AE and can also be used as input parameters for other inner magnetospheric coupling models, such as dynamic radiation belt and ring current models and even MHD models.","[He, Fei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Earth & Planetary Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao-Xin] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Ctr Space Weather, Key Lab Space Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Rui-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Space Sci Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fok, Mei-Ching] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Katus, Roxanne M.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Math, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Liemohn, Mike W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gallagher, Dennis L.] NASA, Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Huntsville, AL USA; [Nakano, Shinya] Inst Stat Math, Tokyo, Japan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geology & Geophysics, CAS; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Space Science Center, CAS; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Eastern Michigan University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM) - Japan","Zhang, XX (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Ctr Space Weather, Key Lab Space Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xxzhang@cma.gov.cn,"Fok, Mei-Ching/D-1626-2012; Liemohn, Michael/H-8703-2012; He, Fei/AAA-4679-2019","Fok, Mei-Ching/0000-0001-9500-866X; Liemohn, Michael/0000-0002-7039-2631; Nakano, Shin'ya/0000-0003-0772-4610; HE, Fei/0000-0003-0542-2686","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41274147, 41674155]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2017258]; NASA",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The authors sincerely thank the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for provision of the CE-3 EUVC data; NASA/CDAWEB for provision of the ISEE 1 PWI data, DE-A PWI data, Polar PWI data, and IMAGE RPI data; ESA/Cluster Science Archive for provision of the Cluster WHISPER data; Iowa University for the provision of the VAP EMFISIS data available from http://emfisis.physics.uiowa.edu/data/index; the THEMIS team for provision of the THEMIS ESA and EFI data available from http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/index.shtml; JAXA/DARTS for provision of the Akebono PWS data; and T.

These changes are likely to have affected both the composition and diversity of small mammal communities living in agricultural landscapes. In this context, we compared population abundance (expressed as an index of relative abundance), species richness (S), and species diversity (expressed as Shannon and Pielou indexes) of small mammal assemblages (i.e. sub-sets of the entire small mammal community) living in three areas in North-East Italy positioned along a gradient of agricultural land-use intensification (measured with the Landscape Conservation Index). We expected that assemblages would be less diverse and dominated by generalist species where the landscape was more intensely cultivated and where semi-natural habitats were less common. In the three areas, from a total of 4630 trap-nights, 668 individuals were captured with Sherman traps, belonging to four species (Apodemus agrarius, A. flavicollis, A. sylvaticus and Microtus arvalis). The results showed that population abundance, type of species present (but not species richness), and species diversity were affected by agricultural intensification and landscape naturalness. In particular, moving from less natural to more natural landscapes, we observed no effect on richness of species but increasing diversity due to a greater abundance of the more specialist species, such as A. agrarius and, partially, A. flavicollis, the latter only present in the most natural area. Generalist species, namely A. sylvaticus, and those associated with disturbed environments, such as M. arvalis, were instead more abundant in less natural landscapes. When considering population abundance, the highest overall abundance of small mammals was found in the most disturbed landscape. The results were consistent with those of research carried out in other agroecosystems of Europe and highlight the controversial effect of the anthropogenic impact on small mammal assemblages, since a decrease in species diversity may be associated with an increased overall population abundance, due to the success of few generalist species.","[Gentili, Stefania; Sigura, Maurizia] Univ Udine, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Bonesi, Laura] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England",University of Udine; University of Cambridge,"Gentili, S (corresponding author), Univ Udine, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Sci 208, I-33100 Udine, Italy.",ste.g@virgilio.it,"Gentili, Stefania/AAR-6653-2020","Gentili, Stefania/0000-0002-7740-7883; Bonesi, Laura/0000-0003-3351-3892; SIGURA, MAURIZIA/0000-0003-4531-2721",Friuli Venezia Giulia region (MULTIFARM project) [L.R. 26/05],Friuli Venezia Giulia region (MULTIFARM project),"We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers and to the editorial lean) who helped to improve our manuscript.

A cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) counter is used to examine the relative growth rates of cloud droplets for case studies from field measurements on the North Pacific Ocean and in a coniferous forest. A model of the condensational growth of water droplets, on particles dissolving according to their solubility in water, is used to simulate the initial scattering of the droplets as they grow in the CCN counter. Simulations of the growth rates of fine particles sampled in the marine boundary layer of the North Pacific Ocean shows no evidence of natural marine organic material contributing to the CCN water uptake but there is an indication of an influence from organics from diesel ship emissions on the size distribution of sulphate and the ability of these particles to act as CCN. Simulations of the observations of water uptake on biogenic organic aerosol particles sampled in a coniferous forest indicate an impact of the organic on the water uptake rates, but one that is still smaller than that of pure sulphate. The existence of organics becomes important in determining the water uptake as the organic mass increases relative to sulphate. The values of the organic component of the hygroscopicity parameter kappa that describes the CCN activity were found to be negligible for the marine particles and 0.02-0.05 for the forest particles.","[Shantz, N.

The main objectives of the current study were to (i) combine and standardize recently performed trawl survey with historical ones, (ii) explore and discuss the trends in abundance, and (iii) the trends in maximum length (L-max) for cod (Gadus morhua) and flounder (Platichthys flesus) stocks in the Baltic Sea. Standardization of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) from trawl surveys from 1978 to 2014 to swept area per unit of time was conducted using information on trawling speed and horizontal opening of the trawls. CPUE data for cod and flounder stocks were modelled using generalized additive models (GAMs) in a delta modelling approach framework, while the L-max data were modelled using ordinary GAMs. The CPUE time series of the Eastern Baltic cod stock closely resembles the spawning stock biomass trend from analytical stock assessment. The results obtained furnish evidence of the cod spill-over from Subdivisions (SD) 25-28 to SD 24. The decline of L-max in recent years was evident for both species in all the stocks analysed indicating that the demersal fish community is becoming progressively dominated by small individuals. It is concluded that the standardization of long time series of fisheries-independent data constitutes a powerful tool that could help improve our knowledge on the dynamics of fished populations, thus promoting a long-term sustainable use of these marine resources.","[Orio, Alessandro; Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Florin, Ann-Britt; Bergstrom, Ulf] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Skolgatan 6, S-74242 Oregrund, Sweden; [Sics, Ivo; Baranova, Tatjana] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm BIOR, Dept Fish Resources, Lejupes St 3, LV-1076 Riga, Latvia","Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health & Environment BIOR","Orio, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden.",alessandro.orio@slu.se,"Orio, Alessandro/O-4136-2019","Orio, Alessandro/0000-0002-5566-6139; Bergstrom, Ulf/0000-0002-5478-0634; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236",BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - EU; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden); BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - State Education Development Agency (Latvia),BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - EU; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - Swedish Research Council Formas (Sweden); BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - State Education Development Agency (Latvia),"We thank Valerio Bartolino for his valuable comments on the modelling.

The unique aspects of much of the calibration data provide considerable modeling challenges and require a made-to-measure approach to curve construction that accurately represents and adapts to these individualities, bringing the data together into a single curve. For IntCal20, the statistical methodology has undergone a complete redesign, from the random walk used in IntCal04, IntCal09 and IntCal13, to an approach based upon Bayesian splines with errors-in-variables. The new spline approach is still fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) but offers considerable advantages over the previous random walk, including faster and more reliable curve construction together with greatly increased flexibility and detail in modeling choices. This paper describes the new methodology together with the tailored modifications required to integrate the various datasets. For an end-user, the key changes include the recognition and estimation of potential over-dispersion in C-14 determinations, and its consequences on calibration which we address through the provision of predictive intervals on the curve; improvements to the modeling of rapid C-14 excursions and reservoir ages/dead carbon fractions; and modifications made to, hopefully, ensure better mixing of the MCMC which consequently increase confidence in the estimated curve.","[Heaton, Timothy J.; Blackwell, Paul G.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England; [Blaauw, Maarten; Reimer, Paula J.] Queens Univ Belfast, 14CHRONO Ctr Climate Environm & Chronol, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, 1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Scott, E.

While AMF have been shown to have a role in soil nitrogen (N) cycling, it is unclear whether AMF affect N cycling microbes such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), which convert ammonium into nitrite in the first step of nitrification. In this study, we examined the effects of AMF on AOA and AOB abundances within the corn rhizosphere and bulk soil of conventional (corn-soybean rotation with inorganic fertilizer) and diversified (corn-soybean-oats/alfalfa-oats rotation with composted manure) systems. We hypothesized that AMF would decrease AOA and AOB abundances in a cropping-system dependent manner, possibly due to competition for ammonium. We grew corn deficient or proficient in AMF symbiosis in microcosms for 10 weeks. At the end of the experiment, both soils planted with the AMF-proficient corn genotype had higher ammonium and lower nitrate pool sizes compared to the same soils planted with the AMF-deficient corn genotype. Likewise, total plant N was higher in the AMF-proficient genotype compared to the AMF-deficient genotype. Despite changes in soil inorganic N pool sizes, AOA and AOB abundances were unaffected by plant AMF-proficiency. Instead, AOA abundance was greater in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil regardless of cropping system, and AOB abundance was greater in the conventional than the diversified cropping system soil regardless of proximity to the root. These data indicate that 1) AMF did not affect AOA or AOB abundance in these N-rich soils but other factors such as root proximity and inorganic fertilization did and 2) AOA and AOB have differing ecological niches within rhizosphere and bulk soil that should be considered when managing for nitrogen losses.","[Wattenburger, Cassandra J.; Halverson, Larry] Iowa State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Gutknecht, Jessica] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Zhang, Quan; Brutnell, Thomas] Donald Danforth Plant Sci Ctr, St Louis, MO 63132 USA; [Hofmockel, Kirsten] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Environm Mol Sci Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Hofmockel, Kirsten] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Donald Danforth Plant Science Center; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Iowa State University,"Hofmockel, K (corresponding author), 3335 Innovat Blvd, Richland, WA 99354 USA.;Halverson, L (corresponding author), 1344 ATRB,2213 Pammel Dr, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",kirsten.hofmockel@pnnl.gov; larryh@iastate.edu,"Gutknecht, Jessica/AAI-3682-2021","Hofmockel, Kirsten/0000-0003-1586-2167; Halverson, Larry/0000-0002-9164-8691",United States Department of Agriculture [2014-67019-21628]; University of Minnesota,United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System),"This work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture [grant number 2014-67019-21628] and University of Minnesota internal funding.

However, the sometimes intensive processes used by resource-based industries and their associated infrastructure have significantly altered the region, creating concerns over the future socio-ecological health of the boreal zone. Addressing these concerns will require industries reliant on natural resources from the boreal zone to innovate their processes, management, and infrastructure to improve extraction efficiency while contributing to society's increasing expectations related to sustainability. Here, we explore past, current, and future trends in industrial innovation and infrastructure in the boreal zone for forestry, mining, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and renewable sources of power generation. We assess the role of innovation on the future socio-ecological state of the boreal zone by considering interactions between innovation in industry and infrastructure and other key drivers of change in the boreal, such as atmospheric changes, changing demands for nonprovisioning and provisioning ecosystem services, governance, and demographics and social values. We present future scenarios highlighting three divergent trajectories of change in boreal ecosystems based on past and current states of innovation in industry and infrastructure. We suggest that minimizing impacts of natural resource extraction activities in the boreal zone will only be possible through innovation directly focused on reducing the human footprint on the landscape. Innovation in the information technology sector related to process, management, and end products within these industries and placing greater emphasis on cross-sectoral collaboration will be key to achieving this goal.","[Musetta-Lambert, Jordan L.; Sibley, Paul K.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Enanga, Eric M.; Teichert, Sonja; Creed, Irena F.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5K7, Canada; [Creed, Irena F.] Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada; [Kidd, Karen A.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Kidd, Karen A.] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Kreutzweiser, David P.] Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada",University of Guelph; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Saskatchewan; McMaster University; McMaster University; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Musetta-Lambert, JL (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jmusetta@uoguelph.ca,"Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020","Kidd, Karen A/0000-0002-5619-1358",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canadian Network of Aquatic Ecosystem Services (CNAES); Stephen A.

The number of dead birds (2007: 125; 2015: 110) composed 5-10% of the total colony. In 2015, we collected 15 (12 adult females, three subadult males) of the 110 recently deceased Common Eiders for detailed autopsy. The average body mass of the females was 1,040 g (920-1,160 g) which is ca 60% lower than what can be expected of healthy females during wintertime. Similarly, for the subadult males the average body mass of 1,203 g (1,070-1,300 g) comprised only 45% of what can be expected for healthy subadult males during winter. All 15 birds were thus severely emaciated and cachexic with general atrophy of muscles and internal organs. Hunger oedema, distended gall bladder, empty stomach, empty and dilated intestines and dilated cardiomyopathy were observed as well. In addition, all 15 Common Eiders were infected with high loads of the acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutes. No gross morphological changes suggested toxicological, bacteriological or viral causes to the mortality. Taken together, our autopsy suggested starvation leading to secondary metabolic catabolism and eventually congestive heart failure. Five birds that were examined in 2007 showed the same symptoms. We suspect that the introduction of suboptimal feeding conditions in combination with a high parasite load over the last decade synergistically caused high physiological stress leading to population level effects manifested as high mortality.","[Garbus, Svend-Erik; Eulaers, Igor; Mosbech, Anders; Dietz, Rune; Sonne, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, ARC, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Garbus, Svend-Erik; Christensen, Jens Peter; Buchmann, Kurt] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Vet Dis Biol, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Lyngs, Peter] Christianso Sci Field Stn, Christianso 97, DK-3760 Gudhjem, Denmark; [Gilchrist, H.

Traditional manual irrigation facilities management faces critical limitations, such as delays/losses resulting from data handling errors, and facility misidentification. Therefore, an information system for irrigation facilities management could be more efficient if it includes a wireless sensor network (WSN) that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs). We propose a wireless sensor network application for irrigation facilities management based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and quick response (QR) codes. The system was installed in a pilot site in the I-dong irrigation districts in Gyeonggi, South Korea, and was determined to be beneficial for the inspection of agricultural irrigation facilities in the irrigation districts. Real-time information downloading, collecting field data, and updating the condition of the irrigation facilities in terms of operational conditions and maintenance requirements can improve management. The operation results demonstrated the applicability of the ICTs and WSN to agricultural water management and that it provided good portability, recognition, and information gathering abilities in the field.","[Nam, Won-Ho] Univ Nebraska, Natl Drought Mitigat Ctr, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA; [Nam, Won-Ho] Hankyong Natl Univ, Dept Bioresources & Rural Syst Engn, Anseong, South Korea; [Nam, Won-Ho] Hankyong Natl Univ, Inst Agr Environm Sci, Anseong, South Korea; [Kim, Taegon] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Hong, Eun-Mi] USDA ARS, Beltsville Agr Res Ctr, Environm Microbial & Food Safety Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Hong, Eun-Mi] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Engn, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Choi, Jin-Yong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Rural Syst Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Jin-Yong] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jin-Taek] Korea Rural Community Corp, Rural Res Inst, Gyeonggi, South Korea",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Hankyong National University; Hankyong National University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Rural Community Corporation,"Kim, T (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",taegon.k@gmail.com,"Kim, Taegon/J-4257-2013; NAM, WONHO/B-3489-2014","Kim, Taegon/0000-0002-7931-6627; NAM, WONHO/0000-0002-9671-6569","Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (IPET) through Advanced Production Technology Development Program - Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) [316022-03-1-HD040]","Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (IPET) through Advanced Production Technology Development Program - Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA)","This research was supported by Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (IPET) through Advanced Production Technology Development Program, funded by Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) (316022-03-1-HD040).

To plan the location of such tile drain measures, it is important to know where in the landscape drain flow is generated and to understand the key factors governing drain flow dynamics. In the present study, we test two approaches to assess spatial patterns in drain flow generation and thereby assess the importance of including geological information. The approaches are the widely used topographical wetness index (TWI), based solely on elevation data, and hydrological models that include the subsurface geology. We set-up an ensemble of 20 hydrological models based on 20 stochastically generated geological models to predict drain flow dynamics in the clay till Norsminde catchment in Denmark and test the results against TWI. We find that the hydrological models predict observed daily drain flow reasonably well. High drain flow volumes were found in stream valleys and in wetlands and lower drain flow volumes in the more hilly parts of the catchment. In spite of the apparent connection to the landscape, there was no statistically significant correlation between TWI and drain flow at grid scale (100 x 100 m). TWI was therefore not found to be a sufficient index on its own to assess where drain flow is generated, especially in the highlands of the catchment. The geology below 3 m was found to have a large impact on the drain flow, and correlations between sand percentage in the subsurface geology and drain flow volume were found to be statistically significant. Geological uncertainty therefore give rise to uncertainty on simulated drain flow, and this uncertainty was found to be high at the model grid scale but decreasing with increasing scale.","[Hansen, Anne Lausten; He, Xin; Hojberg, Anker Lajer; Refsgaard, Jens Christian] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Hydrol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Storgaard, Anne] Niras AS, Dept Environm, Allerod, Denmark; [He, Xin] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Iversen, Bo Vangso; Kjaergaard, Charlotte] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Tjele, Denmark; [Hansen, Anne Lausten] LandboSyd, Dept Crop Prod & Environm, Aabenraa, Denmark; [Kjaergaard, Charlotte] SEGES, Dept Construct & Environm, Aarhus, Denmark; [Hansen, Anne Lausten] LandboSyd, Jens Terp Nielsens Vej 13, DK-6200 Aabenraa, Denmark; [Kjaergaard, Charlotte] SEGES, Agro Food Pk 15, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark",Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland; Southern University of Science & Technology; Aarhus University,"Hansen, AL (corresponding author), LandboSyd, Dept Plant Prod & Environm, Jens Terp Nielsens Vej 13, DK-6200 Aabenraa, Denmark.;Hansen, AL (corresponding author), LandboSyd, Jens Terp Nielsens Vej 13, DK-6200 Aabenraa, Denmark.",alh@landbosyd.dk,"Refsgaard, Jens Christian/G-5274-2011; Iversen, Bo Vangsø/N-7968-2019; He, Xin/C-9863-2015; Højberg, Anker Lajer/AAE-1670-2019; Hansen, Anne Lausten/B-4865-2018","Refsgaard, Jens Christian/0000-0003-0420-349X; Iversen, Bo Vangsø/0000-0002-2276-0233; He, Xin/0000-0002-5618-1774; Højberg, Anker Lajer/0000-0003-3460-6046; Kjaergaard, Charlotte/0000-0002-9134-8293; Hansen, Anne Lausten/0000-0002-7032-4188","Innovation Fund Denmark [4106-00027B]; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme from EU's Seventh Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration [185]; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme from Innovation Fund Denmark [185]; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Polish National Centre for Research and Development; German Ministry for Education and Research; Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)","Innovation Fund Denmark; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme from EU's Seventh Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme from Innovation Fund Denmark; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Polish National Centre for Research and Development; German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR))","This work was carried out as part of the TReNDS project (Transport and Reduction of Nitrate in Danish landscapes at various Scales www.nitrat.dk) and the BONUS SOILS2SEA project (www.soils2sea.eu).

Their discovery leads to an assessment of their introduction status and invasive risk. Several evaluations were conducted on the plants regarding their extent, taxonomy, reproductive status and invasive potential. It is possible that the two species were accidentally introduced by human activities due to their proximity to human-frequented sites. No further occurrences were found, indicating that although the species were established, they were, respectively, restricted to two small swards of less than 1 m(2) each. Observations of floral development in the field at the end of summer suggested that no sexually reproductive material was produced. Indoor cultivation of sampled specimens at the island station showed a faster development with mature flowers at the end of the summer but still no seeds. The bioclimatic niches of the two species were modeled with MaxEnt software. Biomodeling results indicate that reasonably favorable habitat is available on Macquarie Island for the successful colonization of both species. Agrostis stolonifera showed a higher invasion risk than A. capillaris. Our observations indicate that the two species are strong candidates for invading the island despite having phenological constraints. As a result, the two swards were removed by the island's management authority. Further introductions and establishment of non-native plant species are expected to occur on sub-Antarctic islands under current global change scenarios.","[Pertierra, Luis R.; Vega, Greta C.; Olalla-Tarraga, Miguel A.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Baker, Matthew] Tasmanian Museum & Art Gallery, Tasmanian Herbarium, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Howard, Chris] Tasmanian Pk & Wildlife Serv, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Scott, Jenny] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Tasmania,"Pertierra, LR (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain.",luis.pertierra@gmail.com; matthew.baker@tmag.tas.gov.au; chris.howard@parks.tas.gov.au; greta.vega@urjc.es; miguel.olalla@urjc.es; jenny.scott@utas.edu.au,"Pertierra, Luis R./K-3727-2017; Olalla-Tárraga, Miguel Ángel/ABE-7880-2020; Vega, Greta Carrete/E-8666-2016","Pertierra, Luis R./0000-0002-2232-428X; Olalla-Tárraga, Miguel Ángel/0000-0001-5346-4528; Vega, Greta Carrete/0000-0001-5115-0146",SCAR-COMNAP Fellowship (Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs) by University of New England (UNE) project [AAC 4158]; ALIENANT project granted by the Spanish MINECO (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) I+D Programme [CTM2013-47381],SCAR-COMNAP Fellowship (Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs) by University of New England (UNE) project; ALIENANT project granted by the Spanish MINECO (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) I+D Programme,"The authors thank the Australian Antarctic Division, especially the staff involved in the logistics of the 2013-14 summer field season on Macquarie Island.

We assessed the photosynthetic rate, leaf water content and antioxidative enzyme activity (APX, GPX, SOD and CAT) of three Greek olive cultivars ('Amfisis', 'Mastoidis' and 'Lefkolia Serron') subjected to drought and salinity stresses. Hyperspectral reflectance data were acquired using an analytical spectral device (ASD) FieldSpec(R) 3 spectroradiometer, while principal component regression, partial least squares regression and linear discriminant analysis were used to estimate the relationship between spectral and physiological measurements. The photosynthetic rate and water content of stressed plants decreased, while enzyme activity had an increasing tendency. 'Amfisis' was more resistant to drought and salinity stress than 'Mastoidis' and 'Lefkolia Serron'. The NDVI appeared to have the highest correlation with the photosynthetic rate, followed by the PRI. APX enzyme activity was the most highly correlated with the 1150-1370 nm range, with an additional peak at 1840 nm. CAT enzyme activity resulted in the highest correlation with the visible part of the spectrum with two peaks at 1480 nm and 1950 nm, while GPX enzyme activity appeared to have a strong correlation within all the available spectral ranges except for 670-1180 nm. Finally, SOD activity showed high correlation values within 1190-1850 nm. This is the first time the correlation of hyperspectral imagery with photosynthetic rate and antioxidant enzyme activities was determined, providing the background for high-throughput plant phenotyping through a drone with a hyperspectral camera. This progress would provide the possibility of early stress detection in large olive groves and assist farmers in decision making and optimizing crop management, health and productivity.","[Boshkovski, Blagoja; Zapolska, Anhelina; Kalaitzidis, Chariton] Mediterranean Agron Inst Chania, Dept Geoinformat Environm Management, Khania 73100, Greece; [Doupis, Georgios; Koubouris, Georgios] Inst Olive Tree Subtrop Crops & Viticulture, ELGO DIMITRA, Leoforos Karamanli 167, Khania 73134, Greece",CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Chania,"Koubouris, G (corresponding author), Inst Olive Tree Subtrop Crops & Viticulture, ELGO DIMITRA, Leoforos Karamanli 167, Khania 73134, Greece.",bobiboshkovski@gmail.com; doupis@elgo.iosv.gr; zapolskaya_a@mail.ru; chariton@maich.gr; koubouris@elgo.iosv.gr,"Koubouris, Georgios C/T-3906-2018","Koubouris, Georgios C/0000-0002-0079-8900; Kalaitzidis, Chariton/0000-0001-5217-7164; Zapolska, Anhelina/0000-0002-8045-8016","Greek national funds through the Action `Establishment of a National Research Network in the Olive Value Chain' of GSRT [2018SE01300000]; General Secretariat for Research and Innovation of the Ministry of Development and Investments under the PRIMA Programme (Horizon 2020, the European Union's Programme for Research and Innovation); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [101000427]","Greek national funds through the Action `Establishment of a National Research Network in the Olive Value Chain' of GSRT; General Secretariat for Research and Innovation of the Ministry of Development and Investments under the PRIMA Programme (Horizon 2020, the European Union's Programme for Research and Innovation); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","This research project was partially financed by (i) Greek national funds through the Action `Establishment of a National Research Network in the Olive Value Chain', code 2018SE01300000 of GSRT; (ii) the General Secretariat for Research and Innovation of the Ministry of Development and Investments under the PRIMA Programme for the project Freeclimb (PRIMA is an Art.185 initiative supported and co-funded under Horizon 2020, the European Union's Programme for Research and Innovation); and (iii) the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101000427 for the project Gen4Olive.",,60,5,5,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,1432,10.3390/su14031432,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031432,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YY9FK,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000755090500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous root symbionts in many terrestrial ecosystems and account for a large fraction of photosynthate in a wide range of ecosystems; they therefore play a key role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. A large part of the fungal mycelium is outside the root ( the extraradical mycelium, ERM) and, because of the dispersed growth pattern and the small diameter of the hyphae (<5 micrometers), exceptionally difficult to study quantitatively. Critically, the longevity of these. ne hyphae has never been measured, although it is assumed to be short. To quantify carbon turnover in these hyphae, we exposed mycorrhizal plants to fossil (carbon-14 - dead) carbon dioxide and collected samples of ERM hyphae ( up to 116 micrograms) over the following 29 days. Analyses of their carbon-14 content by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) showed that most ERM hyphae of AM fungi live, on average, 5 to 6 days. This high turnover rate reveals a large and rapid mycorrhizal pathway of carbon in the soil carbon cycle.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Univ Oxford, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford OX1 3QJ, England; Inst Terr Ecol, Merlewood Res Stn, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Grange Over Sands LA11 6JU, Cumbria, England",University of York - UK; University of Oxford; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Staddon, PL (corresponding author), Riso Natl Lab, Plant Res Dept, Bldg 313,Postbox 49, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",,"Ostle, Nick J/K-6891-2012; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/A-3277-2012; Ostle, Nicholas J/E-4847-2014; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/AAQ-2227-2021","Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Ostle, Nicholas J/0000-0003-3263-3702; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309",,,,,27,270,292,12,178,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,16-May,2003,5622,,,,1138,1140,,10.1126/science.1084269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1084269,,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,678VC,12750519,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000182886500043,View Full Record in Web of Science

By the end of the Late Pleistocene, our species was distributed across every continent except Antarctica, setting the foundations for the subsequent demographic and cultural changes of the Holocene. The intervening processes remain intensely debated and a key theme in hominin evolutionary studies. We review archeological, fossil, environmental, and genetic data to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the dispersal of Homo sapiens out of Africa. The emerging picture of the dispersal process suggests dynamic behavioral variability, complex interactions between populations, and an intricate genetic and cultural legacy. This evolutionary and historical complexity challenges simple narratives and suggests that hybrid models and the testing of explicit hypotheses are required to understand the expansion of Homo sapiens into Eurasia.","[Groucutt, Huw S.; Petraglia, Michael D.; Scerri, Eleanor M.

This study utilizes 5 years of fully three-dimensional beach surveys at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach (SE Australia) to quantify the control of alongshore nonuniform wave exposure and cross-shore processes on embayed beach rotation. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of the alongshore variability in subaerial beach volume/width and berm slope confirms that the dominant mode of subaerial beach variability is an onshore/offshore sediment exchange that is strongly controlled (R> 0.8) by the alongshore gradient in breaker wave height and coincides with a uniform flattening/steepening of the berm slope. A secondary rotation-like signal is observed in both the subaerial beach volume/width data and, significantly, the berm slope. This inverse flattening/steepening of the berm slope between beach extremities is most likely a proxy for differing cross-shore processes within the surf zone between the exposed and sheltered ends of the embayment, particularly with regards to dissipation of storm wave energy by offshore sandbars and beach recovery following storms. Analysis of the corresponding wave data reveals two distinct time scales of wave forcing characteristic of short-term erosion and longer-term recovery processes. A new conceptual model is presented of three differing modes of embayed beach rotation, with the newly identified beach rotation mode controlled by offshore sandbars considered of particular importance at embayments where headland sheltering of oblique waves is pronounced.","[Harley, M.

RESET examined the chronological and correlation methods employed to establish causal links between the timing of abrupt environmental transitions (AETs) on the one hand, and of human dispersal and development on the other, with a focus on the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic periods. The period of interest is the Last Glacial cycle and the early Holocene (c. 100-8 ka), during which time a number of pronounced AETs occurred. A long-running topic of debate is the degree to which human history in Europe and the Mediterranean region during the Palaeolithic was shaped by these AETs, but this has proved difficult to assess because of poor dating control. In an attempt to move the science forward, RESET examined the potential that tephra isochrons, and in particular non-visible ash layers (cryptotephras), might offer for synchronising palaeo-records with a greater degree of finesse. New tephrostratigraphical data generated by the project augment previously-established tephra frameworks for the region, and underpin a more evolved tephra 'lattice' that links palaeo-records between Greenland, the European mainland, sub-marine sequences in the Mediterranean and North Africa. The paper also outlines the significance of other contributions to this special volume; collectively, these illustrate how the lattice was constructed, how it links with cognate tephra research in Europe and elsewhere, and how the evidence of tephra isochrons is beginning to challenge long-held views about the impacts of environmental change on humans during the Palaeolithic.

A critical need in conservation biology is to determine which species are most vulnerable to extinction. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionacea) are one of the most imperilled faunal groups globally. Freshwater mussel larvae are ectoparasites on fish and depend on the movement of their hosts to maintain connectivity among local populations in a metapopulation. 2. I calculated local colonisation and extinction rates for 16 mussel species from 14 local populations in the Red River drainage of Oklahoma and Texas, U.S. I used general linear models and AIC comparisons to determine which mussel life history traits best predicted local colonisation and extinction rates. 3. Traits related to larval dispersal ability (host infection mode, whether a mussel species was a host generalist or specialist) were the best predictors of local colonisation. 4. Traits related to local population size (regional abundance, time spent brooding) were the best predictors of local extinction. The group of fish species used as hosts by mussels also predicted local extinction and was probably related to habitat fragmentation and host dispersal abilities. 5. Overall, local extinction rates exceeded local colonisation rates, indicating that local populations are becoming increasingly isolated and suffering an 'extinction debt'. This study demonstrates that analysis of species traits can be used to predict local colonisation and extinction patterns and provide insight into the long-term persistence of populations.","[Vaughn, Caryn C.] Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Vaughn, Caryn C.] Univ Oklahoma, Grad Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Vaughn, CC (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",cvaughn@ou.edu,"Vaughn, Caryn C/D-8534-2011",,"National Science Foundation [DEB-9306687, DEB-9870092]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank Chris Barnhart, Art Bogan, Dan Graf, Bill Matthews, Tom Watters and David Zanatta for providing information on mussel and/or fish life history traits and habits; Dan Allen, Carla Atkinson, Dan Graf, Pascal Irmscher, Edie Marsh-Matthews, Dan Spooner, David Strayer and especially Wendell Haag for helpful comments on versions of the manuscript; Matt Craig, Kelly Eberhard, Mark Pyron, Chris Taylor and Matt Winston for field assistance; Jeff Kelly for advice on metapopulation models; Michael Patten for assistance with AIC model comparison; Andy Vaughn for drafting Fig. 1; and the National Science Foundation (DEB-9306687, DEB-9870092) for funding.

All counts of cryptotephra shards are presented, but we focus on two prominent peaks of dark coloured glass shards representing, distinct cryptotephras within the sediments of Lake Keilambete, Victoria, southeast Australia. These two basaltic cryptotephras, aged 4589-3826 cal BP and 7149-5897 cal BP, may have derived from eruptions of Mts Gambier or Schank, South Australia. In addition, colourless shards, most likely of silicic composition and therefore unlikely to emanate from an Australian volcano were observed, suggesting a distant volcanic source beyond Australia. The presence of both the 'local' basaltic shards and the distal silicic shards highlights the potential to identify isochronous marker horizons in southern Australian sediments, thus potentially enabling a long-term goal of establishing a novel chronostratigraphic tool based on a cryptotephra network.

Our approach combines a single aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocol for equivalent dose (D(e)) estimation on fine silt-sized quartz with a time-dependent evaluation of supported and unsupported long-lived radioisotopes within the deposited sediment matrix. For this purpose nine samples from two independently dated deep-sea cores from the Indian Ocean were obtained. The SAR analysis resulted in mean D(e) estimates with precisions ranging from 0.9% to 3.7%. Combination of these data with measured radioisotope concentrations resulted in stratigraphically sensible ages ranging from ca 7 to 120 ka. These ages exhibit good agreement with existing chronologies for the cores based on radiocarbon age determinations and correlation of key volcanic, palaeoecological and isotopic events. Optical dating may provide an important additional dating method for Late Quaternary deep-sea sediments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Well-designed streets encourage walking behaviour and attract public activities, thus advancing the sustainability of a city as a whole. Currently, most quantificational analyses of street quality are based on two dimensional maps, using network algorithms and economic theories to calculate accessibility and land value or to account for a series of elements such as number of trees and number of courtyards in order to audit quality scores. The analysis from three dimensional models and human-centred views is rarely utilized but could offer new possibilities to provide urban planners and designers with analytical feedback on the built environment and design process. This research explores ways to relate physical features with walking behaviour using Reid Ewing's Urban Design Tool to measure the street quality for walkability. It applies physical metrics from measuring parameters in 3D models based on the human's perspective and other building metrics from GIS data online to systematically audit street walkability. To validate this method, we take two separate studies. One is a case study to evaluate the street walkability of two districts in NYC from their 3D models and GIS data and to visualize the scores. The result from digital models and real environment are similar which indicates the feasibility of applying this method in urban scale. The other is a pilot study asking a group of students (N = 8) to evaluate street walkability of 3D models, telling them the scores calculated by this method, to explore how the scores influence their evaluations. This study illustrates the possibility to quantify the evaluation of street quality for walkability using Urban Design Tool in 3D models to inform urban designer's evaluation in street scale during the design process.","[Zhu, W.; Hua, Y.] Cornell Univ, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Design & Environm Anal, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Dogan, T.] Cornell Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, Dept Architecture, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Zhu, W (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Design & Environm Anal, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",wz334@cornell.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,2,10,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

However, such depth interval varies depending on sunlight penetration, which is primarily a function of solar radiation incidence and water clarity. This is especially obvious in the Mediterranean Sea with its peculiar biophysical properties. Integrating information on light regime in the estimation of the bathymetric range of the mesophotic zone would provide a more robust definition, orienting conservation actions targeting its ecosystems. We present a first assessment of the spatial and vertical extension of the mesophotic zone in the Mediterranean Sea based upon light penetration, comparing our prediction with literature data. Our study also represents a baseline to monitor future variations in the bathymetric interval associated with the mesophotic zone in the Mediterranean Sea in relation to global changes.","[Castellan, Giorgio; Angeletti, L.; Taviani, M.] Natl Res Council CNR ISMAR, Inst Marine Sci, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Castellan, Giorgio] Univ Bologna, Dept Cultural Heritage, Via Ariani 1, I-48121 Ravenna, Italy; [Montagna, P.] Natl Res Council CNR ISP, Inst Polar Sci, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Montagna, P.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Taviani, M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Taviani, M.] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); University of Bologna; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Polari (ISP-CNR); Columbia University; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli,"Castellan, G (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR ISMAR, Inst Marine Sci, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.;Castellan, G (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Cultural Heritage, Via Ariani 1, I-48121 Ravenna, Italy.",giorgio.castellan@bo.ismar.cnr.it,"Castellan, Giorgio/ABC-3340-2020","Castellan, Giorgio/0000-0001-6084-1504",Convenzione MATTMCNR per i Programmi di Monitoraggio per la Direttiva sulla Strategia Marina (MSFD) [2008/56/CE]; H2020 Project RELIANCE [101017501]; DG Environment programme IDEM [11.0661/2017/750680/SUB/EN V.C2]; MIUR-PRIN 2017 [GLIDE 2017FREXZY]; Ph.D. program in Cultural and Natural Heritage of the University of Bologna,Convenzione MATTMCNR per i Programmi di Monitoraggio per la Direttiva sulla Strategia Marina (MSFD); H2020 Project RELIANCE; DG Environment programme IDEM; MIUR-PRIN 2017; Ph.D. program in Cultural and Natural Heritage of the University of Bologna,"We thank Dr. Enrico Bonatti for reading an early version of the manuscript.

Iani Chaos, located at the head Ares Vallis, is among the most geomorphologically complex of the chaotic terrains. Its morphology is defined by (1) multiple, 1 to 2 km deep basins, (2) flat-topped, fractured plateaus that are remnants of highland terrain, (3) knobby, fractured remnants of highland terrain, (4) plateaus with a knobby surface morphology, (5) interchaos grooved terrain, (6) interior layered deposits (ILDs), and (7) mantling material. Topography, the observed geomorphology, and measured fracture patterns suggest that the interchaos basins formed as a result of subsurface volume loss and collapse of the crust, likely owing to effusion of groundwater to the surface. Regional patterns in fracture orientation indicate that the basins developed along linear zones of preexisting weakness in the highland crust. Multiple overlapping basins and fracture systems point to multiple stages of collapse at Iani Chaos. Furthermore, the total estimated volume loss from the basins (10(4) km(3)) is insufficient to explain erosion of 10(4)-10(5) km(3) of material from Ares Vallis by a single flood. Comparisons with the chronology of Ares Vallis indicate multiple water effusion events from Iani Chaos that span the Hesperian, with termination of activity in the early Amazonian. Recharge of groundwater through preexisting fracture systems may explain this long-lived, but likely episodic, fluvial activity. Late-stage, early to middle Amazonian aqueous processes may have deposited the ILDs. However, the topography data indicate that the ILDs did not form within lacustrine environments.","[Warner, Nicholas H.; Gupta, Sanjeev; McGonigle, Chris] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Kim, Jung-Rack] Ziin Consulting, Seoul, South Korea; [Muller, Jan-Peter; Le Corre, Lucille] Univ Coll London, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Holmbury, England; [Morley, Jeremy] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Geospatial Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Lin, Shih-Yuan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Land Econ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",Imperial College London; University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London; University of Nottingham; National Chengchi University,"Warner, NH (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",n.warner@imperial.ac.uk,"Muller, Jan-Peter/Q-8886-2019; Warner, Nicholas/D-8473-2011","Muller, Jan-Peter/0000-0002-5077-3736; McGonigle, Chris/0000-0002-0262-0559; Le Corre, Lucille/0000-0003-0349-7932; Gupta, Sanjeev/0000-0001-6415-1332","UK STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council) [ST/F003099/1, PP/E002366/1]; Royal Society-Leverhulme Trust; Science and Technology Facilities Council [PP/E002366/1, ST/H00260X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; UK Space Agency [ST/I003118/1, ST/F003099/1] Funding Source: researchfish; STFC [PP/E002366/1, ST/H00260X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); Royal Society-Leverhulme Trust(Royal Society of LondonLeverhulme Trust); Science and Technology Facilities Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); UK Space Agency; STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),"We thank the HRSC PI, Gerhard Neukum (Freie Universitaet Berlin), and the team at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) in Berlin as well as ESA for use of the HRSC data and various preprocessing software.

Four AMS radiocarbon age determinations, the litho-stratigraphic analysis of a lake bed core, and the analysis of subsurface sediment samples from 15 shallow auger holes across the basin document sedimentation patterns during the Holocene. Based on the widespread occurrence of Chara gyrogonite, and several species of ostracoda and gastropoda, the Elmali basin was dominated by lacustrine and palustrine environments but was continually influenced by alluvial fan sedimentation. Contrasting stratigraphy in the Kara Gol and Avlan Golu sub-basins is a result of basin morphology, and possibly hydrologic control by karst features, and sub-basin isolation due to alluvial fan development. The cyclical deposition of marl/lime mud, gyttja, and peat in the Kara Gol core is indicative of periodic fluctuations in water level across a broad shallow basin, whereas the continuous clay record observed at Avlan Golu implies deep-water sedimentation within a plugged former karst collapse feature. Calcareous clay deposited between 14,935 and 11,180 cal yr BP signals the growth and expansion of paleo Lake Elmali, which at its peak during the late Pleistocene, may have inundated over half of the of the 180 km(2) Elmali basin.","[Galicki, Stan J.] Millsaps Coll, Dept Geol, Jackson, MS 39210 USA; [Doerner, James P.] Univ No Colorado, Dept Geog, Greeley, CO 80639 USA",Millsaps College; University of Northern Colorado,"Galicki, SJ (corresponding author), Millsaps Coll, Dept Geol, Jackson, MS 39210 USA.",,,,"Turkish Ministry of Culture, Bilkent University; Associated Colleges of the South; University of Northern Colorado's Faculty Research and Publications Board (FRPB); Sponsored Programs and Academic Research Center (SPARC)","Turkish Ministry of Culture, Bilkent University; Associated Colleges of the South; University of Northern Colorado's Faculty Research and Publications Board (FRPB); Sponsored Programs and Academic Research Center (SPARC)","The Hacimusalar Project was directed by Dr. Ilknur Ozgen of the Department of Archaeology and History of Art, Bilkent University.

The yield of bio-oil decreased as the average biomass particle size was increased from 0.3 to about 1.5 mm. Further increases in biomass particle size did not result in any further decreases in the bio-oil yield. These results are mainly due to the impact of particle size in the production of lignin-derived compounds. Possible inter-particle interactions between bio-oil vapour and char particles or homogeneous reactions in vapour phases were not responsible for the decreases in the bio-oil yield. The bio-oil samples were characterised with thermogravimetric analysis, UV-fluorescence spectroscopy, Karl-Fischer titration as well as precipitation in cold water. It was found that the yields of light bio-oil fractions increased and those of heavy bio-oil fractions decreased with increasing biomass particle size. The formation of pyrolytic water at low temperatures (< 500 degrees C) is not greatly affected by temperature or particle size. It is believed that decreased heating rates experienced by large particles are a major factor responsible for the lower bio-oil yields from large particles and for the changes in the overall composition of resulting oils.

However, environmental decision support systems/tools (henceforth EDSS) are often strongly science driven and assuming single types of decision makers, and hence poorly suited for more decentralized and polycentric decision making contexts. In such contexts, EDSS need to be tailored to meet diverse user requirements to ensure that it provides useful (relevant), usable (intuitive), and exchangeable (institutionally unobstructed) information for decision support for different types of actors. To address these issues, we present a participatory framework for designing EDSS that emphasizes a more complete understanding of the decision making structures and iterative design of the user interface. We illustrate the application of the framework through a case study within the context of water-stressed upstream/downstream communities in Lima, Peru. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Also, it is pertinent that the level of compliance towards environmental regulations is highly dependent on the quality of socioeconomic status of the public and government interventions in terms of annual budgetary allocations in the respective industry or sector. Therefore, the study explores the government's participation through public expenditure in the entertainment and cultural sector and socioeconomic factors in realizing environmental sustainability in OECD countries. The data set consists of observations from 1990 to 2019 on which the advanced panel technique, namely; Cross Section ARDL was applied. The results reported that both the government budgetary allocations in entertainment and cultural industry and socioeconomic status are crucial for ensuring environmental sustainability as they assist in decreasing the level of carbon emissions. Manifestly, the magnitude of the interaction term empirically proves that when both government allocations and socioeconomic factors are integrated, the emissions mitigating effects turn more pronounced. These results imply that the appropriate budgetary allocations in entertainment and cultural industry promotes environmental performance channelized through people's welfare, awareness, and satisfaction. Along with fiscal allocations, socioeconomic factors are imperative to maximize positive spillovers for ecological sustainability.","[Shao, Lu] Xian Polytech Univ, Sch New Media Art, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hao] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Law Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Irfan, Muhammad] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Irfan, Muhammad] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Irfan, Muhammad] ILMA Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan",Xi'an Polytechnic University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Irfan, M (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Irfan, M (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Irfan, M (corresponding author), ILMA Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan.",irfansahar@bit.edu.cn,"Irfan, Muhammad/AAL-9371-2020","Irfan, Muhammad/0000-0003-1446-583X",,,,,68,14,14,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Any sudden disruption can result in debilitating impacts on human life or the economy. In particular, road systems in mountain areas are highly vulnerable, because they often do not feature redundant elements at comparable efficiencies. This paper addresses the impacts of network interruptions caused by landslide events on the (rural) road network system in Vorarlberg, Austria. Based on a landslide susceptibility map we demonstrate the performance of agent-based traffic modelling using disaggregated agent data. This allows us to gain comprehensive insights into the impacts of road network interruptions on the mobility behaviour of affected people. Choosing an agent-based activity-chain model enables us to integrate the individual behavioural decision-making processes into the traffic flow model. The detailed representation of individual agents in the transport model allows optimisation of certain characteristics of agents and including their social learning effects into the system. Depending on the location of the interruption, our findings reveal median deviation times ranging between several minutes and more than half an hour, with effects being more severe for employed people than for unemployed individuals. Moreover, results show the benefits of using agent-based traffic modelling for assessing the impacts of road network interruptions on rural communities by providing insights into the characteristics of the population affected, as well as the effects on daily routines in terms of detour costs. This allows hazard managers and policymakers to increase the resilience of rural road network systems in remote areas.","[Schloegl, Matthias] AIT, Transportat Infrastruct Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Schloegl, Matthias] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria; [Schloegl, Matthias; Thaler, Thomas; Fuchs, Sven] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Schloegl, Matthias; Avian, Michael] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam ZAMG, Staff Unit Earth Observat, Vienna, Austria; [Richter, Gerald; Lenz, Gernot] AIT, Dynam Transportat Syst, Vienna, Austria; [Heiss, Gerhard] AIT, Environm Impact Assessment, Vienna, Austria","Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)","Schlogl, M (corresponding author), AIT, Transportat Infrastruct Technol, Vienna, Austria.;Schlogl, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria.;Schlogl, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria.;Schlogl, M (corresponding author), Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam ZAMG, Staff Unit Earth Observat, Vienna, Austria.",matthias.schloegl@boku.ac.at,"Fuchs, Sven/F-4208-2012; Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014; Schlögl, Matthias/AAE-3266-2022","Fuchs, Sven/0000-0002-0644-2876; Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722; Schlögl, Matthias/0000-0002-4357-523X; Richter, Gerald/0000-0002-2870-1568; Avian, Michael/0000-0003-2648-9505; Lenz, Gernot/0000-0002-6539-8756",BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,"We would like to thank the Austrian Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism (BMNT) and the Land-, forst-und wasserwirtschaftliches Rechenzentrum (LFRZ) for providing basic hazard maps as well as data on landslide events.

To address this issue, we combine a range of observations (forest inventories, eddy flux tower data, and remote sensing products) and modeling approaches with contrasting degrees of abstraction. The following models are selected: (i) Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ), a well-established, area-based, dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM); (ii) LPJ-General Ecosystem Simulator, a hybrid, individual-based approach that additionally considers plant population dynamics in greater detail; and (iii) distributed in space-LPJ, a spatially explicit version of LPJ, operating at a fine spatial resolution (100mx100m), which uses an enhanced hydrological representation accounting for lateral connectivity of surface and subsurface water fluxes. By comparing model simulations with a multivariate data set available at the catchment scale, we argue that (i) local environmental and topographic attributes that are often ignored or crudely represented in DGVM applications exert a strong control on terrestrial ecosystem response; (ii) the assumption of steady state vegetation and soil carbon pools at the beginning of simulation studies (e.g., under current conditions), as embedded in many DGVM applications, is in contradiction with the current state of many forests that are often out of equilibrium; and (iii) model evaluation against vegetation carbon fluxes does not imply an accurate simulation of vegetation carbon stocks. Having gained insights about the magnitude of aggregation-induced biases due to smoothing of spatial variability at the catchment scale, we discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the global-scale modeling studies of carbon cycle and we illustrate alternative ways forward.","[Pappas, Christoforos; Fatichi, Simone; Rimkus, Stefan; Burlando, Paolo] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huber, Markus O.] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Pappas, C (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland.",pappas@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Rimkus, Stefan/C-9853-2013","Rimkus, Stefan/0000-0002-1636-4226; Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659",Swiss National Science Foundation [4061-125926],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"We would like to thank Veiko Lehsten and the LPJ team from the Department of Earth and Ecosystem Sciences at Lund University for providing the source code of LPJ-GUESS.

Reduced power plant emissions (NOx SIP Call) and cooler temperatures in 2004 compared to 2002 resulted in lower ambient ozone concentrations over the eastern United States. Lightning flash rates in early summer 2004 were 50% higher than 2002 over the United States. Over the North Atlantic, changes in ozone column between early summer 2002 and 2004 due to changes in lightning and meteorology exceeded the change due to emission reductions by a factor of 7. Late summer changes in lightning had a much smaller impact on ozone columns. In summer 2004, net downward radiative flux at the tropopause due to ozone produced from anthropogenic emissions ranged from 0.15 to 0.30 W m(-2) across the North Atlantic, while that due to ozone produced from lightning NO emissions ranged from 0.20 to 0.50 W m(-2). Enhanced lofting of polluted air followed by stronger westerly winds led to more net export of NOx, NOy, and ozone in early summer 2004 than 2002 despite reduced anthropogenic emissions. Ozone export fluxes across the eastern NA boundary due to anthropogenic emissions were factors of 1.6 and 2 larger than those due to lightning in 2004 and 2002, respectively. Doubling the NA lightning NO source increased downwind ozone enhancements due to lightning NO emissions by one third.","[Martini, Matus; Allen, Dale J.; Loughner, Christopher P.] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hyer, Edward J.] USN, UCAR Visiting Scientist Program, Res Lab, Monterey, CA 93943 USA; [Pickering, Kenneth E.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Richter, Andreas] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Stenchikov, Georgiy L.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Stenchikov, Georgiy L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Bremen; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Martini, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",martini@atmos.umd.edu,"Richter, Andreas/C-4971-2008; Georgiy, Stenchikov/J-8569-2013; Allen, Dale J/F-7168-2010; Hyer, Edward/AAN-6903-2020; Hyer, Edward J/E-7734-2011; Pickering, Kenneth E/E-6274-2012; Allen, Dale/P-4737-2019; Loughner, Christopher/ABD-6707-2021; Stenchikov, Georgiy/AAA-4371-2022","Richter, Andreas/0000-0003-3339-212X; Allen, Dale J/0000-0003-3305-9669; Hyer, Edward/0000-0001-8636-2026; Hyer, Edward J/0000-0001-8636-2026; Loughner, Christopher/0000-0002-3833-2014; Martini, Matus/0000-0003-0459-4988; Stenchikov, Georgiy Lvovich/0000-0001-9033-4925","NASA [NNG04GD32G, NNG06GE01G, NNG06GB52G]",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was funded under NASA grants NNG04GD32G and NNG06GE01G (Interdisciplinary Science Investigation) and under NASA grant NNG06GB52G from the Tropospheric Chemistry Program.

One key question concerns whether localized or more widespread regional strategies were employed to manage large herds of domestic animals. In order to identify potential herding areas we carried out strontium isotope analyses on tooth enamel from domestic fauna recovered at Shashe-Limpopo River Basin sites and compared them with those of modern wild and domestic fauna sampled from the greater region. Values were determined via low-resolution Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Laser-ablation ICP-MS and high-resolution, standard Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS). The low-resolution approaches gave values comparable to data produced by TIMS, within the level of precision required to distinguish geological areas contained in this exceptionally isotopically variable environment. The less invasive laser-ablation ICP-MS method provided a means to sample tooth enamel increments for indications of inter-seasonal movement of livestock. The archaeological data suggest that an inter-seasonal geographical expansion of herd management took place as socio-political complexity increased. A trans-humance or relocating herding strategy would have limited overgrazing of the local river basin landscape and results allow us to revisit hypotheses that overgrazing and environmental deterioration contributed to the subsequent political collapse and abandonment of the river basin at ca AD 1290.","[Smith, Jeannette] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lee-Thorp, Julia] Univ Bradford, Div Archaeol Geog & Environm Sci, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Lee-Thorp, Julia] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Prevec, Steve] Rhodes Univ, Dept Geol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Hall, Simon] Univ Cape Town, Dept Archaeol, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Spaeth, Andreas] Univ Cape Town, Dept Geol Sci, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Bradford; University of Oxford; Rhodes University; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Smith, J (corresponding author), POB 72292, Fairbanks, AK 99707 USA.",jmsmith144@yahoo.com,,,,,,,100,11,11,0,9,AFRICA MAGNA VERLAG,FRANKFURT AM MAIN,"HEDDERNHEIMER LANDSTR 15, FRANKFURT AM MAIN, 60439, GERMANY",1612-1651,2191-5784,,J AFR ARCHAEOL,J.

In the wine supply chain, the agricultural phase represents a potential source of pollution and costs. From the farmers' point of view, these contexts require them to be more attentive and find a compromise among environmental benefits, economic benefits, and costs linked to farming practices. This paper aims to make a sustainability assessment of different wine-growing scenarios located in Calabria (Southern Italy) that combines conflicting insights, i.e., environmental and economic ones, by applying Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to identify the main hotspots and select the alternative scenarios closest to the ideal solution through the VIKOR multicriteria method. In particular, the latter allowed us to obtain synthetic indices for a two-dimensional sustainability assessment. Conventional practices associated to the espalier training system represent the best compromise from both environmental and economic points of view, due to the higher yield per hectare. The choices regarding Functional Unit (FU) and indicators were shown to have a high influence on results.","[Falcone, Giacomo; De Luca, Anna Irene; Stillitano, Teodora; Strano, Alfio; Romeo, Giuseppa; Gulisano, Giovanni] Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Agr AGRARIA, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,"Falcone, G (corresponding author), Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Agr AGRARIA, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",giacomo.falcone@unirc.it; anna.deluca@unirc.it; teodora.stillitano@unirc.it; astrano@unirc.it; giuseppa.romeo@unirc.it; ggulisano@unirc.it,"Falcone, Giacomo/H-7668-2013; Strano, Alfio/A-7654-2018; De Luca, Anna/M-1489-2013; Falcone, Giacomo/AAE-8461-2019","Falcone, Giacomo/0000-0002-9024-7167; Strano, Alfio/0000-0003-4709-4748; De Luca, Anna/0000-0002-8716-8177; Falcone, Giacomo/0000-0002-9024-7167",Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) within research project: Distretto ad alta tecnologia agroindustrale della Calabria AGRIFOODTECH Modelli sostenibili e nuove tecnologie per la valorizzazione delle filiere vegetali mediterranee [PON03PE_00090_3],Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) within research project: Distretto ad alta tecnologia agroindustrale della Calabria AGRIFOODTECH Modelli sostenibili e nuove tecnologie per la valorizzazione delle filiere vegetali mediterranee,This research is funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) within the research project: Distretto ad alta tecnologia agroindustrale della Calabria AGRIFOODTECH (PON03PE_00090_3) Modelli sostenibili e nuove tecnologie per la valorizzazione delle filiere vegetali mediterranee.,,134,47,52,2,73,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2016,8,,,,,,793,10.3390/su8080793,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8080793,,,34,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DU8HC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000382452900093,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to empirically explore the geographic and temporal extent of the effects, we adopt two analytical methods: random-intercept multilevel modeling and Mahalanobis-metric matching modeling. The analytical results suggest that the geographic extent of the discount effect of a flooding disaster is within 300 m from an inundated area. Market values of housing located 0-100, 100-200, and 200-300 m from inundated areas were lower by 11.0%, 7.4%, and 6.3%, respectively, than counterparts in the control group. The effect lasted only for 12 months after the disaster and then disappeared. During the first month, 1-3 months, and 3-6 months after a flood, housing units in the disaster-influenced area (within 300 m of the inundated area) were worth, on average, 57.6%, 49.2%, and 45.9% less than control units, respectively. Also, within the following 6 months, the discount effects were reduced to 33.2%. On the other hand, the results showed no statistically significant effects on market values more than 12 months after the disaster. By providing insights into how people perceive and respond to natural hazards, this research provides practical lessons for establishing sustainable disaster management and urban resilience strategies.","[Jung, Eunah] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Yoon, Heeyeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Yoon, Heeyeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Cornell University; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Yoon, H (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Yoon, H (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",ej254@cornell.edu; hyyoon@snu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A8020226],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea under grant number [NRF-2017S1A5A8020226].,,79,8,8,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2018,11,,,,,,4008,10.3390/su10114008,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114008,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC1AQ,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000451531700182,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stone tools found at these sites are attributed to the Nejd Leptolithic tradition; an autochthonous lithic culture found across Dhofar (Oman). The artifact-bearing deposits excavated within these rockshelters have been chronologically constrained by optically stimulated luminescence dating, while sedimentological analyses help to establish site formation processes. Together, these methods provide a chronological anchor for some Nejd Leptolithic archaeological findspots across Dhofar. The archaeological evidence from surface and stratified sites indicates a technological continuum across the shifting climatic regimes of the Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene. This technological continuity points to possible population persistence within one of the posited South Arabian refugia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.","[Hilbert, Y.

Most of the freshwater lakes and wetlands are facing the problem of water quality deterioration and ecological imbalance due to the increasing anthropogenic activities particularly in developing countries. The understanding of the mechanism and identification of the sources of eutrophication will be beneficial to mitigate the problem through proper management policy. Mechanism and effects of eutrophication described within various case studies all over the world, and the evolution of modelling approaches for their mitigation has been reviewed in this paper. With the advancement of ecosystem modeling, it has become feasible for the governmental bodies and policy makers to propose better lake control schemes and restoration programs, through their better predictive capacity. While prediction and control of eutrophication of lakes now has become easier than before, refinements are still going on owing to the ever-increased complexity and lake specific problems that require wider experience and more details. The current status of knowledge about lake eutrophication and advances in ecological and hydrodynamic modeling will be of great use for future research prospects.

The most investigated SNPs are missense mutations resulting in residue substitutions in the protein. Here we propose SNPs&GO, an accurate method that, starting from a protein sequence, can predict whether a mutation is disease related or not by exploiting the protein functional annotation. The scoring efficiency of SNPs&GO is as high as 82%, with a Matthews correlation coefficient equal to 0.63 over a wide set of annotated nonsynonymous mutations in proteins, including 16,330 disease-related and 17,432 neutral polymorphisms. SNPs&GO collects in unique framework information derived from protein sequence, evolutionary information, and function as encoded in the Gene Ontology terms, and outperforms other available predictive methods.

A novel partial-body heating system (NPHS) was developed, consisting of three electrically heating pads in the feet, buttocks and shoulder regions with controllable surface temperatures, and the temperatures of the pads can be separately set on phone app. Eight female students were asked to sleep for 8 h in the CON (i.e., the NPHS with power off) and HEAT (i.e., the NPHS with power on) conditions randomly inside a climatic chamber. The chamber was controlled at 5 degrees C and 65% relative humidity. Physiological responses, including core and local skin temperatures, and heart rate, were recorded throughout all-night sleep. Participants' whole- and local-body thermal sensation, wetness and comfort sensations were evaluated. A subjective survey of sleep quality was also conducted after sleep. Results demonstrated that in comparison with CON, using HEAT showed significantly higher toe, calf and mean skin temperatures (p < 0.05), and remarkably improved whole- and local-body thermal and comfort sensations (p < 0.05), and provided a better sleep quality (p < 0.05). Besides, using NPHS did not induce body thermal stress evidenced by similar core temperatures and heart rate between HEAT and CON scenarios (p > 0.1). The present study shows that partial-body heating at the major body parts could effectively maintain thermoregulation, improve thermal comfort and provide a better sleep quality while sleeping in a cold environment.","[Song, Wenfang] Guangdong Univ Technol, Garment Digital Engn Ctr, Sch Art & Design, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China; [Song, Wenfang; Lu, Yehu; Liu, Yuping] Soochow Univ, Natl Engn Lab Modem Silk, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yehu] Nantong Text & Silk Ind Technol Res Inst, Nantong 226300, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xinghong] Shenzhen Yinhe Carbon Technol Co Ltd, Shenzhen 215227, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Technology; Soochow University - China; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Lu, YH (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Natl Engn Lab Modem Silk, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.",yhlu@suda.edu.cn,,"Yang, Yang/0000-0002-3648-6001",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51606131]; Technology Innovation Project of Key Industries in Suzhou [SYG201812]; Nantong Municipal Science and Technology Project [JC2018039],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Technology Innovation Project of Key Industries in Suzhou; Nantong Municipal Science and Technology Project,"The work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51606131), the Technology Innovation Project of Key Industries in Suzhou (No. SYG201812), and the Nantong Municipal Science and Technology Project (No. JC2018039).",,53,12,14,6,37,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Diatoms are common in much of the sequence and preserve a record of environmental change within the basin. A high-resolution diatom stratigraphy has been developed for these deposits. The data document the presence of freshwater and saline lakes as well as wetlands. Transfer functions indicate that these water bodies ranged in conductivity between about 200-20,000 mu S cm(-1), with pH varying between about 7.5 and 10.3. Pedogenesis affected multiple horizons within the succession, reflecting periods of emergence that encompass much of the time represented by the Olorgesailie Formation. A variety of other sedimentological indicators (carbonates, rhizoliths, mudcracks, erosional channels) also record periods when the sampled portions of the basin were dominated by terrestrial conditions. Stone tools are common at several levels, indicating the use of the area by hominins. Lakes and wetlands were potentially usable as sources of potable water by hominins for part of the basin history, but at other times were undrinkable. Other water sources (springs, rivers) would have been necessary during these periods. Paleoenvironments in the basin were complex and changed frequently with time. Such shifts in resources and habitat distribution during Olorgesailie Formation time seem likely to have influenced the behavior and evolution of local plant and animal populations, including Homo.

The C-13 estimates were based on the model's existing description of carbon assimilation and canopy conductance. The model was tested in two approximate to 80-year-old natural stands of Abies grandis (grand fir) in northern Idaho. We used as many independent measurements as possible to parameterize the model. Measured parameters included quantum yield, specific leaf area, soil water content and litterfall rate. Predictions were compared with measurements of transpiration by sap flux, stem biomass, tree diameter growth, leaf area index and C-13. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model's predictions of C-13 were sensitive to key parameters controlling carbon assimilation and canopy conductance, which would have allowed it to fail had the model been parameterized or programmed incorrectly. Instead, the simulated C-13 of tree rings was no different from measurements (P>0.05). The C-13 submodel provides a convenient means of constraining parameter space and avoiding model artefacts. This C-13 test may be applied to any forest growth model that includes realistic simulations of carbon assimilation and transpiration.","[Wei, Liang; Marshall, John D.; Link, Timothy E.; Kavanagh, Kathleen L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Marshall, John D.] Swedish Agr Univ, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Du, Enhao] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Climate Sci Dept, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pangle, Robert E.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Gag, Peter J.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Reading, CA 96002 USA; [Ubierna, Nerea] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Idaho; University of Idaho; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of New Mexico; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Australian National University,"Wei, L (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",liangwei@vandals.uidaho.edu,"Wei, Liang/K-3522-2015","Wei, Liang/0000-0001-8967-5036","National Science Foundation EPSCoR - Research Infrastructure Improvement Grant [EPS - 0447689]; USDA-CSREES NRI grants [2003-35102-13675, 2006-35102-17689]; USFS [03-JV-11222065-068, 04-D6-11010000-037]",National Science Foundation EPSCoR - Research Infrastructure Improvement Grant; USDA-CSREES NRI grants(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); USFS,"Potlatch Corporation allowed this research to be conducted at MCEW.

A comparison of geochemical results obtained on both archaeological artefacts and geological samples collected from Chikiani outcrop in Georgia, together with literature data of southern Caucasus and eastern Turkey, allowed us to define the source of the archaeological obsidians of Samshvilde site. The majority of archaeological samples (28/30) shows a local provenance, precisely from Chikiani (Georgia) on the contrary the other two samples suggest a provenance from two different Armenian sources respectively Gegham and Akhurian volcanic system.","[La Russa, M.

The systematic investigation of the deposit in the early 1970s identified megafaunal remains dominated by the 100-200 kg kangaroo Macropus giganteus titan. Associated radiocarbon ages indicated that the species was extant until c.30,000 BP, suggesting significant overlap with human settlement of Sahul. This evidence was inconsistent with contemporary models of rapid human-driven extinctions. Instead, researchers inferred ecological tethering of fauna at Lancefield Swamp due to intense drought precipitated localised mass deaths, consistent with Late Pleistocene climatic variability. Later investigations in another part of the swamp, the Mayne Site, remote to the initial investigations, concluded that mass flow disturbed this area, and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) analyses on megafauna teeth returned wide-ranging ages. To clarify site formation processes and dating of Lancefield Swamp, we excavated new test-pits next to previous trenches in the Classic and Mayne Sites. We compared absolute chronologies for sediments and teeth, sedimentology, palaeo-topography, taphonomy, and macropod age at death across the swamp. Luminescence dating of sediments and ESR analysis of teeth returned ages between c.80,000 and 45,000 years ago. We found no archaeological remains in the bone beds, and evidence of carnivore activity and fluvial action, in the form of reactivated spring flow. The latter disturbed limited parts of the site and substantial areas of the bone beds remained intact. The faunal assemblage is dominated by megafaunal adult Macropus, consistent with mass die-offs due to severe drought. Such droughts appear to have recurred over millennia during the climatic variability of Marine Isotope Stages 4 and 3. These events began tens of millennia before the first appearance of Aboriginal people in Sahul and only the very youngest fossil deposits could be coeval with the earliest human arrivals. Therefore, anthropogenic causes cannot be implicated in most if not all of mass deaths at the site. Climatic and environmental changes were the main factors in site formation and megafauna deaths at Lancefield Swamp. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we present an extensive molecular phylogeny of the viperid snake genus Montivipera, including all known taxa. Based on nuclear and mitochondrial data, we present novel insights into the phylogeny of the genus and review the status of its constituent species. Maximum likelihood methods revealed a montane origin of Montivipera at 12.3 Mya. We then analyzed factors of mountain viper diversity. Our data support substantial changes in effective population size through Plio-Pleistocene periods. We conclude that climatic oscillations were drivers of allopatric speciation, and that mountain systems of the Near and Middle East have strongly influenced the evolution and survival of taxa, because climatic and topographical heterogeneities induced by mountains have played a crucial role as filters for dispersal and as multiple refugia. The wide diversity of montane microhabitats enabled mountain vipers to retain their ecological niche during climatic pessima. In consequence the varied geological and topographical conditions between refugia favoured genetic isolation and created patterns of species richness resulting in the formation of neoendemic taxa. Our data support high concordance between geographic distributions of Montivipera haplotypes with putative plant refugia.

This research examines the determinant factors of thermal environment and also strategies related to albedo and greenery in a medium-scale park using ENVI-met software. In this regard, the environmental situation is analyzed using air (Ta) and surface temperature (Ts), wind speed (WS), sky view factor (SVF), the mean radiant temperature (MRT), and physiological equivalent temperature (PET). Subsequently, low- and high-albedo pavements, plane and pine trees, and Buxus shrubs strategies are investigated that can significantly influence the parameters. According to the results, SVF is not a precise indicator for determining radiation exposure and thermal comfort conditions despite its wide application in previous studies. Further, there is a significant correlation between SVF and PET only during sunlight and sunset. In addition, the best thermal comfort condition can be reached by combining the low-albedo pavements, and trees with wide crowns and high trunks. The crown height from the ground is an important factor due to its effect on the airflow that can also counteract the impact of slightly increased radiation. Field investigation and simulation studies reveal that the effect of albedo on thermal comfort is lower than the vegetation coverage. Nevertheless, the significant changes in albedo values and urban heat island mitigation do not have any considerable effect on thermal comfort improvement in urban parks. (C) 2020 The Authors.

To enable the best possible preservation of stone materials, it is crucial to examine the performances of those protective treatments. Many studies have been conducted to inspect the water-repellence properties of a variety of coatings, while their effects on airborne particle deposition are poorly established. In this work, the effects of the application of different protective treatments to marble surfaces exposed to an urban environment were investigated in relation to particle deposition and colour variation. Five commercial products for the preservation of stone buildings, including siloxanic, fluorinated and TiO2-based coatings, were selected and applied to Carrara marble samples, which were exposed outdoors in the historic centre of Florence (Italy). The morphology and the chemical composition of particles deposited on the samples surfaces after one year were investigated by combining scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX). Cluster analysis and principal component analysis were then applied to SEM-EDX data, to identify the main sources of the deposited particles and to assess the performance of the applied products. Moreover, changes in surface colour due to both the application of the products and the outdoor exposure were evaluated using spectrocolorimetry. Based on the experimental results, all the treated surfaces showed a lower proneness to particle deposition and colour alteration in comparison to an untreated surface. In particular, among the tested products, organosilicon-based and fluorinated acrylic polymers were identified as the best performing protective coatings. Additionally, the experimental and statistical methodology used for this study proved a suitable approach for the investigation of deposition phenomena on stone surfaces.","[Becherini, Francesca] CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Stati Uniti 4, I-35127 Padua, Italy; [Pastorelli, Gianluca] Corehmat Res Consulting, Finsensvej 37C 1th, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Valotto, Gabrio] Univ Ca Foscari, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Vegapk,Via Ind 21-8, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Gambirasi, Arianna; Bianchin, Sara; Favaro, Monica] CNR, Inst Condensed Matter Chem & Energy Technol, Corso Stati Uniti 4, I-35127 Padua, Italy; [Pastorelli, Gianluca] Northwestern Univ, Art Inst Chicago, Ctr Sci Studies Arts NU ACCESS, Technol Inst, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Chimica della Materia Condensata e di Tecnologie per l Energia (ICMATE-CNR); Northwestern University,"Pastorelli, G (corresponding author), Corehmat Res Consulting, Finsensvej 37C 1th, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Pastorelli, G (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Art Inst Chicago, Ctr Sci Studies Arts NU ACCESS, Technol Inst, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",f.becherini@isac.cnr.it; gianluca.pastorelli@northwestem.edu; valotto@unive.it; arianna.gambirasi@ieni.cnr.it; sara.bianchin@ieni.cnr.it; monica.favaro@cnr.it,"Becherini, Francesca/AAD-8969-2020; Becherini, Francesca/AAW-8880-2020; Pastorelli, Gianluca/X-4561-2019","Becherini, Francesca/0000-0002-8408-0102; Pastorelli, Gianluca/0000-0001-6926-1952; Favaro, Monica/0000-0003-4091-6163",European Commission 7th Framework Programme [212458],European Commission 7th Framework Programme(European Commission),This work was supported by the European Commission 7th Framework Programme [grant number 212458].,,52,10,11,1,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0300-9440,,,PROG ORG COAT,Prog.

Although quarrying activity has been extensive across much of the area it has been undertaken in flooded workings due to the high level of the watertable. Consequently little is known in detail about the sequences except where they outcrop on the foreshore around the coast. This paper examines recent work from the lower coastal plain using a multi-disciplinary approach these deposits to elucidate the age of the sequences and their associated environments of deposition. OSL dates from two of the beaches, the Aldingbourne and Brighton/Norton Beaches, place both within MIS 7. Although these OSL dates cannot differentiate between sub-stages within MIS 7, coupling these results with inferences from local geography, lithology and contained microfossils it is clear that the beaches belong to two different phases within MIS 7. These two beaches are clearly divided by a major phase of erosion and downcutting associated with a fall in sea-level. Fluvial sediments from Solent Terrace 2 and Arun Terrace 4 also date within MIS 7 and are tentatively ascribed to the downcutting event between the beaches. Together this information allows us to propose, for the first time, a robust independently dated framework for the lower parts of the coastal plain integrating for the first time the marine and terrestrial record.

This unique record offers a Pacific view of the stable isotope and chemical record from the Lateglacial to the present. The timescale is based on seasonal counted years, the largest known volcanic acid signatures and the major shift in stable isotopes and chemistry at the end of the Younger Dryas. There are large and sustained changes in the stable isotopic record that are anti-correlated with marine and continental chemistry series. The oxygen-18 in this area is not a proxy for palaeotemperature but rather for source region. The last major isotope shift in AD 1840 in delta(O-18) and chemistry is compared with the Quinn's ENSO record. During periods of more frequent La Nina (stronger tropical easterlies) there is more zonal flow of water vapour transport to the Pacific Northwest, delta(O-18) values are larger and the deuterium excess d smaller. These periods coincide with periods of lower accumulation/precipitation in southern Yukon. The Holocene delta(O-18) record indicates many large shifts between the meridional (strong El Nino) and zonal (La Nina). Comparison of the Logan isotopic record and the moisture/temperature-sensitive time series of peat bog inception dates for the Northwest shows a strong correlation (0.36) that points to high accumulation rates coincident with low delta(O-18) and enhanced meridional flow. Major changes in the core at 4200 BP and 7000-8000 BP point to enhanced meridional flow, which coincide with big changes in the Pacific palaeorecords of the balance between El Nino and La Nina. 4200 BP seems to have inaugurated the 'modern' ENSO world.","[Fisher, David; Dyke, Art; Demuth, Mike; Zdanowicz, Christian; Bourgeois, Jocelyne; Koerner, Roy M.; Zheng, James] Geol Survey Canada NRCan, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E8, Canada; [Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Climate Change Res Ctr, EOS, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Osterberg, Erich; Mayewski, Paul; Kreutz, Karl] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Osterberg, Erich; Mayewski, Paul; Kreutz, Karl] Univ Maine, Dept Earth Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Steig, Eric] Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, ESS, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen E, Denmark; [Yalcin, Kaplan] Oregon State Univ, Dept Geosci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Goto-Azuma, Kumiko] Natl Inst Polar Res, NIPR, Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1738515, Japan; [Luckman, Brian] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6F 5C2, Canada; [Rupper, Summer] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Natural Resources Canada; Lands & Minerals Sector - Natural Resources Canada; Geological Survey of Canada; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; Oregon State University; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Brigham Young University,"Fisher, D (corresponding author), Geol Survey Canada NRCan, 601 Booth St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E8, Canada.",david.fisher@nrcan.gc.ca,"Wake, Cameron/G-8114-2014; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/N-4401-2016; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/AAO-6951-2020; Steig, Eric J/G-9088-2015","Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/0000-0002-1474-1948; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/0000-0002-1474-1948; Steig, Eric J/0000-0002-8191-5549; Wake, Cameron/0000-0002-5961-5902; Zdanowicz, Christian/0000-0002-1045-5063; Osterberg, Erich/0000-0002-0675-1230",,,,,52,85,86,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,AUG,2008,5,,,,667,677,,10.1177/0959683608092236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683608092236,,,11,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,335FW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000258277200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a complete anthracological sequence from Moli del Salt (Vimbodi i Poblet, Tarragona, NE Iberian Peninsula), a site assigned to the Late Upper Palaeolithic. Our results suggest a continuous forest cover transformation throughout the inter-GI-1. Forest opening was determined by the retreat of Pinus sylvestris type, which was dominant during the Late Pleistocene, in relation to the continuous expansion of Juniperus sp. Likewise, our results suggest a progressive increase in the diversity of cold- and drought-resistant mesophilic taxa, which would have begun with the more temperate climatic conditions occasioned by the positive isotopic oscillations of GI-1. A comparison with other paleoecological data from the Iberian Peninsula suggests the presence of different biogeographic regions, as evidenced by different frequencies of certain montane and meso-thermophilic taxa. Our research also made use of a new methodology based on the spatial distribution of the charcoal remains recovered from Late Magdalenian layer A of Moli del Salt. The results have provided data with which to evaluate the taphonomic alterations identified in the charcoal fragments, such as hyperfragmentation and the occurrence of postdepositional processes. This analysis has increased the temporal resolution of the archaeological fieldwork, allowing us to identify unique events of human activity in a context of cumulative palimpsests. Finally, the Kernel distributions according to the standard deviation of the tree taxa, projected both in plan (X-Y) and in section (X-Z(1)), indicate human strategies in fuel selection that differentiated between Pinus sylvestris type, Juniperus sp. and Prunus sp.","[Mas, Barbara] Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist & Arqueol, Seminari Estudis & Recerques Prehist SERP, C Montalegre 6, Barcelona 08001, Spain; [Allue, Ethel; Alonso, E.

These insular shelf data reveal that persistent eastward flowing currents and retreating glaciers drive patterns of sediment distribution. Sedimentary bedform directionality, corroborated by drifter data, suggest that the prevailing energy in this region dominates from west to east, and is deflected in an anticlockwise direction around Heard Island, causing sediment deposition to be concentrated on the eastern (down-current) side of the islands. Sediment bedform morphology likely mirrors the eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and oscillating east-west tidal currents. Thick sediment accumulations north of Heard Island may be related to deglaciation since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sample sites on the northern down-current side of Heard Islands and on the western up-current side of the McDonald Islands contain a diverse range of taxonomic groups compared to all other sample sites. Benthic specimens obtained in rock dredges and sediment grabs show a range of invertebrate species that are likely endemic to the HIMI region.","[Watson, Sally J.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Wellington, New Zealand; [Watson, Sally J.; Lucieer, Vanessa; Whittaker, Joanne; Fox, Jodi M.; Hill, Nicole; Coffin, Millard F.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies IMAS, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Fox, Jodi M.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Fox, Jodi M.] Univ Tasmania, CODES, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Coffin, Millard F.] Univ Maine, Sch Earth & Climate Sci, Orono, ME USA; [Coffin, Millard F.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Barnstable, MA USA",National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Watson, SJ (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Wellington, New Zealand.;Watson, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies IMAS, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",,"Whittaker, Joanne M/B-3695-2010","Whittaker, Joanne M/0000-0002-3170-3935; Fox, Jodi/0000-0003-2493-6623",Australia's Marine National Facility (MNF); Australian Antarctic Science Program grant [4338],Australia's Marine National Facility (MNF); Australian Antarctic Science Program grant,"We thank Australia's Marine National Facility (MNF) for its support in the form of sea time on R/V Investigator, support personnel, scientific equipment, and data management.

However, these changes are characterized less often and with less certainty than easier-to-measure aboveground stocks. We sampled soils prior to the whole-tree harvest of Watershed 5 at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in 1983, and again in years 3, 8, and 15 following harvest. The repeated measures of total soil C in this stand show no net change in the O horizon over 15 years, though mixing with the mineral soil reduced observed O horizon C in disturbed areas in post-harvest years 3 and 8. Mineral soil C decreased by 15% (20Mgha(-1)) relative to pre-harvest levels by year 8, with no recovery in soil C stocks by year 15. Proportional changes in N stocks were similar. The loss of mineral soil C offset two-thirds of the C accumulation in aboveground biomass over the same 15years, leading to near-zero net C accumulation post-harvest, after also accounting for the decomposition of slash and roots. If this result is broadly representative, and the extent of forest harvesting is expanded to meet demand for bioenergy or to manage ecosystem carbon sequestration, then it will take substantially longer than previously assumed to offset harvest- or bioenergy-related carbon dioxide emissions with carbon uptake during forest regrowth.","[Hamburg, Steven P.] Brown Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Box 1943, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Hamburg, Steven P.] Environm Def Fund, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, 8 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Johnson, Chris E.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 151 Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Sanderman, Jonathan] Woods Hole Res Ctr, 149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA",Brown University; Environmental Defense Fund; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Syracuse University; Woods Hole Research Center,"Vadeboncoeur, MA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, 8 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",shamburg@edf.edu; matt.vad@unh.edu,"Brook, Hubbard/AAD-1112-2022","Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708","National Science Foundation [BSR8316953, BSR8717570, 9211768, 9810221, 0423259, 1114804]; NSF",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by National Science Foundation Grants BSR8316953, BSR8717570, 9211768, 9810221, 0423259, and 1114804.

This study analyzed phenological dynamics in a savannah dominated semi-arid environment of Uganda. We used moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS NDVI) imagery. TIMESAT program was used to analyse the imagery to determine key phenological metrics; onset of greenness (OGT), onset of greenness value, end of greenness time (EGT), end of greenness value, maximum NDVI, time of maximum NDVI, duration of greenup (DOG) and range of normalized difference vegetation index (RNDVI). Results showed that thicket and shrubs had the earliest OGT on day 85 +/- 14, EGT on day 244 +/- 32 and a DOG of 158 +/- 25 days. Woodland had the highest NDVI value for maximum NDVI, OGT, EGT, and RNDVI. In the bushland, OGT occurs on average around day 90 +/- 11, EGT on day 255 +/- 33 with a DOG of 163 +/- 36 days. The grassland showed that OGT occurs on day 96 +/- 13, EGT on day 252 +/- 36 with a total DOG of 156 +/- 33 days. Early photosynthesis activity was observed in central to eastern Karamoja in the districts of Moroto and Kotido. There was a positive relationship between rainfall and NDVI across all vegetation cover types as well as between phenological parameters and season dynamics. Vegetation senescence in the sub-region occurs around August to mid-September (day 244-253). The varied phenophases observed in the sub-region reveal an inherent landscape heterogeneity that is beneficial to extensive pastoral livestock production. Continuous monitoring of savannah phenological patterns in the sub-region is required to decipher landscape ecosystem processes and functioning.","[Egeru, Anthony; Kuule, Derick Ansyijar; Namaalwa, Jjumba Justine] Makerere Univ, Dept Environm Management, Kampala, Uganda; [Egeru, Anthony] Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr RUFORUM, Kampala, Uganda; [Magaya, John Paul; Gidudu, Anthony] Makerere Univ, Coll Engn Design Art & Technol, Dept Geomat & Land Management, Kampala, Uganda; [Siya, Aggrey] Makerere Univ, Coll Vet Med Anim Resources & Biosecur, Dept Biosecur Ecosyst & Vet Publ Hlth, Kampala, Uganda; [Barasa, Bernard] Kyambogo Univ, Dept Geog & Social Studies, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University; Makerere University; Makerere University,"Egeru, A (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Dept Environm Management, Kampala, Uganda.;Egeru, A (corresponding author), Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr RUFORUM, Kampala, Uganda.",egeru81@gmail.com,,"John Paul, Magaya/0000-0002-1933-337X",Carnegie Corporation of New York through Makerere University under the Post-Doc 2017 grant,Carnegie Corporation of New York through Makerere University under the Post-Doc 2017 grant,This work was originally funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York through Makerere University under the Post-Doc 2017 grant to AE.,,90,0,0,2,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

For this purpose, an interdisciplinary protocol has been designed to simultaneously collect physical parameter measurements (related to microclimate and acoustics) and survey data on perceptions (involving residents and non-residents). The cross-referenced analysis of data collected at six contrasting places in a district in Toulouse (France) enabled us (i) to better understand and prioritise the factors that influence residents' assessment of the quality of their living environment and (ii) to understand to what extent the differentiation of the places by the inhabitants converges with the differentiation of these places based on acoustic and micrometeorological measurements. The statistical analysis based on individuals showed the importance of noise and air quality that rank just after the aesthetic dimension for all respondents. Nevertheless, the quality of maintenance and the feeling of security that the place inspires seem to be as crucial as these environmental criteria for the inhabitants. The analysis focused on the sites highlighted the consistency between the typology of places based on perceptions and that based on acoustic measurements, which confirms the high inhabitants' sensitivity to this environmental component.","[Sinda, Haoues-Jouve; Noemie, Gaudio; Julia, Hidalgo; Claudia, Lopez-Rieu; Delphine, Chouillou] Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, Toulouse, France; [Aude, Lemonsu; Alexandre, Amosse; Cecile, De Munck; Julien, Le Bras; Dominique, Legain] Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Benoit, Gauvrau; Arnaud, Can] IFSTTAR, Champs Sur Marne, France; [Bertrand, Carrissimo; Gao, Zhenlan] CEREA, Paris, France; [Isabelle, Richard] LAVUE, Birac, France; [Luc, Adolphe] INSA, Villeurbanne, France; [Isabelle, Berry-Chikhaoui] ART Dev, Montpellier, France; [Julien, Bouyer] CEREMA, Bron, France; [Samuel, Challeat] GEODE, Paris, France; [Elisabeth, Dorier; Sophie, Hooneart] LPED, Marseille, France; [Gwenael, Guillaume] CEREMA Direct Terr Est, Metz, France; [Jean-Pierre, Levy] CNRS, Paris, France; [Valery, Masson] CNRS, Meteo France, Paris, France; [Solene, Marry] ADEME Ctr Paris, Paris, France; [Danny, Nguyen-Luong] Inst Amenagement & Urbanisme, Aix En Provence, France; [Juan-Carlos, Rojas-Arias] ENSAT, Auzeville Tolosane, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Sinda, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, Lab Interdisciplinaire Solidarites Soc Terr LISST, Toulouse, France.",Sinda.haoues-jouve@univ-tlse2.fr,"Can, Arnaud/C-1261-2012","Can, Arnaud/0000-0002-9975-4245; Challeat, Samuel/0000-0002-2119-2051; GAO, Zhenlan/0000-0001-9285-9688",,,,,55,1,1,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-8083,2399-8091,,ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN,Env.

Despite a generally severe urban-rural development imbalance, these rural areas feature well-developed basic infrastructure and diverse economic activities. Rural revitalization policies in these areas have emphasized the development of cultural and ecological tourism, which has spurred economic development and given rise to a trend of villa construction. Residential buildings sit on large areas where natural resources are abundant. These advantages are conducive to the development and use of sustainable resources. This study proposes an incentive policy encouraging rural residents to renovate their buildings to include rainwater conservation and solar power generation. The Delphi method, an analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy logic theory were combined to establish an AI-MCDM model, with applications of artificial intelligence and multiple-criteria decision making. Using Conghua District, Guangdong Province as an example, the study suggested that the model is beneficial to increasing the willingness of rural residents to reconstruct and renovate their residences, promoting the development of a low-carbon ecological region, Wenquan Township. We conducted the Delphi process twice to assess and validate incentives for installing natural resource conservation structures in agricultural areas. Nine criteria were identified, which can be divided into three main dimensions of participation situation, generating capacity, and storage facilities. The proposed AI-MCDM model developed using the Delphi-Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process Model has high objectivity and can support rural areas in developing low-carbon, sustainable characteristics. The findings can serve as a reference for governments formulating incentives to encourage the installation of rainwater conservation and solar energy generation structures by rural households.","[Hsueh, Sung-Lin; Feng, Yuan; Sun, Yue; Jia, Ruqi] Nanfang Coll, Dept Art Design & Creat Ind, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yan, Min-Ren] Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, 231,Sec 2,Jian Guo S Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Nanfang College, Guangzhou; Chinese Culture University","Yan, MR (corresponding author), Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, 231,Sec 2,Jian Guo S Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",hsueh.sl@msa.hinet.net; von2000@126.com; sinyocn@gmail.com; douzijrq0608@gmail.com; ymr3@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,,"Yan, Min-Ren/0000-0002-8270-9763",Nanfang College; iiLABs,Nanfang College; iiLABs,This research was funded by Nanfang College and iiLABs.,,118,2,2,5,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,22,,,,,,12505,10.3390/su132212505,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132212505,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XI2MK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000725952400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Murray hardyhead is a threatened fish endemic to the southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, which has declined significantly in range and abundance since European settlement. Conservation of the species has relied largely on environmental watering of off-channel wetlands where isolated populations persist. This became problematic during recent drought (1997-2010) because of competing demands for limited water, and resentment towards environmental watering programs from communities that themselves were subject to reduced water entitlements. In response, emergency conservation measures prioritised the delivery of environmental water to minimise applied volumes. Captive maintenance programs were established for fish rescued from four genetically distinct conservation units, with varying levels of breeding success. Several translocations of wild and captive-bred fish to surrogate refuge sites were also conducted. Future recovery of the species should secure existing natural and stocked populations and translocate fish to additional appropriate sites to spread risk and reinstate natural pathways for dispersal. The approach to the conservation of Murray hardyhead during extreme environmental conditions provides insights to inform the management of fishes in other drought-prone regions of the world.","[Ellis, Iain M.] La Trobe Univ, Murray Darling Freshwater Res Ctr, Mildura, Vic 3501, Australia; [Stoessel, Daniel] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Museums & Art Galleries Northern Terr, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia; [Wedderburn, Scotte D.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Suitor, Lara] Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, Berri, SA 5343, Australia; [Hall, Arkellah] Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",La Trobe University; Murray Darling Basin Authority; Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research (ARI); University of Adelaide,"Ellis, IM (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Murray Darling Freshwater Res Ctr, POB 3428, Mildura, Vic 3501, Australia.",I.Ellis@latrobe.edu.au,,"Hammer, Michael/0000-0002-0981-4647; Stoessel, Daniel/0000-0002-2140-7390",,,,,83,27,27,0,36,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

The vertical profile and seasonal fluctuation of nutrients are crucial to understanding the biogeochemical cycles in aquatic systems. In this study, field research was carried out at a small and shallow lake, Lake Bulan, in the lower Kharaa River basin. The area has been receiving increased nutrient loads from the water catchment area for the last 20 years. Water samples were collected seasonally from the lake from 2019-2022 and analyzed for nutrients, major cations, trace metals, and dissolved organic carbon. The average concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the surface lake water had a wide seasonal variation from 0.26 +/- 0.11 mg N/L in August to 1.44 +/- 0.08 mg N/L in January. Seasonal differences were also observed in the vertical profiles. Concentrations were relatively similar at the various water depths in April and September at turnover time. Thermal stratification was observed when the lake was covered in ice, with the maximum concentrations being observed in the bottom layer in the months of January and August. The phosphate concentration showed a similar variation trend. These results indicate that both the summer and winter stratifications are important for regeneration of nutrients in the bottom layer, biochemical cycling, and mitigating impacts of global warming on small and shallow lakes in Mongolia.","[Baterdene, Ariunsanaa] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Div Mat Chem, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Baterdene, Ariunsanaa; Zorigt, Baasanjav; Ochir, Altansukh; Yunden, Ariuntungalag] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Environm & Forest Engn, Ulaanbaatar 14201, Mongolia; [Baterdene, Ariunsanaa; Ochir, Altansukh; Munkhsuld, Enkhuur; Tsetsgee, Solongo] Natl Univ Mongolia, Inst Sustainable Dev, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Nagao, Seiya; Fukushi, Keisuke] Kanazawa Univ, Inst Nat & Environm Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Davaasuren, Davaadorj] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Gankhurel, Baasansuren] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Div Global Environm Sci & Engn, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Munkhsuld, Enkhuur] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Soc, Dept Transdisciplinary Sci & Engn, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268502, Japan",Kanazawa University; National University of Mongolia; National University of Mongolia; Kanazawa University; National University of Mongolia; Kanazawa University; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Nagao, S (corresponding author), Kanazawa Univ, Inst Nat & Environm Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",ariunsanaa1790@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; seiya-nagao@se.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; baaska8696@gmail.com; altansukh@num.edu.mn; fukushi@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; davaadorj@num.edu.mn; gbaasnsrn@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; munkhsuld.e.aa@m.titech.ac.jp; osko_8888@yahoo.com; ariuna_0924@yahoo.com,"; Fukushi, Keisuke/C-4827-2015","Davaasuren, Davaadorj/0000-0001-9638-6793; Fukushi, Keisuke/0000-0003-0398-8950; Munkhsuld, Enkhuur/0000-0001-9134-7269; Nagao, Seiya/0000-0002-1709-9225","Higher Engineering Education Development Project; Functional material based on Mongolian Natural Minerals for Environmental Engineering, Cementitious and Float Process of the Joint Usage/Research Program of Kanazawa University [J11A15, 20012, 21002]; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science [JP18KK0296, JPJSBP120219915]","Higher Engineering Education Development Project; Functional material based on Mongolian Natural Minerals for Environmental Engineering, Cementitious and Float Process of the Joint Usage/Research Program of Kanazawa University; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","Financial support was provided by the Higher Engineering Education Development Project; Functional material based on Mongolian Natural Minerals for Environmental Engineering, Cementitious and Float Process (No. J11A15), under collaborative research (20012 and 21002) of the Joint Usage/Research Program of Kanazawa University and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JP18KK0296 and JPJSBP120219915).",,59,1,1,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2022,12,,,,,,1916,10.3390/w14121916,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14121916,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,2M3KQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000817603100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, if marks affect the vital rates or behavior of marked individuals, any conclusions reached by a study might be biased relative to the general population. Leg bands have rarely been found to have negative effects on birds and are frequently used to mark individuals. Leg flags, which are larger, heavier, and might produce more drag than bands, are commonly used on shorebirds and can help improve resighting rates. However, no one to date has assessed the possible effects of leg flags on the demographic performance of shorebirds. At seven sites in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, we marked individuals and monitored nest survival of four species of Arctic-breeding shorebirds, including Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), Western Sandpipers (C. mauri), Red-necked Phalaropes (Phalarope lobatus), and Red Phalaropes (P. fielicarius). We used a daily nest survival model in a Bayesian framework to test for effects of leg flags, relative to birds with only bands, on daily survival rates of 1952 nests. We found no evidence of a difference in nest survival between birds with flags and those with only bands. Our results suggest, therefore, that leg flags have little effect on the nest success of Arctic-breeding sandpipers and phalaropes. Additional studies are needed, however, to evaluate the possible effects of flags on shorebirds that use other habitats and on survival rates of adults and chicks.","[Weiser, Emily L.; Grond, Kirsten; Kwon, Eunbi; Sandercock, Brett K.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 116 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Weiser, Emily L.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, 2630 Fanta Reed Rd, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA; [Lanctot, Richard B.; Gates, H.

However, a major barrier to the identification of the remains of extinct megafaunal species in archaeological and palaeontological sites is the highly fragmented nature of the material, which often precludes confident taxonomic identifications based on morphology. Biomolecular techniques are able to go beyond these limitations and are increasingly being used to make such identifications. Protein analysis offers a promising alternative to DNA techniques because they can be much cheaper, more amenable to high-throughput processing and work on much older specimens. Here we demonstrate the potential of collagen fingerprinting in an Australian context by extracting collagen from 50-ka kangaroo fossils from two caves in Tasmania, and identify several species including the extinct short-faced kangaroo Simosthenurus occidentalis. Importantly, of the five fossil bones sampled that had hitherto been ascribed morphology-based identifications below the family level, three had been incorrectly identified during an initial assessment of photographs taken in the field. Our results highlight the utility of using protein-based methods for making genus-level identification of marsupial bone, especially those that may form a basis for broader arguments such as that of late-surviving megafaunal species.","[Buckley, Michael] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Cosgrove, Richard; Garvey, Jillian] La Trobe Univ, Dept Archaeol & Hist, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Prideaux, Gavin J.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia",University of Manchester; La Trobe University; Flinders University South Australia,"Buckley, M (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England.",m.buckley@manchester.ac.uk,,"Prideaux, Gavin/0000-0002-9958-0265; Buckley, Michael/0000-0002-4166-8213",Royal Society [UF120473]; NERC [NE/K000799/1]; Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering [01/037P]; Australian Research Council [DP120100580]; La Trobe University Research Enhancement Fund; Department of Anthropology University of Utah generously funded the Florentine River Valley megafauna project; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K000799/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Royal Society(Royal Society of London); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); La Trobe University Research Enhancement Fund; Department of Anthropology University of Utah generously funded the Florentine River Valley megafauna project; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The laboratory analyses were funded by a Royal Society university research fellowship to M.B.

In mountain environments, steep topography produces strong gradients in solar insolation, vegetation, and snowpack dynamics that lead to large differences in soil temperature over short distances, suggesting a need for high-resolution, process-based models that quantify the influence of topography. We present soil temperature and snow depth results from a coupled thermo-hydrologic model compared to field observations from Gordon Gulch, a seasonally snow-covered montane catchment in the Colorado Front Range in the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory. The field site features two instrumented hillslopes with opposing aspects: Despite the persistent snowpack on the north-facing slope, seasonally frozen ground is more prevalent there than the south-facing slope, which experiences significantly higher incoming radiation that prevents the persistence of frozen ground. A novel modeling framework is developed by coupling a surface energy balance model incorporating solar radiation and snowpack processes to an existing subsurface model (PFLOTRAN-ICE). The coupled model is used to reproduce strong aspect-controlled differences in soil temperature and snow depth evident from observations during water years 2013-2016, including a higher incidence of frozen ground under the north-facing slope. Representation of the snowpack and its insulating effects significantly improves soil temperature estimates on the north-facing slope, particularly the duration of soil freezing in the spring, which is underestimated by 1-2 months without including the snowpack.","[Rush, M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Rajaram, H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD USA; [Anderson, R.

We tested the role of seabirds as indicators of food web conditions that affect sockeye salmon at sea survival by investigating co-variation between seabirds breeding on the Pribilof Islands and returns of Bristol Bay sockeyes. We examined seabird phenology (hatching dates of eggs) against sockeye returns based on the year of ocean entry. Annual seabird hatching date was inversely related to sockeye returns, with the strongest co-variation found for sockeye which entered the ocean at 2 years of age (age 2x smolts). The mechanism supporting this covariation is unknown, but both birds and salmon may be responding to changes in prey availability (a bottom-up effect). The co-variation between seabird hatching date and sockeye returns supports the idea that variation in seabird breeding parameters indicates food web conditions that also affect other upper trophic level predators in marine systems. Coupling seabird phenology with existing annual predictions for Bristol Bay salmon may improve forecasts and fishery management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism is based on an analysis of extensive observations of particle formation in the BL at a continental surface site. It assumes that molecular clusters form at a rate proportional to the gaseous sulfuric acid concentration to the power of 1. The formation rate of 3 nm diameter observable particles is controlled by the cluster formation rate and the existing particle surface area, which acts to scavenge condensable gases and clusters during growth. Modelled sulfuric acid vapour concentrations, particle formation rates, growth rates, coagulation loss rates, peak particle concentrations, and the daily timing of events in the global model agree well with observations made during a 22-day period of March 2003 at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiala, Finland. The nucleation bursts produce total particle concentrations (>3 nm diameter) often exceeding 10(4) cm(-3), which are sustained for a period of several hours around local midday. The predicted global distribution of particle formation events broadly agrees with what is expected from available observations. Over relatively clean remote continental locations formation events can sustain mean total particle concentrations up to a factor of 8 greater than those resulting from anthropogenic sources of primary organic and black carbon particles. However, in polluted continental regions anthropogenic primary particles dominate particle number and formation events lead to smaller enhancements of up to a factor of 2. Our results therefore suggest that particle concentrations in remote continental regions are dominated by nucleated particles while concentrations in polluted continental regions are dominated by primary particles. The effect of BL particle formation over tropical regions and the Amazon is negligible. These first global particle formation simulations reveal some interesting sensitivities. We show, for example, that significant reductions in primary particle emissions may lead to an increase in total particle concentration because of the coupling between particle surface area and the rate of new particle formation. This result suggests that changes in emissions may have a complicated effect on global and regional aerosol properties. Overall, our results show that new particle formation is a significant component of the aerosol particle number budget.","Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland",University of Leeds; University of Helsinki; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Spracklen, DV (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Atmospher Chem Modelling Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dominick@env.leeds.ac.uk,"Spracklen, Dominick/AAA-6257-2019; Kulmala, Markku T/I-7671-2016; Kerminen, Veli-Matti/M-9026-2014; Carslaw, Ken S/C-8514-2009; Spracklen, Dominick V/B-4890-2014; Mann, Graham/L-9529-2017","Kulmala, Markku T/0000-0003-3464-7825; Carslaw, Ken S/0000-0002-6800-154X; Mann, Graham/0000-0003-1746-2837",,,,,77,251,253,4,53,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

The alpha(DOM)(lambda) was low in contrast to other regions of the Arctic Ocean, while alpha(p)(lambda) has the largest contribution to absorption variability in sea ice and surface waters. alpha(p)(443) was 1.4-2.8 times and 1.3-1.8 times higher than alpha(CDOM)(443) in surface water and sea ice, respectively. alpha(ph)(lambda) contributed 90% and 81% to alpha(p)(lambda), in open leads and under-ice waters column, and much less (53%-74%) in sea ice, respectively. Both alpha(CDOM)(lambda) and alpha(p)(lambda) followed closely the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a in sea ice and the water column. We observed a tenfold increase of the chlorophyll a concentration and nearly twofold increase in absorption at 443 nm in sea ice from winter to spring. The alpha(CDOM)(lambda) dominated the absorption budget in the UV both in sea ice and surface waters. In the visible range, absorption was dominated by alpha(ph)(lambda), which contributed more than 50% and alpha(CDOM)(lambda), which contributed 43% to total absorption in water column. Detrital absorption contributed significantly (33%) only in surface ice layer. Algae dynamics explained more than 90% variability in alpha(p)(lambda) and alpha(ph)(lambda) in water column, but less than 70% in the sea ice. This study presents detailed absorption budget that is relevant for modeling of radiative transfer and primary production.","[Kowalczuk, Piotr; Meler, Justyna; Zablocka, Monika] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland; [Kauko, Hanna M.; Pavlov, Alexey K.; Granskog, Mats A.] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway; [Peeken, Ilka; Castellani, Giulia] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Polar Biol Oceanog, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Dybwad, Christine] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Norwegian Polar Institute; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso","Kowalczuk, P (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland.",piotr@iopan.gda.pl,"Castellani, Giulia/AAS-9298-2021; Meler, Justyna/U-7326-2019","Castellani, Giulia/0000-0001-6151-015X; Meler, Justyna/0000-0002-7112-5041; Kauko, Hanna Maria/0000-0002-3384-6454; Zablocka, Monika/0000-0002-1803-7042; Dybwad, Christine/0000-0001-5930-201X; Peeken, Ilka/0000-0003-1531-1664; Granskog, Mats/0000-0002-5035-4347; Pavlov, Alexey/0000-0002-1978-5368; Kowalczuk, Piotr/0000-0001-6016-0610","Polish-Norwegian Research ProgrammeNational Centre for Research and Development under the Norwegian Financial Mechanism [Pol-Nor/197511/40/2013]; Centre for Ice, Climate and Ecosystems (ICE) at the Norwegian Polar Institute through project N-ICE [N-ICE2015]; Research Council of Norway project [221961/F20, 244646/E10]; Helmholtz Association Young Investigators Group Iceflux Ice-ecosystem carbon flux in polar oceans [VH-NG-800]","Polish-Norwegian Research ProgrammeNational Centre for Research and Development under the Norwegian Financial Mechanism; Centre for Ice, Climate and Ecosystems (ICE) at the Norwegian Polar Institute through project N-ICE; Research Council of Norway project(Research Council of Norway); Helmholtz Association Young Investigators Group Iceflux Ice-ecosystem carbon flux in polar oceans","This work was supported by the Polish-Norwegian Research Programme operated by the National Centre for Research and Development under the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 in the frame of Project Contract Pol-Nor/197511/40/2013, CDOM-HEAT.

To investigate the development of these abilities, we designed a new evolutionary agent-based system where agents start with no executable functions nor with the inherent ability to recognize other elements in their environment. Instead, the agents can only perceive externally visible properties (phenotype) of other agents initially. Over the course of evolution they gradually construct their own reactions to perceived properties. To minimize constraints on the building of adaptations, the only measure of success in our model is the agents' ability to survive and reproduce. To survive, agents need to collect energy by learning to recognize and feed on either other agents or on primary food. We ran a series of experimental runs where we compared evolutionary development of agents between two settings: s(+) where agents are allowed to develop awareness of their environment and s(-) where they are completely ignorant of it. In the case of s(+) evolution, the system settled on cyclic interdependent swings between a large number of prey and much smaller number of predators, as in real ecological systems. Our results show that in s(+) setting, the agent's early evolutionary focus is to, as soon as possible, expand their ability to perceptively assimilate environment and to functionally categorize environment by developing a variety of adaptive responses to newly assimilated environmental properties.","[Balaz, Igor] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Lab Meteorol Biophys & Phys, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 8, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Schneider-Kitamura, Eugene] Kobe Univ, Dept Planetary Sci, Nada Ku, Rokkodai Cho 1-1, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",University of Novi Sad; Kobe University,"Balaz, I (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Lab Meteorol Biophys & Phys, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 8, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",igor.balaz@df.uns.ac.rs,,,European Union [691998]; Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [43007],"European Union(European Commission); Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This paper is supported by the following projects: (i) H2020 SERBIA FOR EXCELL project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 691998; and (ii) 'Studying climate change and its influence on the environment: impacts, adaptation and mitigation' (43007) financed by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia within the framework of integrated and interdisciplinary research for the period of 2011 - 2018.",,29,0,0,0,0,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,,,,,2018,,,,,428,435,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BO1CE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000494826700080,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observations have led to the hypothesis that the storm, which formed over the Tibetan Plateau, was steered over the steep edge of the plateau by 500-hPa winds and then energized by the ingestion of lower-level moist air, which was approaching from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal and rose up the Himalayan barrier. A coupled land surface and atmospheric model simulation validates this hypothesized storm scenario, with the model storm taking the form of a traveling mesoscale squall line with a leading convective line, trailing stratiform region, and midlevel inflow jet. In this region, the development of a mesoscale storm over high terrain is highly unusual, especially one in the form of a propagating squall line system. This unusual storm occurrence and behavior could serve as a warning sign in flash flood prediction. The coupled atmosphere and land surface model showed that the excessive runoff leading to the flood and landslide were favored by the occurrence of this unusual meteorological event coinciding temporally and spatially with favorable hydrologic conditions. Additionally, the model simulations showed that previous rainstorms had moistened the soil during the entire season and especially over the few days leading up to the Leh flood, so the normally arid mountainsides were likely not able to rapidly absorb the additional rainfall of the sudden 5 August squall line.","[Kumar, Anil; Peters-Lidard, Christa] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20770 USA; [Kumar, Anil] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Houze, Robert A., Jr.; Rasmussen, Kristen L.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kumar, A (corresponding author), NASA, Hydrol Sci Branch, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Code 617, Greenbelt, MD 20770 USA.",anil.kumar@nasa.gov,"Peters-Lidard, Christa D/E-1429-2012; Rasmussen, Kristen/J-6421-2014","Peters-Lidard, Christa D/0000-0003-1255-2876; Rasmussen, Kristen/0000-0003-1321-0974","NSF Grants [ATM-0820586, AGS-1144105]; NASA Grants [NNX10AH70G, NNX11AL65H]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration grants from the NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (MAP) Program","NSF Grants(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA Grants; National Aeronautics and Space Administration grants from the NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (MAP) Program","This research was sponsored by NSF Grants ATM-0820586 and AGS-1144105 and NASA Grants NNX10AH70G and NNX11AL65H (Dr. Ramesh Kakar).

Nevertheless, these amphidromous gobies have only occasionally been recorded in Australia, and this probably relates to the existence of limited suitable habitat (perennial streams that drain steep coastal mountain ranges and enter the sea via poorly developed estuaries). We provide new records of the distribution of sicydiine gobies within Australia, and review the Australian biogeography of the group to confirm at least seven species from four genera (Sicyopterus Sicyopus Smilosicyopus Stiphodon) occur in north-eastern Australia (North Queensland). We provide the first Australian records of three species: Sicyopus discordipinnis, Smilosicyopus sp. and Stiphodon birdsong. Current records of sicydiines in Australia are centred on and are almost exclusive to the Wet Tropics region, spanning just a few hundred kilometres of coastline. Longitudinal within-stream distributions of the fauna are species-specific (and to a large extent, genus-specific) corresponding with altitude and migration ability in relation to instream barriers (e.g., waterfalls). Sicydiines are colourful, and attractive to aquarists. This in combination with the apparently low densities and restricted ranges of sicydiines in Australia, suggests that collecting, should be limited, at least until the population structure and ecology of these assemblages is better understood.","[Ebner, Brendan C.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ebner, Brendan C.] Pigfish, Mareeba, Qld 4880, Australia; [Thuesen, Paul A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Thuesen, Paul A.] Dept Employment Econ Dev & Innovat, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Larson, Helen K.] Museum & Art Gallery No Terr, Darwin, NT 0820, Australia; [Keith, Philippe] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR BOREA 7208, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Griffith University; James Cook University; Northern Territory Government; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN),"Ebner, BC (corresponding author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Trop Landscapes Joint Venture, 47 Maunds Rd, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia.",Brendan.Ebner@csiro.au; paul.thuesen@gmail.com; eviotahkl@gmail.com; keith@mnhn.fr,,,,,,,71,13,16,1,14,SOC FRANCAISE D ICHTYOLOGIE,PARIS,"MUSEUM NATL D HISTOIRE NATURELLE, 43 RUE CUVIER, 75231 PARIS, FRANCE",0399-0974,,,CYBIUM,Cybium,31-Dec,2011,4,,,,397,414,,,,,,18,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,941FS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000303949700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Exe catchment lay beyond the maximum extent of Pleistocene ice sheets and the drainage pattern evolved from the Tertiary to the Middle Pleistocene, by which time the major valley systems were in place and downcutting began to create a staircase of strath terraces. The higher terraces (8-6) typically exhibit altitudinal overlap or appear to be draped over the landscape, whilst the middle terraces show greater altitudinal separation and the lowest terraces are of a cut and fill form The terrace deposits investigated in this study were deposited in cold phases of the glacial-interglacial Milankovitch climatic cycles with the lowest four being deposited in the Devensian Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 4-2. A new cascade process-response model is proposed of basin terrace evolution in the Exe valley, which emphasises the role of lateral erosion in the creation of strath terraces and the reworking of inherited resistant lithological components down through the staircase The resultant emergent valley topography and the reworking of artefacts along with gravel clasts, have important implications for the dating of hominin presence and the local landscapes they inhabited. Whilst the terrace chronology suggested here is still not as detailed as that for the Thames or the Solent System it does indicate a Middle Palaeolithic hominin presence in the region, probably prior to the late Wolstonian Complex or MIS 6 This supports existing data from cave sites in South West England (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved","[Brown, A.

Prior to January 2015, the ship used a heavy fuel oil (FIFO) but switched to a low sulfur residual marine fuel oil (RMB30) after the implementation of the new FSC limit. The emitted particulate matter (PM) was measured in terms of mass, number, size distribution, volatility, elemental composition, content of organics, black and elemental carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), microstructure and micro-composition, along with the gaseous emissions at different operating conditions. The fuel change reduced emissions of PM mass up to 67%. The number of particles emitted remained unchanged and were dominated by nanoparticles. Furthermore, the fuel change resulted in an 80% reduction of SO2 emissions and decreased emissions of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emissions of both monoaromatic and lighter polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds increased with RMB30, while the heavy, PM-bound PAH species that belong to the carcinogenic PAH family were reduced. Emissions of BC remained similar between the two fuels. This study indicates that the use of low-sulfur residual marine fuel oil is a way to comply with the new FSC regulation and will reduce the anthropogenic load of SO2 emissions and secondary PM formed from SO2, Emissions of primary particles, however, remain unchanged and do not decrease as much as would be expected if distilled fuel was used. This applies both to the number of particles emitted and some toxic components, such as heavy metals, PAHs or elemental carbon (EC). The micro-composition analyses showed that the soot particles emitted from RMB30 combustion often do not have any trace of sulfur compared with particles from HFO combustion, which always have a sulfur content over 1%m/m. The soot sulfur content can impact aging and cloud condensation properties. This study is an in-depth comparison of the impact of these two fuels on the emissions of particles as well as their composition and microstructure. To evaluate the impact of the use of low-sulfur residual marine fuel oils on emissions from ships, additional research is needed to investigate the varied fuel types and compositions as well as the wide range of engine conditions and properties.

It has an area of 36,735 m(2) and maximum depth of 25 m. Four sediment cores along a depth transect provide a 4-ka record of the evolution of the eastern deep basin (core PC1 at 25 m depth) and the shallow margin (cores PC2-4 at 0.25-5 m depth). PC1 shows the effect of water-level rise and flooding of the shallow margin (2.8-1.8 ka) through a lithological (organic to carbonate) and geochemical (mu XRF; decreased Ti, Fe, K and Ca) change along with a reduction in sediment accumulation (0.2927 to 0.0343 cm year(-1)). This change in sedimentation matches basal ages of PC2 and PC4 at 2.5 and 1.8 ka respectively, indicating water-level rise and flooding of the shallowly sloped margin which is within estimates of Holocene sea-level rise thus indicating connection with the aquifer. Corroborating evidence for connection with the aquifer comes from water-level monitoring (30 min intervals; 6 months December 12, 2018 to June 6, 2019) which shows a semi-diurnal tidal fluctuation (1-1.5 cm). Droughts have been thoroughly discussed as a proponent of the decline of the Classic Maya, with lakes being inferred to be isolated from the aquifer and experiencing water level drawdown. However, during the Classic Maya droughts lake drawdown in Pac Chen would be minimal, and there is no evidence of a water level drop in our lake margin stratigraphy (PC2-4). Water mass characteristics measured in March 2016 (temperature, conductivity) indicate some hydrological isolation from the aquifer. This isolation would have allowed for recording of environmental changes, but also likely changed through time as flooding of the lake progressed. The shallow margin core PC4, however, recorded several rapid drops in K and Fe from 1100 to 975, and 925-875 yr BP, which we interpret as periods of reduced inputs of terrigenous weathering during times of reduced rainfall and runoff. These periods are consistent with other regional paleoclimate records (lake and speleothem) of the Classic Maya droughts (1200-850 yr BP).","[Krywy-Janzen, Anya; Reinhardt, Eduard; McNeill-Jewer, Chelsi] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Coutino, Aaron; Stastna, Marek] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Waltham, Brenda] Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Rissolo, Dominique] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci Art Architecture & Arch, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Meacham, Sam] CINDAQ Ctr Invest Sistema Acuifero Quintana Roo A, Puerto Aventuras, Mexico; [van Hengstum, Peter] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, Galveston, TX 77553 USA",McMaster University; University of Waterloo; Carleton University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Texas A&M University System,"Krywy-Janzen, A (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",krywyja@mcmaster.ca,"van Hengstum, Pete/AHC-5291-2022","Stastna, Marek/0000-0003-1770-2044; Krywy-Janzen, Anya/0000-0003-1003-8363","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [EGR-RGPIN/05725-2015, MS-RGPIN/37157-2015]; National Science Foundation [1703087]; Canada Foundation for Innovation John R.

We assess this coevolution in granodiorite from Monterey Peninsula, California, by measuring changes in bulk chemistry, mineralogy, volumetric strain, the oxidation state of Fe in biotite crystals, tensile strength, abrasion rate, connected porosity, and hydraulic conductivity in samples covering a range of weathering grades. We identify the oxidative dissolution of biotite as the key chemical reaction because of the volumetric expansion that accompanies formation of altered biotite and precipitation of ferrihydrite. We show how the associated accumulation of elastic strain produces an energy density that is sufficient to support rock fracturing over length scales equivalent to constituent crystals. The resulting intragranular and intergranular cracking profoundly reduces tensile strength and increases the abrasion rate, connected porosity, and hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix. These changes increase the rate of plagioclase weathering, and ultimately the rock disintegrates into grus and clay. Major changes in rock properties can occur with only minor element leaching, and the threshold behavior of weathering that arises from the coevolution of chemical, hydrological, and mechanical properties may be difficult to capture using simplified weathering models that fail to incorporate these properties. Our results, which combine the mechanical and hydrological evolution of weathering rock with more common measurements of chemical changes, should help to more accurately model the effects of, and mechanical and hydrological feedbacks upon, chemical weathering of rock.","[Goodfellow, Bradley W.; Hilley, George E.; Moon, Seulgi] Stanford Univ, Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Goodfellow, Bradley W.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Goodfellow, Bradley W.] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Lund, Sweden; [Webb, Samuel M.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Sklar, Leonard S.; Olson, Christopher A.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Moon, Seulgi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Earth Planetary & Space Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Stanford University; Stockholm University; Lund University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; California State University System; San Francisco State University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Goodfellow, BW (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Goodfellow, BW (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.;Goodfellow, BW (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Lund, Sweden.",bradley.goodfellow@geo.su.se,"Webb, Samuel M/D-4778-2009","Webb, Samuel M/0000-0003-1188-0464; Moon, Seulgi/0000-0001-5207-1781","Birgit and Helmuth Hertz's Foundation, through the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund; Wenner Gren Foundation in Stockholm; Terman Fellowship; Doris and David Fund for Hydrologic Science at SFSU","Birgit and Helmuth Hertz's Foundation, through the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund; Wenner Gren Foundation in Stockholm; Terman Fellowship; Doris and David Fund for Hydrologic Science at SFSU","We thank Oliver Chadwick, Heather Buss, Marjorie Schulz (especially), and Art White for helpful discussions on chemical weathering and Keith Loague for advice on permeability measurements and the use of his combination permeameter.

A survey in peer-reviewed literature and Dutch grey-literature was performed to gain insight into the physical-, chemical- and biological in-lake interventions used to bring these waters towards their desired state. A critical overview is presented on efficacy of different measures to counteract cyanobacterial blooms directly via targeting the cyanobacteria or indirectly via reduction of nutrient availability. Many actions have no or limited effects on minimising cyanobacterial blooms (air-bubble- or oil screens, surface mixers, low-energy ultrasound, effective micro-organisms, fish introduction), while others are more effective, but may vary in longevity and costs (dams, excavation or dredging, hydrogen peroxide, phosphorus inactivation agents), meet legislation restrictions (copper-based algaecides, herbicides, dreissenids), or are not currently implemented (hypolimnetic withdrawal). The selection of promising interventions requires a proper diagnosis of each problem lake, based on water- and nutrient fluxes, the biology of the lake (plants, fish), the function of the lake and the characteristics of the method, such as efficacy, costs, safety and ease of implementation.

The various characteristics of computational approaches are listed and collated by means of comparison among the principal modelling methods as well as among the respective computational tools that may be used for simulation and decision-making purposes. Insights of coupling between building energy and urban microclimate models are also presented. The main goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of available simulation methods that can be used at the early design stages for planning retrofitting strategies and guiding engineers and technical professionals through the simulation tools' options oriented to the considered case study.","[Stavrakakis, George M.; Al Katsaprakakis, Dimitris] Hellen Mediterranean Univ HMU, Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn, GR-71410 Iraklion, Greece; [Stavrakakis, George M.] MES Energy SA, 67 Aeolou Str, GR-10559 Athens, Greece; [Damasiotis, Markos] Ctr Renewable Energy Sources & Saving CRES, Div Dev Programmes, 19th Km Marathonos Av, GR-19009 Pikermi, Greece",,"Stavrakakis, GM (corresponding author), Hellen Mediterranean Univ HMU, Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn, GR-71410 Iraklion, Greece.;Stavrakakis, GM (corresponding author), MES Energy SA, 67 Aeolou Str, GR-10559 Athens, Greece.",georgstavr@gmail.com; dkatsap@hmu.gr; mdamas@cres.gr,,"Katsaprakakis, Dimitris/0000-0003-3874-6628; Stavrakakis, George/0000-0002-0760-8057",PROGRAMME MED EUROPEAN TERRITORIAL COOPERATION 2007-2013 [1C-MED12-73],PROGRAMME MED EUROPEAN TERRITORIAL COOPERATION 2007-2013,"Part of this research was funded by the PROGRAMME MED EUROPEAN TERRITORIAL COOPERATION 2007-2013, project: REPUBLIC-MED, grant number: 1C-MED12-73.",,145,2,2,8,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,OCT,2021,20,,,,,,6707,10.3390/en14206707,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14206707,,,41,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,YN1FN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000747011400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We track the distribution and direct radiative forcing of aerosols, including sulfate and black and organic carbon, emitted from major source regions (North America, Europe, south Asia, Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa). We also partition the emissions by sector, including industrial, power, residential, transport, biomass burning, and natural. Southeast Asia produces 15% and 10% of the world's black carbon and sulfate and exports over 2/ 3 of this burden over the Northern Hemisphere. About 1/ 2 of the SO2 emitted by Southeast Asia and Europe is not converted to sulfate because of oxidant limitation. Although Africa has the largest biomass burning emissions, South America generates a larger (about 20% of the global carbonaceous) aerosol burden; about 1/ 2 of this burden is exported and dominates the carbonaceous aerosol load in the Southern Hemisphere. Calculated direct anthropogenic radiative forcings are -0.29, -0.06, and 0.24 W m(-2) for sulfate, organic, and black carbon, respectively. The largest BC radiative forcings are from residential (0.09 W m(-2)) and transport (0.06 W m(-2)) sectors, making these potential targets to counter global warming. However, scattering components within these sectors reduce these to 0.04 and 0.03 W m(-2), respectively. Most anthropogenic sulfate comes from power and industry sectors, and these sectors are responsible for the large negative aerosol forcings over the central Northern Hemisphere.","Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Hydrol & Geoenvironm Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Koch, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",dkoch@giss.nasa.gov,"van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016; Bond, Tami/A-1317-2013; Unger, Nadine/AAI-4462-2021; Unger, Nadine/M-9360-2015","van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; Bond, Tami/0000-0001-5968-8928; Unger, Nadine/0000-0001-7739-2290; Streets, David/0000-0002-0223-1350",,,,,49,172,177,3,70,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Eutrophication may cause a switch from the clear to the turbid state, if the phosphorus loading exceeds a critical value. Recovery of the clear state is difficult as the critical loading for the switch back during oligotrophication is often lower. A system of interacting ecological processes makes both states stabilize themselves causing the observed hysteresis. The ecosystem of shallow lakes is analysed with PCLake, a dynamic model of nutrient cycling and biota - including phytoplankton, rnacrophytes and a simplified food web. The model was used to calculate the switchpoints in terms of critical phosphorus loading levels for a number of lake types. It turned out that the predicted critical phosphorus loadings differ per lake type, e.g. they decrease with lake area, mean depth and retention time, increase with relative marsh area and fishing intensity, and differ per sediment type. The findings were grossly comparable with empirical evidence. These outcomes were also used to build a metamodel. The results may be useful for lake management, by comparing the critical loadings for a given lake with the actual loading. If the actual loading clearly exceeds the upper switchpoint, nutrient reduction measures are recommended. If the loading approaches the upper switchpoint, or is in the intermediate range, a manager could try to increase the critical loading values of the lake, e.g. by hydromorphological measures. If the loading is well between the two switchpoints, an alternative is to force a switch by direct food web management. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.","[Domis, Lisette N.

However, existing literature has revealed that PPSs cannot achieve the expected permeability and evaporation. To overcome this gap, this study presents an elaborate review of problems associated with PPSs and highlights its benefits to stormwater management and UHI mitigation. We determined key parameters of PPSs that could influence urban flooding and UHI mitigation, including hydrological properties, thermal physical properties, structure design, and clogging resistance. We identified the co-benefits approach of PPS towards performance synergism on stormwater management and UHI mitigation from quality controlled design and fabrication, periodic maintenance, and effective evaluation system based on practice environments. The results indicate that existing studies of PPSs primarily focus on permeability, while little emphasis is given to the evaporative cooling performance, leading to a biased development with a loss of test standards and regulations that cannot control the cooling potential of the system. The performance synergism of permeability and evaporative cooling in PPS should be studied further, while considering quality control of the materials and in-situ practice design. Parameter controls (with commonly used standards) during fabrication, periodic maintenance (during operation), and pre- and post-evaluation processes of PPSs should work collectively to achieve optimal benefits and reduced costs.","[Wang, Junsong; Qi, Qianlong; Tan, Kanghao; He, Bao-Jie] South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zou, Ya] Guangzhou City Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, Guangzhou 510813, Peoples R China; [Santamouris, Mat; He, Bao-Jie] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [He, Bao-Jie] Chongqing Univ, Ctr Climate Resilient & Low Carbon Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie] Chongqing Univ, Inst Smart City Chongqing Univ Liyang, Chongqing 213300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Bao-Jie] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab New Technol Construction Cities Mt Area, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; University of New South Wales Sydney; Chongqing University; Chongqing University; Chongqing University,"Tan, KH (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",haokangtan@163.com,"kanghao, Tan/GNM-9884-2022; He, Baojie/J-4430-2019; He, Bao-jie/ABC-5621-2020; Wang, Junsong/GNH-4461-2022","He, Baojie/0000-0002-8841-0711; He, Bao-jie/0000-0002-8841-0711; Wang, Junsong/0000-0002-2401-5771","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52008173]; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2022A1515010788]; National Key R & D Program of China [2021YFC2009400]; State Key Lab of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology [2021ZB20]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M682706]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); National Key R & D Program of China; State Key Lab of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This work is jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 52008173) , Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (no. 2022A1515010788) , National Key R & D Program of China (no. 2021YFC2009400) , State Key Lab of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology (no. 2021ZB20) , and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (no. 2020M682706) .",,192,18,18,42,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0043-1354,1879-2448,,WATER RES,Water Res.,1-Aug,2022,,,,,,,118755,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118755,,,24,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,2L3CW,35728492,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000816897500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, estimating and understanding forest carbon and its spatiotemporal variations requires diverse knowledge from multiple research domains, none of which currently offer a complete understanding of forest carbon dynamics. New large-area forest information products derived from remotely sensed data provide unprecedented spatial and temporal information about our forests, which is information that is currently underutilized in forest carbon models. Our goal in this communication is to articulate the information needs of next-generation forest carbon models in order to enable the remote sensing community to realize the best and most useful application of its science, and perhaps also inspire increased collaboration across these research fields. While remote sensing science currently provides important contributions to large-scale forest carbon models, more coordinated efforts to integrate remotely sensed data into carbon models can aid in alleviating some of the main limitations of these models; namely, low sample sizes and poor spatial representation of field data, incomplete population sampling (i.e., managed forests exclusively), and an inadequate understanding of the processes that influence forest carbon accumulation and fluxes across spatiotemporal scales. By articulating the information needs of next-generation forest carbon models, we hope to bridge the knowledge gap between remote sensing experts and forest carbon modelers, and enable advances in large-area forest carbon modeling that will ultimately improve estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes.","[Boisvenue, Celine; White, Joanne C.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Boisvenue, C (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",celine.boisvenue@canada.ca; joanne.white@canada.ca,"White, Joanne C./Z-1981-2019","White, Joanne C./0000-0003-4674-0373; Boisvenue, Celine/0000-0002-6031-7961",,,,,149,15,16,6,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,2-Feb,2019,4,,,,,,463,10.3390/rs11040463,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11040463,,,16,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,HO2SL,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000460766100093,View Full Record in Web of Science

To inform management, forest dynamics models provide an increasingly diverse and valuable portfolio of tools for projecting forest change under different management and environmental conditions. Yet, many models may not be appropriate or feasible to use in small forest management because of their design for larger-scale applications, the information needed to initialize models, or discrepancies between model outputs and information relevant for small forest management objectives. This review explores the suitability of 54 existing forest dynamics models to inform the management of small forests. We evaluated the characteristics of each model using five criteria with implications for small forest management: spatial resolution, number of species the model can simulate, inclusion of spatial structure, modeling approach, and mechanistic detail. While numerous models can be suitable under certain conditions, the review criteria led us to conclude that two models offered the broadest versatility and usability for small forest contexts, SORTIE and FORMIND. This review can help orient and guide small forest managers who wish to add modeling to their forest management efforts.","[Benson, Dessa L.; King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [O'Brien, Joseph J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Ctr Forest Disturbance Sci, Southern Res Stn, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Benson, DL (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",dessdunn@uga.edu; egking@uga.edu; jjobrien.cfds@gmail.com,,,Jekyll Island Authority Research Grant; National Institute for Food and Agriculture (U.S.) McIntire-Stennis Grant [GEOZ0184-MS]; Golley Memorial Scholarship at the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology,Jekyll Island Authority Research Grant; National Institute for Food and Agriculture (U.S.) McIntire-Stennis Grant; Golley Memorial Scholarship at the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology,"This research was funded by a Jekyll Island Authority Research Grant, National Institute for Food and Agriculture (U.S.) McIntire-Stennis Grant number GEOZ0184-MS, and Golley Memorial Scholarship at the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology.",,111,1,1,10,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2022,4,,,,,,515,10.3390/f13040515,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13040515,,,25,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Forestry,0R3NA,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000785505000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Shipping emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in air over the Baltic Sea are of similar magnitude (330 kt yr(-1)) as the combined land-based NOx emissions from Finland and Sweden in all emission sectors. Deposition of nitrogen compounds originating from shipping activities contribute to eutrophication of the Baltic Sea and coastal areas in the Baltic Sea region. For the North Sea and the Baltic Sea a nitrogen emission control area (NECA) will become effective in 2021; in accordance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) target of reducing NOx emissions from ships. Future scenarios for 2040 were designed to study the effect of enforced and planned regulation of ship emissions and the fuel efficiency development on air quality and nitrogen deposition. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to simulate the current and future air quality situation. The meteorological fields, the emissions from ship traffic and the emissions from land-based sources were considered at a grid resolution of 4 x 4 km(2) for the Baltic Sea region in nested CMAQ simulations. Model simulations for the present-day (2012) air quality show that shipping emissions are the major contributor to atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over the Baltic Sea. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, with the introduction of the NECA, NOx emissions from ship traffic in the Baltic Sea are reduced by about 80 % in 2040. An approximate linear relationship was found between ship emissions of NOx and the simulated levels of annual average NO2 over the Baltic Sea in the year 2040, when following different future shipping scenarios. The burden of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the Baltic Sea region is predicted to decrease by 35 %-37 % between 2012 and 2040. The reduction in PM2.5 is larger over sea, where it drops by 50 %-60 % along the main shipping routes, and is smaller over the coastal areas. The introduction of NECA is critical for reducing ship emissions of NOx to levels that are low enough to sustainably dampen ozone (O-3) production in the Baltic Sea region. A second important effect of the NECA over the Baltic Sea region is the reduction in secondary formation of particulate nitrate. This lowers the ship-related PM2.5 by 72% in 2040 compared to the present day, while it is reduced by only 48% without implementation of the NECA. The effect of a lower fuel efficiency development on the absolute ship contribution of air pollutants is limited. Still, the annual mean ship contributions in 2040 to NO2, sulfur dioxide and PM2.5 and daily maximum O-3 are significantly higher if a slower fuel efficiency development is assumed. Nitrogen deposition to the seawater of the Baltic Sea decreases on average by 40 %-44 % between 2012 and 2040 in the simulations. The effect of the NECA on nitrogen deposition is most significant in the western part of the Baltic Sea. It will be important to closely monitor compliance of individual ships with the enforced and planned emission regulations.","[Karl, Matthias; Bieser, Johannes; Geyer, Beate; Matthias, Volker] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka; Johansson, Lasse] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, POB 503, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Fridell, Erik] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, POB 53021, S-40014 Gothenburg, Sweden",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Finnish Meteorological Institute; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute,"Karl, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",matthias.karl@hzg.de,"Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka/AAL-8095-2021","Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka/0000-0001-8454-4109; Geyer, Beate/0000-0001-8017-3136; Matthias, Volker/0000-0003-0519-8805; Karl, Matthias/0000-0002-0821-018X",BONUS SHEBA (Sustainable Shipping and Environment of the Baltic Sea region); EU [185]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0720A]; Innovation Fund Denmark; Estonian Research Council; National Centre of Research and Development (Poland); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Academy of Finland,BONUS SHEBA (Sustainable Shipping and Environment of the Baltic Sea region); EU(European Commission); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Innovation Fund Denmark; Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); National Centre of Research and Development (Poland); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This work is part of the BONUS SHEBA (Sustainable Shipping and Environment of the Baltic Sea region) research project under Call 2014-41.

Typically, a great focus is given to criteria such as data availability, scientific basis, or measurability. Features associated with the indicator's performance such as sensitivity or robustness are often neglected due to the lack of quantitative validation tools. In this paper, we present a simple but flexible framework for selecting and validating the performance of food web indicators. In specific, we suggest a 7-step process in which indicator performances at a regional scale are quantified and visualized allowing for the selection of complementary indicator suites. We demonstrate its application by comparing the performance of pelagic food web indicators for three basins of the Baltic Sea and by assessing the food web status based on selected indicator suites. Our analysis sheds light on spatial differences in indicator performances with respect to direct and indirect pressures, the role of non-linearity and non-additivity in pressure responses, as well as relationships between indicators caused by species interactions. Moreover, our results suggest that the present food web states in the Bornholm and Gotland basins of the Baltic Sea deviate distinctly from an earlier reference period. We advocate the use of our quantitative framework as decision-support tool for selecting suites of complementary indicators under given management schemes such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.","[Otto, Saskia A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Otto, Saskia A.; Kadin, Martina; Blenckner, Thorsten] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kadin, Martina] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St,Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, SE-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Torres, Maria A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Skolgatan 6, SE-74242 Oregrund, Sweden; [Torres, Maria A.] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal",University of Hamburg; Stockholm University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Universidade do Algarve,"Otto, SA (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.",saskia.otto@uni-hamburg.de,"; Torres, Maria Angeles/K-2168-2017","Kadin, Martina/0000-0002-4706-7267; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236; Torres, Maria Angeles/0000-0003-4922-1894; Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [20704801]; Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - EU; Swedish Research Council FORMAS,Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - EU; Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"We would like to thank colleagues from the Department of Fish Resources Research, Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health and Environment (BIOR) in Latvia, the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE), the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemiinde (IOW) in Germany, and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) for maintaining these extensive long-term monitoring programs.

In the present study, we studied the world distribution patterns of polychaetes based on datasets obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System and our recently published checklist of Indonesian polychaete species. Polychaete biogeographic regions were visualized using 'Infomap Bioregions', and the latitudinal species richness gradient of the animals was examined using 3 metrics, i.e. alpha, gamma and estimated species richness (the last metric was adjusted for sampling bias). We identified 11 major polychaete biogeographic regions. The North Atlantic, Australia and Indonesia were the top 3 species-rich biogeographic regions in the world. The total number of polychaete species was higher in the southern hemisphere (similar to 2100 species, 67 families) than in the northern hemisphere (similar to 1800 species, 75 families) despite significantly more data in the latter (>500000 records compared to >26 000 records). Contrary to the classical idea of a unimodal distribution pattern, the latitudinal gradient of polychaetes was generally bimodal with a pronounced dip north of the Equator (15 degrees N). We suggest that the slightly higher peak of species richness in the southern (30 degrees S) than in the northern (60 degrees N) hemisphere reflects higher southern endemicities. These patterns are unlikely to be due to sampling bias but rather represent a natural phenomenon, and we found them most significantly correlated with sea temperature.","[Pamungkas, Joko] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Pamungkas, Joko] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Biol, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia; [Glasby, Christopher J.] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT 0820, Australia; [Costello, Mark J.] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Costello, Mark J.] Nord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, N-8049 Bodo, Norway",University of Auckland; Indonesian Institute of Sciences; University of Auckland; Nord University,"Pamungkas, J (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.;Pamungkas, J (corresponding author), Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Biol, Cibinong 16911, Indonesia.",joko.pamungkas@lipi.go.id,,,New Zealand ASEAN Scholarship (NZAS),New Zealand ASEAN Scholarship (NZAS),"We thank Chhaya Chaudhary, Dinusha Jayathilake and Hanieh Saeedi for useful discussions about dataset cleaning and analyses, and Thomas Morris and Han-Yang Lin for the help with R and GMED data analyses, respectively.

Many authors have also suggested that during some of these humid periods very large lakes, termed megalakes, developed in several basins within the Sahara. Recent work has questioned their existence. In particular it has been argued that the lack of well-developed and spatially extensive shorelines in these basins suggests that discrete groundwater and spring deposits have been misinterpreted as evidence for megalakes. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence used to identify megalakes. Firstly, we apply a comprehensive remote sensing and GIS analyses to the megalake shorelines, their catchments and the wider Sahara. This not only supports the previously proposed existence of numerous megalakes, but also indicates a previously unrecognised megalake in the Niger Inland Delta region, here named Megalake Timbuktu. Secondly, we review the geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for the megalakes, highlighting the importance of the sedimentary record in identifying lake highstands, particularly through the example of the Chotts Megalake in southern Tunisia where we provide new sedimentary information on lake shorelines. This analysis demonstrates that in much of the Sahara the dynamic aeolian systems preclude the preservation of well-developed shorelines, but the distribution of fragmented geomorphic features and localised lake deposits provide robust evidence for Quaternary megalake formation. The paper concludes by highlighting that although extensive evidence for Saharan megalake formation exists, the current chronology of lake highstands indicates that the vast majority date to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 or earlier. Only megalakes Chad and Timbuktu, which derive much of their water from outside the desert, show evidence for Holocene (African Humid Period or AHP) shorelines. The AHP record of the other megalakes indicate the existence of much smaller water bodies than those that developed earlier in the Pleistocene indicating that it was significantly drier than these earlier humid phases.

Here, we present the first 4 months of data from the new TCCON site in Burgos, initial comparisons with satellite measurements of CO2 and model simulations of CO. A nearest sounding from Japan's GOSAT as well as target mode observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) showed very good consistency in the retrieved column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2, yielding TCCON - satellite differences of 0.86 +/- 1.06 ppm for GOSAT and 0.83 +/- 1.22 ppm for OCO-2. We also show measurements of enhanced CO, probably from East Asia. GEOS-Chem model simulations were used to study the observed CO variability. However, despite the model capturing the pattern of the CO variability, there is an obvious underestimation in the CO magnitude in the model. We conclude that more measurements and modeling are necessary to adequately sample the variability over different seasons and to determine the suitability of current inventories.","[Velazco, Voltaire A.; Bukosa, Beata; Deutscher, Nicholas M.; Griffith, David W.

To understand the consequences of marine debris to wildlife populations, studies must go beyond reporting the incidence of wildlife and debris interactions and aim to quantify the harm resulting from these interactions. Tubenosed seabirds are globally threatened, with a near universal risk of debris ingestion and an unquantified risk of mortality due to eating plastics. In this paper, we explore the mortality risk narrative due to the acute effects of debris ingestion, and quantify behavioural and ecological factors including age, diet and foraging method. We examined ingested debris loads, types and mortality of 972 adult and immature seabirds across 17 albatross, shearwater and prion species in a global seabird biodiversity hotspot. Though age and foraging method interact to influence the incidence and number of items ingested, age and diet were the most important factors influencing mortality. Mortality is influenced by debris load and type of debris ingested and there is selectivity for items that visually resemble a seabird's prey. Immature birds that forage on cephalopods are more likely to ingest and die from eating debris than are adults. Conversely, the risk of death to seabirds that forage on crustaceans is linked to the number of plastic items ingested and is higher in adults. Debris ingestion is an under-recognised cause of tubenose mortality and is likely negatively affecting rare and threatened species.","[Roman, Lauren; Hardesty, Britta Denise; Wilcox, Chris] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Roman, Lauren; Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst CRC, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Roman, L (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Roman, L (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",lauren.roman@utas.edu.au,"Roman, Lauren/K-3804-2015","Roman, Lauren/0000-0003-3591-4905; Hindell, Mark/0000-0002-7823-7185",BirdLife Australia's Australian Bird Environment Foundation; Australian Wildlife Society; Ecological Society of Australia's Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,BirdLife Australia's Australian Bird Environment Foundation; Australian Wildlife Society; Ecological Society of Australia's Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,"The authors would like to acknowledge the following Australian and New Zealand organizations who have supported this seabird sampling for this project, provided facilities and storage, and assisted with the collection of, veterinary examination of and care of seabirds used in this study: Auckland War Memorial Museum, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, Australian Museum, Australian Seabird Rescue Inc, BirdLife Australia, BirdLife Tasmania, Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, Currumbin Sanctuary Wildlife Hospital, Department of Conservation (New Zealand), Department of Environment and Science (QLD Australia), Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS Australia), Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA Australia), Friends of Shorebirds SA, Holistic Vets Tauranga, Melbourne Museum, Moreton Bay Research Station, Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Pelican and Seabird Rescue, Queensland Museum, RSPCA QLD Wildlife Hospital, South Australian Museum, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Te Papa Museum, University of Queensland, University of Western Australia and Wildlife Management International.

Marine debris ingestion is a globally recognized threat to marine biodiversity, yet the relationship between how much debris a bird ingests and mortality remains poorly understood. Using cause of death data from 1733 seabirds of 51 species, we demonstrate a significant relationship between ingested debris and a debris-ingestion cause of death (dose-response). There is a 20.4% chance of lifetime mortality from ingesting a single debris item, rising to 100% after consuming 93 items. Obstruction of the gastro-intestinal tract is the leading cause of death. Overall, balloons are the highest-risk debris item; 32 times more likely to result in death than ingesting hard plastic. These findings have significant implications for quantifying seabird mortality due to debris ingestion, and provide identifiable policy targets aimed to reduce mortality for threatened species worldwide.","[Roman, Lauren; Hardesty, Britta Denise; Wilcox, Chris] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Roman, Lauren; Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst CRC, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Roman, L (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Roman, L (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",lauren.roman@utas.edu.au,"Roman, Lauren T/K-3804-2015","Roman, Lauren T/0000-0003-3591-4905; Hindell, Mark/0000-0002-7823-7185",BirdLife Australia's Australian Bird Environment Foundation; Australian Wildlife Society; Ecological Society of Australia's Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,BirdLife Australia's Australian Bird Environment Foundation; Australian Wildlife Society; Ecological Society of Australia's Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,"The authors would like to acknowledge the following Australian and New Zealand organizations who have supported this project, provided facilities and storage, and assisted with the collection of seabirds for this study: Auckland War Memorial Museum, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, Australian Museum, Australian Seabird Rescue Inc, BirdLife Australia, BirdLife Tasmania, Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, Currumbin Sanctuary Wildlife Hospital, Department of Conservation (New Zealand), Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (QLD Australia), Department of National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing (QLD Australia), Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS Australia), Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA Australia), Friends of Shorebirds SA, Holistic Vets Tauranga, Melbourne Museum, Moreton Bay Research Station, Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Pelican and Seabird Rescue, Queensland Museum, RSPCA QLD Wildlife Hospital, South Australian Museum, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Te Papa Museum, University of Queensland, University of Western Australia and Wildlife Management International.

During June-July of 2016 Russian High Latitude expedition, 93 samples of soil genetic horizon from 25 soil profiles dug till frozen ground were sampled from 8 islands and 2 capes of the Russian Arctic without direct anthropogenic influences. Nine trace metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, Fe, Mn and Hg) were measured and quantified by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis for elemental concentrations. Through analysis of divided soil groups (Haplothels, Turbels, Historthels), the factors of organic matter and cryoturbation had a significant influence on metals' distribution except for Fe and Mn. From summarized soil master horizons (O, A, B, C), Fe and Mn are abundant in all horizons suggesting as geochemical background values. Cu, Pb, Co and Ni are distributed specifically in different horizons with leaching and accumulation process, whereas Hg is evenly disturbed in all horizons. The correlation analysis reveals that distribution of most metals in present soils is highly depended on soil properties (pH, TOC, clay and silt). Li was selected as normalizing element for metals' concentrations from mineral layers to establish geochemical baseline concentrations. The concentrations of trace metals have been assessed by geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and enrichment factor, showing only Co and Zn are moderately polluted and slightly polluted, and Co, Cu, Zn and Pb are enriched in topsoil. Other indices as modified degree of contamination (mC(degree)) and pollution load index (PLI), mC(degree) show moderate degree of pollution and PLI shows unpolluted to moderate pollution load. The ecological risk indices, e.g., ecological risk factor (E-r) and potential ecological risk index, show low ecological risk potential.","[Ji, Xiaowen; Abakumov, Evgeny; Tomashunas, Vitaly; Polyakov, Vyacheslav; Kouzov, Sergey] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, 16 Line,29 Vasilyevskiy Isl, St Petersburg 199178, Russia; [Polyakov, Vyacheslav] Arctic & Antarctic Res Inst, St Petersburg 199397, Russia; [Polyakov, Vyacheslav] St Petersburg State Agr Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Agrochem, St Petersburg 199397, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Arctic & Antarctic Research Institute,"Ji, XW (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, 16 Line,29 Vasilyevskiy Isl, St Petersburg 199178, Russia.",jixiaowen4321@qq.com,"Abakumov, Evgeny/AAO-8580-2020; Polyakov, Vyacheslav/H-5483-2016","Abakumov, Evgeny/0000-0002-5248-9018; Polyakov, Vyacheslav/0000-0001-6171-3221; Ji, Xiaowen/0000-0002-0507-7520","Russian Foundation for Basic research [18-44-890003, 19-416-890002, 19-05-50107]; Grant of Saint Petersburg State University Urbanized ecosystems of the Russian Arctic: dynamics; state and sustainable development [39377455]",Russian Foundation for Basic research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Grant of Saint Petersburg State University Urbanized ecosystems of the Russian Arctic: dynamics; state and sustainable development,"This work was supported by Grant of Russian Foundation for Basic research (18-44-890003, 19-416-890002, and 19-05-50107) and by a Grant of Saint Petersburg State University Urbanized ecosystems of the Russian Arctic: dynamics; state and sustainable development (Grant No. 39377455).

Soils were artificially spiked with Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, and a combination of these REs according to the levels measured in Arctic soils from REs-polluted industrial sites. During the incubation period, microbial activities and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) formation were inhibited, and microbial quotient (qCO2) values were relatively high in the spiked soils indicating that more energy was used by microbes for maintenance under REs stress. Meanwhile, microbial metabolism was significantly restrained. Microbial Specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were reduced in RE spiked soils relative to the control, especially in the Asand multi-RE-spiked soils. The abundance of both fungi and bacteria was reduced in response to RE amendments by 14-24% and 1-55%, respectively. PLFA biomarkers indicated a shift in soil microbial community structure and activities influenced by REs, consequently having a negative effect on soil organic carbon degradation.

Our study found that after activation treatment of groundwater, the pH levels and dissolved oxygen contents of water increased, and the surface tension and viscosity coefficients decreased. To verify the effect of this technology on winter wheat growth in the Guanzhong Plain, a three-year field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2021 using activated water irrigation that included different irrigation treatments (i.e., 60 mm of magnetized and ionized water, MW1 and IW1; 120 mm, MW2 and IW2; 180 mm, MW3 and IW3), while 180 mm of groundwater (GW(3)) was used as a control. The results showed that, when compared with the GW(3) treatment, the MW3 and IW3 treatments significantly increased grain yields (GY), and this effect could be due to the increased chlorophyll contents, delayed senescence of the flag leaves during grain filling and then the significant increase in the dry matter accumulations at post-anthesis. In addition, the daily water consumption amounts in the MW3 and IW3 treatments were significantly higher than that in GW(3) treatment from joining to filling stages, which caused a slight increase in the WUEs. Both the GYs and WUEs of the MW2 and IW2 treatments significantly increased versus the GW(3) treatment. Therefore, we propose that 120 mm of activated water irrigation is the best mode for the Guanzhong Plain, which can save 60 mm of water.","[Wang, Yanhui; Yang, Shujian; Wang, Li] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanhui; Yang, Shujian; Wang, Li] Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Mu, Yan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Xinong Rd 26, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Northwest A&F University - China","Wang, YH (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wang, YH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",wangli5208@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"wang, li/0000-0002-2697-4802","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830754, 41977012, 42171043]; State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS [SKLLQG1718]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41830754; 41977012; 42171043), and the State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS (SKLLQG1718).",,59,0,0,10,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1735-6814,1735-8043,,INT J PLANT PROD,Int.

It has been previously reported on the basis of stratigraphic and radiocarbon data that this species was present within this region from the Sangamonian interglaciation (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5) through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, MIS 2). However, the continued presence of western camel through the LGM is at odds with its ecological preferences as inferred from more southerly parts of the continent. Here we report 43 new radiocarbon dates on 34 western camel fossils from Alaska and Yukon, including specimens that have been dated previously. To minimize exogenous carbon contamination, we utilized either ultrafiltered collagen or single amino acid (hydroxyproline) methodologies in conducting the analyses. All samples, including previously reported specimens with finite ages, yielded ages that were either non-finite or close to the effective limit of radiocarbon dating. These results indicate that dates implying local presence of western camels in Alaska and Yukon during full-glacial conditions of MIS 2 are erroneous by as much as several tens of millennia, probably because of carbon contamination from glue or varnish used in fossil preparation and conservation. The revised radiocarbon chronology, together with other evidence, indicates that western camels were only able to occupy eastern Beringia only during Pleistocene interglaciations such as MIS 5, when forests and shrublands became the dominant regional biomes. The subsequent transition to cold, arid full-glacial conditions during the early Wisconsinan glaciation (MIS 4) around 75 000 years ago created unfavorable environmental conditions, eliminated browse, and led to their local extirpation in eastern Beringia. After their complete population loss in the Arctic and Subarctic, the range of western camels was restricted to the temperate mid-continent, where they eventually went extinct 13 000 years ago.

In the Mediterranean region and over history, climatic drying was coincidental with developing agricultural technology and the rapid increase of the population and their dependence on the grain field, timber, and animal products. As a result of human population demand, it is evident that depletion of natural resources, such as water (surface or ground) and soil (e.g., soil erosion) and reduction of farm productivity, leads many farmers to move to alternative lands or to urban areas. This has a major impact on socioeconomics resulting in a decrease of per-capita food production affecting the political stability of the region and enhancing poverty. Desertification can be evaluated using environmental degradation. However, it is important to separate degradation that occurred naturally (fire, flood, drought, etc.) or as a result of anthropogenic human activities (urbanization, livestock grazing, etc.). Here we report the use of advanced technology to map changes in vegetation cover that enables managers to geographically locate major changes in loss or gain of vegetation cover. Vegetation cover was assessed over a 10-year period (1990-1999) using 1 km Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) biweekly composites. A regression model of NDVI, over time, was developed to identify long-term trends in vegetation cover for each pixel in a study area in the State of Oregon, USA. Since vegetation cover is highly correlated with precipitation, general precipitation trends were also calculated for each precipitation station (n = 73) in the study area. Localized analysis was also performed around precipitation stations, comparing NDVI and rainfall trends in a 3 km x 3 km neighborhood centered on each station. A decreasing trend in vegetation cover was an indicator of some type of stress, either natural (drought, fire) or anthropogenic (excessive grazing, urban growth) in origin. The method presented here allows mapping changes in vegetation cover trends over large areas quickly and inexpensively, providing land managers a useful tool in locating areas in most in need of remediation or protection efforts. Results were mapped using ArcView for visualization and assessments. Three patches of decreasing vegetation cover were identified and analyzed, along with two patches of increasing vegetation cover. Analysis was performed using ancillary data and experts with extensive knowledge of the area. Degradation causes were identified as urban growth and fire. Increased vegetation cover was attributed to recovery in timber harvest areas.","US EPA, Las Vegas, NV 89193 USA; US EPA, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Nash, MS (corresponding author), US EPA, Las Vegas, NV 89193 USA.",nash.maliha@epa.gov,,"Heggem, Daniel/0000-0001-9238-3368","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through Office of Research and Development","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through Office of Research and Development(United States Environmental Protection Agency)","We are very grateful to local experts: Tony Selle, Joan Baker, and Scott Augustine of the U.S. EPA, and Gary Bishop and Colleen Johnson (OAO Corp.) for providing information about field sites.

For sediment-dwelling organisms, such as free-living nematodes, body size is a direct adaptation for living in sediments with a particular particle size, but other environmental factors, e.g., water depth and food availability, directly or indirectly shape nematode morphology. Nevertheless, our knowledge of meiofaunal organisms sizes still lags far behind that of other aquatic fauna, particularly for high-latitude fauna. Therefore, to gain insight into the nematode community size structure, we investigated eight stations located in the seasonal sea-ice zone north of Svalbard (Yermak Plateau, Nansen Basin, and Northern Svalbard shelf) during Arctic spring. Sample locations covered a wide depth gradient, different sea-ice concentrations and subsequent bloom stages. Our study provides previously unavailable data on nematode morphometry for this Arctic region during ecologically important spring to summer transition times. We analyzed nematode biomass, body shape and morphometric attributes, along with respective feeding types and life stage information. Our results show that differences in nematode densities, biomass and allometric attributes most likely reflect differences in the flux of organic material to the seafloor and in the biogeochemical properties of the sediments. Nematode assemblages appeared to respond to spatial gradients in ice cover duration and therefore pelagic productivity from the northern Svalbard shelf to the Yermak Plateau as evidenced by decreasing density, biomass and body size. Considering the entire community, as well as different life stages, average individual body weight decreased northward. Biomass dominance in the lower weight classes and the significantly lower abundance of long and thick morphotype nematodes observed on the Yermak Plateau than in the two other regions were striking. This was in contrast with the assemblage observed on the shelf, where prevailing environmental conditions influenced the presence of other morphotypes markedly longer and wider organisms. Ongoing changes in sea-ice cover and primary production in the Arctic may significantly affect nematode functioning, as they are expected to have pronounced impacts on nematode morphological characteristics. In this regard, the size-based approach becomes a useful tool for detecting changes in the community and has important implications for predicting the direction of change with regard to benthic productivity.","[Grzelak, Katarzyna; Gluchowska, Marta; Kedra, Monika] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland; [Blazewicz, Magdalena] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Lab Polar Biol & Oceanobiol, Lodz, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Lodz,"Grzelak, K (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland.",kgrzelak@iopan.pl,"Grzelak, Katarzyna/AAL-2917-2021; Grzelak, Katarzyna/AAM-1103-2021","Grzelak, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8175-575X; Kedra, Monika/0000-0002-2223-5850; Gluchowska, Marta/0000-0002-3032-4925","National Science Centre, Poland [2016/20/S/NZ8/00432, 2015/19/B/NZ8/03945, 2017/25/B/NZ8/01100]; National Science Centre, Poland postdoctoral fellowship FUGA [2016/20/S/NZ8/00432]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education Outstanding Young Scientist Scholarship;  [AWI_PS92_00]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); National Science Centre, Poland postdoctoral fellowship FUGA; Ministry of Science and Higher Education Outstanding Young Scientist Scholarship; ","The presented material was collected during R/V Polarstern TRANSSIZ cruise (ARKXXIX/1; PS92), carried out under grant number AWI_PS92_00 and organized by the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART).

This large assemblage has enabled an extensive programme of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis, which was designed to explore animal hunting and herding practices and how human diet varied according to age, sex, burial practice, location and over time. The isotope values for sheep and cattle show how both were herded in a range of locations which consisted of pure C-3 and also mixed C-3/C-4 plant locations. We sampled animals from middens adjacent to the buildings where people were buried to provide house-by-house diet reconstruction. However, very few of the people buried in the houses demonstrate a clear dietary relationship to these associated middens. Similarly, people buried in the same house seem to have had different diets to one another. We argue that these data suggest diet at Neolithic Catalhoyuk was a carefully structured, long-lived and repetitious process and that houses may not have functioned as the simple domestic units that they are often assumed to be.

One of the most appealing alternatives is biomass, which can be efficiently used to generate electricity as well as heat with the application of cogeneration technologies that enhance the efficiency of the entire energy conversion process. The Mediterranean basin is a region with a recognized potential for electricity and heat production using primary forest biomass and sub-products from sawmills, among which highlight wood chips for their easiness to be obtained, processed and dried as well as for their good and stable burning or gasification behavior. However, in order to efficiently use the available resources, that is, minimizing logistical requirements to reduce the energy necessary for the electricity generation process, the biomass found in Mediterranean forests can only be used at micro- and small-scale levels to be compatible with sustainable forestry practices. This article is aimed to describe the different technological alternatives to convert wood chips into electricity and heat and it also reviews and compares the current performances in terms of efficiency of these technologies at the micro- and small-scale levels.

High-resolution observations of multiple related species are critical for complex ozone source attribution. In this article, we present an analysis of coinciding ground-based and airborne observations, including ozone lidar, ozonesonde, high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL), and multiple airborne in situ measurements, made on 28 and 29 June 2013 during the Southeast Nexus field campaign. The ozone lidar and HSRL reveal detailed ozone and aerosol structures as well as the temporal evolution associated with a cold front passage. The observations also captured two enhanced (+30 ppbv) ozone layers in the free troposphere (FT), which were determined from this study to be caused by a mixture of BB and stratospheric sources. The mechanism for this STT is tropopause folding associated with a cutoff upper level low-pressure system according to the analysis of its potential vorticity structure. The depth of the tropopause fold appears to be shallow for this case compared to events observed in other seasons; however, the impact on lower tropospheric ozone was clearly observed. This event suggests that strong STT may occur in the southeast United States during the summer and can potentially impact lower troposphere during these times. Statistical analysis of the airborne observations of trace gases suggests a coincident influence of BB transport in the FT impacting the vertical structure of ozone during this case study.","[Kuang, Shi; Wang, Lihua; Pour-Biazar, Arastoo] Univ Alabama, Earth Syst Sci Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Newchurch, Michael J.; Huang, Guanyu; Feng, Nan] Univ Alabama, Atmospher Sci Dept, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Johnson, Matthew S.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Earth Sci Div, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Burris, John] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Pierce, Robert B.] NOAA NESDIS Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Madison, WI USA; [Eloranta, Edwin W.] Univ Wisconsin, Space Sci & Engn Ctr, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Pollack, Ilana B.; Graus, Martin; de Gouw, Joost; Warneke, Carsten; Ryerson, Thomas B.; Markovic, Milos Z.; Holloway, John S.] NOAA Earth Syst Res Iaboratory, Chem Sci Div, Boulder, CO USA; [Pollack, Ilana B.; Graus, Martin; de Gouw, Joost; Warneke, Carsten; Holloway, John S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Pollack, Ilana B.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Graus, Martin] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Markovic, Milos Z.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Huang, Guanyu; Liu, Xiong] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Atom & Mol Phys Div, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Colorado State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Innsbruck; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Harvard University; Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; Smithsonian Institution,"Kuang, S (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Earth Syst Sci Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.",kuang@nsstc.uah.edu,"Ryerson, Thomas/C-9611-2009; Pollack, Ilana B/F-9875-2012; FENG, NAN/HGD-3255-2022; Pierce, Robert Bradley/F-5609-2010; Pierce, R.

More than 1.2 billion people around the work suffer from a deficiency of safe drinking water so that it is estimated that 14% of the global population lives in water-scarce regions by 2050. Although desalination has been used as conventional water providing technology for a long time in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, it has extensive capacities in the USA, Europe, and Australia as well. Interest in investment in desalination sector has been extending beyond these regions of the world which are driven by water stress concerns. Even though desalination has the potential to increase the water supply in water-scarce regions, its associated adverse consequences and constraints cannot be ignored. Brine disposal is the primary environmental consequence that should be considered and studied when installing a desalination plant. Therefore, essential steps must be taken to ensure safe and sustainable brine disposal. Implementation of a proper brine disposal method incorporated with a qualified design and construction procedure can mitigate the destructive effects of the desalination plants on the water environments and groundwater aquifers. Using solar power as a renewable source can both imitate the environmental impacts of the conventional brine disposal methods and an increase in the evaporation rate of the solar traditional evaporation ponds. Directing the brine effluent into the solar saltworks can possibly produce salt, and therefore, the desalination plant would be zero liquid discharge (ZLD). This method requires large land areas and thus is only applicable in arid and semi-arid regions where the evaporation rates are high and the value of the land is low. Also, expensive liners are needed to avert salt seepage from the soil and the groundwater contamination. If the evaporation rate is improved, the need for the same amount of land would consequently be reduced. Enhancing the rate of evaporation would have two benefits of the flexibility to increase the amount of the brine wastewater flows out of an evaporation pond and a reduced amount of land that would be needed to achieve the same rate of evaporation.","[Gorjian, Shiva; Hosseinqolilou, Behnam] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Agr, Biosyst Engn Dept, Tehran 14115111, Iran; [Jamshidian, Farid Jalili] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Water Resources Management & Engn, Tehran 14115143, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University; Tarbiat Modares University,"Gorjian, S (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Agr, Biosyst Engn Dept, Tehran 14115111, Iran.",Gorjian@modares.ac.ir,"Gorjian, Shiva/ABH-4664-2020","Gorjian, Shiva/0000-0003-1587-1346",,,,,114,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1865-3529,1865-3537,978-981-13-6887-5; 978-981-13-6886-8,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2019,,,,,25,48,,10.1007/978-981-13-6887-5_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-6887-5_2,10.1007/978-981-13-6887-5,,24,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Environmental",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BN7ZG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000487752400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

From colonial to post-independent Uganda, the Government of Uganda has worked to eradicate the tsetse menace. Despite these efforts, recent veterinary reports from the Karamoja sub-region have indicated widespread tsetse invasion. This study investigated the potential impact of tsetse invasion on the socioecological resilience of pastoral communities in the Karamoja sub-region. Results indicated that tsetse invasion is spreading from north to south of Karamoja. The tsetse transmission route emerging from southern Karamoja is perceived to be a continuation of the tsetse belt from West Pokot, Kenya. Cases of livestock deaths, livestock abortions, decreased milk yields, restricted access to prime grazing lands, heightened human-wildlife conflicts and disruption on crop cultivation have been reported. A computed socioecological resilience index in the study area was positive but low. Owing to the transboundary characteristics of tsetse invasions and sources and the associated documented effects, an urgent, strategic and system-wide intervention should be undertaken to control the tsetse invasion in this sub-region.","[Egeru, Anthony] Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr RUFORUM, Training & Community Dev, POB 16811, Wandegeya Kampala, Uganda; [Egeru, Anthony; Opio, Joseph; Barasa, Bernard; Namaalwa, Justine J.] Makerere Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Management, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Siya, Aggrey] Makerere Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Biosecur Ecosyst & Vet Publ Hlth, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Magaya, John Paul] Makerere Univ, Coll Engn Design Art & Technol, Dept Geomat & Land Management, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University; Makerere University; Makerere University,"Egeru, A (corresponding author), Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr RUFORUM, Training & Community Dev, POB 16811, Wandegeya Kampala, Uganda.;Egeru, A (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Management, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda.",egeru81@gmail.com; opio.joseph@yahoo.com; siyaggrey@gmail.com; barasagis@gmail.com; magayait@gmail.com; namaalwa.justine@gmail.com,,"John Paul, Magaya/0000-0002-1933-337X; Bernard, Barasa/0000-0003-4339-2422; Aggrey, Siya/0000-0001-9627-656X",Carnegie Corporation of New York through the Nurturing Emerging Research Leaders Project at Makerere University (Post Doc 2017); Regional Universities from for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) through the Transforming African Agricultural Universities to meaningfully contribute to Africa's growth and development (TAGDev) - Mastercard Foundation,Carnegie Corporation of New York through the Nurturing Emerging Research Leaders Project at Makerere University (Post Doc 2017); Regional Universities from for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) through the Transforming African Agricultural Universities to meaningfully contribute to Africa's growth and development (TAGDev) - Mastercard Foundation,"This research was funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York through the Nurturing Emerging Research Leaders Project at Makerere University (Post Doc 2017).

Here, using the puparia of an important insect disease vector, Glossinapallidipes, we examine this potential trade-off using a novel combination of an experimental approach and a population dynamics model. Specifically, we explore and dissect the interactions between plastic physiological responses, treatment-duration and -intensity using an experimental approach. We then integrate these experimental results from organismal water-balance data and their plastic responses into a population dynamics model to examine the potential relative fitness effects of simulated transient weather conditions on population growth rates. The results show evidence for the predicted trade-off for plasticity of water loss rate (WLR) and the duration of new environmental conditions. When altered environmental conditions lasted for longer durations, physiological responses could match the new environmental conditions, and this resulted in a lower WLR and lower rates of population decline. At shorter time-scales however, a mismatch between acclimation duration and physiological responses was reflected by reduced overall population growth rates. This may indicate a potential fitness cost due to insufficient time for physiological adjustments to take place. The outcomes of this work therefore suggest plastic water balance responses have both costs and benefits, and these depend on the time-scale and magnitude of variation in environmental conditions. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of plastic physiological responses and changes in population abundance in the context of environmental variability.","[Kleynhans, E.; Terblanche, J.

This makes it potential treatment option for hypersaline oilfield produced water (PW) with salinity level far greater than that of seawater. Polymeric membranes have recently garnered more attention than their ceramic counterparts in oily wastewater treatment owing to ease of synthesis and relative cost advantage. However, lower mechanical durability and the propensity for fouling of these membranes due to presence of low surface energy organics in PW ultimately affects MD performance in its treatment. Studies elucidating the mechanism of fouling between PW feed and membranes in MD is scarcely reported in the literature. Various fouling mitigation approaches have shown promise towards the realization of MD as a viable option for PW treatment. Hybridization of MD, use of (super)hydrophobic MD membranes with feed pre-treatment using other technologies and/or membrane postcleaning, integrated MD systems and recently omniphobic and Janus modifications of MD membranes have all been reported for treatment of PW showing more promise towards achieving ultrapure-distillate treatment. In this article, the performance of these polymeric MD membranes used in PW treatment in comparison to the other conventional treatment options as well as advances in MD as a cost-effective alternative for beneficial re-use of PW is reviewed, highlighting the areas requiring further study for this line of research. Because MD is still largely energy inefficient, several efforts to realize it as an all-round competitive technology focusing on long-term stability, brine handling capacity and potentials for cost savings with alternative and rather sustainable energy source are also discussed.","[El-badawy, Tijjani; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Adam, Mohd Ridhwan; Tai, Zhong Sheng; Ravi, Jeganes; Ismail, A.

There has therefore been great interest in the use of the recently proposed Post-IR IRSL signal, because it has been shown to significantly reduce the degree of anomalous fading observed in feldspars and therefore potentially provides a means of circumventing the issue. This study undertakes a systematic investigation into various preheat and Post-IR IRSL measurement conditions proposed in the literature, by using two samples from the Halfway House loess section in Alaska which bracket the Old Crow tephra which has been dated using fission track methods. Preheat plateau tests show a dramatic change in equivalent dose with Post-IR IRSL measurement conditions, and further tests reveal that these changes are driven by preheat temperature rather than Post-IR IR stimulation temperature. Dose recovery tests on laboratory-bleached material mimic the findings of the natural preheat plateau test data, and sensitivity change between the first and second Single Aliquot Regenerative dose (SAR) measurement cycle is found to be responsible. Comparison of the Post-IR IRSL ages with the independent age control shows that, for the samples in this study, the Post-IR IR signal stimulated at 290 degrees C is inappropriate for dating. However, use of lower preheat (250-300 degrees C) and Post-IR IR stimulation temperatures from 225 to 270 degrees C gave rise to ages which were in agreement with the independent age control.

However, the underlying mechanisms of spatial distribution are generally complex due to the concurrent forcing of both density-dependent species interactions and density-independent environmental factors. Despite the high economic value and central ecological importance of cod in the Baltic Sea, the drivers of its spatio-temporal population dynamics have not been analytically investigated so far. In this paper, we used an extensive trawl survey dataset in combination with environmental data to investigate the spatial dynamics of the distribution of the Eastern Baltic cod during the past three decades using Generalized Additive Models. The results showed that adult cod distribution was mainly affected by cod population size, and to a minor degree by small-scale hydrological factors and the extent of suitable reproductive areas. As population size decreases, the cod population concentrates to the southern part of the Baltic Sea, where the preferred more marine environment conditions are encountered. Using the fitted models, we predicted the Baltic cod distribution back to the 1970s and a temporal index of cod spatial occupation was developed. Our study will contribute to the management and conservation of this important resource and of the ecosystem where it occurs, by showing the forces shaping its spatial distribution and therefore the potential response of the population to future exploitation and environmental changes.","[Bartolino, Valerio; Tian, Huidong; Cardinale, Massimiliano; Bland, Barbara; Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Inst Marine Res, Lysekil, Sweden; [Bergstrom, Ulf] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Inst Coastal Res, Oregrund, Sweden; [Jounela, Pekka] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Turku, Finland; [Aro, Eero] Puolipaivankatu 4 A 6, Helsinki, Finland; [Dieterich, Christian; Meier, H.

Despite its potential importance for shaping biogeographical patterns, the distribution and connectivity of deep-sea populations across the ACC remain poorly understood. In this study we conducted the first assessment of phylogeographical patterns in deep-sea octocorals in the South Pacific and Southern Ocean, specifically a group of closely related bottlebrush octocorals (Primnoidae: Tokoprymno and Thourella), as a test case to study the effect of the ACC on the population structure of brooding species. We assessed the degree to which the ACC constitutes a barrier to gene flow between northern and southern populations and whether the onset of diversification of these corals coincides with the origin of the ACC (Oligocene-Miocene boundary). Results: Based on DNA sequences of two nuclear genes from 80 individuals and a combination of phylogeographic model-testing approaches we found a phylogenetic break corresponding to the spatial occurrence of the ACC. We also found significant genetic structure among our four regional populations. However, we uncovered shared haplotypes among certain population pairs, suggesting long-distance, asymmetrical migration. Our divergence time analyses indicated that the separation of amphi-ACC populations took place during the Middle Miocene around 12.6 million years ago, i.e., after the formation of the ACC. Conclusion: We suggest that the ACC constitutes a semi-permeable barrier to these deep-sea octocorals capable of separating and structuring populations, while allowing short periods of gene flow. The fluctuations in latitudinal positioning of the ACC during the Miocene likely contributed to the diversification of these octocorals. Additionally, we provide evidence that the populations from each of our four sampling regions could actually constitute different species.","[Duenas, Luisa F.; Crawford, Andrew J.; Sanchez, Juan A.] Univ Los Andes, Dept Biol Sci, Bogota 4976, Colombia; [Duenas, Luisa F.; Wilke, Thomas; Sanchez, Juan A.] Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Tracey, Dianne M.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Wellington, New Zealand; [Crawford, Andrew J.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Alderslade, Phil] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Justus Liebig University Giessen; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Duenas, LF (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Dept Biol Sci, Bogota 4976, Colombia.",lf.duenas161@uniandes.edu.co,"Dueñas, Luisa F./AAL-5546-2020; Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012; sanchez, juan/GSD-8167-2022; Crawford, Andrew J./G-6365-2012","Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758; Crawford, Andrew J./0000-0003-3153-6898; Sanchez, Juan Armando/0000-0001-7149-8369","Dr. David Bowden under NIWA's Ross Sea Climate & Ecosystem project (Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment contract) [CO1X1226]; New Zealand Ministry for Business, Innovation, and Employment; Fondo de Investigacion de la Facultad de Ciencias at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia; CEMarin","Dr. David Bowden under NIWA's Ross Sea Climate & Ecosystem project (Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment contract); New Zealand Ministry for Business, Innovation, and Employment(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); Fondo de Investigacion de la Facultad de Ciencias at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia; CEMarin","We would like to acknowledge Dr. Ben Sharp, Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and New Zealand Scientific Committee representative to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) for approving the provision of the coral sample data; to MPI and CCAMLR Observers for their at-sea collection of the corals.

Recently, there have been major attempts to design the overall form of these buildings based on optimization approaches. This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization framework based on Genetic Algorithm, namely Energy Efficient Form-finder (EEF), consisting four main steps of Form-Generation, Form-Simulation, Form-Optimization and Form-Solutions. The EEF with a comprehensive design-based approach is evaluated through five functions considering objectives of minimizing cooling and heating demand and thermal discomfort time while maintaining operative temperature on the defined thermal comfort zone. This work studies the form combination of five reference buildings based on a new technique called Building Modular Cell in five different urban areas, resulting in twenty-five distinct design problems. According to the results, there is a great potential to adopt EEF in newly-built projects with a rectangular layout; while it can reduce the annual energy demand and thermal discomfort time of the optimal form combinations around 34% and 12% respectively. Finally, a series of qualitative and quantitative design-aid recommendations are presented based on 1998 best design solutions, which can be used as form-finding rules of thumb by architects and urban designers at the early design stages.","[Javanroodi, Kavan; Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Bldg Phys, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Div Bldg Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, Garden Point Campus,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Javanroodi, Kavan; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Art & Architecture Fac, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Lund University; Chalmers University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Tarbiat Modares University,"Javanroodi, K (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Bldg Phys, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden.",kavan.javanroodi@byggtek.lth.se; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se; Mahdavinejad@modares.ac.ir,"Nik, Vahid M./K-2632-2016; Javanroodi, Kavan/AAG-5721-2019; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/H-8187-2017","Nik, Vahid M./0000-0002-1497-4813; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/0000-0002-6454-6518",Swedish Research Council (Formas),Swedish Research Council (Formas)(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This work has partly benefited from the support of the Swedish Research Council (Formas) which is gratefully acknowledged.,,106,27,28,2,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Such predictions remain uncertain, given that fire regime changes and their ecological impacts occur over timescales that are too long for direct observation. Here we analyse centennial- and millennial-scale shifts in fire regimes and compositional turnover to track the consequences of fire regime shifts on Mediterranean vegetation diversity. We estimated rate-of-change, richness and compositional turnover (beta diversity) in 13 selected high-resolution palaeoecological records from Mediterranean Iberia and compared these with charcoal-inferred fire regime changes. Event sequence analysis showed fire regime shifts to be significantly temporally associated with compositional turnover, particularly during the last three millennia. We find that the timing and direction of fire and diversity change in Mediterranean Iberia are best explained by long-term human-environment interactions dating back perhaps 7500 years. Evidence suggests that Neolithic burning propagated a first wave of increasing vegetation openness and promoted woodland diversity around early farming settlements. Landscape transformation intensified around 5500 to 5000 cal. yr BP and accelerated during the last two millennia, as fire led to permanent transitions in ecosystem state. These fire episodes increased open vegetation diversity, decreased woodland diversity and significantly altered richness on a regional scale. Our study suggests that anthropogenic fires played a primary role in diversity changes in Mediterranean Iberia. Their millennia-long legacy in today's vegetation should be considered for biodiversity conservation and landscape management.","[Connor, Simon E.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, MSHE USR 3124, Besancon, France; [Connor, Simon E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Vanniere, Boris] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Chronoenvironm UMR 6249, MSHE USR 3124, Besancon, France; [Colombaroli, Daniele] Royal Holloway Univ London RHUL, Ctr Quaternary Res, Dept Geog, London, England; [Colombaroli, Daniele; Morales-Molino, Cesar; van der Knaap, Willem O.; van Leeuwen, Jacqueline F.

Microscopic analysis revealed that the varve record is curtailed due to the incomplete formation or preservation of annual laminae, necessitating interpolation. The program for varve interpolation presented here analyses the seasonal layer distribution and automatically derives a sedimentation rate estimate, which is the basis for interpolation, and applies it to complement the original varve count. As the interpolation is automated it largely avoids subjectivity, which manual interpolation approaches often suffer from. Application to the Late Glacial chronology from Lake Suigetsu demonstrates the implementation and the limits of the method. To evaluate the reliability of the technique, the interpolation result is compared with the C-14 chronology from Lake Suigetsu, calibrated with the tree-ring derived section of the IntCal09 calibration curve. The comparison shows that the accuracy of the interpolation result is well within the 68.2% probability range of the calibrated C-14 dates and that it is therefore suitable for calibration beyond the present tree-ring limit.

Direct measurements of j(NO2) at ground level are often not available in field studies. In most cases, modeling approaches involving complex radiative transfer calculations are used to estimate j(NO2) and other photolysis frequencies for air chemistry studies. However, important input parameters for accurate modeling are often missing, most importantly with regard to the radiative effects of clouds. On the other hand, solar global irradiance (global radiation, G) is nowadays measured as a standard parameter in most field experiments and in many meteorological observation networks around the world. Previous studies mainly reported linear relationships between j(NO2) and G. We have measured j(NO2) using spectro-or filter radiometers and G using pyranometers side-by-side at several field sites. Our results cover a solar zenith angle range of 0-90 degrees, and are based on nine field campaigns in temperate, subtropical and tropical environments during the period 1994-2008. We show that a second-order polynomial function (intercept = 0): j(NO2) = (1 + alpha) x (B-1 x G + B-2 x G(2)), with alpha defined as the site-dependent UV-A surface albedo and the polynomial coefficients: B-1 = (1.47 +/- 0.03) x 10(-5)W(-1) m(2) s(-1) and B-2 = (-4.84 +/- 0.31) x 10(-9)W(-2) m(4) s(-1) can be used to estimate ground-level j(NO2) directly from G, independent of solar zenith angle under all atmospheric conditions. The absolute j(NO2) residual of the empirical function is +/- 6 x 10(-4) s(-1)(2 sigma). The relationship is valid for sites below 800 ma.s.l. and with low surface albedo (alpha < 0.2). It is not valid in high mountains, above snow or ice and sandy or dry soil surfaces.","[Trebs, I.; Ammann, C.; Rummel, U.; Koenigstedt, R.; Meixner, F. X.; Andreae, M.

However, the model-based design process of DES can be affected by uncertainty, which can lead to suboptimal design decisions and is introduced by aspects like the stochastic nature of renewables or the unknown future global energy and economy outlook. A critical first step of any effort to examine and incorporate uncertainty in the design process of DES includes the performance of a thorough uncertainty characterisation (UC). The UC task comprises the identification of the sources of uncertainty in the model's parameters and the assignment of a mathematical description to their uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to identify and categorise the most important uncertain parameters in typical DES design models and review the approaches used in the literature to represent their uncertainty. The uncertain aspects investigated pertain to the availability of renewable energy (wind and solar), the economic and environmental dimensions of energy carriers in a DES, the costs and technical characteristics of the technologies composing a DES, and, finally, the uncertain energy demands that a DES must satisfy. The analysis reveals the diversity and the varying complexity levels of the approaches used to characterise each parameter's uncertainty, as well as the specific parameters on which studies in the literature have mostly focused. Additionally, this review can serve to assist modellers who wish to introduce uncertainty considerations in their DES design model with the selection of appropriate UC approaches. Finally, in discussing the results of this review, directions for more effective UC in DES design are discussed, as well as suggestions for the integration of uncertainty in the design process of DES.","[Mavromatidis, Georgios; Orehounig, Kristina; Carmeliet, Jan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Bldg Phys, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mavromatidis, Georgios; Orehounig, Kristina] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Lab Urban Energy Syst, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Carmeliet, Jan] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Lab Multiscale Studies Bldg Phys, Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Mavromatidis, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Bldg Phys, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",gmavroma@ethz.ch,,"carmeliet, jan/0000-0001-7489-2652; Orehounig, Kristina/0000-0001-6491-7641; Mavromatidis, Georgios/0000-0003-0227-4518",Competence Center Energy and Mobility (CCEM) IDEAS4cities project [CCEM_801]; Swiss Competence Centre for Energy Research (SCCER) Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts (FEEBD) [KTI.2014.0119],Competence Center Energy and Mobility (CCEM) IDEAS4cities project; Swiss Competence Centre for Energy Research (SCCER) Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts (FEEBD),"The research presented in this paper is supported by funds from the Competence Center Energy and Mobility (CCEM) IDEAS4cities project (Grant no.

Percentage of root length colonized (% RLC) by AMF and tissue element concentrations were determined for four resident plant species. Furthermore, soil nutrient levels and N effects on aboveground biomass of individual species were measured. Nitrogen fertilization lowered % RLC by AMF of Artemisia vulgaris L., Picris hieracioides L. and Poa compressa L., but not of Bromus japonicus Thunb. This - together with positive N addition effects on N status, N:P-ratio and aboveground biomass of most species - suggested that plants are mycorrhizal because of N deficiency. Fungicide treatment, which reduced % RLC in all species, resulted in lower N concentrations in A. vulgaris and P. hieracioides, a higher N concentration in P. compressa, and did not consistently affect N status of B. japonicus. Evidently, AMF had an influence on the N nutrition of plants in this P-rich soil; however - potentially due to differences in their mycorrhizal responsiveness - not all species seemed to benefit from a mycorrhiza-mediated N uptake and accordingly, N distribution.","[Blanke, Verena] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Blanke, Verena; Renker, Carsten; Buscot, Francois] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Wagner, Markus] NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Lippert, Hannelore; Michulitz, Manfred] Res Ctr Julich, Cent Div Analyt Chem ZCH, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Kuhn, Arnd J.] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Phytosphere Res ICG 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Buscot, Francois] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Chair Soil Ecol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Leipzig University,"Blanke, V (corresponding author), Air Pollut Climate Grp, Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",verena.blanke@art.admin.ch,"Buscot, Francois/A-4125-2016; Wagner, Markus/B-9974-2008","Buscot, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006; ",German Research Foundation [GRK 266]; Natural Environment Research Council [CEH010021] Funding Source: researchfish,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation (GRK 266).

(Ericaceae, Epacridoideae, Epacrideae) contains 46 species in south-eastern Australia and two species in New Zealand. Two small genera, Rupicola Maiden & Betche (four spp.) and Budawangia I.Telford (monotypic), both having restricted distributions in the mountains of central eastern New South Wales, have been generally regarded as closely related to but distinct from Epacris. We tested the monophyly and relationships of these three genera using parsimony and Bayesian analysis of morphological and plastid atpB-rbcL DNA sequence datasets.

The caldera forming eruptions of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT) are of particular importance for tephrostratigraphy in Europe. Other key eruptions from this source include the Pomici Principali (PP) and the Tufi Biancastri eruptions. We combine analyses of fresh glasses from proximal locations (i.e., juvenile clasts in proximal flow and fall deposits) with data for key tephra layers from Lago Grande di Monticchio, 120 km to the east. The micron-beam major (EMPA) and trace (LA-ICP-MS) element glass dataset allows us to: (a) distinguish between tephra units produced from the Phlegraean Fields before and during the CI eruption (CI-series), and before and during the NYT and PP eruptions (NYT-series/PP); (b) discriminate between the CI and the geochemically similar Pre-CI pyroclastic deposits; (c) separate the NYT from Pre-NYT tephra units, although both major and trace elements do show significant overlap. The complex compositional overlap between Pre-NYT tephras may present a problem for tephra correlations in the 14-39 ka time window and may have resulted in incorrect proximal-distal and distal-distal correlations. The diagnostic chemical criteria detailed herein permits more accurate matching of distal tephras with their proximal equivalents and hence will improve chronostratigraphy of distal settings and give insight into tephra dispersal. We show that the dispersal of PP tephra was more limited than previously thought. The surge/fall (Lower Member) and subsequent pyroclastic density current (Upper Member) phases of the NYT eruption can be recognised in distal settings. Both the NYT Lower and Upper Members are found in distal localities to the east of the Phlegraean Fields, however the Lower Member is found in the absence of the Upper Member in locations to the far north of Phlegraean Fields. Chemical compositions of the Plinian and ignimbrite phases of the CI eruption overlap extensively, but can be distinguished on a plot of Zr-Th. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As the LPBF technology matures, ongoing research is being conducted to increase its viability as a sustainable solution in achieving digital transformation in metallic materials and qualifying new metallic materials for digital products. This review focuses on recent developments in the LPBF technique in terms of process parameters, defects, microstructure evolution, related metallurgical phenomena, and microselective laser melting processing for miniaturised part production. First, considerable attention is given to the related parameters that affect the LPBF process, that is, powder-related and laser-related properties.

We discuss how energy policy leads to building standards that affect innovation in the building sector. We review current and future materials and solutions for the building envelope (insulation and glazing), renewable energy generation and energy storage, and demonstrate how the integration of buildings into district networks mitigates problems arising from a building's, and its users', dynamic behavior. Buildings account for similar to 40% of global energy demands, and the increased adoption of innovative solutions for buildings represents an enormous potential to reduce energy demands and greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we critically review the current and future materials and solutions for the construction sector. We describe how policy affects innovative businesses and the adoption of new products and solutions. We investigate how the building envelope and user behavior determine building energy demands. Compared to conventional solutions, superinsulation materials (vacuum insulation panels, silica aerogel) can achieve the same thermal performance with drastically thinner insulation. With low-emissivity coatings and appropriate filler gasses, double and triple glazing reduces thermal losses by an order of magnitude. Vacuum and aerogel glazing reduce these even further. Switchable glazing solutions maximize solar gains during wintertime and minimize illumination demands whilst avoiding overheating in summer. Upon integration of renewable energy systems, buildings become both producers and consumers of energy. Combined with the dynamic user behavior, temporal variations in energy production require thermal and electrical storage and the integration of buildings into smart grids and energy district networks. The combination of these measures can reduce the energy consumption of the building's stock by a factor of three.","[Koebel, Matthias M.; Wernery, Jannis; Malfait, Wim J.] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Bldg Energy Mat & Components Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Koebel, MM (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Bldg Energy Mat & Components Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",matthias.koebel@empa.ch,,", Jannis/0000-0001-6819-9683",,,,,200,11,11,2,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",2329-2229,2329-2237,,MRS ENERGY SUSTAIN,MRS Energy Sustain.,30-Oct,2017,,,,,,,e12,10.1557/mre.2017.14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1557/mre.2017.14,,,24,Energy & Fuels,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Energy & Fuels,FZ8BJ,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000427829900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A three-parameter Weibull distribution model was integrated to simulate thinning treatments within the newly developed TRIPLEX-Management model. The thinning intensity component within the model allows users to simulate thinning treatments by applying basal area, stand density and volume to quantify thinning intensity. Natural mortality decreased following thinning due to an increase in growing space for residual stems. Predicted litterfall pools also increased after thinning events took place. The TRIPLEX-Management model was tested against published observational data for Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands subjected to PCT in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The coefficients of determination (R-2) between the predicted and observed variables including stand density, mean DBH (diameter at breast height), the quadratic mean DBH, total volume and merchantable volume as well as belowground, aboveground, and total biomass ranged from 0.50 to 0.88 (n = 20, P < 0.001) with the exception of mean tree height (R-2 = 0.25, n = 20, P < 0.05). Overall, the willmott index of agreement between predicted and observed variables ranged from 0.97 to 1.00. Results show that the TRIPLEX-Management model is generally capable of simulating growth response to PCT for Jack Pine stands. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, the presence of numerous osseous projectile points in many early Upper Palaeolithic (EUP) assemblages in this region has attracted the attention of the international research community. However, the scarcity of properly identified and well-dated Aurignacian contexts represents an obstacle for investigation of the nature and timing of the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. In this context, the question of whether Neandertals made Aurignacian osseous projectile points, either on their own or as a consequence of cultural interaction with anatomically modern humans (AMH), still remains an open issue. Here we reassess the EUP record of Slovenia by evaluating the Aurignacian character of the assemblages from Potocka zijalka, Mokriska jama and Divje babe I in the light of their suggested roots in the local Mousterian. We provide a comprehensive description of the lithic industry from Potocka zijalka, which represents one of the rare EUP assemblages of southern Central Europe with a representative number of lithic artefacts to be analysed from the perspective of lithic technology and raw material economy. Our re-analysis of the Slovenian assemblages is backed by a series of 11 new ultrafiltered collagen 14C dates obtained directly on associated osseous projectile points from the studied assemblages. The Aurignacian of Potocka zijalka underlines the remarkable consistency of the Early Aurignacian with low typotechnological variability across Europe, resulting from a marked dependence on transported toolkits and raw material conservation. The new radiocarbon determinations for the Aurignacian of Slovenia appear to post-date the 34-32 ka BP (thousands of years before present) threshold for the last Neandertals in the region. Although not falsified, the hypothesis of Aurignacian bone tools in southern Central Europe as a product of late Neandertals is not supported by our re-examination of the EUP record of Slovenia.

Until recently, chronological control on these deposits was limited to terrace stratigraphy and limited amino-acid racemisation (AAR) determinations. Recent developments in both this and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating make them potentially powerful tools for improving the chronological control on such sequences. This paper reports new AAR analyses and initial OSL dating from the deposits in this region. These results will help with ongoing investigation of patterns of early human settlement. Using AAR, the attribution by previous workers of the interglacial channel deposits to both MIS 11 (Tillingham Clay) and MIS 9 (Rochford and Shoeburyness Clays) is reinforced. Where there are direct stratigraphic relationships between AAR and OSL as with the Cudmore Grove and Rochford Clays and associated gravels, they agree well. Where OSL dating is the only technique available, it seems to replicate well, but must be treated with caution since there are relatively few aliquots. It is suggested on the basis of this initial OSL dating that the gravel deposits date from MIS 8 (Rochford and Cudmore Grove Gravels) and potentially also MIS 6 (Dammer Wick and Barling Gravels). However, the archaeological evidence from the Barling Gravel and the suggested correlations between this sequence and upstream Thames terraces conflict with this latter age estimate and suggest that it may need more investigation.

The objectives were to analyze the diversity and consistency of value estimations, identify research gaps, and suggest directions for future research. We found 43 studies that used non -market valuation methods to estimate the economic benefits of 24 types of ecosystem services. The most evaluated service was recreation, followed by water and food resources. Contingent valuation was the most cited method, followed by travel cost and choice experiment methods. While the number of studies is encouraging, many important ecosystem services still remain unnoticed and are not accounting towards the total economic value (e.g. pollination, medicine, bioenergy, etc.). In addition, the majority of studies revealed a lack of validity tests, which challenges the reliability of results. Hypothetical bias and the embedding effect are serious problems that must be addressed in future stated preference studies. Considering the issues reviewed here, we believe that the scientific community in Mexico should keep doing more research on economic valuation. This information can help to transit from hypothetical to real markets and to highlight the critical role of ecosystem services in society. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

US exports of wood pellets have grown from essentially nothing in 2008 to 4.6 million metric tons in 2015, with 99% of US pellets being shipped to Europe. To examine effects of this recent expansion of the pellet industry on forest conditions, we use US Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) annual survey data for 2002-2014 to analyze changes in timberland trends since 2009 for two fuelsheds supplying pellets to the ports of Chesapeake, Virginia, and Savannah, Georgia. This analysis reveals that the Chesapeake fuelshed had significant increases in acreage of large trees and harvestable carbon after 2009. Furthermore, the timberland volume within plantations increased in the Chesapeake fuelshed after 2009. The Savannah fuelshed had significant increases in volume, areas with large trees, and all carbon pools after 2008. Increases in carbon in live trees for the Chesapeake fuelshed and all carbon pools for the Savannah fuelshed for the years before and after 2009 provide empirical support to prior estimates that production of wood-based pellets in the southeast US can enhance greenhouse gas sequestration. Both fuelsheds retained more naturally regenerating stands than plantations; however the number of standing dead trees increased within naturally regenerating stands and declined within plantations (but only significantly for the Savannah fuelshed). While the decrease in the number of standing dead trees per hectare for the Savannah fuelshed plantations after 2009 warrants investigation into its effects on biodiversity, others have recommended thinning and hardwood mid-story control within pine plantations to provide habitat for regionally declining bird species, which is consistent with use of biomass for energy and reducing the risk of fire. While all energy use affects the environment, these results show that benefits accrue when sustainable forest management provides wood pellets for energy that keep fossil fuel in the ground. By contrast urbanization is the greatest cause of forest loss in the SE US. It is essential to consistently monitor and assess forest conditions to assess changes, for exports of wood-based pellets for the southern US are expected to grow. Even though use of pellets for energy has more than doubled, the pellet industry constitutes < 1% of US forest products by weight. Therefore, any recent changes, in SE US forest conditions are more likely related to the 2008 declines in the housing market. Continued analysis of annual FIA data using the methods outlined in this manuscript provides a scientifically valid approach for ongoing assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents integrated micromammal and macromammal stable isotope palaeoenvironmental proxy data from one of the few MIS 6 fossil occurrences in the region, a fossil brown hyena (Parahyena brunnea) den, Pinnacle Point 30 (PP30). Two predators with significantly different foraging ranges aggregated the large and small mammal components of the PP30 fossil assemblage. The large mammal specimens were brought to PP30 by Parahyena brunnea with an expansive daily foraging radius that focused on the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain. The micromammal taxa were deposited at the site primarily by the spotted eagle owl, Bubo africanus, with a foraging radius of similar to 3 km, and would have sampled the ecotone between the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain and the Cape coastal lowlands. The large and small mammal components of the PP30 assemblage thus sample palaeovegetation at different geographic scales; micromammal stable isotope data act as a proxy for local conditions, while macromammal data integrate information at a broader scale. Comparison of the stable carbon isotope data obtained from the micromammal and macromammal fossil specimens suggests that these two assemblage components intersected vegetation with differing proportions of C-4 grasses. Micromammal delta C-13 proxy data indicates that, immediately local to the site, a C-3 dominated vegetation was present, while the large mammal delta C-13 proxy data shows evidence of a vegetation community with a greater C-4 grass component that likely occurred somewhat more distant from the site itself on the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain.

Population expansion and growth spurred changes in material culture as well as the exploration of previously unoccupied regions and ecosystems. The archaeological sequence at Melikane Rock shelter (1860 masl) in the Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains of highland Lesotho, southern Africa, stretches from the late Holocene back to sub-stage 5a,-80 ka. The site's earliest strata represent one of the earliest known examples of a sustained human presence in high mountain systems worldwide. This paper deals with the lithic assemblages from those levels, which are currently the oldest radiometrically dated archaeology in Lesotho and one of the few stratified assemblages of Last Interglacial age in the southern African interior. The results of a typo-technological analysis of the assemblages are presented. They suggest that the afromontane foragers who resided at Melikane employed both blade-focussed and bipolar flaking systems, curated a maintainable toolkit suited to frequent residential moves, and used a hybrid provisioning system adapted to their immediate environment. Comparisons with other late Last Interglacial assemblages across the subcontinent suggest that highland populations at this time were largely disconnected from their lowland counterparts. This implies that as Last Interglacial populations in southern Africa expanded into new environments, they also fragmented, adapting to local conditions rather than adhering to a universal technological system.","[Pazan, Kyra R.; Stewart, Brian A.] Univ Michigan, Museum Anthropol Archaeol, 3010 Sch Educ Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pazan, Kyra R.; Stewart, Brian A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, 3010 Sch Educ Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dewar, Genevieve] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Anthropol, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Dewar, Genevieve; Stewart, Brian A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Rock Art Res Inst, PO Wits, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Toronto; University of Witwatersrand,"Pazan, KR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Museum Anthropol Archaeol, 3010 Sch Educ Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Pazan, KR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, 3010 Sch Educ Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",krpazan@umich.edu,,"Dewar, Genevieve/0000-0003-3202-4720",Wenner-Gren Foundation; British Academy; Prehistoric Society; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research; Centre of African Studies (University of Cambridge),Wenner-Gren Foundation; British Academy; Prehistoric Society; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research; Centre of African Studies (University of Cambridge),"Melikane was excavated under permits granted by the Ministry of Technology, Environment and Culture (MTEC), Kingdom of Lesotho.

However, the bioenergy development may potentially cause serious environmental alterations, which remain unclear. The study summarizes the environmental impacts of bioenergy production based on the compilation and published data. Our analysis shows that more and more attention is being paid to the environmental protection as the development of bioenergy, and among the influencing terms of bioenergy production, water issues (i.e., water quantity and quality) gain the greatest concern, whereas the least attention has been given to soil erosion. Although we recognize that the bioenergy production can indeed exert negative effects on the environment in terms of water quantity and quality, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and soil organic carbon, and soil erosion, the adverse impacts varied greatly depending on biomass types, land locations, and management practices. Identifying the reasonable cultivation locations, appropriate bioenergy crop types, and optimal management practices can be beneficial to environment and sustainable development of bioenergy. In this field, Chinese bioenergy production has lagged behind and does not match its rising energy consumption, but it has a great potential of and demand for biomass-based energy especially under its urbanization, in spite of the negative environmental impacts. Therefore, this article is expected to serve as a reference and guideline on what has been done in the bioenergy-oriented countries that might stimulate development of more effective and environmentally sound guidelines for promoting bioenergy production in China and other developing countries as well.","[Wu, Yiping; Zhao, Fubo; Wang, Lijing; Qiu, Linjing] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shuguang] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Natl Engn Lab Appl Technol Forestry & Ecol South, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Alexandrov, Georgii] Russian Acad Sci, AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Jothiprakash, Vinayakam] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Central South University of Forestry & Technology; Russian Academy of Sciences; Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Wu, YP (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",rocky.ypwu@gmail.com,"Alexandrov, Georgii A/F-9410-2011; Zhao, Fubo/AAW-8155-2021","Alexandrov, Georgii A/0000-0002-2522-5690; Qiu, Linjing/0000-0001-7250-5698",National Thousand Youth Talent Program of China [122990901606]; Hundred Youth Talent Program of Shaanxi Province; Young Talent Support Plan of Xi'an Jiaotong University,National Thousand Youth Talent Program of China; Hundred Youth Talent Program of Shaanxi Province; Young Talent Support Plan of Xi'an Jiaotong University,"The study was funded by the National Thousand Youth Talent Program of China (122990901606), the Hundred Youth Talent Program of Shaanxi Province, the Young Talent Support Plan of Xi'an Jiaotong University.",,69,41,42,4,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-4092,,,GEOSCI LETT,Geosci.

While considerable attention has been paid to the outcomes and implications of such infrastructure investments, less analytical attention has been given to the decision processes of infrastructure investment intended to enhance sustainability transformations. Decision-making over infrastructure is characterized by uncertainty - in which the system models and probability functions are unknown, and the desired outcomes are highly controversial. Approaches are needed to address issues of political contention and power asymmetries, disparate values, justice and equity in large-scale infrastructure decision-making. All these elements augment uncertainty and challenge decision processes, while underscoring the role of knowledge co-production.

Proximal glasses from the Biancavilla Ignimbrites and Unit D Plinian fall deposits are characterised. Fall deposits recorded at Acireale (D1b and D2b) and Giarre (D1a and D2a) are geochemically distinct confirming they relate to different eruptions. The Acireale Plinian fall (D1b and D2b) deposits compositionally overlap with the Biancavilla Ignimbrite deposits. These explosive eruptions from Etna are considered responsible for widespread ash dispersals throughout the central Mediterranean region, producing the marker tephra layers (Y-1/Et-1) recorded in marine and lacustrine sedimentary archives. Stratigraphically these distal tephras occur at or close to the onset of the last deglaciation (Termination 1) within their respective palaeoenvironmental records, therefore making them potentially crucial tephrostratigraphic markers. This study investigates distal tephra deposits thought to be from Etna recorded in the Ionian Sea (Y-1), Lago Grande di Monticchio (LGdM, Italy; tephras TM-11 and TM-12-1), Lago di Mezzano (Italy) and the Haua Fteah cave (Libya). The glass chemistry of Y-1 tephras recorded in the Ionian Sea and at Haua Fteah is consistent with the Biancavilla Ignimbrites (16,965-17,670 cal yrs BP) and the upper Acireale Plinian fall (D2b). The LGdM record indicates that explosive activity on Etna associated with Unit D spans a minimum of 1540 +/- 80 varve years. TM-12-1 (19,200-19,804 cal yrs BP) in LGdM appears to represent the oldest distal counterpart of Etna Unit D explosive activity and is associated with the lower Acireale (D1b) Plinian eruption. The proximally undefined TM-11 (17,640-18,324 cal yrs BP) and distal correlatives are geochemically distinct from the Ionian Sea Y-1 tephra. Such significant compositional differences seen between distal tephra layers are not observed within individual proximal units and are likely to indicate that the distal tephras relate to separate eruptive phases. Until proximal relationships can be established, the TM-11 type Y-1 equivalents should be termed TM-11. Great care should be exercised when using these distal ash layers to synchronise sedimentary records during a crucial period of environmental change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our modeling framework is integrated into a cloud-based application, MySmartE, with visual (wall-mounted tablet) and voice (Alexa) user interfaces to facilitate behavioral changes in a user-centric approach. The platform is deployed in a multi-unit residential community in Fort Wayne, IN, and data from the field study are used to investigate: (i) how occupants' thermostat behaviors changed after using the MySmartE app; (ii) how users interacted with the app during the game; and (iii) how was users' experience with the developed platform. Despite the heterogeneous characteristics of households, the results from the field study showed the positive effect of the intervention in the thermostat-adjustment behaviors, which resulted in an increase in the indoor temperature during the cooling season compared to the baseline. Findings from the user interaction analysis and post-experiment interviews also revealed the significant potential to nudge households' energy conservation behaviors with the developed platform along with the challenges that should be tackled to derive long-term behavior changes.","[Kim, Huijeong; Ham, Sangwoo; Devarapalli, Hemanth; Braun, James E.; Karava, Panagiota] Civil Engn Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kim, Huijeong; Ham, Sangwoo; Devarapalli, Hemanth; Bilionis, Ilias; Braun, James E.; Karava, Panagiota] Purdue Univ, Ctr High Performance Bldg, Ray W Herrick Labs, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Promann, Marlen] Purdue Univ, Patti & Rusty Rueff Sch Design Art & Performance, Dept Art & Design, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Promann, Marlen] Purdue Univ, Purdue Polytech Inst, Dept Comp Technol Graph, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Bihani, Geetanjali; Ringenberg, Tatiana; Rayz, Julia Taylor] Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Kwarteng, Vanessa; Bilionis, Ilias; Braun, James E.] Purdue Univ, Sch Mech Engn, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Raymond, Leigh] Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, Dept Polit Sci, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Reimer, Torsten] Purdue Univ, Brian Lamb Sch Commun, 100N Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Karava, P (corresponding author), Civil Engn Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Karava, P (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Ctr High Performance Bldg, Ray W Herrick Labs, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",pkarava@purdue.edu,,"Braun, James E/0000-0001-5004-5379",National Science Foundation [1737591]; Big Ideas Challenge pro-gram at Purdue University,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Big Ideas Challenge pro-gram at Purdue University,This work was funded by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1737591 and supported by the Big Ideas Challenge pro-gram at Purdue University.,,69,1,1,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Results of studies dealing with scale issues in marine benthic communities suggest that variability is concentrated at small spatial scales (from tens of centimetres to few metres) and that spatial patterns of variation are consistent across ecosystems characterized by contrasting physical and biotic conditions, but this has not been formally tested. Here we quantified the variability in the distribution of intertidal rocky shore communities at a range of spatial scales, from tens of centimetres to thousands of kilometres, both in the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and tested whether the observed patterns differed between the two basins. We focused on canopy-forming macroalgae and associated understorey assemblages in the low intertidal, and on the distribution of Patella limpets at mid intertidal levels. Our results highlight that patterns of spatial variation, at each scale investigated, were consistent between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, suggesting that similar ecological processes operate in these regions. In contrast with former studies, variability in canopy cover, species richness and limpet abundance was equally distributed among spatial scales, possibly reflecting the fingerprint of multiple processes. Variability in community structure of low intertidal assemblages, instead, peaked at the largest scale, suggesting that oceanographic processes and climatic gradients may be important. We conclude that formal comparisons of variability across scales nested in contrasting systems are needed, before any generalization on patterns and processes can be made.","[Dal Bello, Martina; Coppa, Stefania;

In addition, hydrological variability can cause greater differences in water residence time and cycling of constituents in man-made lakes (reservoirs) than in natural lakes. Thus, investigations are needed on vertical mixing of constituents in new impounded reservoirs, especially those constructed to supply domestic water. In this study, sampling campaigns were conducted in the Sabalan reservoir, Iran, to investigate vertical changes in constituent concentrations during the year in periods with thermal stratification and homo-thermal conditions. The results revealed incomplete mixing of constituents, even during cold months when the reservoir was homo-thermal. These conditions interacted to create a bottom-up regulated reservoir with sediment that released settled pollutants, impairing water quality in the Sabalan reservoir during both thermal stratification and homo-thermal conditions. Analysis of total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations revealed that the reservoir was eutrophic. External pollution loads, internal cycling of pollutants diffusing out from bottom sediments, reductions in inflow to the reservoir, and reservoir operations regulated vertical mixing and concentrations of constituents in the Sabalan reservoir throughout the year.

Mitigating UHI through nature-based methods is highly recommended. The cooling effect of urban blue infrastructure (UBI) can significantly alleviate the effects of UHI. Revealing the crucial influencing factors of the cooling effect of UBI is of great significance for mitigating the UHI effect. In this study, the water-cooling intensity (WCI) and water-cooling range (WCR) were used to quantitatively analyze the cooling effect of UBI in Hefei city in summer. Furthermore, the influencing factors and their interactions with the cooling effect of UBI were investigated based on the Geodetector model. The results revealed that: (1) The surface thermal environment of the built-up area of Hefei presented obvious spatial differentiation characteristics. (2) There were nine influencing factors that significantly influenced the WCI variation, with the greatest influencing factor of road density. In contrast, only the landscape shape index had a significant effect on WCR variation. (3) The interaction of environmental characteristics, water body characteristics, and socioeconomic characteristics had a significant influence on the cooling effect of UBI, and the interaction relationship between the influencing factors was mutually enhanced. The findings from our research can provide a theoretical reference and practical guidance for the protection, restoration, and planning of UBI as a nature-based solution to improve the urban thermal environment.","[Li, Yingying; Xia, Min] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Li, Yingying] Hefei Natl Urban Ecosyst Res Stn, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Ma, Qun; Zhou, Rui; Liu, Dan] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Ma, Qun; Zhou, Rui] Yangtze River Delta Urban Wetland Ecosyst Natl Fi, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Huang, Leichang] Dalian Polytech Univ, Sch Art & Design, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China",Anhui Agricultural University; Shanghai Normal University; Dalian Polytechnic University,"Zhou, R (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.;Zhou, R (corresponding author), Yangtze River Delta Urban Wetland Ecosyst Natl Fi, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",rzhou@shnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [32071831, 41730642]; Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project for Youth Scholars of the Ministry of Education [22YJCZH092]; General Science Foundation of Shanghai Normal University [SK202256, SK202155]; Soft Science Foundation of Shanghai, China [19692108200]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project for Youth Scholars of the Ministry of Education; General Science Foundation of Shanghai Normal University; Soft Science Foundation of Shanghai, China","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 32071831 and 41730642), the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project for Youth Scholars of the Ministry of Education (22YJCZH092), the General Science Foundation of Shanghai Normal University (Nos.

Human population growth and intensifying resource use for food, water, energy and goods are compromising fish populations through a variety of mechanisms, including overfishing, habitat degradation and declines in water quality. The important challenges raised by these issues have been recognized and have led to considerable advances over past decades in managing and mitigating threats to fishes worldwide. In this review, we identify the major threats faced by fish populations alongside recent advances that are helping to address these issues. There are very significant efforts worldwide directed towards ensuring a sustainable future for the world's fishes and fisheries and those who rely on them. Although considerable challenges remain, by drawing attention to successful mitigation of threats to fish and fisheries we hope to provide the encouragement and direction that will allow these challenges to be overcome in the future.","[Gordon, T.

We operationalized a case using modern information decision support systems (MIDSS) as a fundamental and supportive mechanism utilizing the shared vision across the value chain of an ecosystem to realize the SDGs. Stakeholder theory has been used to argue that shared and cooperative vision can only enable the entire ecosystem to move towards the identified SDGs for living economy and measure the change over a period. We bid for a framework highlighting the role of MIDSS as enablers for achieving the SDGs in stipulated time. The framework is developed based on thematic classification of the data collected by conducting the 31 semi-structured interviews with key people from the industry through 11 questions. We contend that shared vision and trust focussed on stakeholder view linked with common objective of the value chain can create a baseline to hit the target of SDGs around economic, ecological and societal benefits. The framework is useful for the working executives as it can act as reference plug to support and align the organizational activities towards SDGs.","[Modgil, Sachin] IMI, Operat Management, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Gupta, Shivam] Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Bhushan, Bharat] Tata Metaliks Ltd, Tata Ctr, Kolkata, W Bengal, India",International Management Institute (IMI) Kolkata; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier,"Modgil, S (corresponding author), IMI, Dept Operat Management, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",s.modgil@imi-k.edu.in,"Gupta, Shivam/R-2996-2016","Gupta, Shivam/0000-0002-2714-4958; Modgil, Sachin/0000-0001-7816-6594",,,,,290,21,21,1,53,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

Artefacts show that the site was in use from the Zebbu & x121; period of the late 5th/early 4th millennium cal BC to the Tarxien Cemetery phase of the later 3rd/early 2nd millennia cal BC. Absolutely dated funerary activity, however, starts with a small rock-cut tomb, probably in use in the mid to late fourth millennium cal BC, in the & x120;gantija period. After an interval of centuries, burial resumed on a larger scale, probably in the thirtieth century cal BC, associated with Tarxien cultural material, with the use of the cave for collective burial and other depositions, with a series of structures, most notably altar-like settings built from massive stone slabs, which served to monumentalise the space. This process continued at intervals until the deposition of the last burials, probably in the twenty-fourth century cal BC; ceremonial activity may have ended at this time or a little later, to be followed by occupation in the Tarxien Cemetery period. The implications for the development of Neolithic society on Malta are discussed, as well as the changing character of Neolithic Malta in comparison to contemporary communities in Sicily, peninsular Italy and southern Iberia. It is argued that underground settings and temples on Malta may have served to reinforce locally important values of cooperation and consensus, against a wider tide of differentiation and accumulation, but that there could also have been increasing control of the treatment of the dead through time. The end of the Maltese Neolithic is also briefly discussed.","[Malone, Caroline; McLaughlin, T.

This species was only observed on Sudest and Junet Islands. Islands were visited between October and January in the years from 2012-2014 and in 2016. We conducted the first assessment of spatial and habitat use by this species using radio-tracking in 2016. These findings were also used to inform estimates using traditional population density methods. CTMM package in R was used for home-range estimation for the tracked honeyeaters. Our results supported that members of this species display territoriality during the breeding season, occupying a mean of 2.0 +/- 0.6 (SE) ha on Junet Island (n=5). Whether individuals defended defined territories at other times of the year was not known but re-sightings of marked birds confirmed them to be locally resident. Population estimates ranged between 53,000 and 85,000 individuals. However, more conservative estimates nearing 50,000 individuals were considered prudent given lower population densities observed on parts of the larger Sudest Island (0.64/ha). This species utilised the canopy and understorey layers in a range of habitats from mangroves at sea-level, gardens and regrowth of various ages to cloud forest on the highest point of Sudest Island (similar to 800 m asl). Dietary observations support that like many closely related species, Tagula Honeyeaters have a broad diet of mostly insects supplemented with nectar and fruit. Observations indicated that this species had life history attributes toward the slower end of the spectrum but similar to other congeners. Vocalisations were more diverse in both structure and complexity than those of suspected close relatives the MimicMicroptilotis analogusand Graceful Microptilotis gracilis Honeyeaters. Morphological measures were similarly different, supporting species level recognition.","[Goulding, William] Queensland Museum, Biodivers Unit, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia; [Goulding, William; Moss, Patrick T.; Mcalpine, Clive A.] Univ Queensland St Lucia, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Queensland Museum; University of Queensland,"Goulding, W (corresponding author), Queensland Museum, Biodivers Unit, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia.;Goulding, W (corresponding author), Univ Queensland St Lucia, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",williambillgoulding@gmail.com,"Moss, Patrick/AFM-9408-2022","Goulding, William/0000-0003-1780-434X; McAlpine, Clive/0000-0003-0457-8144","Rufford Foundation [14054-1, 18034-2]; Club300 Bird Protection Fund; UQ SEES HDR Support Fund; Pozible project [181214]",Rufford Foundation; Club300 Bird Protection Fund; UQ SEES HDR Support Fund; Pozible project,"We would like to thank Georgia Kaipu of the PNG National Research Institute (NRI), Jim Anamiato of the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery for project support and Misah Lionel and Lulu Osembo of the Milne Bay Provincial Government for project approvals.

In this study, we examined vertical distributions of soil nutrients and their influencing factors within the upper 1 m of soil, using data of 68 soil profiles surveyed in the alpine grassland of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks decreased with depth in both alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS), but remain constant along the soil profile in alpine swamp meadow (ASM). Total phosphorus, Ca2+, and Mg2+ stocks slightly increased with depth in ASM. K+ stock decreased with depth, while Na+ stock increased slightly with depth among different vegetation types; however, SO42- and Cl- stocks remained relatively uniform throughout different depth intervals in the alpine grassland. Except for SOC and TN, soil nutrient stocks in the top 20 cm soils were significantly lower in ASM compared to those in AM and AS. Correlation analyses showed that SOC and TN stocks in the alpine grassland positively correlated with vegetation coverage, soil moisture, clay content, and silt content, while they negatively related to sand content and soil pH. However, base cation stocks revealed contrary relationships with those environmental variables compared to SOC and TN stocks. These correlations varied between vegetation types. In addition, no significant relationship was detected between topographic factors and soil nutrients. Our findings suggest that plant cycling and soil moisture primarily control vertical distributions of soil nutrients (e.g. K) in the alpine grassland and highlight that vegetation types in high-altitude permafrost regions significantly affect soil nutrients.

Here we demonstrate their potential by reporting a new study of the sediment sequence of marine core SA03-11, recovered from the Southern Adriatic Sea, which spans the last c. 39 lea. A total of 28 discrete tephra layers are reported from this sequence, 10 of which are visible in the core and a further 18 are non-visible cryptotephra layers. These have been analysed using more than 1400 WDS-EPMA measurements of glass chemistry and results have been compared with published chemical measurements obtained from relevant proximal and distal sites which preserve eruptive material dating to within the same time interval. The data show that a high proportion of the layers originate from the Campi Flegrei volcanic field but more distinctive layers are sourced from Vesuvius, the Aeolian Islands and Vulcano, and these provide key marker horizons. The results show that the sequence extends in time to the Campanian Ignimbrite at the base, that a number of the layers have robust age estimates that permit a better constrained age depth model to be constructed for the sequence, and that the potential exists for importing terrestrially-based age estimates into marine contexts, thereby circumventing problems of incorporating reservoir uncertainties associated with marine radiocarbon dates. The WDS-EPMA dataset generated here also provides important new data that constrain key Late Quaternary tephra layers in the central Mediterranean region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we present new major and trace element glass data for 39-75 ka proximal tephra deposits, including those of the caldera-forming Monte Epomeo Green Tuff (MEGT) eruption. Correlations with the distal tephra archive preserved at Lago Grande di Monticchio (LGdM) are used to constrain the timing of as yet undated eruptive events. Out of 13 LGdM tephras analysed from the 39-104 ka time window, glass geochemical data show that all are compositionally consistent with the explosive volcanic eruptions of Ischia, whilst 5 of them can be correlated with specific proximal deposits. Pre-MEGT pyroclastic sequences comprise three compositional groups, these groups occur repeatedly in sucessive eruptions. Proximal-distal correlations indicate that the Porticello eruption occurred at 59 +/- 2 ka and the Tisichiello eruption probably occurred at 76 +/- 3 ka. The MEGT eruption is correlated with LGdM TM-19, which has been directly dated at 55 +/- 2 ka. Post-MEGT tephras form compositional groups that overlap with the pre-MEGT but are displaced to lower FeO and TiO2 and lower incompatible element contents. Proximal-distal correlations indicate that the Schiappone and Pietre Rosse eruptions occurred at 50.6 +/- 2.0 ka and 45 +/- 6 ka, respectively. Tephra from the MEGT eruption span a wide compositional range, broadly overlapping the three pre-MEGT compositional groups but are displaced to higher Nd and Y and contain an additional less evolved glass population. Glass geochemistry is used to recognise and confirm distal equivalents of the MEGT at LGdM (TM-19) and in the Ionian (Y-7), Adriatic (PRAD 1870) and Tyrrhenian (C-18, MD 28) seas. Distal occurences of MEGT tephra define a dispersal axis to the south-southeast and are found as far as 540 km from Ischia, making the MEGT one of the most widely dispersed late Quaternary pyroclastic deposit erupted in the Campanian region. We estimate a volume of approximately 40 km(3) for the fallout portion of the MEGT pyroclastic sequence on the basis of proximal and distal deposit thicknesses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To partially overcome this issue, here we reconstruct precipitation from tree-ring oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) in central Japan during AD 1612-1935. Our results indicate that tree-ring cellulose delta O-18 is significantly correlated with May-June (MJ) precipitation, allowing us to investigate the link between the EASM summer rainfall and ENSO over the past 400 years. Time-and frequency-domain comparison of the tree-ring delta O-18 record and recent ENSO reconstructions reveal a common high-frequency (3-8 year) variability that characterized the mid-17th, late 18th and late 19th centuries. Similar analyses of instrumental MJ precipitation and several ENSO indexes during the 20th century indicate that this high-frequency oscillation reappeared from AD 1980.

Determining the impact of flood hazards on the urban area and developing alternatives for protection and prevention measures were the main aims of this work. Tabuk City is exposed to frequent flash flooding due to its location along the outlets of five major wadis. These wadis frequently carry flash floods, seriously impacting the urban areas of the city. WMS and HEC-HMS models and RS data were used to determine the paths and morphological characteristics of the wadis, the hydrographic flow of different drainage basins, flow rates and volumes, and the expansion of agricultural and urban areas from 1998 to 2018. Finally, hydraulic modeling of the HEC-RAS program was applied to delineate the urban areas that could be inundated with floodwater. Ultimately, the most suitable remedial measures are proposed to protect the future sustainable urban development of Tabuk City from flood hazards. This approach is rarely used in the KSA. We propose a novel method that could help decision-makers and planners in determining inundated flood zones before planning future urban and agricultural development in the KSA.","[Abdelkarim, Ashraf] Minist Housing, Res Ctr, Riyadh 68222, Saudi Arabia; [Gaber, Ahmed F.

The upland area of the Manaus municipality is characterized by several streams. In this work, we aim to gradually measure the anthropogenic effect on water quality: we monitored three streams flowing over three zones: a preserved (where the streams take source), a peri-urban (where rural and leisure activities occur), and an urban area. From June 2013 to May 2015, we characterized the water quality of these streams. Statistical analyses reveal peri-urban activity does not significantly impact the water quality. Indeed, when the disturbance remains space-, time- and intensity-limited, the streams have the capacity to assimilate the anthropogenic pollution. However, looking at a seasonal finer scale, peri-urban activity slightly affects the natural pattern of water quality, but these changes remain moderated when compared to the original pattern of water quality. Over urban area, the water quality presents significant higher alkalinity, mineralization, turbidity, suspended material, biochemical and chemical oxygen demands, and lower acidity and dissolved oxygen. These alterations originate with sewage deficiency, presence of landfill sites, enhanced leaching of upturned soil and domestic waste. The natural seasonal patterns of water quality are totally disturbed (inversion, intensification) in the urban area. During the wet season, enhanced rainfall in conjunction with human activity generates local seasonal processes of dilution (e.g. negative anomalies for most of the dissolved elements) and concentration (positive Mg and Fe anomalies). The latter can be linked with enhanced leaching during the rainy period (positive Mg and Fe anomalies) and nitrification activity in the urban area (positive NO3 and negative NH4 anomalies).","[Filgueiras Ferreira, Savio Jose; Rios-Villamizar, Eduardo Antonio; Fonseca Miranda, Sebastiao Atila; Pascoaloto, Domitila; Tundis Vital, Ana Rosa; Ferreira Monteiro, Maria Terezinha; Rocha da Silva, Maria do Socorro; Brandao da Cunha, Thais Rivera; dos Santos, Almir Salgado; da Cunha, Hillandia Brandao] Natl Inst Res Amazon INPA, Coordinat Environm Dynam CODAM, Av Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Petropolis, Amazonas, Brazil; [Pinel, Sebastien] Univ Perpignan Via Domitia, Ctr Educ & Res Mediterranean Environm CEFREM, 52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Bender, Steffen] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht HZG, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Hamburg, Germany",Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Ferreira, SJF (corresponding author), Natl Inst Res Amazon INPA, Coordinat Environm Dynam CODAM, Av Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Petropolis, Amazonas, Brazil.;Pinel, S (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan Via Domitia, Ctr Educ & Res Mediterranean Environm CEFREM, 52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",savio@inpa.gov.br; sebastien.pinel@univ-perp.fr; eduardorios17@hotmail.com; Atila@inpa.gov.br; domitila@inpa.gov.br; artvital@inpa.gov.br; mtmont.10@gmail.com; ssilva@inpa.gov.br; thais.rivera.cunha@gmail.com; Almir.salgado@gmail.com; Steffen.Bender@hzg.de; hilandia@inpa.gov.br,"VILLAMIZAR, EDUARDO ANTONIO RIOS/AAZ-9244-2021; Pascoaloto, Domitila/D-7427-2018; PINEL, Sebastien/R-1310-2017","VILLAMIZAR, EDUARDO ANTONIO RIOS/0000-0001-6581-162X; Pascoaloto, Domitila/0000-0001-6037-5945; PINEL, Sebastien/0000-0001-9608-754X","FAPEAM (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas) [021/2011, 062.00340/2013]",FAPEAM (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas),"This research was done under the auspices of FAPEAM (FundacAo de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas) through Edital Universal FAPEAM-EDITAL No 021/2011 (Proc. 062.00340/2013).

J,"Mills, E; Jacobson, A",,,,"Mills, Evan; Jacobson, Arne",,,From carbon to light: a new framework for estimating greenhouse gas emissions reductions from replacing fuel-based lighting with LED systems,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Clean development mechanism; Energy efficiency; LED lighting; Carbon emissions; Developing countries,,"There is considerable well-intended, yet wishful anticipation about reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fuel-based lighting in the developing world with grid-independent light-emitting diode (LED) lighting systems. Most estimates gloss over important practical realities that stand to erode a genuinely significant potential. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is the leading system for quantifying the benefits of such projects in developing countries and embodying them in a market-based platform for trading carbon credits. However, compliance with methodologies for highly decentralized, small-scale energy saving projects currently employed in the CDM is viewed by developers of as onerous, time-consuming, and costly. In recognition of the problem, the CDM has recently placed priority on improved methodologies for estimating carbon dioxide reductions from displacement of fuel-based lighting with energy-efficient alternatives. The over-arching aim is to maintain environmental integrity without stifling sustainable emission-reduction projects and programs in the field. This article informs this process by laying out a new framework that shifts the analytical focus from highly costly yet narrow and uncertain baseline estimations to simplified methods based primarily on deemed values that focus on replacement lighting system quality and performance characteristics. The result-many elements of which have been adopted in a new methodology approved by the CDM-is more structured and rigorous than methodologies used for LED projects in the past and yet simpler to implement, i.e., entailing fewer transaction costs. Applying this new framework, we find that some off-grid lighting technologies can be expected to yield little or no emissions reductions, while well-designed ones, using products independently certified to have high quality and durability, can generate significant reductions. Enfolding quality assurance within the proposed framework will help stem market spoiling currently underway in the developing world-caused by the introduction of substandard off-grid lighting products-thereby ensuring carbon reduction additionality (emissions reductions that would have not occurred in the absence of the CDM program).","[Mills, Evan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jacobson, Arne] US DOE, Off Policy & Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20585 USA; [Jacobson, Arne] Humboldt State Univ, Schatz Energy Res Ctr, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); California State University System; California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt","Mills, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",emills@lbl.gov,,,"Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley, through the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley, through the US Department of Energy","A longer version of this report was prepared at the request of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Small Scale Working Group of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board.

However, the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental records for MIS 3 in critical areas such as the Arabian Peninsula remain poorly developed. Here, we present findings from the Al Marrat basin in the Nefud desert, which provides the first clear evidence for both increased humidity and human occupation of the interior of northern Arabia during early MIS 3. A Middle Palaeolithic assemblage, dated by optically stimulated luminescence to ca. 55 ka, was found stratified within a sequence of relict palustrine deposits indicative of shallow water body formation in the Al Marrat basin. Hominin presence in northern Arabia at this time coincides with the intensification and northward displacement of monsoon rainfall systems during a period of maximum insolation. These findings add to a growing corpus of palaeoenvironmental evidence, which indicates that the Arabian interior was neither arid nor unpopulated during early MIS 3, and that hydrodynamic responses to enhanced moisture availability facilitated demographic expansions into the Arabian interior.

These macropodids are prolific diggers and are recognised as important 'ecosystem engineers' that improve soil quality and increase seed germination success. However, a combination of introduced predators, habitat loss and disease has seen populations become increasingly fragmented and census numbers decline. Robust phylogenies are vital to conservation management, but the extent of extirpation and fragmentation in brush-tailed bettongs is such that a phylogeny based upon modern samples alone may provide a misleading picture of former connectivity, genetic diversity and species boundaries. Using ancient DNA isolated from fossil bones and museum skins, we genotyped two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes: cytochrome b (266 bp) and control region (356 bp). These ancient DNA data were combined with a pre-existing modern DNA data set on the historically broadly distributed brush-tailed bettongs (similar to 300 samples total), to investigate their phylogenetic relationships. Molecular dating estimates the most recent common ancestor of these bettongs occurred c. 2.5 Ma (million years ago), which suggests that increasing aridity likely shaped their modern-day distribution. Analyses of the concatenated mtDNA sequences of all brush-tailed bettongs generated five distinct and well-supported clades including: a highly divergent Nullarbor form (Clade I), B. tropica (Clade II), B. penicillata (Clades III and V), and B. gaimardi (Clade IV). The generated phylogeny does not reflect current taxonomy and the question remains outstanding of whether the brush-tailed bettongs consisted of several species, or a single widespread species. The use of nuclear DNA markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or short tandem repeats) will be needed to better inform decisions about historical connectivity and the appropriateness of ongoing conservation measures such as translocations and captive breeding.","[Haouchar, Dalal; Pacioni, Carlo] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Ancient DNA Lab, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Haouchar, Dalal; Pacioni, Carlo; Haile, James; Bunce, Michael] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Trace & Environm DNA Lab, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia; [Haile, James] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, PalaeoBARN, Oxford, England; [McDowell, Matthew C.] Flinders Univ South Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Baynes, Alexander] Western Australian Museum, Locked Bag 49, Welshpool Dc, WA 6986, Australia; [Phillips, Matthew J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Austin, Jeremy J.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Pope, Lisa C.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",Murdoch University; Curtin University; University of Oxford; Flinders University South Australia; Western Australian Museum; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Adelaide; University of Queensland,"Bunce, M (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Trace & Environm DNA Lab, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia.",michael.bunce@curtin.edu.au,"Pope, Lisa C/A-7533-2011; Phillips, Matthew J/J-1365-2012; Austin, Jeremy J/F-8729-2010","Pope, Lisa C/0000-0002-1791-3979; Phillips, Matthew J/0000-0003-1532-449X; Austin, Jeremy J/0000-0003-4244-2942; McDowell, Matthew/0000-0001-8009-4171","Australian Research Council [FT0991741, DP120104435]",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Thanks to the WA Museum, Museum of Victoria and the Australian National Wildlife Collection (CSIRO) for access to historical samples and assistance.

There was more widespread deterioration than improvement in the ecological character of wetlands generally, with deterioration increasingly more widespread between 2011 and 2017. The ecological-character trends in Ramsar Sites were significantly better than those of wetlands generally, but an increasingly more widespread deterioration of ecological character was reported between 2011 and 2017. Trends in the ecological character of wetlands generally, and of Ramsar Sites were worst in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, and recently also in Oceania, and better in North America and Europe. Deterioration in the ecological character of Ramsar Site was more widespread in countries with a large average area of their Ramsar Sites. This information on trends of wetland ecological character can contribute to assessing the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Target 6.6 and Aichi Biodiversity Target 5. Our analysis indicated that the 1971 aim of the Ramsar Convention to stem the degradation of wetlands has not yet been achieved.","[Davidson, N.

They are an effective way to identify research foci that advance the field and that also have high policy and conservation relevance. To date, there has been no coherent synthesis of key questions and priority research areas for palaeoecology, which combines biological, geochemical and molecular techniques in order to reconstruct past ecological and environmental systems on time-scales from decades to millions of years. We adapted a well-established methodology to identify 50 priority research questions in palaeoecology. Using a set of criteria designed to identify realistic and achievable research goals, we selected questions from a pool submitted by the international palaeoecology research community and relevant policy practitioners. The integration of online participation, both before and during the workshop, increased international engagement in question selection. The questions selected are structured around six themes: human-environment interactions in the Anthropocene; biodiversity, conservation and novel ecosystems; biodiversity over long time-scales; ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycling; comparing, combining and synthesizing information from multiple records; and new developments in palaeoecology. Future opportunities in palaeoecology are related to improved incorporation of uncertainty into reconstructions, an enhanced understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics and processes and the continued application of long-term data for better-informed landscape management.Synthesis. Palaeoecology is a vibrant and thriving discipline, and these 50 priority questions highlight its potential for addressing both pure (e.g. ecological and evolutionary, methodological) and applied (e.g. environmental and conservation) issues related to ecological science and global change.","[Seddon, Alistair W.

However, considerable gaps remain in understanding the chronology and geographical distribution of Acheulean hominins. We present the first chronometrically dated Acheulean site from the Arabian Peninsula, a vast and poorly known region that forms more than half of Southwest Asia. Results show that Acheulean hominin occupation expanded along hydrological networks into the heart of Arabia from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7 until at least -190 ka - the youngest documented Acheulean in Southwest Asia. The site of Saffaqah features Acheulean technology, characterized by large flakes, handaxes and cleavers, similar to Acheulean assemblages in Africa. These findings reveal a climatically-mediated later Acheulean expansion into a poorly known region, amplifying the documented diversity of Middle Pleistocene hominin behaviour across the Old World and elaborating the terminal archaic landscape encountered by our species as they dispersed out of Africa.","[Scerri, Eleanor M.

We developed a temporal upscaling scheme using satellite-derived instantaneous estimates of evapotranspiration to produce a daily-sum evapotranspiration averaged over an 8-day interval. We tested this scheme against measured evapotranspiration data from 34 eddy covariance flux towers covering seven plant functional types from boreal to tropical climatic zones. We found that the ratio of a half-hourly-sum of potential solar radiation (extraterrestrial solar irradiance on a plane parallel to the Earth's surface) between 10:00 hh and 14:00 hh to a daily-sum of potential solar radiation provides a robust scaling factor to convert a half-hourly measured evapotranspiration to an estimate of a daily-sum; the estimated and measured daily sum evapotranspiration showed strong linear relation (r(2) = 0.92) and small bias (-2.7%). By comparison, assuming a constant evaporative fraction (the ratio of evapotranspiration to available energy) during the daytime, although commonly used for temporal upscaling, caused 13% underestimation of evapotranspiration on an annual scale. The proposed temporal upscaling scheme requires only latitude, longitude and time as input. Thus it will be useful for developing continuous evapotranspiration estimates in space and time, which will improve continuous monitoring of hydrological cycle from local to global scales.

We added geomagnetic directional swimming behaviour for North Atlantic loggerhead turtle hatchlings (Caretta caretta) into a high-resolution (1/4 degrees) global general circulation ocean model to simulate 2,925-year-long hatchling trajectories comprising 355,875 locations. A little directional swimming (1-3 h per day) had a major impact on trajectories; simulated hatchlings travelled further south into warmer water. As a result, thermal elevation of hatchling metabolic rates was estimated to be between 63.3 and 114.5% after 220 days. We show that even small animals in strong flows can benefit from geomagnetic orientation and thus the potential implications of directional swimming for other taxa may be broad.","[Scott, Rebecca; Hays, Graeme C.] Swansea Univ, Swansea Moving Anim Res Team, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Marsh, Robert] Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",Swansea University; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Hays, GC (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Swansea Moving Anim Res Team, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",g.hays@swan.ac.uk,"Scott, Rebecca/G-3529-2015; Marsh, Robert/G-4988-2013; Scott, Rebecca/G-5069-2012","Scott, Rebecca/0000-0003-0954-7742; Scott, Rebecca/0000-0003-1954-2910; Marsh, Robert/0000-0002-1051-8749; Hays, Graeme/0000-0002-3314-8189",Natural Environment Research Council; NERC,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"RS was funded through a PhD studentship awarded to GCH from the Natural Environment Research Council.

This paper presents a study on the effects of wind induced airflows through urban built form using statistical analysis. The data employed in the analysis are from the year-long simultaneous field measurements conducted at the University of Reading campus in the United Kingdom. In this study, the association between typical architectural forms and the wind environment are investigated; such forms include: a street canyon, a semi-closure, a courtyard form and a relatively open space in a low-rise building complex. Measured data captures wind speed and wind direction at six representative locations and statistical analysis identifies key factors describing the effects of built form on the resulting airflows. Factor analysis of the measured data identified meteorological and architectural layout factors as key factors. The derivation of these factors and their variation with the studied built forms are presented in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface POC export production was estimated from steady state and non steady state modelling of Th-234 fluxes, which were converted into POC fluxes, using the POC/Th-234 ratio of large, potentially sinking particles (>53 mu m) collected via in situ pumps. Deficits in Th-234 activities were observed at all stations from the surface to the bottom of the mixed layer, yielding Th-234 export fluxes from the upper 100 m of 496 +/- 214 dpm m(-2) d(-1) to 1195 +/- 158 dpm m(-2) d(-1) for the steady state model and of 149 +/- 517 dpm m(-2) d(-1) to 1217 +/- 231 dpm m(-2) d(-1) for the non steady state model. Using the POC/(234)Thp ratio of sinking particles (ratios varied from 1.7 +/- 0.2 mu mol dpm(-1) to 4.8 +/- 1.9 mu mol dpm(-1)) POC export production at 100 m was calculated to range between 0.9 +/- 0.4 and 5.1 +/- 2.1 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), assuming steady state and between 0.3 +/- 0.9 m(-2) d(-1) and 4.9 +/- 3.3 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), assuming non steady state. From the comparison of both approaches, it appears that during late summer export decreased by 56 to 16% for the area between the sub-Antarctic zone and the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF), whereas it remained rather constant over time in the HNLC area south of the SACCF. POC export represented only 6 to 54% of new production, indicating that export efficiency was, in general, low, except in the vicinity of the SACCF, where export represented 56% of new production. Attenuation of the POC sinking flux in the upper mesopelagic waters (100-600 m depth interval) was evidenced both, from excess Th-234 activities and from particulate biogenic Ba (Baxs) accumulation. Excess Th-234 activities, reflected by Th-234/U-238 ratios as large as 1.21 +/- 0.05, are attributed to remineralisation/disaggregation of Th-234-bearing particles. The accumulation of excess Th-234 in the 100-600 m depth interval ranged from 458 +/- 633 dpm m(-2) d(-1) to 3068 +/- 897 dpm m(-2) d(-1), assuming steady state. Using the POC/(234)Thp ratio of sinking particles (>53 mu m), this Th-234 accumulation flux was converted into a POC remineralisation flux which ranged between 0.9 +/- 1.2 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) and 9.2 +/- 2.9 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Mesopelagic particulate biogenic Ba has been reported to reflect bacterial degradation of organic matter and to be related to oxygen consumption and bacterial carbon respiration. We observed that the highest Baxs contents (reaching up to > 1000 pM), in general, occurred between 200 and 400 m. Depth-weighted average mesopelagic Baxs (meso-Baxs) values were converted into respired C fluxes, which ranged between 0.23 and 6.4 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), in good agreement with Th-234-based remineralisation fluxes. A major outcome from this study is the observed significant positive correlation between POC remineralisation as estimated from meso-Ba-xs contents and from Th-234 excess (R-2 = 0.73; excluding 2 outliers). Remineralisation of POC in the twilight zone was particularly efficient relative to POC export resulting in negligible bathy-pelagic (>600 m) POC export fluxes in the sub-Antarctic zone, the Polar Front zone and the northern Weddell Gyre, while the subtropical zone as well as the vicinity of the SACCF had significant deep POC fluxes.","[Planchon, F.] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Brest, France; [Planchon, F.] Univ Brest, CNRS, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, IUEM,IRD,UMR6539, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Planchon, F.; Cardinal, D.; Andre, L.] Royal Museum Cent Africa, Dept Geol, Tervuren, Belgium; [Cavagna, A-J.; Dehairs, F.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Cardinal, D.] Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN, Paris, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); Royal Museum for Central Africa; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Planchon, F (corresponding author), Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Brest, France.",frederic.planchon@univ-brest.fr,"Cardinal, Damien/AAM-6215-2021; Cardinal, Damien/B-5958-2008","Cardinal, Damien/0000-0003-1238-8412; Cardinal, Damien/0000-0003-1238-8412; Andre, Luc/0000-0002-7286-0072; Planchon, Frederic/0000-0003-1288-9698","Federal Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) [EV/37/7C, EV/03/7A, SD/CA/03A]",Federal Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),"The BONUS-GoodHope cruise is part of the IPY ICED and GEOTRACES programmes.

In the present study, complex contaminant cocktails derived from the blubber of polar bears (PB; Ursus maritimus) and killer whales (KW; Orcinus orca) were used for in vitro concentration-response experiments with PB, cetacean and seal spp. immune cells to evaluate the effect of realistic contaminant mixtures on various immune functions. Cytotoxic effects of the PB cocktail occurred at lower concentrations than the KW cocktail (1 vs 16 mu g/mL), likely due to differences in contaminant profiles in the mixtures derived from the adipose of each species. Similarly, significant reduction of lymphocyte proliferation occurred at much lower exposures in the PB cocktail (EC50: 0.94 vs 6.06 mu g/mL; P < 0.01), whereas the KW cocktail caused a much faster decline in proliferation (slope: 2.9 vs 1.7; P = 0.04). Only the KW cocktail modulated natural killer (NK) cell activity and neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis in a concentration- and species-dependent manner. No clear sensitivity differences emerged when comparing cetaceans, seals and PB. Our results showing lower effect levels for complex mixtures relative to single compounds suggest that previous risk assessments underestimate the effects of real world contaminant exposure on immunity. Our results using blubber-derived contaminant cocktails add realism to in vitro exposure experiments and confirm the immunotoxic risk marine mammals face from exposure to complex mixtures of environmental contaminants.","[Desforges, Jean-Pierre; Eulaers, Igor; Sonne, Christian; Dietz, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Levin, Milton; Jasperse, Lindsay; De Guise, Sylvain] Univ Connecticut, Dept Pathobiol & Vet Sci, 61 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Letcher, Robert J.] Carleton Univ, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Acquarone, Mario; Nordoy, Erling; Folkow, Lars P.] Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Jensen, Trine Hammer] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg Zoo, Mollepk Vej 63, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Grondahl, Carsten; Bertelsen, Mads F.] Copenhagen ZOO, Roskildevej 38,POB 7, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Leger, Judy St.] SeaWorld Pk & Entertainment, 500 SeaWorld Dr, San Diego, CA 92109 USA; [Almunia, Javier] Loro Parque Fdn, Avda Loro Parque S-N, Tenerife 38400, Spain",Aarhus University; University of Connecticut; Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Aalborg University,"Desforges, JP (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",jpd@bios.au.dk,"De Guise, Sylvain/HGF-1052-2022; Eulaers, Igor/AAJ-5912-2020; Eulaers, Igor/A-3265-2012; Bertelsen, Mads/AAA-5746-2022; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/B-9217-2016; Sonne, Christian/I-7532-2013; Almunia, Javier/ABE-1890-2021; Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; St. Leger, Judy/AAD-3565-2019","Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Bertelsen, Mads/0000-0001-9201-7499; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/0000-0002-6816-7697; Sonne, Christian/0000-0001-5723-5263; Almunia, Javier/0000-0001-6343-1463; Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; St. Leger, Judy/0000-0002-6213-3429; Jasperse, Lindsay/0000-0003-1297-8041",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [PGSD3-443700-2013]; Graduate School of Science and technology (GSST) from Aarhus University; Arctic Research Centre; DANCEA; Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science; Loro Parque Foundation; BONUS [185]; EU; Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03F0767A]; Academy of Finland [311966]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Graduate School of Science and technology (GSST) from Aarhus University; Arctic Research Centre; DANCEA; Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science; Loro Parque Foundation; BONUS; EU(European Commission); Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"This work was support by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGSD3-443700-2013 graduate scholarship, funds from the Graduate School of Science and technology (GSST) from Aarhus University, the Arctic Research Centre, DANCEA, the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science, and the Loro Parque Foundation all provided support to expenses linking to the sampling, transport and analytical work of the present study.

Their location, high elevation, and topography make them ideal for exploring human responses to late Quaternary climatic change. This paper reviews and synthesizes palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental data from the Maloti-Drakensberg region over the past 50,000 years. It then employs 325 calibrated radiocarbon dates to examine human occupational trends across the region and its component parts, discuss human-environment dynamics over this time-span, and explore patterning between particular phases of climatic change and the timing, mode, and motives of its exploitation by people. Key findings are that the region's Lesotho core may have served as a refugium for human populations during drier, more unstable climatic periods and that intensified exploitation of freshwater fish likely helped address resource stress in cooler ones. An agenda for future palaeoenvironmental and archaeological research is also mapped out. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studied spatiotemporal patterns, driving factors, mitigation strategies, and research methods of desertification in Mongolia through an extensive review of literature. Results showed that: (i) remote sensing monitoring of desertification in Mongolia has been subject to a relatively low spatial resolution and considerable time delay, and thus high-resolution and timely data are needed to perform a more precise and timely study; (ii) the contribution of desertification impacting factors has not been quantitatively assessed, and a decoupling analysis is desirable to quantify the contribution of factors in different regions of Mongolia; (iii) existing desertification prevention measures should be strengthened in the future. In particular, the relationship between grassland changes and husbandry development needs to be considered during the development of desertification prevention measures; (iv) the multi-method study (particularly interdisciplinary approaches) and desertification model development should be enhanced to facilitate an in-depth desertification research in Mongolia.

It has been traditionally assumed that environmental features could strongly affect human behaviour due to the stretch relationship between their potential prey and the availability of habitats. Environmental changes would produce a high variability in the settlement patterns of the Neanderthal groups. However, the preponderant influence of environmental conditions on these human groups has recently been strongly questioned. This is especially true for the Iberian Peninsula, where latitudinal position and orographic features supported the persistence of environmental conditions that allowed the permanence of a wide range of biotopes and animal and vegetal resources. In the present study, we reconstruct the Neanderthal settlement patterns (i.e. duration and season) from four archaeological sites located in the Mediterranean area of the Iberian Peninsula: Arbreda Cave (Serinya, Girona), Teixoneres Cave (Moja, Barcelona), Abric Romani (Capellades, Barcelona), and El Salt (Alcoy, Alicante). We focus on identifying whether they show a high variability in settlement patterns and check for the existence of local influences, such as the altitude. To reach these objectives, we designed a multi-proxy approach combining tooth wear and dental cementum analysis of the main Neanderthal preys: Cervus elaphus, Equus ferus, Equus hydruntinus, Bos primigenius and Capra pyrenaica. Our results first suggest that local features (i.e. orography, altitude, and environment) appear to be predominant factors determining the main feeding behaviour of the ungulates hunted by Neanderthals. Additionally, seasonal environmental variations seem to have influenced horse migratory behaviour, involving altitudinal movements in search of high-nutritive pastures. Neanderthal survival strategies and settlement patterns seem to have been less affected by environmental particularities and more linked to selective prey procurement based on the seasonal resource availability.

Clare, Ireland. Taking advantage of the recent demonstration that it is possible to obtain reliable in vivo strontium isotope signals from calcined bone, we compare measurements on cremated bone (n = 4) and uncremated tooth enamel (n = 4). The results suggest that two out of four uncremated enamel samples can be considered `local' while the other two, and all four cremated bone samples, represent `non-local' individuals. New radiocarbon dates obtained on two of the cremated bone fragments place them in the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age, contrasting with the Neolithic dates previously obtained on the uncremated remains, demonstrating re-use of the monument. Assuming that our small sample is representative, it seems that the court tomb was used for burial by both `locals' and `non-locals' during the Neolithic and predominantly by `non-locals' in the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age. This stands in contrast to the nearby Early Neolithic portal tomb of Poulnabrone where only one individual (of 17 analysed) appears to be an `outsider'. Our results suggest that, even within a small region, mobility and landscape use may have differed significantly within the Neolithic and also between the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age.","[Snoeck, Christophe; Pouncett, John; Lee-Thorp, Julia A.; Schulting, Rick J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Snoeck, Christophe; Goderis, Steven; Claeys, Philippe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Chem, Res Unit Analyt Environm & Geochem, AMGC WE VUB, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Snoeck, Christophe; Mattielli, Nadine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, G Time Lab, CP 160-02,50,Ave FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Snoeck, Christophe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Maritime Cultures Res Inst, Dept Art Sci & Archaeol, MARI LW VUB, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Jones, Carleton] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Geog & Archaeol, Arts Sci Bldg,Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland; [Zazzo, Antoine] Sorbonne Univ, Archeozool Archeobot Soc Prat & Environm AASPE, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, CP 56,55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Reimer, Paula J.] Queens Univ Belfast, CHRONO Ctr Climate Environm & Chronol, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Oxford; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Queens University Belfast,"Snoeck, C (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Chem, Res Unit Analyt Environm & Geochem, AMGC WE VUB, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",christophe.snoeck@vub.be,"Goderis, Steven/AAF-1307-2019; (VUB), VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL/B-4895-2008; Goderis, Steven/F-9908-2011; zazzo, Antoine/H-1697-2011; Pouncett, John/AAV-2229-2020; Schulting, Rick/AAV-2339-2021; Snoeck, Christophe/V-9679-2019","Goderis, Steven/0000-0002-6666-7153; (VUB), VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL/0000-0002-4585-7687; Goderis, Steven/0000-0002-6666-7153; zazzo, Antoine/0000-0001-7608-2207; Pouncett, John/0000-0001-8387-4499; Schulting, Rick/0000-0002-4444-766X; Snoeck, Christophe/0000-0003-3770-4055; Mattielli, Nadine/0000-0002-7170-1520",British Academy(British Academy) [SG130690]; Philippe Wiener-Maurice Anspach Foundation; VUB; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO),British Academy(British Academy); Philippe Wiener-Maurice Anspach Foundation; VUB; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"This research was made possible by the financial support of the British Academy(British Academy grant SG130690).

Both comparative and experimental evidence indicate that beliefs in moralizing high gods promote cooperation among humans, a behavioral attribute known to correlate with environmental harshness in nonhuman animals. Here we combine fine-grained bioclimatic data with the latest statistical tools from ecology and the social sciences to evaluate the potential effects of environmental forces, language history, and culture on the global distribution of belief in moralizing high gods (n = 583 societies). After simultaneously accounting for potential nonindependence among societies because of shared ancestry and cultural diffusion, we find that these beliefs are more prevalent among societies that inhabit poorer environments and are more prone to ecological duress. In addition, we find that these beliefs are more likely in politically complex societies that recognize rights to movable property. Overall, our multimodel inference approach predicts the global distribution of beliefs in moralizing high gods with an accuracy of 91%, and estimates the relative importance of different potential mechanisms by which this spatial pattern may have arisen. The emerging picture is neither one of pure cultural transmission nor of simple ecological determinism, but rather a complex mixture of social, cultural, and environmental influences. Our methods and findings provide a blueprint for how the increasing wealth of ecological, linguistic, and historical data can be leveraged to understand the forces that have shaped the behavior of our own species.","[Botero, Carlos A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Interior, Southeast Climate Sci Ctr, Initiat Biol Complex, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Gardner, Beth] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Botero, Carlos A.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Kirby, Kathryn R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3E8, Canada; [Kirby, Kathryn R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3E8, Canada; [Kirby, Kathryn R.] Univ Toronto, Program Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3E8, Canada; [Bulbulia, Joseph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Art Hist Class & Religious Studies, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Gavin, Michael C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gray, Russell D.] Univ Auckland, Sch Psychol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Gray, Russell D.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Social Sci, Sch Philosophy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Gray, Russell D.] Max Planck Inst Hist & Sci, Dept Linguist & Cultural Evolut, D-07745 Jena, Germany",United States Department of the Interior; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Victoria University Wellington; Colorado State University; University of Auckland; Australian National University; Max Planck Society,"Botero, CA (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Interior, Southeast Climate Sci Ctr, Initiat Biol Complex, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",c.a.botero@email.wustl.edu,"Gray, Russell/H-2078-2015","Gray, Russell/0000-0002-9858-0191; Gavin, Michael/0000-0002-2169-4668; Botero, Carlos A./0000-0003-0955-2795; Bulbulia, Joseph/0000-0002-5861-2056",US Geological Survey [G10AC00624]; New Zealand Marsden Fund; Templeton Foundation [28745]; Royal Society of New Zealand [11-UOA-239]; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center [EF-0905606],US Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); Templeton Foundation; Royal Society of New Zealand(Royal Society of New Zealand); National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,"We thank Q.

We show that DNA and amino acids from buried organisms can be recovered from the basal sections of deep ice cores, enabling reconstructions of past flora and fauna. We show that high-altitude southern Greenland, currently lying below more than 2 kilometers of ice, was inhabited by a diverse array of conifer trees and insects within the past million years. The results provide direct evidence in support of a forested southern Greenland and suggest that many deep ice cores may contain genetic records of paleoenvironments in their basal sections.","Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ancient Genet, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; Univ York, Dept Archaeol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; Univ Copenhagen, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Comparat Genom, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Leipzig, Germany; Murdoch Univ, Ancient DNA Res Lab, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; McMaster Univ, McMaster Ancient DNA Ctr, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Oxford, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Ion Beam Phys, Inst Particle Phys, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dubendorf, Switzerland; Lund Univ, Geobiosphere Sci Ctr, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada; Univ Oxford, Ancient Biomol Ctr, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; Univ Parma, Dipartimento Chim Gen & Inorgan, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Copenhagen; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Max Planck Society; Murdoch University; McMaster University; Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland; University of Oxford; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Oxford; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Paul Scherrer Institute; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Lund University; University of Alberta; University of Oxford; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Parma,"Willerslev, E (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ancient Genet, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ewillerslev@bi.ku.dk,"Gilbert, Marcus TP/A-8936-2013; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/AAO-6951-2020; Alfimov, Vasily/B-3629-2010; Willerslev, Eske/A-9619-2011; Hebsgaard, Martin B/C-8220-2009; Penkman, Kirsty E/D-1952-2012; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/N-4401-2016; Willerslev, Eske/AAA-5686-2019; TABERLET, Pierre/D-1178-2010; Hofreiter, Michael/A-3996-2017; Bennike, Ole/G-7070-2018; De Hoog, Jan/C-1354-2010; Armitage, Simon/K-7471-2015; Christl, Marcus/J-4769-2016; Nielsen, Rasmus/D-4405-2009; Boomsma, Wouter/K-2903-2014; Cappellini, Enrico/F-9346-2013","Gilbert, Marcus TP/0000-0002-5805-7195; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/0000-0002-1474-1948; Willerslev, Eske/0000-0002-7081-6748; Penkman, Kirsty E/0000-0002-6226-9799; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe/0000-0002-1474-1948; Steffensen, Jorgen Peder/0000-0002-5516-1093; TABERLET, Pierre/0000-0002-3554-5954; Hofreiter, Michael/0000-0003-0441-4705; casoli, antonella/0000-0002-9212-9463; Muscheler, Raimund/0000-0003-2772-3631; Bunce, Michael/0000-0002-0302-4206; Bennike, Ole/0000-0002-5486-9946; De Hoog, Jan/0000-0002-5930-3597; Armitage, Simon/0000-0003-1480-9188; Christl, Marcus/0000-0002-3131-6652; Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591; Boomsma, Wouter/0000-0002-8257-3827; Cappellini, Enrico/0000-0001-7885-7811; Barker, Joel/0000-0003-1661-2709; Collins, Matthew/0000-0003-4226-5501",Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C511148/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/C511148/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Wellcome Trust [076905] Funding Source: Medline,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission),,,28,301,317,4,128,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,6-Jul,2007,5834,,,,111,114,,10.1126/science.1141758,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1141758,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,186KD,17615355,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000247776700062,View Full Record in Web of Science

For both of the time slices studied, the Chesterian (latest Mississippian) and the Virgilian (latest Pennsylvanian), delta O-18 and delta C-13 show a stepwise decrease moving across the continent from modern-day west to east. Higher delta O-18 in the west reflects greater water depths, less freshwater input, and more direct upwelling influence from cool, open marine waters than in the east. Modelling based on these regional isotopic data indicates salinity reductions on the order of similar to 1-4 psu in the Appalachian Basin relative to the Midcontinent Basin for the Virgilian time interval over a range of reasonable thermal gradient and delta(18)Of, assumptions. The magnitude of this gradient is similar to those of modern-day Hudson Bay and the Panama Bight, which exhibit permanent haloclines driven by freshwater discharge. Considering existing paleoecological evidence for freshening, the lack of more dramatic benthic freshening suggests that the depth of a regional halocline was shallower than the depths inhabited by thick shelled stenotopic brachiopods, although other lines of evidence are necessary to verify the strength of the halocline. Estimated delta O-18 temperatures for Appalachian Basin brachiopods are similar to 3-5 degrees C cooler than those of coeval conodonts, due to either slightly warmer, fresher surface waters or uncertainty in the phosphate delta O-18 paleothermometer. Despite discrepancies in calculated temperatures, the magnitude of the regional-isotopic gradient derived from brachiopod and conodont proxies is similar after making appropriate glacioisotopic and water depth corrections. A decreasing delta C-13 trend toward the east (southern paleolatitude) likely reflects greater restriction and terrestrial influence near the sea's tropical shoreline. Trace element trends are less consistent and are affected by species and metabolism. Erratic variations in Mg/Ca concentrations, even among pristine samples of the same genera with similar delta O-18 values, and unrealistic Mg/Ca-derived temperatures justify continued caution in applying existing Mg/Ca thermometer equations to Paleozoic brachiopods.

We use measurements on archived air samples and in situ observations from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and a box model of the global atmosphere to show a global increase of SO2F2 mole fraction from 0.3 +/- 0.02 to 2.5 +/- 0.08 ppt along with a global increase in emissions from 0.5 +/- 0.4 Gg yr(-1) to 2.9 +/- 0.4 Gg yr(-1) from 1978 to 2019. Based on a hybrid model incorporating bottom-up industry data and a top-down downscaling approach, we estimate the spatial distribution and trend in SO2F2 regional emissions between 2000 and 2019 and propose that the global emissions increase is driven by the growing use of SO2F2 in structural fumigation in North America and in postharvest treatment of grains and other agricultural products worldwide.","[Gressent, A.; Prinn, R.

Its contribution to human subsistence during the Gravettian period as source of raw material was documented in southwestern France and southwestern Germany, with some evidence of active hunting in the latter region. However, decreasing genetic diversity and increasing indications of nutritional stress point to a likely decline of this megaherbivore. The specificity of the ecological niche occupied by the woolly mammoth is clearly reflected by their collagen C-13 and N-15 abundances (delta C-13(coll) and delta N-15(coll)), measured on skeletal remains of the typical mammoth steppe. The abundances of carbon-13 in mammoth collagen are comparable to those of other grazers like horse (Equus sp.), while the nitrogen-15 abundances are significantly higher (about 3 parts per thousand) than in the other herbivores, either horse or reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). During the Aurignacian and Gravettian occupation at Geissenklosterle in the Ach Valley (Germany), the mammoths had the expected stable isotope signature, but the nitrogen-15 of horses showed an unexpected overlap with those of the mammoth. This unusual pattern was already occurring during the Aurignacian, while the oxygen-18 abundances in bone phosphate (delta O-18(bp)) of horse and reindeer were unchanged between Aurignacian and Gravettian periods, which rules out significant change in environmental and climatic conditions. Thus, we hypothesize that during the Aurignacian and Gravettian, the ecological niche of mammoth was intact but not occupied intensively by mammoths due to a decline in their population. This decline could be tentatively explained by human pressure through hunting. In Dordogne (France), decreasing horse and reindeer delta N-15(coll) values coeval to decreasing horse delta O-18(bp) values between the Aurignacian and the Early Gravettian periods reflected a clear change in the environment, while no contrast in delta N-15(coll) values was observed between the Early and Final Gravettian at the Abri Pataud. The mammoth of Dordogne yielded slightly higher delta N-15(coll) values than expected, probably as a consequence of the nursing effect since all the analyzed samples were ivory instead of bone. The direct dating and sulphur-34 measurement on the ivory of the Early Gravettian at Pataud showed that almost all of them were of contemporaneous and local origin. Significant contrasts in delta S-34(coll) values were found between the Dordogne and the Ach Valley for the same herbivores species, which confirms the potential of sulphur-34 in collagen as a mobility tracker.

Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1979-2012), we show that the convergence of both LLJs over the eastern Pacific-western Colombia contributes to the explanation of the region's world-record rainfall. Diverse variables involved in the transport and storage of moisture permit the identification of an AR over northern South America involving a midtropospheric easterly jet that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Andes, with stronger activity in April to August. Other major seasonal AR pathways constitute part of a large gyre originating over the tropical North Atlantic, veering to the southeast over the eastern Andes and reaching regions of northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. We illustrate the distribution of average seasonal precipitation along the LLJs and AR pathways with data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (1998-2011), combined with considerations of CAPE, topography, and land cover. In addition, the theory of the biotic pump of atmospheric moisture (BiPAM) is tested at seasonal time scales, and found to hold in 8 out of 12 ARs, and 22 out of 32 forest-covered tracks (64% in distance) along the ARs. Deviations from BiPAM's predictions of rainfall distribution are explained by the effects of topography, orography, and land cover types different from forests. Our results lend a strong observational support to the BiPAM theory at seasonal time scales over South American forested flat lands.","[Poveda, German; Jaramillo, Liliana; Vallejo, Luisa F.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Geosci & Environm, Sede Medellin, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Poveda, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Geosci & Environm, Sede Medellin, Colombia.",gpoveda@unal.edu.co,,"POVEDA, GERMAN/0000-0002-7907-6360",AMAZALERT research program; European Commission; COLCIENCIAS,"AMAZALERT research program; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); COLCIENCIAS(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias)","The work of L.

We provide a comprehensive review on available information concerning China's food losses and waste. The results show that the food loss rate (FLR) of grains in the entire supply chain is 19.0% +/- 5.8% in China, with the consumer segment having the single largest portion of food waste of 7.3% +/- 4.8%. The total water footprint (WF) related to food losses and waste in China in 2010 was estimated to be 135 +/- 60 billion m(3), equivalent to the WF of Canada. Such losses also imply that 26 +/- 11 million hectares of land were used in vain, equivalent to the total arable land of Mexico. There is an urgent need for dialogue between actors in the supply chain, from farmer to the consumer, on strategies to reduce the high rates of food losses and waste and thereby make a more worthwhile use of scarce natural resources.","[Liu, Junguo] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Lundqvist, Jan; Weinberg, Josh; Gustafsson, Josephine] Stockholm Int Water Inst, SE-11151 Stockholm, Sweden",Beijing Forestry University,"Liu, JG (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Qinghua East Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",junguo.liu@gmail.com,"Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012","Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311",International Science & Technology Cooperation Program from Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2012DFA91530]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91025009]; Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges NSFC [41161140353]; Special Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest [201204204]; 1st Youth Excellent Talents Program of the Organization Department of the Central Committee; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [TD-JC-2013-2]; Nestle Company,International Science & Technology Cooperation Program from Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges NSFC; Special Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest; 1st Youth Excellent Talents Program of the Organization Department of the Central Committee; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Nestle Company(Nestle SA),"This study was supported by the International Science & Technology Cooperation Program from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2012DFA91530), National Natural Science Foundation of China (91025009), Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges NSFC (41161140353), Special Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest (No. 201204204), the 1st Youth Excellent Talents Program of the Organization Department of the Central Committee, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (TD-JC-2013-2).

The inferred vegetation reveals the long-term permanence of mixed pine-oak forests through a long period of environmental changes within the interval MIS 4 to MIS 1, and probably before. A relatively high diversity of woody taxa is found, including conifers, mesophytic angiosperms, Mediterranean forest, and xero-thermic scrub. The most outstanding findings include the abundance of Pinus, evergreen Quercus, and Juniperus; the continuous occurrences of deciduous Quercus, Acer, Castanea, Betula, Fraxinus, Buxus, Olea, Salix, and Erica, and the presence of Abies, Taxus, Carpinus betulus, Tilia, Populus, Celtis, Juglans, Ulmus, Calicotome, Cistus, Ephedra fragilis, Myrtus, Pistacia, Rhamnus and Viburnum. Together with the pollen record of the nearby Teixoneres Cave, this new data suggest the existence of woodland refugia during the coldest and most arid stages of the upper Pleistocene across this relatively high-latitude region within the Iberian Peninsula. This study also supports the occurrence of forest ecosystems within the Mediterranean-Eurosiberian ecotone of the Iberian Peninsula in the vicinity of Homo habitats, including Neanderthals.","[Ochando, Juan; Carrion, Jose S.; Amoros, Gabriela; Fernandez, Santiago] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Biol, Bot Area, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Carrion, Jose S.] Univ Witwatersrand, Evolutionary Studies Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Blasco, Ruth] Ctr Nacl Invest Evoluc Humana CENIEH, Paseo Sierra Atapuerca 3, Burgos 09002, Spain; [Rivals, Florent; Rosell, Jordi] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Campus Sescelades URV,Edif W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Rivals, Florent; Rosell, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili URV, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Rivals, Florent] ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Rufa, Anna] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5199, PACEA, Batiment B2,Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire CS 50023, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Munuera, Manuel] Polytech Univ Cartagena, Dept Agr Engn, Cartagena 30203, Spain",University of Murcia; University of Witwatersrand; Centro Nacional de Investigacion de La Evolucion Humana (CENIEH); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; ICREA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Ochando, J (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Biol, Bot Area, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",juan.ochando@um.es,"Carrion, Jose S/A-8983-2015; Munuera Giner, Manuel/H-4799-2015; Fernández, Santiago/D-3182-2015; Blasco, Ruth/AAG-8200-2019; Rufà, Anna/AAH-1580-2019; Tomás, Juan Ochando/U-3995-2019; Rivals, Florent/B-7962-2014; Rosell, Jordi/G-8705-2015","Carrion, Jose S/0000-0002-6949-4382; Munuera Giner, Manuel/0000-0003-1459-3348; Fernández, Santiago/0000-0002-8802-2735; Blasco, Ruth/0000-0001-9804-739X; Rufà, Anna/0000-0003-1278-4220; Tomás, Juan Ochando/0000-0003-0848-2350; Rivals, Florent/0000-0001-8074-9254; Amoros, Gabriela/0000-0001-8943-1066; Rosell, Jordi/0000-0002-6758-6291","FEDER/Ministry of Science and Innovation - Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciO Project [CGL-BOS2015-68604-P, PID2019-1049449BBI00]; FEDER/Ministry of Science and Innovation -Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciOn and FundaciOn Seneca [20788/PI/18]; Generalitat de Catalunya [CLT009-18-00055, 2017 SGR 836, CLT009-18-00053, CLT009-18-00054]; Spanish AEI [HAR2016-76760-C3-1-P, PID2019-103987GB-C31]; Spanish AEI/FEDER projects [PGC2018-093925-B C32, CGL2016-80000-P, PID2019-104949GB-I00]; IdEx University of Bordeaux Investments for the Future program (ANR) [10 IDEX-03-02]",FEDER/Ministry of Science and Innovation - Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciO Project; FEDER/Ministry of Science and Innovation -Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciOn and FundaciOn Seneca; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish AEI(Spanish Government); Spanish AEI/FEDER projects; IdEx University of Bordeaux Investments for the Future program (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"The development of this work was supported by Project (CGL-BOS2015-68604-P), funded by: FEDER/Ministry of Science and Innovation - Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciO Project (PID2019-1049449BBI00), funded by: FEDER/Ministry of Science and Innovation -Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciOn and FundaciOn Seneca (grant number 20788/PI/18).

In South America, nearly 80% of the megamammals went extinct, including the native ungulates Macrauchenia patachonica and Xenorhinotherium bahiense. Little is known about the causes of the macraucheniids' extinction and their paleobiology. Here, we have reconstructed the dietary habits of M. patachonica and X. bahiense using enamel microwear and occlusal enamel index analyses, and also inferred their niches using species distribution modeling and stable isotope paleoecology, in addition to enamel microwear and occlusal enamel index data. We found that both macraucheniids had grazer-feeding habits, although their environmental requirements were different. M. patachonica could live in colder temperatures and arid, subtropical/temperate ecosystems, while X. bahiense was adapted to warmer temperatures and more humid, semi-arid tropical environments. Thus, despite similar feeding habits, these macraucheniids had distinct environmental requirements and ecological niches, which might explain the disjunction in the South American records.

Apart from the environmental and ecological advantages which can be brought about by the re-use and recycling of textiles, there are many benefits of a socio-economic nature. This paper analyses current trends on textile recycling, the barriers impeding greater recycling, and outlines the socio-economic advantages of moving towards a circular economy. Some examples of on-going initiatives are discussed, together with some of the measures that may be used to further reduce the current waste deriving from the apparel sector. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We determined the impact of shipping emissions in harbours on local AQ and population exposure in the Baltic Sea harbour cities Rostock (Germany), Riga (Latvia) and the urban agglomeration of Gdansk-Gdynia (Poland) for 2012. An urban AQ study was performed using a global-to-local chemistry transport model chain with the EPISODE-CityChem model for the urban scale. We simulated NO2, O-3 and PM concentrations in 2012 with the aim of determining the impact of local shipping activities on population exposure in Baltic Sea harbour cities. Based on simulated concentrations, dynamic population exposure to outdoor NO2 concentrations for all urban domains was calculated. We developed and used a novel generic approach to model dynamic population activity in different microenvironments based on publicly available data. The results of the new approach are hourly microenvironment-specific population grids with a spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m. We multiplied these grids with surface pollutant concentration fields of the same resolution to calculate total population exposure. We found that the local shipping impact on NO2 concentrations is significant, contributing 22 %, 11% and 16% to the total annually averaged grid mean concentration for Rostock, Riga and Gdansk-Gdynia, respectively. For PM2.5, the contribution of shipping is substantially lower, at 1 %-3 %. When it comes to microenvironment-specific exposure to annual NO2, the highest exposure to NO2 from all emission sources was found in the home environment (54 %-59 %). Emissions from shipping have a high impact on NO2 exposure in the port area (50 %-80 %), while the influence in home, work and other environments is lower on average (3 %-14 %) but still has high impacts close to the port areas and downwind of them. Besides this, the newly developed generic approach allows for dynamic population-weighted outdoor exposure calculations in European cities without the necessity of individually measured data or large-scale surveys on population data.","[Ramacher, Martin Otto Paul; Karl, Matthias; Bieser, Johannes] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Chem Transport Modelling Dept, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka; Johansson, Lasse] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Ramacher, MOP (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Chem Transport Modelling Dept, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",martin.ramacher@hzg.de,"Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka/AAL-8095-2021; Ramacher, Martin Otto Paul/AAL-2981-2020","Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka/0000-0001-8454-4109; Ramacher, Martin Otto Paul/0000-0001-5813-2258; Karl, Matthias/0000-0002-0821-018X",EU; Innovation Fund Denmark; Estonian Research Council; Academy of Finland; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0720A]; National Centre of Research and Development (Poland); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.; project Regional Atmospheric Modelling [0302],EU(European Commission); Innovation Fund Denmark; Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); National Centre of Research and Development (Poland); Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.; project Regional Atmospheric Modelling,"This work is part of the BONUS SHEBA (Sustainable Shipping and Environment of the Baltic Sea region) research project under call 2014-41.

It was found that pneumatic nebulization multicollector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (PN-MC-ICP-MS) after acid digestion and chromatographic isolation of the target analyte out of the sample matrix can still be seen as the preferred method for the high-precision isotopic analysis of Sr in glass with high Rb and rare-earth element (REE) concentrations. Alternatively, the use of laser ablation (LA) for sample introduction is a powerful technique for the direct analysis of solid samples. However, both the high Rb/Sr ratios in the samples of interest and the presence of REEs at sufficiently high concentrations lead to a large bias in LA-MC-ICP-MS, which cannot be corrected for, even by operating the MC-ICP-MS instrument at higher mass resolution and/or using mathematical corrections. It was demonstrated that LA tandem-ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS/MS) using CH3F/He as the reaction gas to overcome spectral overlap in a mass-shift approach (chemical resolution) provides a viable alternative when (quasi) nondestructive analysis is required. This approach relies on the monitoring of Sr+ (m/z = 86, 87, and 88) ions as the corresponding SrF+ reaction product ions (m/z = 105, 106, and 107), thus avoiding the occurrence of spectral interference. Self-evidently, the isotope ratio precision attainable using sequential quadrupole-based ICP-MS instrumentation (0.3% RSD) was found to be significantly worse than that of high-precision MC-ICP-MS (0.03% RSD) with simultaneous detection, although it was still fit for the purpose of current applications. In addition to Sr isotopic analysis, the REE patterns and their potential influence on the Sr isotopic composition were evaluated by LA-ICP-MS.","[Bolea-Fernandez, Eduardo; Belza, Joke; Vanhaecke, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Chem, Atom & Mass Spectrometry A&MS Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Bevan, Dan] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Jochum, Klaus Peter; Stoll, Brigitte] Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Climate Geochem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Neuray, Brigitte] AWAP Agence Wallone Patrimoine, SPW, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Van Wersch, Line] Univ Liege, UR Art, Archeol Patrimoine, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Van Wersch, Line] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands; [Van Ham-Meert, Alicia] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Van Ham-Meert, Alicia] Vrije Univ Brussel, Analyt Environm & Geochem, B-1050 Elsene, Belgium",Ghent University; University of Bristol; Max Planck Society; University of Liege; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Van Ham-Meert, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.;Van Ham-Meert, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Analyt Environm & Geochem, B-1050 Elsene, Belgium.",alicia.vanhammeert@gmail.com,"; Vanhaecke, Frank/F-5341-2014","Bolea Fernandez, Eduardo/0000-0002-1856-2058; Vanhaecke, Frank/0000-0002-1884-3853; Van Ham-Meert, Alicia/0000-0001-6796-3141",Flemish Research Foundation (FWO-Vlaanderen) [ZW15-02 -G0H6216N]; FWO [G.0C43.15]; FWO-Vlaanderen [12ZA320N],Flemish Research Foundation (FWO-Vlaanderen)(FWO); FWO(FWO); FWO-Vlaanderen(FWO),The Flemish Research Foundation (FWO-Vlaanderen) is acknowledged for providing the funding for the acquisition of MC-ICP-MS instrumentation in operation at A&MS.

Oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of modern and fossil freshwater snail shells were determined to infer seasonal temperature variations. The observational and analytical data confirm that delta O-18 values of fluid inclusion waters in the stalagmite can be regarded as those of spring waters at the sites where snails lived. Our results indicate that the annual mean, summer, and winter air temperatures were lower by 6-7 degrees C at ca. 23 thousand years ago (ka) and 4-5 degrees C at ca. 16-13 ka than those of the present day. Our reconstruction implies that surface air cooling was possibly two times greater than that of seawater around the Ryukyu Islands during the Last Glacial Maximum, which potentially enhanced the development of the East Asian summer monsoon during the last deglaciation. Considering the potential uncertainties in the temperature estimations, the climatic interpretations of this study are not necessarily definitive due to the limited number of samples. Nevertheless, our new geoarchaeological approach using coupled delta O-18 determinations of fossil snails and stalagmite fluid inclusion waters will be useful for reconstructing snapshots of seasonally resolved time series of air temperatures during the Quaternary.","[Asami, Ryuji; Hondo, Rikuto; Takayanagi, Hideko; Iryu, Yasufumi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Uemura, Ryu] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Fujita, Masaki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Anthropol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan; [Yamasaki, Shinji] Okinawa Prefectural Museum & Art Museum, Naha, Okinawa 9000006, Japan; [Shen, Chuan-Chou; Wu, Chung-Che] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, High Precis Mass Spectrometry & Environm Change L, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Shen, Chuan-Chou] Natl Taiwan Univ, Res Ctr Future Earth, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Wu, Chung-Che] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Inorgan Chem, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Jiang, Xiuyang] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Key Lab Humid Subtrop Ecogeog Proc, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Shinjo, Ryuichi] Res Inst Humanity & Nat RIHN, Kita Ku, Motoyama 457-4, Kyoto 6038047, Japan; [Shinjo, Ryuichi] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Kano, Akihiro] Univ Tokyo, Fac Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Tohoku University; Nagoya University; National Museum of Nature and Science; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Fujian Normal University; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN); University of the Ryukyus; University of Tokyo,"Asami, R (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",ryuji.asami.b5@tohoku.ac.jp,"lin, ke/GZM-8300-2022; Uemura, Ryu/C-9793-2012; Shen, Chuan-Chou/H-9642-2013; Wu, Chung-Che/AFO-7404-2022","Uemura, Ryu/0000-0002-4236-0085; Shen, Chuan-Chou/0000-0003-2833-2771; Jiang, Xiuyang/0000-0001-9617-0431; Wu, Dr. Chung-Che/0000-0003-0189-5208; Iryu, Yasufumi/0000-0002-6099-0662","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), KAKENHI [26550012, 26707028, 18K18522, 15H01729, 20H00628]; Marie Curie Fellowships by European Commission [891710]; Frontier Research in Duo (FRiD) of Tohoku University; Science Vanguard Research Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [109-2123-M-002-001]; Higher Education Sprout Project of the Ministry of Education [109L901001]; National Taiwan University [110L8907]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Marie Curie Fellowships by European Commission; Frontier Research in Duo (FRiD) of Tohoku University; Science Vanguard Research Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST); Higher Education Sprout Project of the Ministry of Education; National Taiwan University(National Taiwan University)","We are grateful to Dr. J.

Recent genetic studies have suggested that, despite this continuous presence, major demographic changes occurred in wolf populations between the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene, and that extant wolves trace their ancestry to a single Late Pleistocene population. Both the geographical origin of this ancestral population and how it became widespread remain unknown. Here, we used a spatially and temporally explicit modelling framework to analyse a data set of 90 modern and 45 ancient mitochondrial wolf genomes from across the Northern Hemisphere, spanning the last 50,000 years. Our results suggest that contemporary wolf populations trace their ancestry to an expansion from Beringia at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, and that this process was most likely driven by Late Pleistocene ecological fluctuations that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere. This study provides direct ancient genetic evidence that long-range migration has played an important role in the population history of a large carnivore, and provides insight into how wolves survived the wave of megafaunal extinctions at the end of the last glaciation. Moreover, because Late Pleistocene grey wolves were the likely source from which all modern dogs trace their origins, the demographic history described in this study has fundamental implications for understanding the geographical origin of the dog.","[Loog, Liisa; Larson, Greger] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Loog, Liisa; Frantz, Laurent; Willerslev, Eske; Eriksson, Anders; Manica, Andrea] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England; [Loog, Liisa] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Loog, Liisa] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge, England; [Thalmann, Olaf; Herzig, Karl-Heinz] Poznan Univ Med Sci, Dept Pediat Gastroenterol & Metab Dis, Poznan, Poland; [Sinding, Mikkel-Holger S.; Castruita, Jose A.

Here we use physical and biogeochemical measurements of hundreds of living and dead conifers to reconstruct the impact of heavy industrialisation around Norilsk in northern Siberia. Moreover, we develop a forward model with surface irradiance forcing to quantify long-distance effects of anthropogenic emissions on the functioning and productivity of Siberia's taiga. Downwind from the world's most polluted Arctic region, tree mortality rates of up to 100% have destroyed 24,000 km(2)boreal forest since the 1960s, coincident with dramatic increases in atmospheric sulphur, copper, and nickel concentrations. In addition to regional ecosystem devastation, we demonstrate how 'Arctic Dimming' can explain the circumpolar 'Divergence Problem', and discuss implications on the terrestrial carbon cycle.","[Kirdyanov, Alexander V.; Krusic, Paul J.; Piermattei, Alma; Buentgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Kirdyanov, Alexander V.; Shishov, Vladimir V.; Vaganov, Eugene A.; Korets, Mikhail A.; Mashukov, Dmitry A.; Onuchin, Alexander A.; Pimenov, Alexander V.; Prokushkin, Anatoly S.; Ryzhkova, Vera A.; Shishikin, Alexander S.] RAS, VN Sukachev Inst Forest SB, Fed Res Ctr, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia; [Kirdyanov, Alexander V.; Shishov, Vladimir V.; Fertikov, Alexey I.; Knorre, Anastasia A.; Prokushkin, Anatoly S.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Ecol & Geog, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Krusic, Paul J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Shishov, Vladimir V.; Ilyin, Viktor A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Math Methods & IT Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660075, Russia; [Vaganov, Eugene A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Rectorate, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Myglan, Vladimir S.; Barinov, Valentin V.; Taynik, Anna V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Humanities, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Browse, Jo] Univ Exeter, Ctr Geog & Environm Sci, Penryn TR10 9FE, England; [Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Knorre, Anastasia A.] State Nat Reserve Stolby, Krasnoyarsk 660006, Russia; [Kukarskikh, Vladimir V.] RAS, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Smith, Kevin T.] US Forest Serv, Durham, NH 08324 USA; [Wild, Martin] Inst Atmosphere Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zorita, Eduardo] Helmholtz Ctr Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Buentgen, Ulf] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf] Global Change Res Ctr, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Buentgen, Ulf] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","University of Cambridge; Russian Academy of Sciences; Krasnoyarsk Science Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences; Siberian Federal University; Stockholm University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; University of Exeter; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Plant & Animal Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno","Buntgen, U (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.;Buntgen, U (corresponding author), Global Change Res Ctr, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.;Buntgen, U (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ulf.buentgen@geog.cam.ac.uk,"Piermattei, Alma/AAQ-7143-2020; Knorre, Anastasia/ABB-8057-2021; A, Kirdyanov V/J-6789-2013; Korets, Mikhail/P-9487-2015; Shishov, Vladimir/I-6256-2013; Kukarskih, Vladimir/ABD-5650-2020; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; Kukarskih, Vladimir/O-7156-2017","Piermattei, Alma/0000-0002-7704-8382; A, Kirdyanov V/0000-0002-6797-4964; Korets, Mikhail/0000-0002-5015-5874; Shishov, Vladimir/0000-0001-8850-6142; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Kukarskih, Vladimir/0000-0002-6552-1726; Ilyin, Viktor/0000-0001-5221-1211","ERC project MONOSTAR [AdG 882727]; Russian Science Foundation [19-77-30015, 18-14-00072]; SustES-Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000797]; Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education [FSRZ-2020-0010, FSRZ-2020-0014]; USDA Forest Service",ERC project MONOSTAR; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); SustES-Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions; Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education; USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"As part of the ERC project MONOSTAR (AdG 882727), the study received further supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project #18-14-00072) and the 'SustES-Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions' (CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000797).

Over 200 million people live on Europe's coastline, and aquatic environments are the top recreational destination in the region. In terms of public health, interactions with 'blue space' (eg, coasts, rivers, lakes) are often considered solely in terms of risk (eg, drowning, microbial pollution). Exposure to blue space can, however, promote health and well-being and prevent disease, although underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Aims and methods The BlueHealth project aims to understand the relationships between exposure to blue space and health and well-being, to map and quantify the public health impacts of changes to both natural blue spaces and associated urban infrastructure in Europe, and to provide evidence-based information to policymakers on how to maximise health benefits associated with interventions in and around aquatic environments. To achieve these aims, an evidence base will be created through systematic reviews, analyses of secondary data sets and analyses of new data collected through a bespoke international survey and a wide range of community-level interventions. We will also explore how to deliver the benefits associated with blue spaces to those without direct access through the use of virtual reality. Scenarios will be developed that allow the evaluation of health impacts in plausible future societal contexts and changing environments. BlueHealth will develop key inputs into policymaking and land/water-use planning towards more salutogenic and sustainable uses of blue space, particularly in urban areas. Ethics and dissemination Throughout the BlueHealth project, ethics review and approval are obtained for all relevant aspects of the study by the local ethics committees prior to any work being initiated and an ethics expert has been appointed to the project advisory board. So far, ethical approval has been obtained for the BlueHealth International Survey and for community-level interventions taking place in Spain, Italy and the UK. Engagement of stakeholders, including the public, involves citizens in many aspects of the project. Results of all individual studies within the BlueHealth project will be published with open access. After full anonymisation and application of any measures necessary to prevent disclosure, data generated in the project will be deposited into open data repositories of the partner institutions, in line with a formal data management plan. Other knowledge and tools developed in the project will be made available via the project website (www.bluehealth2020.eu). Project results will ultimately provide key inputs to planning and policy relating to blue space, further stimulating the integration of environmental and health considerations into decision-making, such that blue infrastructure is developed across Europe with both public health and the environment in mind.","[Grellier, James; White, Mathew P.; Elliott, Lewis R.; Fleming, Lora E.] Univ Exeter, Med Sch, ECEHH, Truro, England; [Grellier, James] Imperial Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, Fac Med, London, England; [White, Mathew P.; Elliott, Lewis R.] Univ Exeter, Med Sch, PAtH, Exeter, Devon, England; [Albin, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Lab Med, OEM, Lund, Sweden; [Albin, Maria] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med IMM, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bell, Simon] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Landscape Architect, Tartu, Estonia; [Bell, Simon] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, OPENspace, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gascon, Mireia; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Inst Salud Global Barcelona ISGlobal, Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, Barcelona, Spain; [Gascon, Mireia; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] Inst Salud Global Barcelona ISGlobal, Ctr Res Environm Epidemiol CREAL, Barcelona, Spain; [Gascon, Mireia; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, Barcelona, Spain; [Gascon, Mireia; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.] CIBERESP, Barcelona, Spain; [Gualdi, Silvio] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy; [Mancini, Laura] ISS, Rome, Italy; [Sarigiannis, Denis A.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki AUTH, Thessaloniki, Greece; [van den Bosch, Matilda] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [van den Bosch, Matilda] WHO, Reg Off Europe, European Ctr Environm & Hlth, Bonn, Germany; [van den Bosch, Matilda; Wolf, Tanja] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Wuijts, Susanne] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands",University of Exeter; Imperial College London; University of Exeter; Lund University; Karolinska Institutet; Estonian University of Life Sciences; Edinburgh College of Art; University of Edinburgh; ISGlobal; CRESIB; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; ISGlobal; Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of British Columbia; World Health Organization; University of British Columbia; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Grellier, J (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Med Sch, ECEHH, Truro, England.;Grellier, J (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, Fac Med, London, England.",j.grellier@exeter.ac.uk,"Gascon, Mireia/G-1275-2016; Sarigiannis, Denis/AAD-4251-2019; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; White, Mathew P/AAZ-4113-2021; Fleming, Lora E/ABH-1310-2021; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J/C-3914-2017; Grellier, James/M-2740-2014; van den Bosch, Matilda/F-1550-2013","Gascon, Mireia/0000-0003-4537-8472; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Fleming, Lora E/0000-0003-1076-9967; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J/0000-0001-9461-7981; Elliott, Lewis/0000-0003-3864-9465; Bell, Simon/0000-0002-0986-3887; Grellier, James/0000-0002-7458-7479; mancini, laura/0000-0003-3667-5221; SARIGIANNIS, DIMOSTHENIS/0000-0003-2514-314X; White, Mathew Philip/0000-0002-4168-7289; van den Bosch, Matilda/0000-0003-1410-0099",European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [666773],European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme,This work was supported by funding received from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 666773.,,92,102,107,15,113,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",2044-6055,,,BMJ OPEN,BMJ Open,JUN,2017,6,,,,,,e016188,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016188,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,FB8LT,28615276,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000406391200213,View Full Record in Web of Science

We test this concept using records of volcanic ash layers of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption dated to ca. 40,000 y ago (40 ka B.P.). The distribution of the Campanian Ignimbrite has been enhanced by the discovery of cryptotephra deposits (volcanic ash layers that are not visible to the naked eye) in archaeological cave sequences. They enable us to synchronize archaeological and paleoclimatic records through the period of transition from Neanderthal to the earliest anatomically modern human populations in Europe. Our results confirm that the combined effects of a major volcanic eruption and severe climatic cooling failed to have lasting impacts on Neanderthals or early modern humans in Europe. We infer that modern humans proved a greater competitive threat to indigenous populations than natural disasters.","[Lowe, John; Blockley, Simon; Hardiman, Mark; Housley, Rupert; MacLeod, Alison; Satow, Chris] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England;

In the marine environment, large volumes of data to assess how concentrations have changed over time can be gathered from indicator species such as seabirds, including through sampling feathers from archival collections and museums. As apex predators, Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) are subject to high concentrations of bioaccumulative and bio-magnifying contaminants, and reflect the health of their local marine environment. We analysed Flesh-footed Shearwater feathers from Australia from museum specimens and live birds collected between 1900 and 2011 and assessed temporal trends in three trace elements of toxicological concern: cadmium, mercury, and lead. Concentrations of cadmium increased by 1.5% per year (95% CI: +0.6, +3.0), while mercury was unchanged through the time series (-0.3% per year; 05% CI: -2.1, +1.5), and lead decreased markedly (-2.1% per year, 95% CI: -3.2, -1.0). A reduction in birds' trophic position through the 20th century, and decreased atmospheric emissions were the likely driving factors for mercury and lead, respectively. By combining archival material from museum specimens with contemporary samples, we have been able to further elucidate the potential threats posed to these apex predators by metal contamination.

The first known occurrence of cremation in the territory corresponding to modern Belgium dates back to the Mesolithic period. From the end of the Neolithic onward, the practice of cremation was characterized by periods in which this rite was predominant and periods of contractions, defined by a decrease in the use of this funerary ritual. This paper aims to quantify such phenomenon for the first time by modeling discontinuities in burial practices through kernel density analysis of 1428 radiocarbon (C-14) dates from 311 archaeological sites located in Belgium from the Mesolithic to the Middle Ages. Despite possible taphonomic and sampling biases, the results highlight the existence of periods with a large uptake of cremation rite followed by periods of contractions; such discontinuities took place in correlation with changes in the socio-economical structure of local communities, as, for example, during the later Middle Bronze Age and at the end of the Roman Period.","[Capuzzo, Giacomo; Hlad, Marta; Sabaux, Charlotte; Salesse, Kevin; Sengelov, Amanda; Stamataki, Elisavet; Vercauteren, Martine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Res Unit Anthropol & Human Genet, CP192,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Snoeck, Christophe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Chem, Res Unit Analyt Environm & Geochem, AMGC We VUB, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Snoeck, Christophe] Univ Libre Bruxelles, G Time Lab, CP160-02,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Snoeck, Christophe; Dalle, Sarah; Annaert, Rica; Hlad, Marta; Kontopoulos, Ioannis; Stamataki, Elisavet; Veselka, Barbara; Tys, Dries] Vrije Univ Brussels, Maritime Cultures Res Inst, Dept Art Sci & Archaeol, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Boudin, Mathieu] Royal Inst Cultural Heritage, Jubelpk 1, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Dalle, Sarah; Sabaux, Charlotte; Sengelov, Amanda; De Mulder, Guy] Univ Ghent, Dept Archaeol, Sint Pietersnieuwstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Salesse, Kevin] Univ Bordeaux, UMR 5199, PACEA Prehist Actuel Culture Environm & Anthropol, Bldg B8,Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire,CS 50023, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Warmenbol, Eugene] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Rech Archeol & Patrimoine, Dept Hist Arts & Archaeol, CP133,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Ghent University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Capuzzo, G (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Res Unit Anthropol & Human Genet, CP192,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",giacomo.capuzzo@ulb.ac.be,"Snoeck, Christophe/V-9679-2019; Veselka, Barbara/ACP-7746-2022; Sabaux, Charlotte/AAT-1840-2021; STAMATAKI, ELISAVET/GWZ-9096-2022","Snoeck, Christophe/0000-0003-3770-4055; Veselka, Barbara/0000-0002-2692-9577; Sabaux, Charlotte/0000-0002-2805-2529; STAMATAKI, ELISAVET/0000-0002-7010-2585; Capuzzo, Giacomo/0000-0003-3477-4170; Dalle, Sarah/0000-0003-3338-0700; Kontopoulos, Ioannis/0000-0001-5591-8917; Salesse, Kevin/0000-0003-2492-1536; De Mulder, Guy/0000-0002-4180-502X; Sengelov, Amanda/0000-0003-3884-9600",FWO-F.R.S.-FNRS; EOS project CRUMBEL [30999782]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen (FWO); FWO,FWO-F.R.S.-FNRS; EOS project CRUMBEL; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen (FWO)(FWO); FWO(FWO),"This project was made possible thanks to the financial support of the FWO-F.R.S.-FNRS with the EOS project No. 30999782 CRUMBEL.

Genomic and isotopic research demonstrates non-linear genetic turnover and technological shifts between the Copper and Iron Ages of the GHP, which influenced the dietary strategies of numerous cultures that intermixed and overlapped through time. Given the complexities of these prehistoric cultural and demographic processes, this study aims to identify and elucidate diachronic and culture-specific dietary signatures. We report on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from 74 individuals from nineteen sites in the GHP dating to a similar to 3000-year time span between the Early Bronze and Early Iron Ages. The samples broadly indicate a terrestrial C-3 diet with nuanced differences amongst populations and through time, suggesting exogenous influences that manifested in subsistence strategies. Slightly elevated delta N-15 values for Bronze Age samples imply higher reliance on protein than in the Iron Age. Interestingly, the Fuzesabony have carbon values typical of C-4 vegetation indicating millet consumption, or that of a grain with comparable delta C-13 ratios, which corroborates evidence from outside the GHP for its early cultivation during the Middle Bronze Age. Finally, our results also suggest locally diverse subsistence economies for GHP Scythians.","[Gamarra, Beatriz] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Gamarra, Beatriz] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Carlson, Kellie Sara Duffett; Pinhasi, Ron] Univ Vienna, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Carlson, Kellie Sara Duffett; Pinhasi, Ron] Univ Vienna, Human Evolut & Archaeol Sci, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Bernert, Zsolt; Kiss, Krisztian] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Anthropol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Cseki, Andrea] Archeodata 1998 Ltd, Polgar, Hungary; [Csengeri, Piroska; Hellebrandt, Magdolna; Horvath, Antonia; Koos, Judit] Herman Otto Museum, Dept Archaeol, Gorgey Artur U 28, H-3529 Miskolc, Hungary; [Domboroczki, Laszlo] Doba Istvan Castle Museum, Dept Archaeol, Var 1, H-3300 Eger, Hungary; [Endrodi, Anna] Budapest Hist Museum, Aquincum Museum, Dept Prehist & Migrat Period, Szentendrei Ut 135, H-1031 Budapest, Hungary; [Endrodi, Anna] Archaeol Pk, Szentendrei Ut 135, H-1031 Budapest, Hungary; [Kiraly, Agnes; Kohler, Kitti] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Humanities, Inst Archaeol, Toth Kalman Utca 4, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary; [Kiss, Krisztian; Szeniczey, Tamas; Hajdu, Tamas] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anthropol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Kovacs, Peter] Damjanich Janos Museum, Kossuth Ter 4, H-5000 Szolnok, Hungary; [Szolnoki, Laszlo; Dani, Janos] Deri Museum, Deri Ter 1, H-4026 Debrecen, Hungary; [Zoffmann, Zsuzsanna K.] Hungarian Natl Museum, Dept Anthropol, Muzeum Krt 14-16, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Sirak, Kendra] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sirak, Kendra] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Vienna; University of Vienna; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Centre for the Humanities; Eotvos Lorand University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University,"Pinhasi, R (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.;Pinhasi, R (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Human Evolut & Archaeol Sci, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.;Hajdu, T (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anthropol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",amccall317@gmail.com; tamas.hajdu@ttk.elte.hu; ron.pinhasi@univie.ac.at,,"McCall, Ashley/0000-0001-7968-5564","Hungarian Research, Development and Innovation Office [FK128013]; Eotvos Lorand University; Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship [GOIPG/2015/2275]; Marie-Curie H2020-MSCA-IF-2015 [703373]","Hungarian Research, Development and Innovation Office(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); Eotvos Lorand University; Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Marie-Curie H2020-MSCA-IF-2015","Open access funding provided by Eotvos Lorand University.

The timing of the arrival of humans in South America and the extinction of megafauna is still debated and these sites contribute both to this discussion and to the reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene paleoenvironment. Lagoa do Quari, 40 km south of Sao Raimundo Nonato, Piaui state, is a marsh deposit in the present semiarid caatinga environment, excavated by an interdisciplinary team in 2002-2003. This paper presents the archaeological, palaeontological, geological, chronological, stratigraphical and palynological results and their implications for the Quaternary of northeastern Brazil. The site has a rich megafaunal bonebed at the bottom, dominated by Eremotherium giant sloth remains with poor biodiversity, and a sandy-silty deposit at the top; two C-14 dates constrain this latter layer to 9,944-9,557 and 6,308-6,177 cal. years BP and the associated rich lithic industry of quartz and chert shows a technical continuity throughout the Holocene in the region.

However, uncertainties often arise from comparison among studies using different species, analytical and statistical methods. The long-term temporal trends of Hg exposure were reconstructed for a key sentinel species, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). Body feathers were sampled from museum collections covering 150 years in time (from 1866 to 2015) from West Greenland (n = 124), Norway (n = 102), and Sweden (n = 87). A significant non-linear trend was observed in the Norwegian subpopulation, with a 60% increase in exposure occurring from 1866 to 1957 followed by a 40% decline until 2015. In the Swedish subpopulation, studied at a later period, the Hg exposure showed a drastic decline of 70% from 1967 to 2011. In contrast, no significant trend could be observed in the Greenland subpopulation. The additional analysis of dietary proxies (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in general increased performance of the temporal trend models, but this was dependent on the subpopulation and study period. The downward trend of Hg coincided with the decreasing delta C-13 and delta N-15 in the Norwegian subpopulation, suggesting a potential dietary mitigation of Hg contamination. Hg exposure in both the Greenland and Norwegian subpopulations was consistently below the suggested threshold for adverse health effects (40.0 mu g g(-1)), while the maximum exposure in the Swedish subpopulation was distinctively elevated ( median: 46.0 mu g g(-1)) and still remains well above natural background concentrations (maximum 5.0 mu g g(-1)).

Using an individual-based model framework and globally available data on PCB concentrations in killer whale tissues, we show that PCB-mediated effects on reproduction and immune function threaten the long-term viability of >50% of the world's killer whale populations. PCB-mediated effects over the coming 100 years predicted that killer whale populations near industrialized regions, and those feeding at high trophic levels regardless of location, are at high risk of population collapse. Despite a near-global ban of PCBs more than 30 years ago. the world's killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class.","[Desforges, Jean-Pierre; Eulaers, Igor; Sonne, Christian; Dietz, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Hall, Ailsa; McConnell, Bernie] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Rosing-Asvid, Aqqalu] Greenland Inst Nat Resources, POB 570, Nuuk 3900, Greenland; [Barber, Jonathan L.] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Brownlow, Andrew] SRUC Vet Serv Drummondhill, Scottish Marine Anim Stranding Scheme, Stratherrick Rd, Inverness IV2 4JZ, Scotland; [De Guise, Sylvain; Levin, Milton] Univ Connecticut, Dept Pathobiol & Vet Sci, 61 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [De Guise, Sylvain] Connecticut Sea Grant, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Jepson, Paul D.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England; [Letcher, Robert J.] Carleton Univ, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Ross, Peter S.] Ocean Wise Conservat Assoc, POB 3232, Vancouver, BC V6B 3X8, Canada; [Samarra, Filipa; Vikingson, Gisli] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Skulagata 4, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",Aarhus University; University of St Andrews; Greenland Institute of Natural Resources; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; University of Connecticut; Zoological Society of London; Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI),"Desforges, JP; Dietz, R (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.;Hall, A (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",jpd@bios.au.dk; ajh7@st-andrews.ac.uk; rdi@bios.au.dk,"Eulaers, Igor/A-3265-2012; Rosing-Asvid, Aqqalu/GRN-7660-2022; Eulaers, Igor/AAJ-5912-2020; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/B-9217-2016; De Guise, Sylvain/HGF-1052-2022; Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; Brownlow, Andrew/ABA-4653-2020; Sonne, Christian/I-7532-2013; McConnell, Bernie/G-6553-2019","Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/0000-0002-6816-7697; Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; Brownlow, Andrew/0000-0001-9885-7480; Sonne, Christian/0000-0001-5723-5263; Samarra, Filipa/0000-0002-9909-0565; Jepson, Paul D/0000-0002-7245-375X; Hall, Ailsa/0000-0002-7562-1771; Barber, Jonathan/0000-0002-1495-680X; McConnell, Bernie/0000-0001-7575-5270","Canadian National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) [PGSD3-443700-2013]; Aarhus University's Graduate School and Science and Technology (GSST); Department of Bioscience; Danish DANCEA program [MST-112-00171, MST-112-00199]; Defra, Scottish and Welsh Governments (for CSIP/SMASS/CEFAS); Icelandic Research Fund (i.

For varve counting, a novel approach using high resolution X-ray fluorescence (mu XRF) and X-radiography was applied, described here in detail for the first time, and applied to the Late Glacial sediments of core SG06. This new technique was carried out alongside conventional varve counting by thin-section microscopy (Schlolaut et al., 2012). This dual approach allows comparison of results from the two independent counting methods on metre to sub-mm scales, enabling the identification and characterisation of differences between the techniques, and quantification of their weaknesses. Combining the results produces a more robust chronology than either counting method could produce alone. The reliability of this dual approach is demonstrated by comparison of the combined chronology with the radiocarbon dataset of SG06, calibrated with the tree-ring derived late Glacial section of IntCal09.

Several eruptions since 40 ka have previously been described, particularly from Popocatepetl, the southernmost volcano of the range. However, the longer-term eruption history of the SNVR is poorly understood, due to challenges with correlating limited exposures of older pyroclastic sequences, and in discriminating between tephras derived from different sources. Here we describe two extensive exposures located between Popocatepetl and lztaccihuatl volcanoes, which provide a more complete and longer-term explosive eruption record of the SNVR: the Nepopualco and Xalitzintla tephra sequences. A detailed tephrostratigraphic survey, together with new Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronological analyses and glass geochemistry, has permitted the characterization of identified eruption units further leading to the determination of geochemical fields for each volcano and the subsequent discernment of volcanic sources. Our results show that, since the collapse of the Los Pies Cone, which destroyed the Pale edifice at 631 +/- 44 ka (2 sigma), Iztaccihuatl has produced at least 6 explosive rhyolitic eruptions. After coeval activity with Popocatepetl, between similar to 600 and similar to 500 ka, Iztaccihuatl's explosive activity ceased while Popocatepetl's continued until present day. Popocatepetl has produced at least 27 medium to large explosive eruptions (inferred VEI 4-6), commonly of andesitic to dad tic compositions. Some of these eruptions deposited pumice fallout of >1 m thick in both the Nepopualco and Xalitzintla sequences (e.g. the 339 +/- 16 ka [2 sigma]NT-23/ WRT-7 eruption), suggesting that Popocatepetl has produced several eruptions similar in magnitude to the wellknown similar to 14 ka Tutti Frutti Pumice (a VEI 6 eruption with a similar to 5 km(3) tephra volume). The Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl tephras are interbedded with deposits from more distal volcanoes, including some mafic to intermediate products of unknown sources (possibly from nearby monogenetic cones) and tephras related to the late Pleistocene eruptions of TIaloc-Telapon ( including the tephra layer produced by the San Valentin Ignimbrite, recently Ar-40/Ar-39 dated in this study at similar to 102 ka; 2 sigma). Our new chemical, stratigraphic and geochronologic investigations of these pyroclastic deposits, predominantly from Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, provide information on the scale and frequency of medium to large magnitude explosive eruptions over a longer-time period than currently known and that have had potential to disperse tephra across central Mexico since the middle to late Pleistocene. This new data can be used to determine the source of further unknown tephras in the region as well as to better assess the volcanic hazard to the densely populated megalopolis of Mexico City.

However, the estimation of their carbon balance remains uncertain due to the diversity of crops and cropping systems together with the strong influence of human management. Here, we present a multi-site model comparison for four cropland ecosystem models namely the DNDC, ORCHIDEE-STICS, CERES-EGC and SPA models. We compare the accuracy of the models in predicting net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-eco) as well as actual evapo-transpiration (ETa) for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) and maize (Zea mays L) derived from eddy covariance measurements on five sites along a gradient of climatic conditions from eastern to southwesterly Europe. The models are all able to simulate daily GPP. The simulation results for daily ETa and R-eco are, however, less accurate. The resulting simulation of daily NEE is adequate except in some cases where models fail due to a lack in phase and amplitude alignment. ORCHIDEE-STICS and SPA show the best performance. Nevertheless, they are not able to simulate full crop rotations or the multiple management practices used. CERES-EGC, and especially DNDC, although exhibiting a lower level of model accuracy, are able to simulate such conditions, resulting in more accurate simulation of annual cumulative NEE.

The species distribution maps in www.coralsoftheworld.com are based on comprehensive global assessments of the world's 150 coral ecoregions. Original surveys by the authors cover 4941 sites in 85 ecoregions worldwide. These are combined with a thorough summation of all biogeographic, taxonomic and related literature as well as an extensive review of museum and photographic collections worldwide and extensive inter-personal communications. Species occurrences in ecoregions are recorded as confirmed, strongly predicted, uncertain or absent. These data are used to present global maps of diversity and affinity at species level. There are two templates of Indo-Pacific diversity and affinity: one dominated by the Coral Triangle and one created by poleward continental boundary currents. There is a high degree of uniformity within the main body of the Coral Triangle; diversity and affinities both decrease in all directions. The Sunda Shelf ecoregion now qualifies for inclusion in the Coral Triangle and the Java Sea ecoregion is borderline. There is very little Indo-Pacific provincialism. Two separate centers of diversity occur in the Indian Ocean: the subequatorial west, and the Red Sea. Most species of the far eastern Pacific occur in the central Pacific. The Caribbean dominates Atlantic distribution and affinities and also has high uniformity. Individual ecoregions have very varying data comprehensiveness. Distribution patterns that distinguish between geographic variation within a species and the geographic overlap of sister species support the concept of reticulate evolution.","[Veron, John; Stafford-Smith, Mary; DeVantier, Lyndon; Turak, Emre] Coral Reef Res, 10 Benalla Rd, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Veron, John] James Cook Univ, Dept Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Veron, John] Univ Queensland, Dept Earth Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Turak, Emre] James Cook Univ, Australian Ctr Trop Freshwater Res, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University; University of Queensland; James Cook University,"Veron, J (corresponding author), Coral Reef Res, 10 Benalla Rd, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",j.veron@coralreefresearch.com,,,Ocean Ark Alliance; Google Earth; Atlas of Living Australia; EcoForce; Henry Foundation; Odyssey Publishing; PIJAC; Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council of NOAA; Australian Research Council,Ocean Ark Alliance; Google Earth(Google Incorporated); Atlas of Living Australia; EcoForce; Henry Foundation; Odyssey Publishing; PIJAC; Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council of NOAA; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"More people have given time to logistic support than we can record, but special thanks are due to Rupert Ormond, Michael Pearson and the staff of the Ras Mohammed National Park, the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development in Saudi Arabia, Virginie Tiliot and Alain Jeudy of the Eritrea Coastal Marine Biodiversity Program, Catherine Cheung, Malik Abdul-Aziz and the UNDP Socotra Biodiversity Project in Yemen, Ron Johnson and Sibylle Riedmiller in Tanzania, Pierre Vasseur in Madagascar, Alec Dawson Shepherd and John Collie in the Seychelles, Suki Ekartane in Sri Lanka, Gregor Hodgson, Vo Si Tuan and the Nha Trang Institute of Oceanology, IUCN and WWF in Vietnam, Gregor Hodgson, Ed Gomez, Al Licuanan and many other colleagues in the Philippines, Hasnah Ibrahim and Department of Fisheries in Brunei Darussalam, Denise McCorry, Alan Chen and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department in Hong Kong, Moritaka Nishihira and many other colleagues in Japan, Tim Werner in Papua New Guinea, Suharsono and the Indonesian Ministry of Sciences, Chris Paporakis, Michael Cortenbach and many other colleagues in Indonesia and Ed Lovell in Fiji.

Core from Ocean Drilling Project Site 758 in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean contains discrete tephra layers that we have geochemically correlated to the Young Toba Tuff (73.7 +/- 0.3 ka), Middle Toba Tuff (502 +/- 0.7 ka) and two eruptions (OTTA and OTTB) related to the Old Toba Tuff (792.4 +/- 0.5 and 785.6 +/- 0.7 ka, respectively) (40Ar/39Ar data reported as full external precision, I sigma). Within ODP 758 Termination IX is coincident with OTTB and hence this age tightly constrains the transition from Marine Isotope Stage 19-20 for the Indian Ocean. The core also preserves the location of the Australasian tektites, and the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary with Bayesian age-depth models used to determine the ages of these events, c. 786 and c. 784 ka, respectively. In North America, the Bishop Tuff (766.6 +/- 0.4 ka) and Lava Creek Tuff B (627.0 +/- 1.5 ka) have quantifiable stratigraphic relationships to the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary. Linear age-depth extrapolation, allowing for uncertainties associated with potential hiatuses in five different terrestrial sections, defines a geomagnetic reversal age of 789 +/- 6 ka.

(2014), we suggest at the level of temporal resolution currently attainable using radioisotopic dating the last reversal of Earths geomagnetic field was isochronous. An overall Matuyama-Brunhes reversal age of 783.4 +/- 0.6 ka is calculated, which allowing for inherent uncertainties in the astronomical dating approach, is indistinguishable from the LRO4 stack age (780 +/- 5 ka) for the geomagnetic boundary. Our high-precision age is 10 +/- 2 ka older than the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary age of 773 +/- 1 ka, as reported previously by Channell et al. (2010) for Atlantic Ocean records. As ODP 758 features in the LRO4 marine stack, the high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages determined here, as well as the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary age, can be used as temporally accurate and precise anchors for the Pleistocene time scale.

However, drivers of the horizontal (i.e., latitudinal and longitudinal) and vertical (i.e., position in the water column) distribution patterns of fishes associated with these artificial habitats are not fully understood on a GOM-wide scale. To build upon previous studies on a large spatial scale and focus on species-specific drivers, we conducted 114 submersible rotating drop-camera and water quality sonde surveys at 54 platforms throughout the GOM. We then fitted two sets of binomial generalized additive mixed models integrating environmental and structural (i.e., characteristics of platforms) predictors to encounter/nonencounter data for 17 fish species so as to understand their horizontal and vertical distribution patterns throughout the GOM in platform habitat. Significant predictors for horizontal distribution included distance from shore (for Bermuda Chub Kyphosus saltatrix, Greater Amberjack Seriola dumerili, Vermilion Snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens), salinity (Bermuda Chub, Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus), the number of platforms within 5 km (Blue Runner Caranx crysos, Crevalle Jack Caranx hippos), and dissolved oxygen concentration (Red Snapper). Significant predictors for vertical distribution included temperature (for Atlantic Spadefish Chaetodipterus faber, Bermuda Chub, Blue Runner, Greater Amberjack, Red Snapper), salinity (Greater Amberjack, Red Snapper), dissolved oxygen concentration (Red Snapper), and seafloor depth (Red Snapper). However, the majority of the study species were not influenced by the predictors included in the horizontal (11 of 17 species) and vertical distribution (12 of 17 species) generalized additive mixed models. Thus, many GOM fishes were found to associate with platforms over a relatively wide range of environmental conditions and platform characteristics. This suggests specific environmental conditions and distinct platform characteristics may not be as important as the simple number of available platforms for determining the distributions of many platform-associated fishes in the GOM.","[Bolser, Derek G.; Egerton, Jack P.; Loughran, Tyler; Erisman, Brad E.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Egerton, Jack P.] Echol Ltd, Menai Bridge LL59 5HN, Gwynedd, Wales; [Gruss, Arnaud] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Beyea, Taylor; McCain, Kyle] LGL Ecol Res Associates, Bryan, TX 77802 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Erisman, BE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",berisman@utexas.edu,,,"U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Environmental Studies Program, Washington, D.C.

In contrast, little is known about the archaeological record from the high-elevation regions on either side of the Rift. Melka Wakena is a newly discovered site-complex on the Southeastern Ethiopian Highlands (SEH) (>2300 m above mean sea level) just east of the central sector of the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), where eight archaeological and two paleontological localities were discovered to date. Nine archaeological horizons from three localities were tested so far, all dated to the second half of the early Pleistocene (-1.6 to >0.7 Ma). All the lithic assemblages belong to the Acheulian technocomplex. Here we report on geochronological, stratigraphic, paleontological and lithic technological aspects of the tested localities and contextualize them in the broader framework of hominin cultural evolution in eastern Africa. Findings from Melka Wakena, assessed against the backdrop of the few other highland sites (Melka Kunture and Gadeb), support a scenario of expansion rather than dispersal from the Rift to the highlands. When considered in the context of the Rift-highlands interface, results of the first-phase research at Melka Wakena help to parse existing general models into archaeologically testable hypotheses and demonstrate the site's potential to contribute to research of early prehistory and to understanding the dynamics of early Pleistocene hominin populations in eastern Africa.

Twelve disdrometer datasets across three latitude bands are analyzed in this study, spanning a broad range of precipitation regimes: light rain, orographic, deep convective, organized midlatitude, and tropical oceanic. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reveal comprehensive modes of global DSD spatial and temporal variability. Although the locations contain different distributions of individual DSD parameters, all locations are found to have the same modes of variability. Based on PCA, six groups of points with unique DSD characteristics emerge. The physical processes that underpin these groups are revealed through supporting radar observations. Group 1 (group 2) is characterized by high (low) liquid water content (LWC), broad (narrow) distribution widths, and large (small) median drop diameters D-0. Radar analysis identifies group 1 (group 2) as convective (stratiform) rainfall. Group 3 is characterized by weak, shallow radar echoes and large concentrations of small drops, indicative of warm rain showers. Group 4 identifies heavy stratiform precipitation. The low latitudes exhibit distinct bimodal distributions of the normalized intercept parameter N-w, LWC, and D-0 and are found to have a clustering of points (group 5) with high rain rates, large N-w, and moderate D-0, a signature of robust warm rain processes. A distinct group associated with ice-based convection (group 6) emerges in the midlatitudes. Although all locations exhibit the same covariance of parameters associated with these groups, it is likely that the physical processes responsible for shaping the DSDs vary as a function of location.","[Dolan, B.; Fuchs, B.; Rutledge, S.

Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of this genus using DNA sequence data from two nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene, sampled from throughout the geographic range of Chalcophaps. We find support for three major evolutionary lineages in our phylogenetic reconstruction, each corresponding to the three currently recognized Chalcophaps species. Despite this general concordance, we identify discordant mitochondrial and nuclear ancestries in the subspecies C. longirostris timorensis, raising further questions about the evolutionary history of this Timor endemic population. Within each of the three species, we find evidence for isolation by distance or hierarchical population structure, indicating an important role for geography in the diversification of this genus. Despite being distributed broadly across a highly fragmented geographic region known as a hotspot for avian diversification, the Chalcophaps doves show modest levels of phenotypic and genetic diversity, a pattern potentially explained by strong population connectivity owing to high overwater dispersal capability.","[DeRaad, Devon A.; Ostrow, Emily N.; DeCicco, Lucas H.; Shult, Hannah T.; Moyle, Robert G.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [DeRaad, Devon A.; Ostrow, Emily N.; DeCicco, Lucas H.; Shult, Hannah T.; Moyle, Robert G.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Manthey, Joseph D.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Andersen, Michael J.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [Andersen, Michael J.] Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [Hosner, Peter A.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hosner, Peter A.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Global Mt Biodivers, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Joseph, Leo] CSIRO Natl Res Collect Australia, Australian Natl Wildlife Collect, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Dumbacher, John P.] Calif Acad Sci, Golden Gate Pk, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA",University of Kansas; University of Kansas; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); California Academy of Sciences,"DeRaad, DA (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;DeRaad, DA (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",devonderaad@gmail.com,"; Dumbacher, John/B-5280-2009","Hosner, Peter/0000-0001-7499-6224; Dumbacher, John/0000-0001-8942-1554","National Science Foundation [DEB-1557053, DEB-1557051]; VILLUM FONDEN [25925]; Madison & Lila Self Graduate Fellowship; NSF GRFP",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); VILLUM FONDEN(Villum Fonden); Madison & Lila Self Graduate Fellowship; NSF GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"We thank the Western Australian Museum, Australian National Wildlife Collection, the California Academy of Sciences, Florida Museum of Natural History, Louisiana State University Museum of Natural His-tory, for providing tissue and blood samples to make this project possible.

Soil microorganisms play a central role in decomposing organic matter, in determining the release of mineral nutrients, and in nutrient cycling, and have direct and indirect effects on both crop growth and quality, as well as on the sustainability of soil productivity. In addition, soil microorganisms substantially contribute to the resistance and resilience of agro-ecosystems to abiotic disturbance and stress. Therefore, changes in microbial communities may directly affect soil ecosystem function since microbes can respond rapidly to environmental changes because of the vastness of microbial biomass and diversity. An increasing number of studies have shown how environmental impacts that cause modifications in microbial community structure and diversity ultimately affect soil biological processes. Agricultural land management is one of most significant anthropogenic activities that substantially alter soil characteristics, including physical, chemical, and biological properties. The present chapter gives a picture of the effect of different agricultural management practices on soil microbial community structure and function. A case study on the effects of tillage and nitrogen fertilization on soil bacterial community structure is also reported.","[Bevivino, Annamaria; Dalmastri, Claudia] ENEA, Terr & Prod Syst Sustainabil Dept, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Biotechnol & Agroind Div,Energy & Sustainable Eco, Rome, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Bevivino, A (corresponding author), ENEA, Terr & Prod Syst Sustainabil Dept, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Biotechnol & Agroind Div,Energy & Sustainable Eco, Rome, Italy.",annamaria.bevivino@enea.it,"Dalmastri, Claudia/AAD-1627-2021",,COST Action BioLink: Linking soil biodiversity and ecosystem function in European forests [FP1305]; MIUR (Integrated Special Fund for Research- FISR); MIUR (Research Department of Italian Government) [191],"COST Action BioLink: Linking soil biodiversity and ecosystem function in European forests; MIUR (Integrated Special Fund for Research- FISR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); MIUR (Research Department of Italian Government)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This study was supported by COST Action FP1305 BioLink: Linking soil biodiversity and ecosystem function in European forests.

In Arabia, such records are typically confined to eccentricity-modulated insolation maxima, and are often spatially and temporally discontinuous. Here we present records from a single locality in Northern Arabia of wetter interludes during both global interglacial and glacial conditions, providing a unique opportunity to examine the nature of these events in a common setting. At Jubbah, in the southern Nefud Desert, lake and wetland deposits reveal the repeated formation of a water body within a large endorheic basin over the past ca. 360 kyr. Lake/wetland formation occurred during MIS 11/9, 7, 5, 3 and the early Holocene, assisted by local topographic controls, and spring recharge. Palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological data reveal the existence of a large still water body formed during either MIS 11 or 9 (ca. 363 ka), and basin wide alluviation followed by lake formation during MIS 7 (ca. 212 ka). During MIS 5e (ca. 130 ka) a large freshwater lake occupied the basin, while during MIS 5a (ca. 80 ka) the basin contained a shallow wetland and freshwater lake complex. Lake/wetland formation also occurred during early MIS 3 (ca. 60 ka), at the Terminal Pleistocene-Holocene transition (ca. 12.5 ka), and the early-middle Holocene (ca. 9-6.5 ka). Phases of lake and wetland development coincided with human occupation of the basin during the Middle Palaeolithic, Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic periods, highlighting the significance of the region for early demographic change.

From Oct 2009 to Jul 2012, we measured sediment oxygen demand (SOD), benthic inorganic nutrient fluxes, and sediment characteristics (e.g. chl a and phaeopigment content, grain size, etc.) in two regions of the Southern New England continental shelf: a relatively well mixed ecosystem (Block Island Sound, BIS), and an adjacent, seasonally stratified ecosystem (Rhode Island Sound, RIS). Despite a higher rate of euphotic zone primary production in BIS, benthic metabolism (measured as SOD) was not significantly different between the two areas (BIS = 953.8 +/- 88.2 mu mol m(-2) h(-1); RIS = 912.2 +/- 69.1 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). We speculate that the similarity of SOD at these two sites was due to differences in water column hydrography between the Sounds, where the energetic water column mixing in BIS could potentially resuspend organic matter back to the water column to be decomposed before reaching the benthos. Additionally, we think that the seasonal presence of a strong pycnocline in RIS prevented mixing of regenerated DIN and DIP to surface waters for use by phytoplankton. Apparent differences in benthic macrofaunal abundance between Block Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound translated to differences in dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes between the two areas. Excretion and irrigation activities by the dense amphipod communities in BIS likely caused higher effluxes of DIN (NH4+ = 36.9 +/- 7.7 mu mol m(-2) h(-1); NOx = 23.5 +/- 3.4 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and DIP (7.2 +/- 1.4 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) compared to fluxes in RIS (NH4+ = 22.8 +/- 4.5 mu mol m(-2) h(-1); NOx = 11.1 +/- 5.5 mu mol m(-2) h(-1); DIP = 3.2 +/- 0.8 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). These findings indicate that the hydrographic regime of the water column may exert a strong influence on benthic-pelagic coupling dynamics on the Southern New England shelf and in other inner continental shelf ecosystems.

The southern Caucasus region, with its rich cave-sites, has recently provided important results regarding this process. In this paper we report on the results of fieldwork in Bondi Cave, Western Georgia, providing a new radiocarbon chronology, stratigraphic observations, analyses of lithic technology and provenance, faunal and floral remains as well as paleoenvironmental data. The cave includes Middle Palaeolithic (ca, 45,000 ka cal. BP) cultural horizons and a long Upper Palaeolithic sequence (ca. 40,000-27,000 cal. BP from layer V to IV). A modern human tooth was found in layer Vb. We estimate its age at 39,000 -35,800 Cal BP (95.4%), based on the Bayesian age model we built. If the context of the tooth is reliable, as we think it is, this would make it the oldest morphologically modern human in the Caucasus. Upper Palaeolithic hunting of tur and bison, as well as the collection of various plants including flax is attested. Mobile Upper Palaeolithic foragers inhabited the cave in generally cold and dry periods, but a mosaic of environments, including forests and meadows, was nonetheless available to them. The archaeological sequence of Bondi and adjacent sites indicates a substantial time gap between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic occupations, thus disproving Neanderthal-AMH interaction in this area and lending support to a replacement scenario in the southern Caucasus, assuming of course that the Early Upper Palaeolithic (EUP) is related to the arrival of AMHs.

The Baltic Sea in northern Europe has one of the largest anthropogenically induced oxygen-deficient bottom zones in the world. Despite the decrease of nutrient supply after the 1980s, recently observed oxygen consumption rates are higher than ever observed, limiting the impact of natural ventilation by oxygen-enriched saltwater intrusions. We have estimated oxygen consumption rates after saltwater inflows during subsequent stagnation periods from monitoring observations and model results for 1850-2015. In recent years, ventilating water that originates mainly from the surface layer has contained higher concentrations of organic matter, zooplankton, and higher trophic levels. As a result, oxygen consumption in the water column has increased relatively more than oxygen consumption in the sediment, primarily due to respiration of zooplankton and higher trophic levels. Subsequently, natural ventilation has become less effective in alleviating hypoxia, instead amplifying deoxygenation of the deep water. We propose that such a detrimental, positive feedback may also affect other coastal seas with nutrient excess and with an intense, internal recirculation. Other drivers of oxygen consumption, like warming, were found to be less important under contemporary conditions.","[Meier, H. E.

Most subsequent research on North African prehistory refers to his discoveries and interpretations, but the chronology of its archaeological and geological sequences has been based on very early age determinations. This paper reports on the initial results of a comprehensive multi-method dating program undertaken as part of new work at the site, involving radiocarbon dating of charcoal, land snails and marine shell, cryptotephra investigations, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sediments, and electron spin resonance (ESR) dating of tooth enamel. The dating samples were collected from the newly exposed and cleaned faces of the upper 7.5 m of the similar to 14.0 m-deep McBurney trench, which contain six of the seven major cultural phases that he identified. Despite problems of sediment transport and reworking, using a Bayesian statistical model the new dating program establishes a robust framework for the five major lithostratigraphic units identified in the stratigraphic succession, and for the major cultural units. The age of two anatomically modern human mandibles found by McBurney in Layer XXXIII near the base of his Levalloiso-Mousterian phase can now be estimated to between 73 and 65 ka (thousands of years ago) at the 95.4% confidence level, within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4. McBurney's Layer XXV, associated with Upper Palaeolithic Dabban blade industries, has a clear stratigraphic relationship with Campanian Ignimbrite tephra. Microlithic Oranian technologies developed following the climax of the Last Glacial Maximum and the more microlithic Capsian in the Younger Dryas. Neolithic pottery and perhaps domestic livestock were used in the cave from the mid Holocene but there is no certain evidence for plant cultivation until the Graeco-Roman period.

The intercomparison was conducted blind at the large (270 m(3)) simulation chamber, Simulation of Atmospheric Photochemistry in a Large Reaction Chamber (SAPHIR), in Julich, Germany. Fifteen analytical instruments, representing a wide range of techniques, were challenged with measuring atmospherically relevant OVOC species and toluene (14 species, C-1 to C-7) in the approximate range of 0.5-10 ppbv under three different conditions: (1) OVOCs with no humidity or ozone, (2) OVOCs with humidity added (r.h. approximate to 50%), and (3) OVOCs with ozone (approximate to 60 ppbv) and humidity (r.h. approximate to 50%). The SAPHIR chamber proved to be an excellent facility for conducting this experiment. Measurements from individual instruments were compared to mixing ratios calculated from the chamber volume and the known amount of OVOC injected into the chamber. Benzaldehyde and 1-butanol, compounds with the lowest vapor pressure of those studied, presented the most overall difficulty because of a less than quantitative transfer through some of the participants' analytical systems. The performance of each individual instrument is evaluated with respect to reference values in terms of time series and correlation plots for each compound under the three measurement conditions. A few of the instruments performed very well, closely matching the reference values, and all techniques demonstrated the potential for quantitative OVOC measurements. However, this study showed that nonzero offsets are present for specific compounds in a number of instruments and overall improvements are necessary for the majority of the techniques evaluated here.","[Apel, E.

As a result the postwar period emerges somewhat divided as to what should become the new architecture of the moment with which to accommodate the needs and express the values of a newly progressive society. Although the allocation of certain stylistic tropes to different, socio-cultural situations was not so categorical as in the pre-war totalitarian societies, there were nonetheless comparable semantic inflections in British architecture over the twenty-year period which followed the end of the war. This is perhaps first evident in the prefabricated, lightweight modular building systems adopted for both emergency housing and school building; respectibely, for the accommodation of the bombed out population in the first instance and for the production of some 2500 schools in the second, most of which were built over the fifteen years between 1945 and 1960 as a consequence of the Education Act, put in place by the socialist government in 1946. Emergency housing needs were met by the minimalist, single story, prefabricated Portal house which was extensively built on vacant sites in major cities after the end of the war. The equally modular, prefabricated school system developed by the Ministry of Education came into being initially through the architect's department of the Hertfordshire County Council, under the direction of C. H. Aslin. In both instances what one effectively encountered was a lightweight, steel panel system, bereft of any recognizable iconography apart from the fact the internal walls of the schools were finished in primary colors and were furnished with stackable Scandinavian wood and metal furniture plus indoor plants; the whole often being set in diminutive picturesque landscape. However this modular lingua franca could not be extended to the domestic environment. Here the heritage of the Garden City movement, dating back to the turn of the century, was pressed into service in a discretely modified form to constitute the two-story housing stock that made up the bulk of the residential fabric in the fourteen new towns established by the Labor government after the War as a result of the New Towns Act of 1948. This accounts for the single and semi-detached houses that became the vehicle so to speak, to which the so-called 'peoples detailing' was to be applied. This last comprised a repertoire of shallow-pitched, tile roofs, load-bearing, cavity walls in brick, along with casement opening lights and fixed picture windows in either steel or wood, which were invariably painted white. This amiable, unchallenging, anti-street, garden city aesthetic accessed through winding roads invariably engendered a somewhat informal site layout which, together with the detailing, came under the rubric of 'contemporary' as opposed to the received prewar idea of a severely abstract modern architecture. This conciliatory everyday style was favored by the left-wing architects of the London County Council who occupied mid-level positions within this 300 man architects department. I have in mind such figures as Oliver Cox and Graham Shank land both of whom were very influenced by the socially democratic architecture of the Swedish Welfare State. However this low-rise heimatstil principle of 'people's detailing' would be modified in the case of high-rise housing since flat roofs were deemed to be more appropriate for the capping of such forms. As it happens the preferred high-rise type was also of Swedish origin; namely, a 10-story tower block with a square footprint and a central access core, serving four apartments per floor, as this type occupy a large sector of the LCC Roehampton Estate dating from 1958. The influence of local authorities at this time was very pervasive given that almost half of the registered architects in the country were employed by local governments and the remainder who were in private practice received most of their commissions from the same source. As Reyner Banham would observe in his canonical study The New Brutalism of 1966, Cox and Shank land had close personal contacts with Sweden at the time, moreover as he reveals the term 'brutalist' originated as a qualifying adjective in Sweden. Banham cites a letter from 1956 written by Hans Asplund to Eric de Mare of The Architectural Review. In January 1950 I shared offices with my esteemed colleagues Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm. These architects were at the time designing a house at Uppsala. Judging from their drawings I called them in a mildly sarcastic way 'Neo-Brutalists'. (The Swedish word for 'New Brutalists'!) The following summer, at jollification with some English friends, among whom were Michael Ventris, Oliver Cox and Graeme Shank land, the term was mentioned again in a jocular fashion. When I visited the same friends in London last year, they told me that they had brought the word back with them to England, and that it had spread like wildfire, and that it had, somewhat astoundingly, been adopted by a certain faction of younger English architects. It is hard to imagine something more ironic than that the categorically anti-Swedish British Brutalist line should have at least part of its origin as a style in Sweden itself. Despite the eclipse of the abstract British international style a certain vestige of a pre-war Neo-Corbusian syntax was carried over into the postwar period, most notably in the work of Lubetkin and Tecton, particularly as this applied to the rather formalistic medium-rise apartment blocks that the firm designed for the East End of London between 1945 and 1955. Typified by their Spa Green Estate built in Finsbury in 1956, this ornamental manner could hardly be more removed from the aforementioned 'peoples detailing'. The Tecton slab blocks were invariably animated by syncopated faience screens running across the balconied face of each block. Lubetkin's syntax was also evident in the plan articulation and detailing of the Royal Festival Hall realized under the direction of Leslie Martin who was then chief architect of the LCC and designed by Peter Moro who had worked for Tecton prior to the Second World War. A second figure, from the prewar era, was David du R. Aberdeen, who also seems to have cultivated a 'baroque' Neo-Corbusian manner as we find this elaborated in his Trades Union Headquarters built near Bedford Square in 1951 and faced in polished stone. This New Monumentality apres la lettre could hardly be made to jibe with the pitched roof populism of the New Town vernacular or with the lightweight modular manner of the prefabricated schools. In many respects 1951 is the annus mirabilis of postwar recovery as far as British architecture is concerned, for this not only sees the realization of the Festival of Britain and the Royal Festival Hall, but also the Coventry Cathedral Competition for which Alison and Peter Smithson submitted a totally radical shell concrete form encompassing the entire plan of a diamond ecclesiastical space. It is clear that the inspiration behind the Festival of Britain was the social democratic Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 which under the direction of the architect Gunnar Asplund and the critical intellectual Gregor Paulson would effectively inaugurate a new egalitarian middle class culture, closely linked fields of architecture and industrial design. As far as the propagation of popular good taste was concerned the Festival of Britain followed Stockholm to the letter with its playful tubular metal chairs, in primary colors designed by Ernest Race and the popular slogan of Black Eyes and Lemonade which summed up the playful spirit of the occasion. Like Stockholm, the Festival conveyed a mixed message as far as received taste in architecture was concerned in as much as both exhibitions celebrated Constructivist architecture as a built manifestation of a newly emergent techno-scientific society. I have in mind in the case of Stockholm Asplund's stressed skin control cabin elevated on stilts and capped by a latticework publicity mast while the parallel engineering rhetoric in the Festival was patently the Skylon; a latticework, cigar-shaped pylon stayed by wire cables designed by Powell and Moya in collaboration with the engineer Felix Samuely equally dematerialized stressed-skin dome of the Dome of Discovery by Ralph Tubbs supported at its rim by steel latticework struts as a kind of tethered flying saucer. Overall however what Alvar Aalto wrote about the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930 could have been applied just as easily to the Festival of Britain twenty years later, to the effect that: . . . This is not a composition of glass, stone and steel, as a visitor who despises functionalism might imagine; it is a composition of houses, flags, floodlights, flowers, fireworks, happy people and clean table cloths. Be this as it may, a discernible schism emerged not only between the left wing 'peoples detailing' of the low-rise domestic architecture such as find in Frederick Gibberd's Harlow New Town, but also between those who would look to pure engineering technique as the source for a new unprecedented tectonic language as this is attempted in the shell concrete Brynmawr Rubber Factory designed by the Architect's Co-partnership in 1952 in collaboration with the engineer Ove Arup. The main alternative was to look for an authentic form of expression in the street culture of the then still extant British working class. This split is already discernible in the early work of Alison and Peter Smithson which served to oscillate between heroic engineering form on the one hand as we find this in the competition entries for their Neo-Miesian Hunstanton School Norfolk of 1949 and their Nervi-like Coventry Cathedral of 1951 and, on the other, the as found sociological 'otherness' of the nineteenth century two-story worker's row housing which, comprised of brick walls and slate roofs, made up the fabric and provided the setting for everyday life in the Bye Law streets of Bethnal Green. The Smithsons first experienced this culture through visiting the Bethnal Green home of Nigel and Judith Henderson; the one a photographer and the other a sociologist and where the one captured the street life of the arena on film, the other studied its kinship structure. The Lore and Language of School Children published in 1959 by the sociologists lona and Peter Opie documented the role played by the culture of the street in the evolution of this society. That Henderson and the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi were crucial to the evolution of the sensibility of the Smithsons would be borne out by the patio and pavilion which made up their joint contribution to the seminal White Chapel Gallery exhibition This is Tomorrow of 1956. This 'anti-consumerist' reworking of the Abbe Langier's primitive hut plus a double spread image of all four of them incongruously seated in the middle of Limmerson Street in London, running across the spiral binding of the catalogue, eloquently summed up their l'art brut approach. This ethos was reinforced by a poetic inscription in 'child-like' script asserting the anti-idealistic ethnographic archaism of the content. Patio & pavilion represents the fundamental necessities of the human habitat in a series of symbols. The first necessity is for a piece of the world the patio; the second necessity is for an enclosed space the pavilion. These two spaces are furnished with symbols for all human needs. The head for man himself his brain and his machines. The tree for nature. The rocks and natural objects for stability and the decoration of man-made space. The light box for the hearth and family. Artifacts and pin ups for his irrational urges. The frog and the dog for the other animals. The wheel and aeroplane for locomotion and the machine. Although James Stirling and the Smithsons would rival each other throughout the trajectory of their separate careers it is of the utmost significance as far as Brutalism is concerned that they would both cultivate a 'smokestack' aesthetic in their varied iterations of a native brick vernacular irrespective of whether the location was urban and rural. This mutual sensibility surely accounts for the similarity between a number of 'degree zero' works projected and realized by these separate practices during the first half of the 50's. I have in mind as far as the Smithsons are concerned the small warehouse-like four-story infill terrace house in brick and concrete projected for the Soho area of London in 1952. Of this work they wrote: had this been built, it would have been the first exponent of 'the new brutalism' in England. And equally primitive syncopated exercise in load-bearing brickwork also characterizes the remarkable housing projects realized by Stirling and Gowan in 1955 and 1957; respectively, their 3-story Ham Common flats built on a verdant site in Richmond in 1955 and the 3 to 4 story terrace housing built as a fragmented block in Preston, Lancashire in 1957. The overall cultural intention informing the latter sets forth even more explicitly than any text by the Smithsons the common sensibility of the moment as far as their mutual essays in low-rise, low-cost housing was concerned. Thus we read: In 19th century industrial 'by-law' towns you pass perhaps twenty or more front doors before coming to your own, with children playing in the roads, parents chatting on the pavement and sitting in doorways, and the old peering through windows. This horizontal approach through the neighborhood to get to your house seems to be a reason for the friendliness and sense of community which exists in these work towns and the 19th century solution seems more dynamic than the latter planning solutions for urban mass housing . . . In the initial oeuvre complete published in 1975, Stirling and Gowan make it clear that this 'nostalgia for the slums' was a broad postwar British sensibility that extended well beyond architecture and could be found in artists as diverse as the novelist Somerset Maughan, the painter L.S. Lowry and George Orwell for his 1945 working class epic On the Road to Wigan Pier. This was also the environment that the Smithsons wished to evoke in their 10-story 'street-in-the-air' Golden Lane Housing competition entry of 1952, the span-deck access of which would be realized at a more exposed scale in the Parkhill Housing built to the designs of Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith for the Sheffield City Council in 1961. This achievement proved at a larger, more windswept scale, the truth of the cryptically critical observation that: above the 6th floor it can be accepted that the old forms of contact with the ground are no longer valid. This mutual nostalgia for a declining 'vernacular' would also have its rural version in the work of both of these practices in the early 50's as we may judge from Stirling's village infill housing prototype exhibited at the CLAM X congress at Aix-en-Provence in 1953 which was inspired by Thomas Sharp's 1945 study The English Village. A more or less identical theme expressly designed for the same occasion made up the substance of the Smithsons' 'fold houses' ostensibly designed for West Burton in Yorkshire of which they wrote in Uppercase 3 of 1955. The new is placed over the old like a new plant growing through old branches -or new fruit on old twigs. The fold is a windbreak. Each house has its back to the prevailing wind. Instead of the 'housing Manual' type of house, sent down from the suburbs -a barrow boy on the fells. Sixty years later the oblique references in this statement may be easily missed (i.e. the contempt of the authors for the bureaucratic imposition of petit bourgeois) for what is conjoined in their predilection for 'barrow bow' street culture as a means for revitalizing the existing rural vernacular of the Yorkshire hills. In a resume of the Parallel Life and Art exhibition staged by the Smithsons, Paolozzi, and Henderson at the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London in 1953, the Smithsons openly acknowledge how both themselves and Stirling & Gowan were equally involved with the so-called 'brutalist' ideology emerging out of the Independent Group that met at the ICA in the early 50's, comprising such figures as Reyner Banham, Theo Crosby, Colin St John Wilson, Richard Hamilton and Laurence Alloway, this last being the critic/curator of the exhibition This is Tomorrow. Two canonical buildings of the mid 60's respectively already suggest how these two practices will evolve from their mutual beginnings over the next decade as we may judge from the Smithsons' Economist Building realized in St James Street, London in 1963 and Stirling and Gowan's Engineering Faculty Building, Leicester University completed in 1964. Although both buildings comprise medium-rise towers with The Economist topping out at 17 stories and Leicester rising for 11 floors, the first inserted into dense urban fabric is unequivocally Sittesque and Neo-Miesian in character, while the second is a free-standing, Neo-Constructivist work. By this date quite different positions seem to have been established with the Smithsons opting for modular tectonic pieces having latent classical affinities and Stirling going for more strenuously organic assemblies with partial references to Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto, with last affinity coming more fully into its own with Stirling's dormitories for St. Andrew's University in Scotland also realized in the 60's. The British 19th century engineering tradition is present as a key expressive element as far as the Leicester Engineering Building is concerned (shades of the Crystal Palace and Brunel) while in St. Andrews while we are witness to a concrete and glass essay surprisingly reminiscent of the Smithsons in their Sheffield University competition entry of 1953. At the same time there are faint traces of the Gothic Revival evident in both Leicester and The Economist. In the first instance, on Stirling's own admission, Leicester makes an allusion to William Butterfield's All Saints Margaret Street, London of 184959, while in the case of the Economist Gothic is latent in the structural mullions of the building which step back like attenuated buttresses in order to express the diminution of the load as they rise upwards as in the stepped piers of Mies van de Rohe's Promontory Apartments of 1949. As opposed to The Economist which, as fate would have it, brought the Smithsons' building career to a virtual close in terms of achieving works of comparable status and size, the Leicester Engineering Building gave Stirling and Gowan a run of university commissions culminating in leading to what has more recently recognized as the Red Trilogy on account of the fact that they were all faced in red brick and tile, namely in sequence after Leicester the History Faculty Building at Cambridge University (1964) and the Florey Dormitory at Queen's College, Oxford (1966). All of these major works by the Smithsons and Stirling involved the creative participation of the brilliant structural engineers Ron Jenkins of Ove Arup and Partners in the case the Hunstanton School in Norfolk of 1949-54, and Frank Newby of Felix Samuely and Partners in the case of the Red Trilogy and St Andrews University. With the appointment of Leslie Martin to the professorship of architecture at Cambridge University in 1956the creative patronage of the 'brutalist' sensibility shifted from London to Cambridge and with this change in leadership and focus the so-called movement entered its maturity. However before turning to the exceptionally fertile studio set up in Cambridge by Martin and Colin St. John it is necessary to comment in passing on the importance of certain training offices on the London scene in the 50's and the 60's above all the practice of Lyons Israel and Ellis which served as a proving ground for the next generation, namely, John Miller and Neave Brown, both of whom worked closely with Tom Ellis; in the first instance on an annex to the Old Vic Theatre (1958) and in the second on a stacked lecture theatres in fair-faced, reinforced (white) concrete, for the Wolfson Institute at Hammersmith Hospital (1961). Patrick Hodgkinson was the third architect of exceptional talent from the same year at the AA School. As it happens Hodgkinson would play a seminal role in the development of a normative modern Aaltoesque brick aesthetic appropriate to the British climate as this would issue from the Martin/St. Wilson Studio from 1956 onwards; most notably in terms of Hodgkinson's direct involvement, load bearing brick 3-story terrace housing projected for St. Pancras, London in 1959 and the student hostel for Caius College, dating from 1962. That Hodgkinson was the decisive behind these works is testified to by the house in Burrel's Field, Cambridge that Hodgkinson realized for the retiring master of Trinity College, Lord Adrian, in 1964. Hodgkinson would assert his ultimate prowess as an independent architect with his monumental urban set-piece known as the Brunswick Centre under development and re-development between 1965 and 1973. It is possible to argue that the Brunswick Centre is an ultimate Neo-Brutalist work at an urban scale since executed throughout in beton brut establishes itself as a city-in-miniature, that is as a micro-cosmic city with the city, one which breaks totally within the traditional Georgian square and street patter by which it is confronted on the Marchmont Street side. It has the problematic character of being conceived in section rather than in plan in as much as it comprises two stepped five-story housing blocks facing each other across a central promenade axis, flanked with shops throughout its length plus a cinema at the point of a monumental transverse axis lead to a nearby park. Like Hodgkinson Miller was also working in the Martin/St. John Wilson in Cambridge before opening up his own practice with Alan Colquhoun in 1960 with a commission to design a secondary school in Stratford in East London which is completed in 1964. Like Caius College, it is significant that this two story, load-bearing structure occupies a perfect square in plan from into which voids are 'excavated' as it were in order to produce the figure of the school which in its turn is wrapped a central square double-height assembly hall. It is obvious in retrospect that the plan of this school is closely related to the interlocking square top-lit reading rooms that Martin and St. John Wilson designed for the new Oxford University library complex under construction from 1959 to 1979. It is possibly fair to say that that the British 'neo-brutalist' sensibility much influenced by Aalto plays itself out in the work of Martin and his colleagues, throughout the 70's in what was one final effort to create a normative modern architecture for the British Isles to be executed primarily in brick.",,,"Frampton, K (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,8,276,UNIV NAVARRA,PAMPLONA,"UNIV NAVARRA, PAMPLONA, NAVARRA E-31080, SPAIN",1138-5596,,,RA-REV ARQUIT,Ra-Rev.

Vast tracts of savanna vegetation occur there and yet most palaeoecological studies have focused on highlands and/or forest environments. Greater focus on long-term lowland environments provides a rare opportunity to understand and promote the significance of local and regional savannas, ultimately allowing non-forested and forested ecosystem dynamics to be compared. This paper examines palaeoecological and archaeological data from a lowland open savanna site situated on the south-central PNG coastline. The methods used incorporate pollen and micro-charcoal analyses, artefact recovery and sediment descriptions. We conclude with an environmental model of sedimentation and vegetation change for the past c. 5,800 years, revealing a mid to late Holocene savanna interchange between herbaceous and woody plant growth, with fluctuating fire occurrence increasing toward the present day. Increased silt deposition and modified regional hydrology are also recorded. Environmental changes correspond in timing with the start of permanent settlements and human use of fire. In particular, landscape burning for hunting and gardens for agriculture have helped create the open ecosystem still evident today.","[Rowe, Cassandra] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Ulm, Sean; Aird, Samantha; Leavesley, Matthew] James Cook Univ, Coll Arts Soc & Educ, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [David, Bruno; Mialanes, Jerome; McNiven, Ian J.] Monash Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, 20 Chancellors Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rowe, Cassandra; Ulm, Sean; Petchey, Fiona] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Petchey, Fiona] Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Lab, Hillcrest Rd, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Leavesley, Matthew] Univ Papua New Guinea, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Anthropol Sociol & Archaeol, POB 320,Univ 134, Natl Capital Dist, Guinea; [David, Bruno; Mialanes, Jerome; McNiven, Ian J.; Richards, Thomas] Monash Univ, Monash Indigenous Studies Ctr, 20 Chancellors Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Leavesley, Matthew] Univ Wollongong, ARC Ctr Excellence Biodivers & Heritage, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Monash University; James Cook University; University of Waikato; Monash University; University of Wollongong,"Rowe, C (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.;Rowe, C (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",cassandra.rowe@jcu.edu.au,"CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019; Ulm, Sean/A-3854-2010; Mialanes, Jerome/HDM-4461-2022; Rowe, Cassandra/M-6009-2015","Ulm, Sean/0000-0001-6653-9963; Rowe, Cassandra/0000-0001-8938-5733; Mialanes, Jerome/0000-0002-6790-7542",Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage [CE170100015]; Australian Research Council [FT120100656]; Laureate [FL140100044],Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Laureate,"This research was conducted by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CE170100015).

Mineralogical and geochemical analyses indicate that Quaternary carbonate eolianites on Mallorca have a very high purity, usually composed of more than 90% carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite, and aragonite). In contrast, terra rossa soils developed on these eolianites have lower carbonate contents and contain higher concentrations of quartz and other silicates. Analyses of immobile trace elements indicate that the non-carbonate fractions of the eolianites have distinctive Zr/Hf, La/Yb, Cr/Sc and Th/Ta values that differ from the superjacent terra rossa soils. These observations indicate that even if sufficient dissolution of the eolianite had taken place to create the soils by residual accumulation, immobile element ratios in the soils require an external source. However, Zr/Hf, La/Yb. Cr/Sc and Th/Ta values in the soils fall within the range of values for these element ratios in African dust collected on Barbados and mainland Spain. We conclude that the silicate fractions of terra rossa soils on Mallorca are derived mainly, though not wholly, from far-traveled African dust, and this process may explain the origin of other terra rossa soils found in southern Europe.

Although our local impact on the evolution of these ecosystems has been undeniable and extensively documented, it remains unclear precisely how our activities are altering them, in part because ecosystems are dynamic systems structured by complex, non-linear feedback processes and cascading effects. We argue that it is only by studying human-environment interactions over timescales that greatly exceed the lifespan of any individual human (i.e., the deep past or longue duree), we can hope to fully understand such processes and their implications. In this article, we identify some of the key challenges faced in integrating long-term datasets with those of other areas of sustainability science, and suggest some useful ways forward. Specifically, we (a) highlight the potential of the historical sciences for sustainability science, (b) stress the need to integrate theoretical frameworks wherein humans are seen as inherently entangled with the environment, and (c) propose formal computational modelling as the ideal platform to overcome the challenges of transdisciplinary work across large, and multiple, geographical and temporal scales. Our goal is to provide a manifesto for an integrated scientific approach to the study of socio-ecological systems over the long term.","[Silva, Fabio; Coward, Fiona; Davies, Kimberley; Elliott, Sarah;

Here, we assess controls on methane flux using a database of approximately 19 000 instantaneous measurements from 71 wetland sites located across subtropical, temperate, and northern high latitude regions. Our analyses confirm general controls on wetland methane emissions from soil temperature, water table, and vegetation, but also show that these relationships are modified depending on wetland type (bog, fen, or swamp), region (subarctic to temperate), and disturbance. Fen methane flux was more sensitive to vegetation and less sensitive to temperature than bog or swamp fluxes. The optimal water table for methane flux was consistently below the peat surface in bogs, close to the peat surface in poor fens, and above the peat surface in rich fens. However, the largest flux in bogs occurred when dry 30-day averaged antecedent conditions were followed by wet conditions, while in fens and swamps, the largest flux occurred when both 30-day averaged antecedent and current conditions were wet. Drained wetlands exhibited distinct characteristics, e. g. the absence of large flux following wet and warm conditions, suggesting that the same functional relationships between methane flux and environmental conditions cannot be used across pristine and disturbed wetlands. Together, our results suggest that water table and temperature are dominant controls on methane flux in pristine bogs and swamps, while other processes, such as vascular transport in pristine fens, have the potential to partially override the effect of these controls in other wetland types. Because wetland types vary in methane emissions and have distinct controls, these ecosystems need to be considered separately to yield reliable estimates of global wetland methane release.","[Turetsky, Merritt R.; Kotowska, Agnieszka; Olefeldt, David] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Bubier, Jill] Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Environm Studies, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA; [Dise, Nancy B.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Crill, Patrick] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hornibrook, Ed R.

One-fifth of species are classified as Threatened, and we show that this figure is increasing: On average, 52 species of mammals, birds, and amphibians move one category closer to extinction each year. However, this overall pattern conceals the impact of conservation successes, and we show that the rate of deterioration would have been at least one-fifth again as much in the absence of these.

Among these variations, a weak summer monsoon event occurred approximately at 4 ka, the so called 4.2 ka event. This event is considered to have been a relatively sustained and widespread phenomenon at regional scales across southern Asia to eastern Africa. However, little is known about the impact of such variations in the Himalayas, a key location for understanding the monsoon system. Here we present a record of changes in summer monsoon strength during the Holocene from Lake Rara, western Nepal, using redox sensitive elements (Mn/Ti and Mn/Fe) measured by Xray fluorescence (XRF) core-scanner. In addition, organic matter properties (TOC, delta C-13, and C/N) and changes in the C-14 age offset between bulk organic matter and leaf matter - namely the old carbon offset - are used to augment the environmental reconstruction. Collectively, the data indicate a period of prolonged weak monsoon interval at around 4 ka. The timing of onset and recovery from the event observed at Lake Rara exhibits particular similarity with changes in the Indus River discharge.

J,"Skrobanovic, Z",,,,"Skrobanovic, Zoran",,,A SOULLESS CAMERA: THE PERCEPTION OF ITALIAN FUTURISM IN EARLY CHINESE MODERNIST POETRY,FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA,,,Unspecified,Article,,,,,,Modernism; China; futurism; poetry; poetics,,"Considering the fact that there are certain similarities between the cultural endeavours of the early Chinese modernists and Italian futurists, at first glance, it seems strange that futurist ideas mostly failed to take root in Chinese literary modernism. From the outset, Chinese literary modernism was a heterogeneous movement, but the common denominator in these different movements in post-dynastic China was a radical antitraditionalism that bears similarities to the goals of Italian futurism that was often called the down-with-the-past movement (antipassatismo). Contemporary literary studies usually recognize three distinct waves of Chinese modernism: the first wave refers to the new literary scene in China's Republican era (1911-1949), but due to the eclecticism of early Chinese modernists who were deriving inspiration and ideas from a broad and diverse range of sources, this initial stage of Chinese modernism includes the authors whose work was inspired by the pre-modern Western movements such as romanticism, symbolism etc. The second wave of Chinese modernism emerged on Taiwan in the 1950s, and the final wave brought modernism back to mainland China at the end of the 1970s. This paper attempts to examine the reception of Italian futurism in early Chinese modernist literature, therefore our research is chronologically focused on the first wave of Chinese modernism. Due to the important role of poetry in the social mechanism, and the life of an individual in dynastic China, it can be argued that the revolutionary spirit of Chinese modernists is epitomized in new poetry models created in the first wave of Chinese modernism. During this formative period, Chinese modern poetry was revolutionized - the new poets replaced the classical Chinese with the vernacular language, and they adopted a distinctly anti-traditional stance, thus initiating a series of daring experiments with new poetic forms. The new Chinese poets were true iconoclasts, and their literary work was closely related to the introduction of new social ideas, democracy, science and freedoms promoted by the prominent intellectuals of the epoch. Therefore, in an attempt to shed a light on the perception of futurism in early Chinese modernism, this paper will use illustrative examples found in the work of Chinese modernist poets. In the Chinese modernist context, the transnational character of modernism was emphasized by the fact that most of the Chinese authors were educated abroad (Japan, USA, Europe), which not only explains their interest in foreign literary traditions that often served as a paradigm for establishing their own expression of modernity, but also determines their choice of foreign poetics and literary models applied in their work. Very often, the Chinese writers who returned to China after studying in other countries, took upon themselves the task of translating and interpreting the segments of the culture and literature they had encountered abroad. Naturally, they were also exposed to the complex political climate of their homeland that often forced them to rethink and reassess the cultural and artistic influences they brought back with them to China. Historically speaking, the turning points in the development of Chinese modernist literature were the student protests of May 4, 1919 in Beijing, that soon gave rise to a nationwide anti-imperialist, cultural, and political Fourth May Movement ((sic)), and the May Thirtieth Movement ((sic)) - an upsurge in the mass anti-imperialist struggle that was provoked by the events that had taken place in the International Settlement in Shanghai, on May 30, 1925, when British police opened fire on Chinese protesters, killing thirteen and wounding over fifty people. In many ways, these historical events define the attitude of Chinese early modernists towards Western literary tradition and modernist ideas, including futurism. On the other hand, from 1924, it was becoming evident that futurism in Italy had established strong links with the fascist movement. This historical landscape, with rising anti-imperialist sentiment in China on one side, and ideological links between futurism and fascism in Italy on the other, prevented the further promotion of futurist ideas in the Chinese literary scene. For many Chinese authors, futurism became a synonym for the Western imperial tendencies, at the time when the May Thirtieth Movement forced Chinese writers to re-examine their views on the interaction between literature and national identity, and to re-evaluate the suitability of different Western movements and poetics in their search for the political and cultural renewal. This paper aims to identify reasons for the cautionary attitude displayed by Chinese authors toward futurist ideas, and attempts to answer the following questions: was the perception of Italian futurism in early Chinese modernist context determined solely by the specific historical background, in both China and the West, or is it a consequence of differences in literary and aesthetic approach between Chinese and Western modernists? In the context of the development of Chinese modern poetry, did futurism leave any lasting legacy? Apart from the historical and political circumstances that hindered the spread of futurist ideas in Chinese literary circles, the ephemeral presence of futurism in the first wave of Chinese modernism was also rooted in certain culturally conditioned differences in approach to literature and poetry in China, and the West. By introducing vernacular poetry, thus breaking away from the centuries of classical poetic tradition, Chinese new poets were far more revolutionary than their counterparts in the West, since all the anti-traditional poetic movements in Western modernism could still be interpreted as another step in the development of Western poetry. On the other hand, despite the revolutionary linguistical and formal changes characteristic of Chinese modern poetry, Western modernist poets were far more radical in their struggle against traditional aesthetic principles. Numerous movements and authors in the West tend to question the whole system of values inherited from the past - in that aspect, the futurists represent one of the most extreme examples - whereas most of the Chinese modernist poets are still devoted to the traditional aesthetic postulates. The constant tension between teleology and (traditional) introspection in Chinese early poetic modernism also greatly influenced the Chinese perception of futurism. However, in order to prove that certain futurist ideas eventually managed to exert an important influence on the development of Chinese modern poetry, thus introducing new models of poetic expression, the paper will offer analysis of the futurist poetical elements in the work of Chinese modernist poets like Guo Moruo ((sic), 1892-1978) and Ouwai Ou ((sic), 1911-1995). As previously detailed, there are several reasons why the perception of futurism in Chinese early modernism will be illustrated by the selected examples found in the work of Chinese modernist poets. Namely, apart from the fact that the revolutionary modernist reforms in Chinese literature reached its climax in the new models of poetry, this paper will attempt to prove that poetry is the form of Chinese modernist literature on which futurism left a lasting impact. All the above-mentioned historical, political, and poetical factors that shaped the reception of futurism in China are very much evident in the work of the prominent modernist poet Guo Moruo. As a Chinese student in Japan, where futurist ideas had been introduced very early, Guo was well-acquainted with futurism, and upon his return to his homeland, he served as an important intermediary who presented futurist poetics to the Chinese public. Initially, it seemed that he adopted certain elements and strategies of futurism into his own poetry, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that his true inspiration lies in European romanticism, and that he is actually using futurist techniques to express his criticism of the futurist obsession with the urban environment, material progress and technology. His early poem Looking Afar from Fudetate Peak ((sic), 1920) serves as an illustrative example of his ambivalent attitude to the futurist poetic concepts, and is therefore included in the paper. In the following years, Guo will publish several theoretical articles that fully revealed his disapproval of the goals and the poetic approach of Italian futurists. In Guo's view, which reflects his devotion to traditional aesthetic principles in poetry, futurism is, by its nature, opposed to the lyricism of true poetry, and it fails to offer an individual poetic voice. Therefore, Guo Moruo's perception of futurism represents a paradigmatic example of Chinese views on radical Western movements at the outset of their own modernity. A typical manifestation of these views is a double perspective on the Western modernist tendencies and achievements - occasionally, Chinese modernist writers pragmatically use new Western poetics as a mean to achieve their own goals and agendas, but at the same time, Western modernism is often their nemesis. In his theoretical texts dedicated to futurism, another famous Chinese modernist writer, Mao Dun (.., 1896-1981), expresses a certain admiration for the fearlessness and dynamism of Italian futurists, as well as caution over the destructive spirit of the Italian movement. His interpretations of futurism seem to clarify the difference between the antitraditional stance of Chinese modernists and antipassatismo of Italian futurists, since, in Mao Dun's opinion, futurism is just a temporary and superficial reaction to the glorification of the past, excessively focused on the advantages of mechanization and industrialization. Unlike Guo Moruo, who, in the context of our research, serves as a representative example of the eclectic approach in adopting Western literary poetics and influences displayed by early Chinese modernist writers, Ouwai Ou is a somewhat atypical poetic figure. He is a less known Chinese poet who applied certain elements of futurist poetics to his poetry, thus enabling the development of new poetic genres and models. Following in the footsteps of futurists who insisted on the idea of words in freedom (parole in liberta), both Guo Moruo and Ouwai Ou, as well as many other Chinese modernist poets, often use the Western alphabet and foreign (mostly English) words within the Chinese text. Although these poetic experiments are somewhat resemblant of the practice employed by some Western authors like Ezra Pound (1885-1972) or Paul Claudel (1868-1955) who used Chinese characters to either produce distancing effect or to emphasize the pictographic or ideographic value of the Chinese script, for Chinese poets, the foreign words are the synonyms for modernity. Inspired by the futurist typographic experiments, and Marinetti's (Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, 1876-1944) paroliberismo as a new means of poetic expression, Ouwai Ou starts to employ typographic manipulations in his poetry, thus creating new visual effects. By combining iconic and textual elements in his poems, Ouwai Ou established himself as one of the modernist pioneers of Chinese concrete poetry. As a typical example of his poetic experiments inspired by futurism, his poem The Second Obituary for the World (, 1937) is included in the paper. His work had long been forgotten, but in the contemporary critical revaluation of the poetic achievements of early Chinese modernism, many critics have finally recognized his significant contribution to the development of new poetic forms and concrete poetry in China. Due to the turbulent historical circumstances - the Japanese aggression and the following civil war, the first wave of Chinese modernism soon came to an abrupt end. Mao Zedong's (1893-1976) Talks at the Yan'an Conference on Literature and Art (, 1942) will dictate cultural and literary politics in mainland China for decades, but modernism will resurrect in Taiwan in the middle of the twentieth century, and eventually find its way back to China at the end of the 1970s. However, the echoes of the futurist ideas will haunt the Chinese social scene even during the time of the Cultural revolution. Although the futurist impulses in the first wave of Chinese literary modernism were rather short-lived, certain segments of futurist poetics are fragmentarily present in the work of some Chinese authors. Furthermore, it can be argued that there are some elements of futurist poetics that played a key role in the creation of new poetic forms in China, and served as a catalyst that helped transform poetic means of expression.","[Skrobanovic, Zoran] Univ Beogradu, Filoloski Fak, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Skrobanovic, Z (corresponding author), Univ Beogradu, Filoloski Fak, Belgrade, Serbia.",zoran.skrobanovic@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,2,2,"UNIV MONTENEGRO, INST LANGUAGE & LITERATURE, FAC PHILOSOPHY-NIKSIC",NIKSIC,"DANILA BOJOVICA BB, NIKSIC, CRNA GORA 81400, MONTENEGRO",1800-8542,,,FOLIA LINGUIST LITT,Folia Linguist.

The same dynamic processes can be far-reaching and extend into the inner heliosphere to at least 1AU and likely to smaller heliocentric distances. While the high-resolution magnetic field measurements required to study these waves are not yet available in the heliosheath, we have studied a range of available observations and found evidence of waves due to interstellar PUIs using ACE (1998-2015 at 1 AU), Ulysses (1996-2006 at 2 to 5 AU, high and low latitudes) and Voyager (1978-1979 and 2 to 6 AU) observations. Efforts to extend the Voyager observations to 35 AU are ongoing. We have examined these data sets and report on observations of low-frequency waves that result from newborn interstellar pickup H+ and He+ ions. Although not as common as theory originally predicted, we presently have identified 524 independent occurrences. Our conclusion from studying these waves is that they are seen only when the ambient turbulence is sufficiently weak. The instability that generates these waves requires a slow accumulation of wave energy over several to tens of hours to achieve observable wave amplitudes. In regions where the turbulence is moderate to strong, the turbulence absorbs the wave energy before it can reach observable levels nd transports the energy to the dissipation scales where it heats the background thermal particles.

We assess the extent of their implementation and compliance, but not issues of the adequacy of their design nor the consequences of their extent of implementation. We conclude that, with the exception of qualitative national-scale reporting in triennial Contracting Party National Reports, there is inadequate implementation and compliance with most of these mechanisms, notably concerning required reporting under Article 3.2 of the Convention and the updating of the Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands (RIS). This limits the ability of the Convention to assess the status, and trends in status, of designated Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites), and to inform future decision-making and priority-setting for the wise use of all wetlands. As has been recognised by the Ramsar Convention, unless compliance with these mechanisms is improved, sufficient information will not be gathered through the mechanisms of Ramsar Convention to assess fully the Sustainable Development Goal 6.6.1 indicator supported by the Convention on change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time.","[Davidson, N.

In the Arctic, snow directly influences resource availability. The causes and consequences of different migration patterns of migratory species as a response to the snow conditions remains however unexplored. Birds migrating to the Arctic are expected to follow the spring snowmelt to optimise their arrival time and select for snow-free areas to maximise prey encounter en-route. Based on large-scale movement data, we compared the migration patterns of three top predator species of the tundra in relation to the spatio-temporal dynamics of snow cover. The snowy owl, an irruptive migrant, the rough-legged buzzard, with an intermediary migration pattern, and the peregrine falcon as a regular migrant, all followed, as expected, the spring snowmelt during their migrations. However, the owl stayed ahead, the buzzard stayed on, and the falcon stayed behind the spatio-temporal peak in snowmelt. Although none of the species avoided snow-covered areas, they presumably used snow presence as a cue to time their arrival at their breeding grounds. We show the importance of environmental cues for species with different migration patterns.","[Curk, Teja; Pokrovsky, Ivan; Wikelski, Martin; Safi, Kamran] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Migrat, Obstberg 1, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany;

Subfossil specimens of early to late Holocene age from the Pamwak archaeological site on Manus Island are referred to the new species on morphological criteria; these confirm the species as a long-term resident of Manus Island. The new species is distinguished by its combination of large size; short tail; dorsal pelage that is coarse, spiny, and dark, with prominent black guard hairs; and sharply contrasting cream ventral pelage. Based on its overall body form, the species is almost certainly terrestrial. The dentition combines robust incisors with relatively small molars and the cranium displays a distinctive melange of characters-including an elongate and anteriorly expanded rostrum and a mesopterygoid fossa that is narrow anteriorly and broadens to the rear. Sequence data from the mitochondrial control region and 3 nuclear genes place the new species as a highly divergent member of the Australo-Papuan Rattus radiation, with no identified close relative among sampled taxa. Morphological comparisons are made between the new species and other pertinent species of Rattus from the region, including R. sanila, a species known only from Late Pleistocene fossil to Late Holocene subfossil remains from an archaeological site on New Ireland. The conservation status of the new species is discussed in the light of a recent survey that failed to locate surviving populations in 2 areas of natural forest on Manus Island. Further survey work is urgently needed to identify any surviving populations and to assess the role of potential threats to the species.","[Timm, Robert M.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Timm, Robert M.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Weijola, Valter] Univ Turku, Zool Museum, Turku 20014, Finland; [Aplin, Ken P.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Div Mammals, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Aplin, Ken P.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Goroka, Papua N Guinea; [Donnellan, Stephen C.] Univ Adelaide, S Australian Museum, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Donnellan, Stephen C.] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Flannery, Tim F.] Climate Council Australia, POB 1267, Potts Point, NSW 2011, Australia; [Thomson, Vicki] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Pine, Ronald H.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas; University of Kansas; University of Turku; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Kansas,"Timm, RM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;Timm, RM (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",btimm@ku.edu,"Thomson, Vicki A./B-9971-2014; Donnellan, Stephen/F-2442-2013","Thomson, Vicki A./0000-0001-8368-9664; Donnellan, Stephen/0000-0002-5448-3226; Timm, Robert/0000-0001-6203-3316; Weijola, Valter/0000-0002-6907-0619","Conservation International; Nordenskiold-Samfundet, Svenska Kulturfonden, Svensk-Osterbottniska Samfundet, Turun Yliopistosaatio; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Critical Partnership Ecosystem Fund; ARC [DP0988863]","Conservation International; Nordenskiold-Samfundet, Svenska Kulturfonden, Svensk-Osterbottniska Samfundet, Turun Yliopistosaatio; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Critical Partnership Ecosystem Fund; ARC(Australian Research Council)","The National Research Institute (NRI) and the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) provided permits for our research in Papua New Guinea.

The system consists of a regional ocean model component (ROMS) forced by output from a regional atmospheric model component (the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, WRF). The ROMS ocean model component has a horizontal resolution of 1 km within PWS and utilizes a recently-developed multi-scale 3DVAR data assimilation methodology along with freshwater runoff from land obtained via real-time execution of a digital elevation model. During the Sound Predictions Field Experiment (July 19-August 3, 2009) the system was run in real-time to support operations and incorporated all available real-time streams of data. Nowcasts were produced every 6 h and a 48-h forecast was performed once a day. In addition, a sixteen-member ensemble of forecasts was executed on most days. All results were published at a web portal (http://ourocean.jpl.nasa.gov/PWS) in real time to support decision making. The performance of the system during Sound Predictions 2009 is evaluated. The ROMS results are first compared with the assimilated data as a consistency check. RMS differences of about 0.7 degrees C were found between the ROMS temperatures and the observed vertical profiles of temperature that are assimilated. The ROMS salinities show greater discrepancies, tending to be too salty near the surface. The overall circulation patterns observed throughout the Sound are qualitatively reproduced, including the following evolution in time. During the first week of the experiment, the weather was quite stormy with strong southeasterly winds. This resulted in strong north to northwestward surface flow in much of the central PWS. Both the observed drifter trajectories and the ROMS nowcasts showed strong surface inflow into the Sound through the Hinchinbrook Entrance and strong generally northward to northwestward flow in the central Sound that was exiting through the Knight Island Passage and Montague Strait entrance. During the latter part of the second week when surface winds were light and southwesterly, the mean surface flow at the Hinchinbrook Entrance reversed to weak outflow and a cyclonic eddy formed in the central Sound. Overall, RMS differences between ROMS surface currents and observed HF radar surface currents in the central Sound were generally between 5 and 10 cm/s, about 20-40% of the time mean current speeds. The ROMS reanalysis is then validated against independent observations. A comparison of the ROMS currents with observed vertical current profiles from moored ADCPs in the Hinchinbrook Entrance and Montague Strait shows good qualitative agreement and confirms the evolution of the near surface inflow/outflow at these locations described above. A comparison of the ROMS surface currents with drifter trajectories provided additional confirmation that the evolution of the surface flow described above was realistic. Forecasts of drifter locations had RMS errors of less than 10 km for up to 36 h. One and two-day forecasts of surface temperature, salinity and current fields were more skillful than persistence forecasts. In addition, ensemble mean forecasts were found to be slightly more skillful than single forecasts. Two case studies demonstrated the system's qualitative skill in predicting subsurface changes within the mixed layer measured by ships and autonomous underwater vehicles. In summary, the system is capable of producing a realistic evolution of the near-surface circulation within PWS including forecasts of up to two days of this evolution.

This archaeological region is con-nected with the first Homo populations in Western Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene. The VM1 pollen record is characterized by Ephedra, and to a lesser extent, Pinus, Juniperus and evergreen Quercus, occassionally accompa-nied by Olea, Genisteae, Erica, deciduous Quercus, Alnus, Castanea, Fraxinus, Salix and Phillyrea. BL is dominated by Juniperus, Olea, Pinus, Poaceae, and evergreen Quercus. FN3 is characterized by an open Mediterranean woodland dominated by evergreen Quercus, Pinus, Juniperus and Olea, accompanied by deciduous Quercus, Castanea, Populus, Salix, Ulmus, Fraxinus, Pistacia, Phillyrea, Genisteae, Erica, Cistus, and Ephedra fragilis. Relic Tertiary taxa in OAZ include Carya, Pterocarya, Eucommia, Zelkova, and Juglans. The Early Pleistocene OAZ vegetation is a mosaic of different landscapes embracing mesophytes, thermophytes, xerophytes, xerothermophytes, and Mediterra-nean elements. These finds are compared with former pollen analyses in the region and beyond within the Ibe-rian Peninsula. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Understanding these ocean-atmospheric C-14 differences is important both to estimate the calendar ages of samples which obtained their C-14 in the marine environment, and to investigate the carbon cycle. The Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve is created to address these dual aims by providing a global-scale surface ocean record of radiocarbon from 55,000-0 cal yr BP that accounts for the smoothed response of the ocean to variations in atmospheric C-14 production rates and factors out the effect of known changes in global-scale palaeoclimatic variables. The curve also serves as a baseline to study regional oceanic C-14 variation. Marine20 offers substantial improvements over the previous Marine13 curve. In response to community questions, we provide a short intuitive guide, intended for the lay-reader, on the construction and use of the Marine20 calibration curve. We describe the choices behind the making of Marine20, as well as the similarities and differences compared with the earlier Marine calibration curves. We also describe how to use the Marine20 curve for calibration and how to estimate Delta R-the localized variation in the oceanic C-14 levels due to regional factors which are not incorporated in the global-scale Marine20 curve. To aid understanding, illustrative worked examples are provided.","[Heaton, T. J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Math, Dept Stat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Heaton, T.

Most financial strategies rest on strong assumptions which are not valid in many parts of the world. We use cases drawn from tribal forestry in the US and government forestry in India to illustrate how carbon finance relies on the presence of enforceable rights, representative and accountable institutions, clear incentives, and symmetrical power relations. In the absence of these conditions, carbon finance provides perverse incentives that undermine biodiversity and human rights without storing carbon. We suggest that for forest-based carbon storage to be successful, more attention needs to be paid to underlying political reforms, as well as to policies that are not reliant on finance.","[Fleischman, Forrest; Solorzano, Claudia Rodriguez; Schmitz, Marissa] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55104 USA; [Basant, Shishir] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, 534 John Kimbrough Rd,BLDG 1537, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Fischer, Harry] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Box 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Gupta, Divya] Indian Sch Business, Bharti Inst Publ Policy, ISB Rd, Hyderabad 500111, India; [Lopez, Gustavo Garcia] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Rua Fernao Lopes 5,1-A, P-3030164 Coimbra, Portugal; [Kashwan, Prakash] Univ Connecticut, Dept Polit Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Powers, Jennifer S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Powers, Jennifer S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Ecol, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Ramprasad, Vijay] Ctr Ecol Dev & Res, 201-1 Vasant Vihar, Dehra Dun 2480006, Uttarakhand, India; [Rana, Pushpendra] Indian Forest Serv, Shimla, Himachal Prades, India; [Rastogi, Archi] Green Climate Fund, Independent Evaluat Unit, 175 Art Ctr Daero, Incheon 22004, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Indian School of Business (ISB); Universidade de Coimbra; University of Connecticut; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Fleischman, F (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55104 USA.",ffleisch@umn.edu,"Rana, Pushpendra/AGK-5348-2022; Fleischman, Forrest/I-8703-2016","Rana, Pushpendra/0000-0001-8626-3351; Fischer, Harry/0000-0001-7967-1154; Ramprasad, Vijay/0000-0003-2636-0090; Basant, Shishir/0000-0003-2896-9481; Fleischman, Forrest/0000-0001-6060-4031; Garcia Lopez, Gustavo/0000-0002-8005-1574",,,,,117,9,9,2,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Here, the authors examine how Indigenous oyster harvest in North America and Australia was managed across 10,000 years, advocating for effective future stewardship of oyster reefs by centering Indigenous peoples.' Historical ecology has revolutionized our understanding of fisheries and cultural landscapes, demonstrating the value of historical data for evaluating the past, present, and future of Earth's ecosystems. Despite several important studies, Indigenous fisheries generally receive less attention from scholars and managers than the 17th-20th century capitalist commercial fisheries that decimated many keystone species, including oysters. We investigate Indigenous oyster harvest through time in North America and Australia, placing these data in the context of sea level histories and historical catch records. Indigenous oyster fisheries were pervasive across space and through time, persisting for 5000-10,000 years or more. Oysters were likely managed and sometimes farmed, and are woven into broader cultural, ritual, and social traditions. Effective stewardship of oyster reefs and other marine fisheries around the world must center Indigenous histories and include Indigenous community members to co-develop more inclusive, just, and successful strategies for restoration, harvest, and management.","[Reeder-Myers, Leslie] Temple Univ, Dept Anthropol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Braje, Todd J.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Anthropol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Hofman, Courtney A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Anthropol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Hofman, Courtney A.] Univ Oklahoma, Labs Mol Anthropol & Microbiome Res, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Smith, Emma A.

Recent results on trends in corrosion, soiling, and pollution show that corrosion of carbon steel, zinc, and limestone is today substantially lower than 25 years ago, but while corrosion of carbon steel has decreased until today, corrosion of zinc and limestone has remained more or less constant since the turn of the century. Unique data are given on measured HNO3 concentrations from 2002-2003, 2005-2006, and 2008-2009, and the relative average decrease was about the same from 2002-2003 to 2005-2006 as it was from 2005-2006 to 2008-2009.","[Tidblad, Johan; Kucera, Vladimir] Swerea KIMAB AB, Drottning Kristinas Vag 48, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ferm, Martin] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, S-40014 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kreislova, Katerina] SVUOM Ltd, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic; [Bruggerhoff, Stefan] Deutsch Bergbau Museum Bochum, D-44787 Bochum, Germany; [Doytchinov, Stefan; Screpanti, Augusto] ENEA, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Grontoft, Terje] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Yates, Tim] Bldg Res Estab BRE Ltd, Watford WD25 9XX, England; [de la Fuente, Daniel] CENIM, CSIC, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Roots, Ott] Estonian Environm Res Inst, Estonian Environm Res Ctr, Tallinn 10617, Estonia; [Lombardo, Tiziana] Univ Paris Est Creteil 61, LISA, UMR CNRS 7583, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Simon, Stefan] Staatliche Museen Berlin, Rathgen Forschungslabor, D-14059 Berlin, Germany; [Faller, Markus] EMPA, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Kwiatkowski, Lech; Kobus, Joanna] Inst Precis Mech, PL-01796 Warsaw, Poland; [Varotsos, Costas; Tzanis, Chris] Univ Athens, Fac Phys, Div Environm Phys & Meteorol, Climate Res Grp, Athens 15784, Greece; [Krage, Linda] Riga Tech Univ, Fac Mat Sci & Appl Chem, Dept Silicate Mat Technol, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia; [Schreiner, Manfred; Melcher, Michael] Acad Fine Arts, Inst Sci & Technol Art, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Grancharov, Ivan] Univ Chem Technol & Met, Sofia 1756, Bulgaria; [Karmanova, Nadya] JSC SRI Atmosphere, Int Cooperat Sect, St Petersburg 194021, Russia",Swerea Group; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute; SVUOM s.r.o.; Deutsches Bergbau Museum Bochum (DBM); Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Metalurgicas (CENIM); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Institute of Precision Mechanics - Poland; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Riga Technical University; University of Chemical Technology & Metallurgy - Bulgaria,"Tidblad, J (corresponding author), Swerea KIMAB AB, Drottning Kristinas Vag 48, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.tidblad@swerea.se,"Faller, Markus/E-4927-2014; Kreislová, Kateřina/AAL-6360-2020; Tzanis, Chris G./O-5578-2015; Varotsos, Costas/H-6257-2013; Melcher, Michael/W-4633-2017","Tzanis, Chris G./0000-0002-7345-2900; Varotsos, Costas/0000-0001-7215-3610; Melcher, Michael/0000-0003-0633-9964; de la Fuente, Daniel/0000-0003-4540-3180",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,"Coauthors to this paper are those who are currently active in the work of ICP Materials.

A squall line observed over Oklahoma on 12 June 2011 is used as a case study. A recently developed retrieval technique combining observations of two vertically pointing cloud radars provides quantitative description of the drop size distribution (DSD) properties of the transition and stratiform regions of the squall-line system. For the first time, the results of this multifrequency cloud radar retrieval are compared to more conventional retrievals from a nearby polarimetric radar, and a supplementary result of this work is that this new methodology provides a much more detailed description of the DSD vertical and temporal variations. While the extent and evolution of the squall line is well reproduced by the model, the 1-h low-reflectivity transition region is not. In the stratiform region, simulations with both schemes are able to reproduce the observed downdraft and the associated significative subsaturation below the melting level, but with a slight overestimation of the relative humidity. Under this subsaturated air, the simulated rain mixing ratio continuously decreases toward the ground, in agreement with the observations. Conversely, the profiles of the mean volume diameter and the concentration parameter of the DSDs are not well reproduced. These discrepancies pinpoint at an issue in the representation of rain microphysics. The companion paper, investigates the sources of the biases in the microphysics processes in the rain layer by performing numerical sensitivity studies.","[Tridon, Frederic; Battaglia, Alessandro] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci, Leicester, Leics, England; [Planche, Celine; Banson, Sandra; Van Baelen, Joel; Wobrock, Wolfram] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, UMR 6016, INSU,Lab Meteorol Phys, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Mroz, Kamil; Battaglia, Alessandro] Univ Leicester, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester, Leics, England; [Tridon, Frederic] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany",University of Leicester; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University of Leicester; University of Cologne,"Tridon, F (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci, Leicester, Leics, England.;Tridon, F (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany.",ftridon@uni-koeln.de,"UzK, IGMK/HGU-4003-2022; Planche, Celine/J-1059-2016","Planche, Celine/0000-0001-8007-623X; Battaglia, Alessandro/0000-0001-9243-3484",project Evaluation de la Modelisation microphysique des Precipitations a l'aide d'Observations Radars Multi-frequences (EMPORiuM) - French CNRS-INSU LEFE-IMAGO programme; Centre Informatique National de l'Enseignement Superieur (CINES) at Montpellier [940180]; Calibration and validation studies over the North Atlantic and U.K. for Global Precipitation Mission - U.K. NERC [NE/L007169/1]; Atmospheric System Research Project [DE-SC0017967]; NERC [nceo020006] Funding Source: UKRI,project Evaluation de la Modelisation microphysique des Precipitations a l'aide d'Observations Radars Multi-frequences (EMPORiuM) - French CNRS-INSU LEFE-IMAGO programme; Centre Informatique National de l'Enseignement Superieur (CINES) at Montpellier; Calibration and validation studies over the North Atlantic and U.K. for Global Precipitation Mission - U.K. NERC; Atmospheric System Research Project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the associate editor Hugh Morrisson, Alain Protat, and two other anonymous reviewers for their interesting comments that greatly helped to improve the manuscript.

Here we combine mooring times series, ship-based measurements and remote sensing to assess the variability and forcing factors of vertical fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) across the Mackenzie Shelf in 2009. We developed a geospatial model of these fluxes to proceed to an integrative analysis of their determinants in summer. Flux data were obtained with sediment traps moored around 125m and via a regional empirical algorithm applied to particle size distributions (17 classes from 0.08-4.2 mm) measured by an Underwater Vision Profiler 5. The low fractal dimension (i.e., porous, fluffy particles) derived from the algorithm (1.26 +/- 0.34) and the dominance (similar to 77 %) of rapidly sinking small aggregates (< 0.5 mm) in total fluxes suggested that settling material was the product of recent aggregation processes between marine detritus, gel-like substances, and ballast minerals. Modeled settling velocity of small and large aggregates was, respectively, higher and lower than in previous studies within which a high fractal dimension (i.e., more compact particles) was consequential of deep-trap collection (similar to 400-1300 m). Redundancy analyses and forward selection of abiotic/biotic parameters, linear trends, and spatial structures (i.e., principal coordinates of neighbor matrices, PCNM) were conducted to partition the variation of the 17 POC flux size classes. Flux variability was explained at 69.5% by the addition of a temporal trend, 7 significant PCNM, and 9 biophysical variables. The first PCNM canonical axis (44.5% of spatial variance) reflected the total magnitude of POC fluxes through a shelf-basin gradient controlled by bottom depth and sea ice concentration (p < 0.01). The second most important spatial structure (5.0 %) corresponded to areas where shelf break upwelling is known to occur under easterlies and where phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms. Among biophysical parameters, bacterial production and northeasterly wind (upwelling-favorable) were the two strongest corollaries of POC fluxes (r(2) cum. = 0.37). Bacteria were correlated with small aggregates, while northeasterly wind was associated with large size classes (> 1mm ESD), but these two factors were weakly related with each other. Copepod biomass was overall negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with vertical POC fluxes, implying that metazoans acted as regulators of export fluxes, even if their role was minor given that our study spanned the onset of diapause. Our results demonstrate that on interior Arctic shelves where productivity is low in mid-summer, localized upwelling zones (nutrient enrichment) may result in the formation of large filamentous phytoaggregates that are not substantially retained by copepod and bacterial communities.","[Forest, A.; Babin, M.; Fortier, L.; Devred, E.; Sahlin, J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol & Quebec Ocean, Univ Laval Canada CNRS France, Takuvik Joint Int Lab,UMI 3376, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Stemmann, L.; Picheral, M.; Doxaran, D.] Univ Paris 06, UMR 7093, Lab Oceanog Villefranche 06230, Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Sampei, M.] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398511, Japan; [Gratton, Y.] Inst Natl Rech Sci Eau Terre Environm, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada; [Belanger, S.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Joux, F.; Ortega-Retuerta, E.] Univ Paris 06, UMR 7621, Lab Oceanog Biol Banyuls, Observ Oceanol, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Joux, F.; Ortega-Retuerta, E.] CNRS, UMR 7621, Lab Oceanog Microbienne, Observ Oceanol, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Ortega-Retuerta, E.; Martin, J.] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Jeffrey, W.

Although barcodes were not designed for phylogenetics, they can be beneficial to the completion of the Tree of Life. The barcode database for Trichoptera is relatively comprehensive, with data from every family, approximately two-thirds of the genera, and one-third of the described species. Most Trichoptera, as with most of life's species, have never been subjected to any formal phylogenetic analysis. Here, we present a phylogeny with over 16 000 unique haplotypes as a working hypothesis that can be updated as our estimates improve. We suggest a strategy of implementing constrained tree searches, which allow larger datasets to dictate the backbone phylogeny, while the barcode data fill out the tips of the tree. We also discuss how this phylogeny could be used to focus taxonomic attention on ambiguous species boundaries and hidden biodiversity. We suggest that systematists continue to differentiate between 'Barcode Index Numbers' (BINs) and 'species' that have been formally described. Each has utility, but they are not synonyms. We highlight examples of integrative taxonomy, using both barcodes and morphology for species description.

Its primary goal is to characterize the airbone dust in the Mars atmosphere, inferring its concentration, shape and optical properties. Thanks to its geometry, the sensor will be capable of studying dust-lifting processes with a high temporal resolution and high spatial coverage. Thanks to its multiwavelength design, it will characterize the solar spectrum from Mars' surface. The present work describes the sensor design from the scientific and technical requirements, the qualification processes to demonstrate its endurance on Mars' surface, the calibration activities to demonstrate its performance, and its validation campaign in a representative Mars analog. As a result of this process, we obtained a very compact sensor, fully digital, with a mass below 1 kg and exceptional power consumption and data budget features.","[Apestigue, Victor; Gonzalo, Alejandro;

Radiocarbon determinations from samples which obtained their C-14 in the marine environment therefore need a marine-specific calibration curve and cannot be calibrated directly against the atmospheric-based IntCal20 curve. This paper presents Marine20, an update to the internationally agreed marine radiocarbon age calibration curve that provides a non-polar global-average marine record of radiocarbon from 0-55 cal kBP and serves as a baseline for regional oceanic variation. Marine20 is intended for calibration of marine radiocarbon samples from non-polar regions; it is not suitable for calibration in polar regions where variability in sea ice extent, ocean upwelling and air-sea gas exchange may have caused larger changes to concentrations of marine radiocarbon. The Marine20 curve is based upon 500 simulations with an ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box-model of the global carbon cycle that has been forced by posterior realizations of our Northern Hemispheric atmospheric IntCal20 C-14 curve and reconstructed changes in CO2 obtained from ice core data. These forcings enable us to incorporate carbon cycle dynamics and temporal changes in the atmospheric C-14 level. The box-model simulations of the global-average marine radiocarbon reservoir age are similar to those of a more complex three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. However, simplicity and speed of the box model allow us to use a Monte Carlo approach to rigorously propagate the uncertainty in both the historic concentration of atmospheric C-14 and other key parameters of the carbon cycle through to our final Marine20 calibration curve. This robust propagation of uncertainty is fundamental to providing reliable precision for the radiocarbon age calibration of marine based samples. We make a first step towards deconvolving the contributions of different processes to the total uncertainty; discuss the main differences of Marine20 from the previous age calibration curve Marine13; and identify the limitations of our approach together with key areas for further work.

We present here SHCal20, a revised calibration curve from 0-55,000 cal BP, based upon SHCal13 and fortified by the addition of 14 new tree-ring data sets in the 2140-0, 3520-3453, 3608-3590 and 13,140-11,375 cal BP time intervals. We detail the statistical approaches used for curve construction and present recommendations for the use of the Northern Hemisphere curve (IntCal20), the Southern Hemisphere curve (SHCal20) and suggest where application of an equal mixture of the curves might be more appropriate. Using our Bayesian spline with errors-in-variables methodology, and based upon a comparison of Southern Hemisphere tree-ring data compared with contemporaneous Northern Hemisphere data, we estimate the mean Southern Hemisphere offset to be 36 +/- 27 C-14 yrs older.","[Hogg, Alan G.; Petchey, Fiona] Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Lab, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Hogg, Alan G.; Palmer, Jonathan G.; Turney, Chris Sm] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Heaton, Timothy J.; Blackwell, Paul G.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England; [Hua, Quan] Australian Nucl Sci & Technol Org, Locked Bag 2001, Kirrawee Dc, NSW 2232, Australia; [Palmer, Jonathan G.; Turney, Chris Sm] Univ New South Wales, Chronos 14Carbon Cycle Facil & Changing Earth, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Southon, John] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Bayliss, Alex] Hist England, 4th Floor,Cannon Bridge House,25 Dowgate Hill, London EC4R 2YA, England; [Boswijk, Gretel] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford,1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Pearson, Charlotte] Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Petchey, Fiona] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, Coll Arts Soc & Educ, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Reimer, Paula; Reimer, Ron] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Climate Environm & Chronol 14CHRONO, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Wacker, Lukas] HPK, Lab Ion Beam Phys, H29,Otto Stern Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Waikato; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sheffield; Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Auckland; University of Oxford; University of Arizona; James Cook University; Queens University Belfast,"Hogg, AG (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Waikato Radiocarbon Lab, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand.;Hogg, AG (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",alan.hogg@waikato.ac.nz,"Heaton, Tim/AAF-5132-2022; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/AAQ-2227-2021; Blackwell, Paul/F-2885-2017; Heaton, Timothy J/AFJ-8295-2022; Turney, Chris/P-8701-2018; Hogg, Alan/M-8427-2014; Palmer, Jonathan/J-7834-2012","Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Blackwell, Paul/0000-0002-3141-4914; Heaton, Timothy J/0000-0002-9994-142X; Turney, Chris/0000-0001-6733-0993; Bayliss, Alex/0000-0003-2782-1979; Hogg, Alan/0000-0002-4001-9027; Palmer, Jonathan/0000-0002-6665-4483","Leverhulme Trust Fellowship [RF-2019-140\9]; NERC [NE/H007865/1, NRCF010002] Funding Source: UKRI",Leverhulme Trust Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"TJ Heaton is supported by a Leverhulme Trust Fellowship RF-2019-140\9, Improving the Measurement of Time Using Radiocarbon.

Yet, solution-oriented research addressing complex sustainability problems has become complex itself, with new transdisciplinary research formats being developed and tested for this purpose. Application of new formats offers learning potentials from experience. To this end, we accompanied fourteen research projects conceptualized as real-world labs (RwLs) from 2015 to 2018. RwLs were part of a funding program on 'Science for Sustainability' in the German federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Here, we combine conceptual and empirical work to a structured collection of experiences and provide a comprehensive account of RwLs. First, we outline characteristics of RwLs as transformation oriented, transdisciplinary research approach, using experiments, enabling learning and having a long-term orientation. Second, we outline eleven success factors and concrete design notes we gained through a survey of the 14 RwLs: (1) find the right balance between scientific and societal aims, (2) address the practitioners needs and restrictions, (3) make use of the experimentation concept, (4) actively communicate, (5) develop a 'collaboration culture', (6) be attached to concrete sites, (7) create lasting impact and transferability, (8) plan for sufficient time and financial means, (9) adaptability, (10) research-based learning, and (11) recognize dependency on external actors. Characteristics and success factors are combined to illustrate practical challenges in RwLs. Third, we show which methods could be used to cope with challenges in RwLs. We conclude discussing the state of debate on RwLs and outline future avenues of research.","[Bergmann, Matthias; Marg, Oskar] Inst Social Ecol Res ISOE, Hamburger Allee 45, D-60486 Frankfurt, Germany; [Bergmann, Matthias; Lang, Daniel J.] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Schaepke, Niko] Chalmers Univ Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Schaepke, Niko] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Stelzer, Franziska] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany; [Bossert, Michael] Concordia Univ Montreal, 1455 Blvd Maisonneuve Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Gantert, Marius] TELEINTERNETCAFE Architektur & Urbanismus, Kottbusser Damm 74, D-10967 Berlin, Germany; [Haeussler, Elke] Karlsruhe Univ Appl Sci, Inst Transport Syst & Infrastruct IVI, Moltkestr 30, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Marquardt, Editha] Univ Adm Sci Speyer, PF 14 09, D-67324 Speyer, Germany; [Piontek, Felix M.] Ulm Univ, Inst Sustainable Corp Management, Helmholtzstr 18, 89081 Ulm, Germany; [Potthast, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Int Ctr Eth Sci & Humanities, Wilhelmstr 19, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Rhodius, Regina] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Remote Sensing & Landscape Informat Syst, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Rudolph, Matthias] Stuttgart State Acad Art & Design, Weissenhof 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany; [Ruddat, Michael] Univ Stuttgart, Ctr Interdisciplinary Risk & Innovat Res, ZIRIUS, Seidenstr 36, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Seebacher, Andreas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Technol Assessment & Syst Anal ITAS, Karlstr 11, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Sussmann, Nico] Heilbronn Univ Appl Sci, Fac Mech & Elect Automot Syst Engn, Max Planck Str 39, D-74081 Heilbronn, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Chalmers University of Technology; University of Freiburg; Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences; Ulm University; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; University of Freiburg; University of Stuttgart; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Max Planck Society,"Bergmann, M (corresponding author), Inst Social Ecol Res ISOE, Hamburger Allee 45, D-60486 Frankfurt, Germany.;Bergmann, M (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",bergmann@isoe.de,"Marquardt, Editha/ABC-9617-2021","Bergmann, Matthias/0000-0002-6090-4429","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg [0421.915-4(14)]","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg within the frame of the Science for Sustainability program (#0421.915-4(14)).",,66,24,24,1,14,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

The analysis addresses the spatial representativeness of the flux measurements, instrumental effects on data quality, spatial patterns in the data quality, and the performance of the coordinate rotation method. Our findings demonstrate that application of a footprint filter could strengthen the CarboEurope-IP flux database, since only one third of the sites is situated in truly homogeneous terrain. Almost half of the sites experience a significant reduction in eddy-covariance data quality under certain conditions, though these effects are mostly constricted to a small portion of the dataset. Reductions in data quality of the sensible heat flux are mostly induced by characteristics of the surrounding terrain, while the latent heat flux is subject to instrumentation-related problems. The Planar-Fit coordinate rotation proved to be a reliable tool for the majority of the sites using only a single set of rotation angles. Overall, we found a high average data quality for the CarboEurope-IP network, with good representativeness of the measurement data for the specified target land cover types.","[Aubinet, M.; Heinesch, B.] Univ Agr Sci, Unit Biosyst Phys, Gembloux, Belgium; [Aurela, M.; Laurila, T.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Banza, J.] Univ Evora, Evora, Portugal; [Bernhofer, C.; Gruenwald, T.] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, Dept Meteorol, Tharandt, Germany; [Bonnefond, J.

We present an advanced stochastic-ecological model to test the relative support for scenarios describing where and when the first humans entered Sahul, and their most probable routes of early settlement. The model supports a dominant entry via the northwest Sahul Shelf first, potentially followed by a second entry through New Guinea, with initial entry most consistent with 50,000 or 75,000 years ago based on comparison with bias-corrected archaeological map layers. The model's emergent properties predict that peopling of the entire continent occurred rapidly across all ecological environments within 156-208 human generations (4368-5599 years) and at a plausible rate of 0.71-0.92km year(-1). More broadly, our methods and approaches can readily inform other global migration debates, with results supporting an exit of anatomically modern humans from Africa 63,000-90,000 years ago, and the peopling of Eurasia in as little as 12,000-15,000 years via inland routes. Advanced ecological modelling reveals how Sahul (Australia and New Guinea) was first peopled, suggesting the most probable routes and surprisingly rapid early settlement of this continent by anatomically modern humans starting 50,000 to 75,000 years ago.","[Bradshaw, Corey J.

The belief that the remains of St James the Great, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, is buried there has stimulated, since their reported discovery in the 9th century AD, a significant flow of people from across the European continent and beyond. Little is known about the practical experiences of people living within the city during its rise to prominence, however. Here, for the first time, we combine multi-isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18(ap), delta C-13(ap) and Sr-87/Sr-86) and radiocarbon dating (C-14) of human remains discovered at the crypt of the Cathedral of Santiago to directly study changes in diet and mobility during the first three centuries of Santiago's emergence as an urban centre (9th-12th centuries AD). Together with assessment of the existing archaeological data, our radiocarbon chronology broadly confirms historical tradition regarding the first occupation of the site. Isotopic analyses reveal that the foundation of the religious site attracted migrants from the wider region of the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula, and possibly from further afield. Stable isotope analysis of collagen, together with information on tomb typology and location, indicates that the inhabitants of the city experienced increasing socioeconomic diversity as it became wealthier as the hub of a wide network of pilgrimage. Our research represents the potential of multidisciplinary analyses to reveal insights into the origins and impacts of the emergence of early pilgrimage centres on the diets and status of communities within Christian mediaeval Europe and beyond.","[Perez-Ramallo, Patxi; Ilgner, Jana; Roberts, Patrick] Max Planck Inst Geoanthropol, IsoTROP Res Grp, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Perez-Ramallo, Patxi; Ilgner, Jana; Fernandes, Ricardo; Roberts, Patrick] Max Planck Inst Geoanthropol, Dept Archaeol, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Perez-Ramallo, Patxi; Etxeberria, Francisco] Univ Basque Country EHU, Fac Med & Enfermeria, Dept Especialidades Med Quirurg, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Grandal-d'Anglade, Aurora] Univ Coruna UDC, Inst Univ Xeoloxia, ESCI 15071, La Coruna, Spain; [Organista, Elia] Stockholm Univ, Dept Archaeol & Class Studies, Osteoarcheol Res Lab, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Organista, Elia] Univ Alcala Henares, Inst Evolut Africa IDEA, Madrid 28010, Spain; [Santos, Elena] Univ Burgos UBu, Burgos, Spain; [Chivall, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Rodriguez-Varela, Ricardo; Gotherstrom, Anders] Ctr Palaeogenet, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rodriguez-Varela, Ricardo; Gotherstrom, Anders] Stockholm Univ, Dept Archaeol & Class Studies, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fernandes, Ricardo] Princeton Univ, Climate Change & Hist Res Initiat, Princeton, NJ USA; [Fernandes, Ricardo] Masaryk Univ, Fac Arts, Brno, Czech Republic; [Arsuaga, Juan Luis] Univ Complutense Madrid, Ctr Mixto UCM, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; [Le Roux, Petrus] Univ Cape Town, Dept Geol Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Higham, Tom] Univ Vienna, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Res Network Human Evolut & Archaeol Sci HEAS, Vienna, Austria; [Beaumont, Julia; Koon, Hannah] Univ Bradford, Fac Life Sci, Sch Archaeol & Forens Sci, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Roberts, Patrick] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Basque Country; Universidade da Coruna; Stockholm University; Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Burgos; University of Oxford; Swedish Museum of Natural History; Stockholm University; Princeton University; Masaryk University Brno; Complutense University of Madrid; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Cape Town; University of Vienna; University of Bradford; University of Queensland,"Perez-Ramallo, P; Roberts, P (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Geoanthropol, IsoTROP Res Grp, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.;Perez-Ramallo, P; Roberts, P (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Geoanthropol, Dept Archaeol, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.;Perez-Ramallo, P (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country EHU, Fac Med & Enfermeria, Dept Especialidades Med Quirurg, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.;Roberts, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",ramallo@shh.mpg.de; roberts@shh.mpg.de,"Grandal-d'Anglade, Aurora/A-5910-2011; Santos, Elena/H-5558-2015; Chivall, David/N-6967-2013","Grandal-d'Anglade, Aurora/0000-0002-2087-4034; Santos, Elena/0000-0002-6012-6313; Chivall, David/0000-0003-4961-3847; Perez-Ramallo, Patxi/0000-0002-1142-4912","'la Caixa' Banking Foundation [100010434, LCF/BQ/ES16/11570006]; Max Planck Society; University of Bradford; Xunta de Galicia [ED431B 2018/47, R2016/023]",'la Caixa' Banking Foundation(La Caixa Foundation); Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); University of Bradford; Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission),"This project has been supported by a grant from the 'la Caixa' Banking Foundation (ID 100010434; Code: LCF/BQ/ES16/11570006).

This is because stakeholders often hold valuable knowledge about socio-environmental dynamics and collaborative forms of modeling produce important boundary objects used to collectively reason about environmental problems. Although the number of participatory modeling (PM) case studies and the number of researchers adopting these approaches has grown in recent years, the lack of standardized reporting and limited reproducibility have prevented PM's establishment and advancement as a cohesive field of study. We suggest a four-dimensional framework (4P) that includes reporting on dimensions of (1) the Purpose for selecting a PM approach (the why); (2) the Process by which the public was involved in model building or evaluation (the how); (3) the Partnerships formed (the who); and (4) the Products that resulted from these efforts (the what). We highlight four case studies that use common PM software-based approaches (fuzzy cognitive mapping, agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and participatory geospatial modeling) to understand human-environment interactions and the consequences of ecological changes, including bushmeat hunting in Tanzania and Cameroon, agricultural production and deforestation in Zambia, and groundwater management in India. We demonstrate how standardizing communication about PM case studies can lead to innovation and new insights about model-based reasoning in support of ecological policy development. We suggest that our 4P framework and reporting approach provides a way for new hypotheses to be identified and tested in the growing field of PM.","[Gray, Steven; Laursen, Bethany; Olabisi, Laura Schmitt; Singer, Alison] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, Nat Resource Bldg 480,Wilson Rd,Room 151, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Voinov, Alexey] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Syst Management & Leadership, CB11-06-217,POB 123,81 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Paolisso, Michael] Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jordan, Rebecca] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, Human Ecol & Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 59 Lipman Dr, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [BenDor, Todd] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, New East Bldg,CB 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bommel, Pierre] CIRAD, Green Res Unit, Ave Agropolis, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Bommel, Pierre] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Glynn, Pierre] US Geol Survey, 432 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 20191 USA; [Hedelin, Beatrice] Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci, Ctr Climate & Safety, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Hubacek, Klaus] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Introne, Josh] Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, 404 Wilson Rd,Room 417, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kolagani, Nagesh] Indian Inst Informat Technol IIIT Chittoor, Sri City 517588, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Laursen, Bethany] Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Nat Resource Bldg 480,Wilson Rd,Room 151, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Prell, Christina] Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Parren Mitchell Art Sociol Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sterling, Eleanor] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, 200 Cent Pk West, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Zellner, Moira] Univ Illinois, Inst Environm Sci & Policy, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, 412 South Peoria St,MC 348, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",Michigan State University; University of Technology Sydney; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; CIRAD; Universidad Costa Rica; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Karlstad University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Gray, S (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, Nat Resource Bldg 480,Wilson Rd,Room 151, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",stevenallangray@gmail.com,"Hedelin, Beatrice/H-2667-2012; Hubacek, Klaus/K-3500-2019; Gray, Steven/ABF-1206-2021; Kolagani, Nagesh/AAF-4267-2020; Bommel, Pierre/S-4152-2019; Sterling, Eleanor/AAS-1036-2020; Sterling, Eleanor J/AGK-8469-2022; Laursen, Bethany/ABI-7656-2020; Voinov, Alexey/F-7397-2010","Bommel, Pierre/0000-0002-7776-9075; Sterling, Eleanor/0000-0003-2692-8264; Voinov, Alexey/0000-0002-2985-4574; Kolagani, Nagesh/0000-0003-3870-3230; Laursen, Bethany/0000-0001-8935-9607; Glynn, Pierre/0000-0001-8804-7003","National Science Foundation through the Socio-environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) in Annapolis, Maryland, USA; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1427091, 1444184]","National Science Foundation through the Socio-environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) in Annapolis, Maryland, USA; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Funding for this study was provided by the National Science Foundation through the Socio-environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) in Annapolis, Maryland, USA.

Here, we introduce Tilt Trivia, a suite of quiz-style, multiplayer games for use on mobile devices and tablets (Android or Apple) to help students learn simple definitions and facts. This mobile device game was built using the Unity engine and has a multiplayer functionality that runs seamlessly, all day, every day. A single game consists of 6-10 questions that are selected at random from a base suite of 13-33 questions. A single Tilt Trivia game takes 3-7 min to complete and allows up to five players to play simultaneously in the same game space. To begin, players select a topical avatar to represent them in the game. While in the competitive playing field, players are presented with a question and then they simply tilt their tablets until their avatar rests on the correct answer marker (i.e., true or false). Because the playing field is constantly tilting, keeping your avatar on the correct answer requires a continual counter-tilting motion of the tablet to maintain your position within the game. A countdown timer is incorporated requiring players to answer the questions as quickly as possible. At the end of the game, a leaderboard displays the players' scores and rankings, a metric that motivates repeat play. Players have the option of jostling other players off of the correct answer in the hopes of netting the highest score. The game is configurable to any topic and currently there are games for eight different topics (see Data and Resources).","[Kilb, Debi; Yang, Alan] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92071 USA; [Garrett, Nathan] Santana High Sch, 9915 Magnolia Ave, Santee, CA 92071 USA; [Pankow, Kris; Linville, Lisa] Univ Utah, Seismograph Stn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Rubinstein, Justin] US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Kilb, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92071 USA.",dkilb@ucsd.edu,,"Kilb, Debi/0000-0002-7252-4167",National Science Foundation (NSF) [1460232]; NSF [1053376]; Eaton; Marty Scripps,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Eaton; Marty Scripps,"The authors are grateful to many students, teachers, and professors who participated in the development of Tilt Trivia games and testing sessions and provided feedback on the functionality and playability of the game.

The ISMN brings together in situ soil moisture measurements collected and freely shared by a multitude of organisations, harmonises them in terms of units and sampling rates, applies advanced quality control, and stores them in a database. Users can freely retrieve the data from this database through an online web portal (https://ismn.earth/en/, last access: 28 October 2021). Meanwhile, the ISMN has evolved into the primary in situ soil moisture reference database worldwide, as evidenced by more than 3000 active users and over 1000 scientific publications referencing the data sets provided by the network. As of July 2021, the ISMN now contains the data of 71 networks and 2842 stations located all over the globe, with a time period spanning from 1952 to the present. The number of networks and stations covered by the ISMN is still growing, and approximately 70 % of the data sets contained in the database continue to be updated on a regular or irregular basis. The main scope of this paper is to inform readers about the evolution of the ISMN over the past decade, including a description of network and data set updates and quality control procedures. A comprehensive review of the existing literature making use of ISMN data is also provided in order to identify current limitations in functionality and data usage and to shape priorities for the next decade of operations of this unique community-based data repository.","[Dorigo, Wouter;

J,"Jennings, B",,,,"Jennings, Bruce",,,Solidarity and care as relational practices,BIOETHICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,bioethics; care; community; flourishing; justice; recognition; social practices; solidarity,,"But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics. For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be called an 'applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice. A contrasting 'relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency, interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful. It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice. I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand, care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core problems with which health policy and public health must grapple. I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention, attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould observes concerning solidarity on this score: 'the proliferation of solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences, along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret Urban Walker has called the 'expressive-collaborative' model of morality over the 'theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power. Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness and embodied living in the natural, material world. Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going, contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning this contest, we should 'see the process as basic and never ending, and [subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than [imagine] that it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However, when these patterns endure they comprise 'practices', which may be defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this definition more fully. First, social practices are structured sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power, distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value. Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped, and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact together. A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually constructed or 'theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at 'the root of the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of what has been called 'interpretive phenomenology' and has been well developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change, transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal ellipsis The ethos embedded in [interpretive] phenomenology is respect for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices, skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices allow for the other to be encountered and made visible. When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it, this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism, reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive, discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty. The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a critique of what she calls 'conventional solidarity', and defines a counter-notion of 'reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. 'Conscience just isn't enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role in them,' he writes. 'Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that could secure moral results that challenge one's standing. ' Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all. Thus Kolers defines solidarity as 'reason-driven political action on other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction between agency and the institutional structures within which agency takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and practices of community, but who crucially brings community and solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what might be called 'comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy, one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members. In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense, two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity between its members. 'Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time. It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting, defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; ; ","[Jennings, Bruce] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Sch, Ctr Biomed Eth & Soc, 2525 West End Ave,Suite 400, Nashville, TN 37027 USA; [Jennings, Bruce] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Sch, Dept Hlth Policy, 2525 West End Ave,Suite 400, Nashville, TN 37027 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University,"Jennings, B (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Sch, Ctr Biomed Eth & Soc, 2525 West End Ave,Suite 400, Nashville, TN 37027 USA.;Jennings, B (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Sch, Dept Hlth Policy, 2525 West End Ave,Suite 400, Nashville, TN 37027 USA.",brucejennings@humansandnature.org,"Ločičnik, Aleksandra/ABE-7348-2021","Jennings, Bruce/0000-0002-5279-2420",,,,,42,27,27,75,844,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-9702,1467-8519,,BIOETHICS,Bioethics,NOV,2018,9,,SI,,553,561,,10.1111/bioe.12510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12510,,,9,"Ethics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Social Sciences, Biomedical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences,HA5QZ,30264873,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000450332600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated similar to 10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the desert.","[Malaspinas, Anna-Sapfo; Muller, Craig; Margaryan, Ashot; Korneliussen, Thorfinn S.; Moreno-Mayar, J.

Over 10,000 people were involved in the data collection. New information Within 20 months, the participants accumulated 750,143 photo observations of 6,857 species of the Russian flora. This constitutes the largest dataset of open spatial data on the country's biodiversity and a leading source of data on the current state of the national flora. About 87% of all project data, i.e. 652,285 observations, are available under free licences (CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC) and can be freely used in scientific, educational and environmental activities.","[Seregin, Alexey P.;

Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation - but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.","[Kattge, J.; Boenisch, G.; Reichstein, M.; Frank, D.; Mahecha, M.

After the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, its people mixed with individuals in the southeast to form one of the two main ancestral populations of South Asia, whose direct descendants live in southern India. Simultaneously, they mixed with descendants of Steppe pastoralists who, starting around 4000 years ago, spread via Central Asia to form the other main ancestral population. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the distinctive features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.","[Narasimhan, Vagheesh M.;

We collected information on native and non-native species attacking non-native trees, i.e. type, extent and time of first observation of damage for 23 important non-native trees in 27 European countries. Our database includes about 2300 synthesised attack records (synthesised per biotic threat, tree and country) from over 800 species. Insects (49%) and fungi (45%) are the main observed biotic threats, but also arachnids, bacteria including phytoplasmas, mammals, nematodes, plants and viruses have been recorded. This information will be valuable to identify patterns and drivers of attacks, and trees with a lower current health risk to be considered for planting. In addition, our database will provide a baseline to which future impacts on non-native tree species could be compared with and thus will allow to analyse temporal trends of impacts.","[Poetzelsberger, Elisabeth] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Silviculture, Vienna BOKU, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria;
