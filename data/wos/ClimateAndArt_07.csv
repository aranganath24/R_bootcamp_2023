Similar to other factor analysis methods, DSARF approximates high dimensional data by a product between time dependent weights and spatially dependent factors. These weights and factors are in turn represented in terms of lower dimensional latent variables that are inferred using stochastic variational inference. DSARF is different from the state-of-the-art techniques in that it parameterizes the weights in terms of a deep switching vector auto-regressive likelihood governed with a Markovian prior, which is able to capture the non-linear inter-dependencies among weights to characterize multimodal temporal dynamics. This results in a flexible hierarchical deep generative factor analysis model that (i) provides a collection of potentially interpretable states abstracted from the process dynamics, and (ii) performs short- and long-term vector time series prediction in a complex multi-relational setting. Our extensive experiments, which include simulated data and real data from a wide range of applications such as climate change, weather forecasting, traffic, infectious disease spread and nonlinear physical systems attest the superior performance of DSARF in terms of long- and short-term prediction error, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods(1).","[Farnoosh, Amirreza; Azari, Bahar; Ostadabbas, Sarah] Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Farnoosh, A (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",afarnoosh@ece.neu.edu; azari@ece.neu.edu; ostadabbas@ece.neu.edu,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,3,ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PALO ALTO,"2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA",2159-5399,2374-3468,978-1-57735-866-4,AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE,,,2021,,,,,7394,7403,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BR9ZM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000680423507058,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are not being built anymore today, and unfortunately the knowledge of their building technology is being lost, This region has a variety of traditional houses. The various types match the materials which are found in the vicinity of the structures. Nowadays, however, structures everywhere are built in a contemporary way, using cement-blocks and concrete. Many traditional houses are still in use, An estimate is that the number in Abha is about 10% of all houses, while at more remote settlements in inland wadies the percentage of use rises from 30 to 80%. In this paper, three examples of traditional houses and their characteristics are shown together with relevant drawings: a stone house, a mud house with bands of protecting slate slabs, and a mud house with plain mud-walls. These dwellings show a balance between the available materials, the climatic conditions, and human dimensions. They demonstrate the ability to create the art of building. In view of the fact that the loss of the traditional art of building is inevitable, an awareness of the value of this tradition with its ecological and economical technology becomes more desirable.

Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) is preferred among available thermo-responsive smart materials for architectural applications because of its advantages of reaction temperatures, deformation patterns, shape-changing behaviors, opportunity for various forms and manufacturing processing, in addition to the shape memory effect. Of various facade elements, this study focuses on designing and validating the SMP components as prototypes for shading devices for the Climate Adaptive Building Skin (CABS), to approach design decisions of optimal activation temperature, size, arrangements, and operating scenarios using digital models and simulation tools following the presented research framework in conjunction with design-to-fabrication studies in parallel. Prior to performance evaluations, the operating principles of SMP shading devices and interpretation of temperature data in relation to the urban conditions are prescribed. This research is based on a sustainability assessment of state-of-the-art responsive facade design integrating SMP elements combining active and passive measures to support a sustainable architectural design that provides less heat gain and better daylight comfort while demonstrating the simplified performance analysis method of SMP prototype designs. Following the simulation and comparative analysis of the results, drawbacks, and cautions inherent in the simulation methods, the potential meaning is briefly discussed.","[Yoon, Jungwon; Bae, Sanghyun] Univ Seoul, Dept Architecture, Seoulsiripdae Ro 163, Seoul 02504, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Yoon, J (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Dept Architecture, Seoulsiripdae Ro 163, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",jwyoon@uos.ac.kr; minz514@naver.com,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [NRF-2017R1C1B5015080]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (NRF-2017R1C1B5015080).",,121,4,4,4,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2020,11,,,,,,4391,10.3390/su12114391,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12114391,,,35,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC6JX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000543391800054,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main issue in this regard is to plan, design and manage urban settlements where human beings would be able to have the desirable quality of life according to sustainable principles. The increase in social, economic and spatial vulnerabilities in cities, and the excess of degradation factors of natural environment resources show the necessity of considering resilience thinking. This paper aims to apply resilience thinking to urban studies and to identify the required basis for further research on urban resilience through a descriptive analytical review of the theoretical literature. A recent research on urban resilience in urbanization, which is a novel topic in urban resilience studies is addressed in this article. This paper aimed at introducing indices of urban resilience through a particular approach to the relationship between urban form and urban resilience. Given the literature review of urban resilience, our results show that while most research topics rely on environmental dimensions and reduction in natural hazards, such as global warming and climate change, the need for further research on spatial morphology and urban spatial structures is evident. Furthermore, additional research is needed to explore the criteria of urban resilience measurement specifically in the locational-spatial aspect.","[Masnavi, M.

Based on experiments with an atmospheric model, the possible contribution of SSTAs in different ocean basins to the atmospheric circulation anomalies is identified. Further, through verifying the real-time forecasts, current capabilities in predicting such an extreme warm event with a state-of-the-art coupled general circulation model are assessed. During the long-lasting warm event, there were two warm maxima in the area-averaged SSTA around January 2014 and July 2015, respectively. The warm anomaly originated at the oceanic surface and propagated downward and reached about 300 m. Model experiments forced by observed SST suggest that the long persistence of the atmospheric anomalies in the northeastern Pacific as a whole may be partially explained by SST forcing, particularly in the tropical Pacific Ocean associated with a persistent warm SSTA in 2014/15 and an extremely strong El Nino in 2015/16, via its influence on atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific. Nevertheless, it was a challenge to predict the evolution of this warm event, especially for its growth. That is consistent with the fact that the SSTAs in extratropical oceans are largely a consequence of unpredictable atmospheric variability.","[Hu, Zeng-Zhen; Kumar, Arun; Jha, Bhaskar; Zhu, Jieshun] NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, NWS, NCEP, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Jha, Bhaskar; Zhu, Jieshun] Innovim, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Huang, Bohua] George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Huang, Bohua] George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Center for Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies; George Mason University; George Mason University,"Hu, ZZ (corresponding author), NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, NWS, NCEP, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",zeng-zhen.hu@noaa.gov,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011; , AK/B-6517-2008","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400; Huang, Bohua/0000-0003-4869-3849",NSF [AGS-1338427]; NOAA [NA14OAR4310160]; NASA [NNX14AM19G],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We appreciate the constructive comments and suggestions from reviewers and the assistance of Dr. Wanqiu Wang in processing the CFSv2 real-time forecast data.

The most significant areas of concern are mine infrastructure, supply chains, health and safety conditions, environmental management, community relations and exploration. This is particularly relevant to mining in a country as climatically vulnerable as Peru. This study focuses on the identification of mining regions and main commodities in Peru that are potentially vulnerable to future extreme rainfall events associated with climate change. From a mine design and planning perspective, this study is a first step to illustrate the importance of considering the impacts of different climatic scenarios on mining in Peru. Based on HadGEM2-ES global climate model projections, mining regions across Peru were clustered into super-regions with differing potentials of extreme rainfall events during the next three decades. Five indices for precipitation extremes were used, and their variations between 1971-2000 and 2015-2034 were computed. Current and future metallic mining projects expected to take place across Peru in the next 30years were retrieved from a mining database and subsequently exported into a geographical information systems software to represent their location and interpolate the variation for each precipitation extreme index. The results of this study point out at a decreasing trend in rainfall extremes intensity and frequency in regions of southern Peru. For copper projects located in these regions, a decrease in rainfall events could also imply an eventual decrease in total precipitation and consequently a deficit in water availability during the next three decades. Mining regions in central Peru, with significant number of zinc projects, are likely to experience a marked increase in overall annual precipitation, average daily precipitation intensity, consecutive days of precipitation and number of heavy precipitation days. At a lesser extent than in central Peru, gold projects in northern Peru are also likely to experience an overall increase in precipitation extremes. The approach used for this research could be extended to other mining regions around the world with extreme weather events.","[Gonzalez, Francisco R.; Raval, Simit; Timms, Wendy; Hitch, Michael] UNSW, Australian Ctr Sustainable Min Practices, Sch Min Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Gonzalez, Francisco R.] Univ Chile, Dept Min Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Taplin, Ros] UNSW, Art & Design, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Taplin, Ros] Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Energy Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of New South Wales Sydney; Universidad de Chile; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Strathclyde,"Gonzalez, FR (corresponding author), UNSW, Australian Ctr Sustainable Min Practices, Sch Min Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Gonzalez, FR (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Min Engn, Santiago, Chile.",francgon@uchile.cl,"Hitch, Michael/AAE-6734-2022; Hitch, Michael/AAH-8205-2020","Hitch, Michael/0000-0002-0893-5973; ","International Mining for Development Centre (IM4DC); Australian Centre for Sustainable Mining Practices (ACSMP); School of Mining Engineering, UNSW","International Mining for Development Centre (IM4DC); Australian Centre for Sustainable Mining Practices (ACSMP); School of Mining Engineering, UNSW","Access to the SNL Metals & Mining database has been possible through research funding granted by the International Mining for Development Centre (IM4DC) and the Australian Centre for Sustainable Mining Practices (ACSMP).

The objective of this study is to quantify their potential to reduce energy use and peak demand in commercial buildings using state-of-the art whole-building computer simulation software that allows accurate modeling of the behavior of optically-complex fenestration systems such as angular selective systems. Three commercial systems were evaluated: a micro-perforated screen, a tubular shading structure, and an expanded metal mesh. This evaluation was performed through computer simulation for multiple climates (Chicago, Illinois and Houston, Texas), window-to-wall ratios (0.15-0.60), building codes (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and 2010) and lighting control configurations (with and without). The modeling of the optical complexity of the systems took advantage of the development of state-of-the-art versions of the EnergyPlus, Radiance and Window simulation tools. Results show significant reductions in perimeter zone energy use; the best system reached 28% and 47% savings, respectively, without and with daylighting controls (ASHRAE 90.1-2004, south facade, Chicago, WWR= 0.45). Angular selectivity and thermal conductance of the angle-selective layer, as well as spectral selectivity of low-emissivity coatings, were identified as factors with significant impact on performance.

However, companies committed to sustainability are interested in more methods that examine their products and activities' impacts. Methods that build on LCA strengths and illuminate other connected but less understood facets, related to social and economic impacts, would provide greater value to decision-makers. This study is a LCA that calculates the potential impacts associated with Bounty paper towels from two facilities with different production lines, an older one (Albany, Georgia) representing established technology and the other (Box Elder, Utah), a newer state-of-the-art platform. This is unique in that it includes use of Industrial Process Systems Assessment (IPSA), new electricity and pulp data, modeled in open source software, and is the basis for the development of new integrated sustainability metrics (published separately). The new metrics can guide supply chain and manufacturing enhancements, and product design related to environmental protection and resource sustainability. Results of the LCA indicate Box Elder had improvements on environmental impact scores related to air emission indicators, except for particulate matter. Albany had lower water use impacts. After normalization of the results, fossil fuel depletion is the most critical environmental indicator. Pulp production, electricity, and fuels for product production drive fossil fuel depletion. Climate change, land occupation, and particulate matter are also relevant. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by pulp, electricity, papermaking, and landfill methane from the disposed product, drive climate change impacts. Pulp provides significant offsets to balance climate change impacts due to sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Fluctuations of the Earth's surface heat balance immediately affect the PBL and assimilate there owing to the effective mechanism of turbulent heat transfer. In this case the upper boundary of the PBL plays the role of a cover, preventing the direct penetration of thermal effects and contaminants into an overlying atmospheric layer. In view of this, air pollution is especially dangerous when associated with shallow PBL. In addition, local peculiarities of climate change are mainly determined by the PBL height due to the high sensitivity of thin stably stratified PBLs to the thermal effects. Deep convective PBLs are not very sensitive to weak thermal effects, but they significantly affect the formation of convective cloudiness and the climate system as a whole by means of the turbulent entrainment of the thermal energy, humidity, aerosols, and other admixtures through the upper boundary. The PBL height and turbulent entrainment must be calculated when simulating and forecasting air pollution, abnormal frosts and heat, and other hazardous phenomena. In this paper we discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge in the area of PBL height simulation and suggest a new model of turbulent entrainment for convective PBLs.","[Zilitinkevich, S.

On the Norwegian mainland, seNorge2 provides high-resolution fields of daily total precipitation for applications requiring long-term datasets at regional or national level, where the challenge is to simulate small-scale processes often taking place in complex terrain. The dataset constitutes a valuable meteorological input for snow and hydrological simulations; it is updated daily and presented on a high-resolution grid (1 km of grid spacing). The climate archive goes back to 1957. The spatial interpolation scheme builds upon classical methods, such as optimal interpolation and successive-correction schemes. An original approach based on (spatial) scale-separation concepts has been implemented which uses geographical coordinates and elevation as complementary information in the interpolation. seNorge2 daily precipitation fields represent local precipitation features at spatial scales of a few kilometers, depending on the station network density. In the surroundings of a station or in dense station areas, the predictions are quite accurate even for intense precipitation. For most of the grid points, the performances are comparable to or better than a state-of-the-art pan-European dataset (E-OBS), because of the higher effective resolution of seNorge2. However, in very data-sparse areas, such as in the mountainous region of southern Norway, seNorge2 underestimates precipitation because it does not make use of enough geographical information to compensate for the lack of observations. The evaluation of seNorge2 as the meteorological forcing for the seNorge snow model and the DDD (Distance Distribution Dynamics) rainfall-runoff model shows that both models have been able to make profitable use of seNorge2, partly because of the automatic calibration procedure they incorporate for precipitation.","[Lussana, Cristian; Tveito, Ole Einar] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Saloranta, Tuomo; Skaugen, Thomas; Magnusson, Jan; Andersen, Jess] Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate,"Lussana, C (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway.",cristianl@met.no,"Lussana, Cristian/AAA-8780-2019; Skaugen, Thomas/AAJ-5392-2020","Lussana, Cristian/0000-0003-3159-4895; Saloranta, Tuomo/0000-0001-8436-0342",Norwegian project Felles aktiviteter NVE-MET tilknyttet nasjonal flom- og skredvarslingstjeneste; NVE project [FoU-80200],Norwegian project Felles aktiviteter NVE-MET tilknyttet nasjonal flom- og skredvarslingstjeneste; NVE project,Work at MET Norway and NVE on the activities presented in the article has been funded by Norwegian project Felles aktiviteter NVE-MET tilknyttet nasjonal flom- og skredvarslingstjeneste and NVE project FoU-80200.,,56,62,62,2,13,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

However, the driving behavior is a major factor which has been neglected in these methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware methodology to estimate the driving behavior in terms of future vehicle speeds and integrate this capability into EV energy management. We implement a driving behavior model using a variation of artificial neural networks called nonlinear autoregressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX). We train our novel context-aware NARX model based on historical behavior of real drivers, their recent driving reactions, and route average speed retrieved from Google Maps in order to enable driver-specific and self-adaptive driving behavior modeling and long-term estimation. We analyze the estimation error of our methodology and its impact on a battery lifetime-aware automotive climate control, comparing to the state-of-the-art methodologies for various estimation window sizes. Our methodology shows only 12% error for up to 30-s speed prediction which is an improvement of 27% compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the higher accuracy helps the controller to achieve up to 82% of the maximum energy saving and battery lifetime improvement achievable in ideal methodology where the future vehicle speeds are known.","[Vatanparvar, Korosh; Faezi, Sina; Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Burago, Igor; Levorato, Marco] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Vatanparvar, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kvatanpa@uci.edu; sfaezi@uci.edu; iburago@uci.edu; levorato@uci.edu; alfaruqu@uci.edu,,"Burago, Igor/0000-0002-3288-1004; Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah/0000-0002-5390-0497",National Science Foundation [ECCS 1611349],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant ECCS 1611349.

However, in his historical drama, Alexander Nevsky (1938), regardless of their marginal position and the scarcity of their appearances within a visual narrative of sequential shots, female characters guard and reaffirm the boundaries of the two ideological agendas: of the artist himself inspired by the revolutionary aptitudes of the modern art-form, and the authoritative office of the Soviet cinematography under Stalin. Women, in this Eisenstein production, happen to be makers of meaning who address both socialist realist (imposed on the artist) and Eisenstein's own, formalist aesthetics of intellektual'noe kino that was developed under the ideological climate of the Russian Revolution. This article uncovers how Sergei Eisenstein preserved his artistic autonomy and individuality in Stalin Prize-winning film Alexander Nevsky (1938) via the means of the avant-gardist device of plasmaticness. The study of Eisenstein's film, Alexander Nevsky, demonstrates that there is no give and take interaction between the spectator and the woman bodies represented on the screen, because formalist aesthetics is designed to work towards the functional dominance of art over people and their sentiments and desires.",,,,khokholova_n@auca.kg,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,1,EDIZIONI STORIA & LETTERATURA,ROME,"VIA DELLE FORNACI 24, ROME, 00165, ITALY",2036-6558,,,SGUARDO,Sguardo,,2017,25,,,,183,195,,10.5281/zenodo.1156985,http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1156985,,,13,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,FU6GM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000423949900013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change can expose new regions and subject others to a changing freeze-thaw frequency. Therefore, understanding and predicting the effect of freeze-thaw cycles is important in environmental science, the built environment and cultural heritage preservation. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of state-of-the-art micro-CT in studying the pore scale dynamics related to freezing and thawing. The experiments show the development of a fracture network in a porous limestone when cooling to -9.7 degrees C, at which an exothermal temperature peak is a proxy for ice crystallization. The dynamics of the fracture network are visualized with a time frame of 80 s. Theoretical assumptions predict that crystallization in these experiments occurs in pores of 6-20.1 nm under transient conditions. Here, the crystallization-induced stress exceeds rock strength when the local crystal fraction in the pores is 4.3%. The location of fractures is strongly related to preferential water uptake paths and rock texture, which are visually identified. Laboratory, continuous X-ray micro-CT scanning opens new perspectives for the pore-scale study of ice crystallization in porous media as well as for environmental processes related to freeze-thaw fracturing.","[De Kock, Tim; Boone, Marijn A.; Van Stappen, Jeroen; Derluyn, Hannelore; Cnudde, Veerle] Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, UGCT Dept Geol & Soil Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Boone, Marijn A.] Vlaamse Instelling Technol Onderzoek, Unit Sustainable Mat Management, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [De Schryver, Thomas; Masschaele, Bert] Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, UGCT Dept Phys & Astron, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Masschaele, Bert] Xray Engn BVBA XRE, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [De Schutter, Geert] Univ Ghent, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Struct Engn, Magnel Lab Concrete Res, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; VITO; Ghent University; Ghent University,"De Kock, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, UGCT Dept Geol & Soil Sci, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Tim.DeKock@UGent.be,"Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017; Cnudde, Veerle/K-2026-2016; Derluyn, Hannelore/M-3423-2017; De Kock, Tim/GOE-5013-2022","Cnudde, Veerle/0000-0002-3269-5914; Derluyn, Hannelore/0000-0002-1574-1456; De Kock, Tim/0000-0001-5096-1473; Van Stappen, Jeroen/0000-0003-2191-2888","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO); FWO [G.0041.15N]; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT, SBO) [120033]","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); FWO(FWO); Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT, SBO)","H.D. is a postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) and acknowledges its support.

Detecting penetrating objects (e.g., persons and cars) through dense foliage in various climate conditions using visual sensors is prone to high fault rates. Through-foliage scenarios contain an unprecedented amount of occlusion-in fact, they often contain fragmented occlusion (for example, looking through the branches of a tree). Current state-of-the-art detectors based on deep learning perform inadequately under moderate-to-heavy fragmented occlusion. The FOLDOUT project builds a system that combines various sensors and technologies to tackle this problem. Consequently, a hyperspectral sensor was investigated due to its extended spectral bandwidth, beyond the range of typical RGB sensors, where vegetation exhibits pronounced reflectance. Due to the poor performance of deep learning approaches in through-foliage scenarios, a novel background modeling-based detection approach was developed, dedicated to the characteristics of the hyperspectral sensor, namely strong correlations between adjacent spectral bands and high redundancy. The algorithm is based on local dimensional reduction, where the principal subspace of each pixel is maintained and adapted individually over time. The successful application of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in a through-foliage scenario comprised of heavy fragmented occlusion and a highly dynamical background, where state-of-the-art deep learning detectors perform poorly.","[Schreiber, David; Opitz, Andreas] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Schreiber, D (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",david.schreiber@ait.ac.at,,,European Union [787021],European Union(European Commission),This research was carried out in the scope of the FOLDOUT project: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 787021.,,29,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,OCT,2022,20,,,,,,7720,10.3390/s22207720,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22207720,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,5T4WD,36298071,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000875867900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, scientific understanding of rapid shortwave cloud adjustments is rather poor. State-of-the-art 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models showed large uncertainty in regard to rapid cloud adjustments. This study determines whether large-eddy simulations may, in principle, be used as a reference, thanks to their ability to resolve cloud dynamics and thermodynamics, to constrain rapid shortwave cloud adjustments in general circulation models. This is an open question since large-eddy models can only be run over limited domains, for a short period of time, and are influenced by boundary conditions. Using the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic global climate modelAtmospheric component (ICON-A), we examine shortwave rapid cloud adjustments over central Europe, which is found to be representative of shortwave rapid cloud adjustments over Northern Hemispheric global continents in the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models. This work finds (i) a couple of days of simulation is sufficient to get a clear signal in the net top-of-atmosphere radiative balance to emerge after a 4xCO(2) perturbation and (ii) use of present-day meteorological and CO2 concentrations for boundary conditions in global simulations is not an issue for short lead times, up to similar to 36hr. We also found that atmospheric processes influencing shortwave rapid cloud adjustments over central Europe are largely thermodynamically driven changes in local cloud dynamics and are rather independent of the synoptic-scale and circulation effects on short timescales (<2 days). These results imply that high-resolved large-eddy simulations over a limited area can be instructive for assessing and constraining global rapid cloud adjustments. Plain Language Summary Our work demonstrates that large-eddy simulations may, in principle, be used to constrain rapid adjustments in general circulation models despite the fact that large-eddy models can only be run on over limited area, run for a short period of time, and are influenced by boundary conditions.","[Nam, Christine; Kuehne, Philipp; Salzmann, Marc; Quaas, Johannes] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany; [Nam, Christine] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",Leipzig University; Max Planck Society,"Nam, C (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany.;Nam, C (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.",christine.nam@uni-leipzig.de,"Quaas, Johannes/I-2656-2013; Salzmann, Marc/N-2229-2014","Quaas, Johannes/0000-0001-7057-194X; Salzmann, Marc/0000-0002-3987-2303; Nam, Christine/0000-0001-9404-3412","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LK1210D, 01LK1218A, 01LK1213B]; German Research Foundation (DFG); Leipzig University",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Leipzig University,"This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the research program High-Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Climate Prediction (HD[CP]<SUP>2</SUP>; FKZ 01LK1210D, 01LK1218A, and 01LK1213B).

Earlier revisions of this significant climate record have been produced as flat, binary, gridded arrays with minimal or no file-level metadata and no machine-readable geolocation. Developed for many applications in polar regions, data were projected to polar azimuthal and global cylindrial projections that users found difficult to handle in standard mapping software packages. Funded by the NASA MEa-SUREs program, we are using state-of-the-art image reconstruction techniques to produce a Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Passive Microwave Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid 2.0 Brightness Temperature (CETB) Earth System Data Record (ESDR) that leverages the improved EASE-Grid 2.0 projection definitions and netCDF-CF metadata conventions to improve usability of the data products. We describe our approach to defining file-level metadata that is intelligible to standard software packages, including open source netCDF Operators (NCO) and Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (gdal), and the commercial ESRI ArcMap geospatial mapping tool.","[Brodzik, Mary J.; Hardman, Molly A.] Univ Colorado, CIRES, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, 449 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Long, David G.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Provo, UT 84602 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Brigham Young University,"Brodzik, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, CIRES, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, 449 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",brodzik@nsidc.org; molly.hardman@nsidc.org; long@ee.byu.edu,"Brodzik, Mary J/E-3191-2016","Brodzik, Mary J/0000-0002-2544-659X",NASA MEaSUREs; National Science Foundation [CNS-0821794]; University of Colorado Boulder,NASA MEaSUREs; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Colorado Boulder,"The authors would like to acknowledge Julia Collins at NSIDC for detailed traceability to CF and ACDD standards and initial work to define the CETB metadata template.

Agriculture analytics is a data intensive multidisciplinary problem. Big data analytics becomes a key technology to perform analysis of voluminous data. Irrigation water management is a challenging task for sustainable agriculture. It depends on various parameters related to climate, soil and weather conditions. For accurate estimation of requirement of water for a crop a strong modeling is required. This paper aims to review the application of big data based decision support system framework for sustainable water irrigation management using intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, analytics and decision support tools for agriculture irrigation water system. Moreover, water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using big data technologies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing application based on analytical modeling approach.

Solar energy, generated by enormous solar panel farms, is a rapidly developing environmentally friendly technology. However, its efficiency degrades due to some factors. The climate is one of the most impactful factors that affect the electricity generation of a photovoltaic cell-especially countries with snowy climates face those downside effects. Hence, detection and removal of the snow layer on the solar panels are crucial. Firstly, most of the snow detection approaches are based on time series or momentary sensor data. Secondly, the removal of snow is based on surface coatings, heating, and mechanical clearing. Nowadays, vision-based solutions for detecting and removal of snow are trending. Since eliminating the human factor is a priority in physical labor, drones are suitable for vision-based operations. This paper presents a new deep learning-based approach that can be deployed on drones for detecting snowy conditions on solar panels using deep learning-based algorithms. As they are state-of-the-art neural networks in computer vision applications, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and InceptionV3 have been selected. In order to increase generalization in the training phase, we augmented the dataset using different image manipulation techniques.

The goal of the JCSDA is to accelerate the use of observations from earth-orbiting satellites in operational numerical analysis and prediction models for the purpose of improving weather forecasts, improving seasonal to interannual climate forecasts, and increasing the accuracy of climate data sets. Advanced instruments of the current and planned satellite missions, do and will increasingly provide large volumes of data related to atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface state. These data will exhibit accuracies and spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions never before achieved. The JCSDA will ensure that the maximum benefit from investment in space is realised from the advanced global observing system. It will also help accelerate the use of satellite data from both operational and experimental spacecraft for weather and climate related activities. To this end the advancement of data assimilation science by JCSDA has included the establishment of the JCSDA Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and continual upgrades including, the incorporation of AIRS and snow and ice emissivity models for improving the use of microwave sounding data over high latitudes, preparation for use of METOP IASI/AMSU/HSB, DMSP SSMIS and CHAMP GPS data, real-time delivery of EOS-Aqua AMSR-E to NWP centers, and improved physically based SST analyses. Eighteen other research projects are also being supported by the JCSDA (e.g. use of cloudy radiances from advanced satellite instruments) to develop a state of-the-art satellite data assimilation system. The work undertaken by the JCSDA represents a key component of GEOSS. In particular data assimilation, data impact studies, OSSEs, THORPEX and network design studies are key activities of GEOSS.","NOAA, Joint Ctr Satellite Data Assimilat, Ctr Sci, Camp Springs, MD USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Le Marshall, J (corresponding author), NOAA, Joint Ctr Satellite Data Assimilat, Ctr Sci, Camp Springs, MD USA.",john.lemarshall@noaa.gov,"Weng, Fuzhong/F-5633-2010","Weng, Fuzhong/0000-0003-0150-2179",,,,,28,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,0-8194-5619-5,PROC SPIE,,,2005,,,,,144,153,,10.1117/12.578472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.578472,,,10,"Engineering, Aerospace; Instruments & Instrumentation; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BBT11,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000227664900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the scarcity of suitable data to adequately describe urban morphology is in many cases a significant obstacle to overcome. For this purpose, the World Urban Database Portal Tool (WUDAPT) framework was developed in order to obtain a standard classification of urban morphology, even in the absence of ad-hoc data for any city. In the present work, a modified WUDAPT method to define urban morphology is proposed and compared with two state-of-the-art methods, i.e. the standard WUDAPT method and a urban morphology parameters obtained from LIDAR data. In particular, here morphological features of Local Climate Zones (LCZs), resulting from a 30-m resolution WUDAPT classification, are interpolated to NWP cells, providing averaged features of the urban morphology. In this way, the method produces a unique value of the different urban morphology parameters for each model cell. This technique is tested by means of simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 500 m resolution for the city of Bologna (Italy), located in the Po Plain. Simulation output is compared with measurements from weather stations. Results show that simulations using the modified WUDAPT method reproduce better atmospheric dynamics with respect to those implementing the standard WUDAPT method, and are comparable with simulations using the urban morphology defined with LIDAR data, considered as reference. In particular, the most relevant improvements are found in areas where LCZs are more heterogeneous and where the boundary between rural and urban areas is not clearly defined. It follows that the use of this method improves the classic WUDAPT method for small and scattered cities with respect to large and clustered urban areas, and can be particularly useful for urban areas where detailed LIDAR data are not available.","[Zonato, A.; Zardi, D.; Giovanni, L.] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Atmospher Phys Grp, Trento, Italy; [Zonato, A.; Di Sabatino, S.] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy; [Martilli, A.] Ctr Energy Environm & Technol CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain","University of Trento; University of Bologna; Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas","Zonato, A (corresponding author), Via Mesiano 77, Trento 38123, Italy.",andrea.zonato@unitn.it,"Giovannini, Lorenzo/A-5468-2015; Zardi, Dino/J-3237-2012; Martilli, Alberto/AAC-5455-2022","Giovannini, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1650-0344; Zardi, Dino/0000-0002-3573-3920; ",,,,,37,22,23,8,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAR,2020,,,,,,,100584,10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100584,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100584,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,LJ9HY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000530472600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this review, the current state-of-art is analysed in terms of relationship between demographic, geographic, environmental factors, and habits with the gut microbiota pattern and the onset of epidemics of microbial, metabolic and immunological origin. The inter-nationally promoted initiative for the creation of metagenomic platforms contributing to studies of the gut microbiota pattern for the epidemiological monitoring and prevention of epidemic diseases associated with its alteration is fostered, as well as the design of rapid and economic methods to complement these studies.","[Martinez-Cabrera, Ileana] Empresa 3P Bio Pharmaceut, Navarra, Spain; [Gustavo Sierra-Gonzalez, Victoriano] BioCubaFarma, Grp Ind Biotecnol & Farmaceut Cuba, Havana, Cuba; [Maria Fajardo-Diaz, Esther] Biotecnol, Havana, Cuba",,"Martinez-Cabrera, I (corresponding author), Empresa 3P Bio Pharmaceut, Navarra, Spain.",ileanamart@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,0,0,1,1,FEDERACION BIOQUIMICA PROVINCIA BUENOS AIRES,"LA PLATA, BUENOS AIRES","CALLE 6, NO. 1344, 1900 LA PLATA, BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA",0325-2957,1851-6114,,ACTA BIOQUIM CLIN L,Acta Bioquim.

This was not only due to the problems of distance, but was exacerbated by several political and organizational issues. An important lesson is that successful 'cooperative buildings' will depend not just on the technology but also on an appropriate managerial, organizational and political climate in which these resources can be meaningfully exploited.

Consequently, more and more state-of-the-art solutions are being proposed for the electricity generation and the optimization of the energy system management, taking advantage of innovations in all energy related sectors. The evaluation of all available solutions requires quantitative assessment, through the adoption of representative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the projects that are related to smart grid development in isolated energy systems, providing the relevant stakeholders with a useful comparison among the proposed solutions. The evaluation approach that is described in this paper emphasizes the role of the various stakeholder groups who face the proposed solutions by different points of view. Apart from the domains of interest that are also observed in previous approaches, the proposed list also contains a set of legal KPIs, since the regulatory framework can either represent a serious barrier or grant a strong incentive for the implementation of state-of-the-art energy technology and grid management solutions in different countries.","[Pramangioulis, Dionysios; Atsonios, Konstantinos; Nikolopoulos, Nikos; Rakopoulos, Dimitrios; Grammelis, Panagiotis] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Chem Proc & Energy Resources Inst, GR-57001 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Kakaras, Emmanuel] Natl Tech Univ Greece, Lab Steam Boilers & Thermal Plants, GR-15780 Athens, Greece",Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; National Technical University of Athens,"Rakopoulos, D (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Chem Proc & Energy Resources Inst, GR-57001 Thessaloniki, Greece.",pramaggioulis@certh.gr; atsonios@certh.gr; n.nikolopoulos@certh.gr; rakopoulos@certh.gr; grammelis@certh.gr; ekak@central.ntua.gr,"Grammelis, Panagiotis/H-6426-2017; Kakaras, Emmanuel/AAM-2437-2020; Atsonios, Konstantinos/AAU-2678-2020; Rakopoulos, Dimitrios/AAA-8173-2019; Nikolaos, Nikolopoulos/Y-7867-2019; Nikolopoulos, Nikos/K-7286-2012","Grammelis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-8569-910X; Nikolopoulos, Nikos/0000-0002-5550-456X; Atsonios, Konstantinos/0000-0002-5549-2650; Pramangioulis, Dionysis/0000-0003-0167-2880; Rakopoulos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-4948-4862",Horizon 2020 [731249],Horizon 2020,"This research was funded by Horizon 2020, grant number 731249.

Subsequently, we apply this methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines including cases in neurobiology, finance and climate science.

The first opportunity to detect indications for life outside of the Solar System may be provided already within the next decade with upcoming missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) mission, searching for atmospheric biosignatures on planets in the habitable zone of cool K- and M-stars. Nevertheless, their harsh stellar radiation and particle environment could lead to photochemical loss of atmospheric biosignatures. Aims. We aim to study the influence of cosmic rays on exoplanetary atmospheric biosignatures and the radiation environment considering feedbacks between energetic particle precipitation, climate, atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and secondary particle generation. Methods. We describe newly combined state-of-the-art modeling tools to study the impact of the radiation and particle environment, in particular of cosmic rays, on atmospheric particle interaction, atmospheric chemistry, and the climate-chemistry coupling in a self-consistent model suite. To this end, models like the Atmospheric Radiation Interaction Simulator (AtRIS), the Exoplanetary Terrestrial Ion Chemistry model (ExoTIC), and the updated coupled climate-chemistry model are combined. Results. In addition to comparing our results to Earth-bound measurements, we investigate the ozone production and-loss cycles as well as the atmospheric radiation dose profiles during quiescent solar periods and during the strong solar energetic particle event of February 23, 1956. Further, the scenario-dependent terrestrial transit spectra, as seen by the NIR-Spec infrared spectrometer onboard the JWST, are modeled. Amongst others, we find that the comparatively weak solar event drastically increases the spectral signal of HNO3, while significantly suppressing the spectral feature of ozone. Because of the slow recovery after such events, the latter indicates that ozone might not be a good biomarker for planets orbiting stars with high flaring rates.","[Herbst, Konstantin; Heber, Bernd; Banjac, Sasa] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel CAU, Inst Expt & Angew Phys, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Grenfell, John Lee; Rauer, Heike; Gebauer, Stefanie] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Planetenforsch PF, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Sinnhuber, Miriam; Schmidt, Vanessa] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Scheucher, Markus] TUB, Zentrum Astron & Astrophys, Hardenbergstr 36, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Lehmann, Ralph] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Telegrafenberg A45, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Schreier, Franz] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Method Fernerkundung, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR)","Herbst, K (corresponding author), Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel CAU, Inst Expt & Angew Phys, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",herbst@physik.uni-kiel.de,"Herbst, Konstantin/AAH-6772-2021","Herbst, Konstantin/0000-0001-5622-4829; Schreier, Franz/0000-0001-7196-6599; Heber, Bernd/0000-0003-0960-5658",German Research Foundation (DFG) [282759267]; Influence of Cosmic Rays on Exoplanetary Atmospheric Biosignatures [282759267]; International Space Science Institute; DFG project [SCHR1125/3-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Influence of Cosmic Rays on Exoplanetary Atmospheric Biosignatures; International Space Science Institute; DFG project(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the German Research Foundation (DFG) for financial support via the project The Influence of Cosmic Rays on Exoplanetary Atmospheric Biosignatures (Project number 282759267).

This study updates and extends the several previous works undertaken to analyse tide-gauge records and satellite altimetry around South Korea using enhanced time-series analysis techniques to detect coastal vertical land motion and current rates of rise and accelerations in mean sea level to augment planning, design, and risk management activities. Although the longest tide-gauge records available only date back to 1960, every effort has been made to separate the mean sea-level trend from the more dynamic influences with improved precision using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The analysis identified general trends of subsidence observed around the margins bounded by the East China Sea and East Sea (Sea of Japan) below 36 degrees N, whereas uplift was a more prevalent feature along the margins bounded by the Yellow Sea. All tide-gauge records longer than 50 years exhibited 'relative' mean sea-level rise increasing marginally over the length of the record, suggesting the presence of an acceleration; however, the estimated time-varying accelerations (albeit predominantly positive) are small and not statistically different from zero (95% confidence interval). Although the average trend of sea-surface height from satellite altimetry across this region was 3.2 mm/y, key spatial variations were evident, with the highest rates of rise centred in two discrete areas east and west of South Korea around 37.5 degrees N, each exceeding 8 mm/y.","[Watson, Phil J.] CERF, Coconut Creek, FL 33073 USA",,"Watson, PJ (corresponding author), CERF, Coconut Creek, FL 33073 USA.",philwatson.slr@gmail.com,,"Watson, Phil J/0000-0002-6008-7465",,,,,48,8,8,0,10,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

The unique aspect of this study is that it became possible to use the forecast results from as many as 16 state of the art coupled atmosphere-ocean models. A downscaling component, with respect to observed rainfall estimates uses data sets from TRMM and a dense rain gauge distriburion; this enables the forecasts of each model to be bias corrected to a common 25 km resolution. The downscaling statistics for each model, at each grid location is developed during a training phase of the model forecasts; the forecasts from all of the member models use the downscaling coefficients of the training phase. These forecasts are next used for the construction of a multimodel superensemble. A major result of this paper is on the climatology of the model rainfall. From the downscaled multimodel superensemble which shows a correlation of nearly 1.0 with respect to the observed climatology. This high skill is important for addressing the rainfall anomaly forecasts, which are defined in terms of departures from the observed (rather than a model based) climatology. The second part of this study addresses seasonal climate forecasts of Asian monsoon precipitation anomalies. Seasonal climate forecasts over the larger monsoon Asia domain and over the regional belts are evaluated. The superensemble forecasts invariably carry the highest skill compared to the member models globally and regionally. This relates largely to the presence of large systematic errors in models that carry low seasonal prediction skills. Such models carry persistent signatures of systematic errors, and their errors are recognized by the multimodel superensemble. One of the conclusions of this study is that given the uncertainties in current modeling for seasonal rainfall forecasts, post processing of multimodel forecasts, using the superensemble methodology, seems to provide the most promising results for the rainfall anomaly forecasts.","[Krishnamurti, T.

Current state-of-the-art technology to restore these functions is through the isolation, screening, formulation and application of microbial inoculants and synthetic consortia. These approaches have inconsistent success, in part due to the incompatibility between the biofertilizer, crop, climate, existing soil microbiome and physicochemical characteristics of the soils. Here, we review the current state of the art in biofertilization and identify two key deficiencies in current strategies: the difficulty in designing complex multispecies biofertilizers and the bottleneck in scaling the production of complex multispecies biofertilizers. To address the challenge of producing scalable, multispecies biofertilizers, we propose to merge ecological theory with bioprocess engineering to produce 'self-assembled communities' enriched for particular functional guilds and adapted to a target soil and host plant. Using the nitrogen problem as an anchor, we review relevant ecology (microbial, plant and environmental), as well as reactor design strategies and operational parameters for the production of functionally enriched self-assembled communities. The use of self-assembled communities for biofertilization addresses two major hurdles in microbiome engineering: the importance of enriching microbes indigenous to (and targeted for) a specific environment and the recognized potential benefits of microbial consortia over isolates (e.g. functional redundancy). The proposed community enrichment model could also be instrumental for other microbial functions such as phosphorus solubilization, plant growth promotion or disease suppression.","[Fernando Gutierrez, Carlos; Sanabria, Janeth] Univ Valle, Engn Fac, Engn Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Environm Microbiol & Biotechnol Lab, Cali 760032, Colombia; [Raaijmakers, Jos M.; Oyserman, Ben O.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Microbial Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Raaijmakers, Jos M.] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Oyserman, Ben O.] Wageningen Univ, Bioinformat Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Universidad del Valle; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Wageningen University & Research,"Oyserman, BO (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Microbial Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",BenOyserman@gmail.com,"Raaijmakers, Jos M/D-1574-2014","Raaijmakers, Jos M/0000-0003-1608-6614; Gutierrez, Carlos F./0000-0002-1542-1751",Dutch Technology Foundation of the Dutch National Science Foundation - COLCIENCIAS; Universidad del Valle Convocatoria Interna para Apoyo a la Movilidad,Dutch Technology Foundation of the Dutch National Science Foundation - COLCIENCIAS; Universidad del Valle Convocatoria Interna para Apoyo a la Movilidad,The contributions of BOO and JMR were funded in part by the Dutch Technology Foundation of the Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO-Toegepaste en Technische Wetenschappen).

These applications use data from many satellites; for the data to be interoperable, the instruments must be cross-calibrated. To meet the stringent needs of such applications, instruments must provide reliable, accurate, and consistent measurements over time. Robust techniques are required to ensure that observations from different instruments can be normalized to a common scale that the community agrees on. The long-term reliability of this process needs to be sustained in accordance with established reference standards and best practices. Furthermore, establishing physical meaning to the information through robust Systeme International d'unites traceable calibration and validation (Cal/Val) is essential to fully understand the parameters under observation. The processes of calibration, correction, stability monitoring, and quality assurance need to be underpinned and evidenced by comparison with peer instruments and, ideally, highly calibrated in-orbit reference instruments. Intercalibration between instruments is a central pillar of the Cal/Val strategies of many national and international satellite remote sensing organizations. Intercalibration techniques as outlined in this paper not only provide a practical means of identifying and correcting relative biases in radiometric calibration between instruments but also enable potential data gaps between measurement records in a critical time series to be bridged. Use of a robust set of internationally agreed upon and coordinated inter-calibration techniques will lead to significant improvement in the consistency between satellite instruments and facilitate accurate monitoring of the Earth's climate at uncertainty levels needed to detect and attribute the mechanisms of change. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of postlaunch radiometric calibration of remote sensing satellite instruments through intercalibration.","[Chander, Gyanesh] US Geol Survey, SGT Inc, Earth Resources Observat & Sci Ctr, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA; [Hewison, Tim J.] European Org Exploitat Meteorol Satellites, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany; [Fox, Nigel] Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England; [Wu, Xiangqian] NOAA, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA; [Xiong, Xiaoxiong] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Blackwell, William J.] MIT, Lexington, MA 02420 USA","Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies, Inc.

Two literature-based emission rates for fungal spores derived from fungal spore colony counts and chemical tracer measurements were used as a parameterization baseline for this study. A third, new emission parameterization for fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAP) was adapted to field measurements from four locations across Europe. FBAP concentrations can be regarded as a lower estimate of total PBAP concentrations. Size distributions of FBAP often show a distinct mode at approx. 3 mu m, corresponding to a diameter range characteristic for many fungal spores. Previous studies for several locations have suggested that FBAP are in many cases dominated by fungal spores. Thus, we suggest that simulated FBAP and fungal spore concentrations obtained from the three different emission parameterizations can be compared to FBAP measurements. The comparison reveals that simulated fungal spore concentrations based on literature emission parameterizations are lower than measured FBAP concentrations. In agreement with the measurements, the model results show a diurnal cycle in simulated fungal spore concentrations, which may develop partially as a consequence of a varying boundary layer height between day and night. Temperature and specific humidity, together with leaf area index (LAI), were chosen to drive the new emission parameterization which is fitted to the FBAP observations. The new parameterization results in similar root mean square errors (RMSEs) and correlation coefficients compared to the FBAP observations as the previously existing fungal spore emission parameterizations, with some improvements in the bias. Using the new emission parameterization on a model domain covering western Europe, FBAP in the lowest model layer comprise a fraction of 15% of the total aerosol mass over land and reach average number concentrations of 26 L-1. The results confirm that fungal spores and biological particles may account for a major fraction of supermicron aerosol particle number and mass concentration over vegetated continental regions and should thus be explicitly considered in air quality and climate studies.","[Hummel, M.; Hoose, C.; Schnaiter, M.; Toprak, E.; Vogel, H.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Gallagher, M.] Univ Manchester, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Healy, D.

However, safety and efficiency are the general challenges of ocean operations. Increased automation is believed to solve these problems. This paper discusses the impact of automation on safety and efficiency. A literature review of 'Human factors' mainly from the aviation and maritime industries is presented to untangle the human-machine relationship characteristics when increased automation is introduced to operators. A literature review of Hydrodynamics, Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) technologies is presented to introduce the state-of-art and associated limitations. It is concluded that, if the industry's drive is safety and efficiency, then full-autonomy is, at present, not the way to go. Remote control, instead, could facilitate a feasible future, while focused research and development are in need.","[Zghyer, R.; Ostnes, R.; Halse, K.

The mathematical structure of those formulae implies several difficulties when trying to study the numerical properties of coupling algorithms used for practical applications. This article introduces a methodology for building physically realistic approximations of existing bulk formulae which would also satisfy suitable mathematical properties (explicit character, regularity, differentiability). This is achieved by applying the Sobol' method to compute sensitivity indices in order to reduce the number of inputs and derive a simple metamodel for the parametrization of turbulent air-sea fluxes. Numerical results show excellent agreement between our approximations and the standard bulk formulae. In particular, single-column simulations using the TOGA-COARE experiment within the LMDZ atmospheric model show negligible changes in numerical results.","[Pelletier, C.; Lemarie, F.; Blayo, E.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRIA, Grenoble INP, CNRS,LJK, Grenoble, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Inria,"Pelletier, C (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, LJK Batiment IMAG,CS 40700, F-38058 Grenoble 9, France.",charles.pelletier@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"Blayo, Eric/AAG-7447-2019","Pelletier, Charles/0000-0003-2177-2694; Lemarie, Florian/0000-0002-6341-402X; Blayo, Eric/0000-0002-8742-5655",French national research agency (ANR) [ANR-16-CE01-0007]; Mercator-Ocean through PPR SIMBAD project; Mercator-Ocean through CMEMS ALBATROS project,French national research agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Mercator-Ocean through PPR SIMBAD project; Mercator-Ocean through CMEMS ALBATROS project,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable input, which has considerably helped improve this paper.

In fact, the installation site also affects the PV panel degradation rate, and thus the long-term power production. Prior-art lifetime analysis in PV inverters has not yet investigated the impact of panel degradation. This paper thus evaluates the lifetime of PV inverters considering panel degradation rates and installation sites. Evaluations have been carried out on PV systems installed in Denmark and Arizona. The results reveal that the PV panel degradation rate has a considerable impact on the PV inverter lifetime, especially in the hot climate (e.g., Arizona), where the panel degrades at a faster rate. In that case, the PV inverter lifetime estimation can be deviated by 54 %, if the impact of PV panel degradation is not taken into account.","[Sangwongwanich, Ariya; Yang, Yongheng; Sera, Dezso; Blaabjerg, Frede] Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Pontoppidanstr 101, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Sangwongwanich, A (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Pontoppidanstr 101, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.",ars@et.aau.dk; yoy@et.aau.dk; des@et.aau.dk; fbl@et.aau.dk,"Yang, Yongheng/N-7735-2015; Sangwongwanich, Ariya/V-9577-2019; Sera, Dezso/P-6785-2019","Yang, Yongheng/0000-0002-1488-4762; Sangwongwanich, Ariya/0000-0002-2587-0024; Sera, Dezso/0000-0001-9050-2423","European Commission [PV2.3 - PV2GRID]; Energinet.dk (ForskEL, Denmark) [2015-1-12359]; Research Promotion Foundation (RPF, Cyprus) [KOINA/SOLAR-ERA.NET/0114/02]","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Energinet.dk (ForskEL, Denmark); Research Promotion Foundation (RPF, Cyprus)","This work was supported in part by the European Commission within the European Unions Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) through the SOLAR-ERA.NET Transnational Project (PV2.3 - PV2GRID), by Energinet.dk (ForskEL, Denmark, Project No. 2015-1-12359), and in part by the Research Promotion Foundation (RPF, Cyprus, Project No. KOINA/SOLAR-ERA.NET/0114/02).",,37,6,6,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1048-2334,,978-1-5090-5366-7,APPL POWER ELECT CO,,,2017,,,,,2845,2852,,,,,,8,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BH8ED,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000403242802147,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many physical processes come into play in the stable boundary layer (SBL), i.e., turbulence, radiation, land surface coupling and heterogeneity, orographic turbulent and gravity wave drag (GWD). The development of robust stable boundary-layer parameterizations for weather and climate models is difficult because of the multiplicity of processes and their complex interactions. As a result, these models suffer from biases in key variables, such as the 2-m temperature, boundary-layer depth and wind speed. This short paper briefly summarizes the state-of-the-art of SBL research, and highlights physical processes that received only limited attention so far, in particular orographically-induced GWD, longwave radiation divergence, and the land-atmosphere coupling over a snow-covered surface. Finally, a conceptual framework with relevant processes and particularly their interactions is proposed.","[Steeneveld, Gert-Jan] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Sect, Droevendaalsesteeg 3,POB 47, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Steeneveld, GJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Sect, Droevendaalsesteeg 3,POB 47, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",gert-jan.steeneveld@wur.nl,"Steeneveld, Gert-Jan/B-2816-2010","Steeneveld, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-5922-8179",NWO VENI [863.10.010],NWO VENI(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The author acknowledges NWO VENI grant Lifting the fog (contract number 863.10.010), and all co-workers who contributed to this mini-review, i.e., Bert Holtslag, Liduin Burgering, Michal Kleczek, Marina Sterk, Bert Heusinkveld, Christine Groot Zwaaftink, Marcel Wokke, Sander Pijlman (Wageningen University), Bas van de Wiel (TU Eindhoven), Richard Bintanja (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute), Carmen Nappo (CJN Research Meteorology).",,56,34,34,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

In the context of climate change, a major application of the results has been in the modelling of primary production and the ocean carbon cycle. It is now recognised that a partition of the marine autotrophic pool into a suite of phytoplankton functional types, each type having a characteristic role in the biogeochemical cycle of the ocean, would increase our understanding of the role of phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle.

The occurrence of Ultisols alongside acidic Alfisols and Mollisols in both zeolitic and non-zeolitic parent materials in humid tropical (HT) climatic environments, indicates that the soil diversity in India is large. These soils are not confined to a single production system and generally maintain a positive organic carbon (OC) balance without adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This review presents a synthesis of literature on the recent developments on the pedology of RF soils, including their physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical and micro-morphological properties, and their degradation status. It also addresses the changes in soil properties in semi-arid tropical (SAT) areas, created by climate shift during the Holocene. This knowledge contributed to our understanding as to how the parent material composition influences the formation of Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols in weathering environments of HT climate; and also as to how the relict Alfisols of SAT areas are polygenetic. The state-of-the-art information developed through the extensive work on such soils has helped establish an organic link between pedogenetic processes and bulk soil properties, and has provided an insight of many pedological and edaphological issues related to Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols mainly of HT climate. The synthesis has helped us to understand as to why the formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway in tropical environment of India and elsewhere in the world. There is a strong need to modify the mineralogy class of highly weathered RF soils. We hope this review will help to dispel some of the myths on the formation of tropical soils and their low fertility by putting in context their characteristics and capacity to be productive.

Many discussions on pots-Kyoto GHG emission reduction strategies and energy options have raised the increasing role of nuclear power in enhancing energy security and mitigating climate change together with concerns over disposal of nuclear waste. In addition the increasing interest in carbon capture and the geological storage of CO2 has brought up a range of questions as well. Lithuania is currently dealing with two major problems in energy sector: final closure of Ignalina Nuclear Power plant (Ignalina NPP) in the end of 2009 and nuclear waste disposal and climate change mitigation issues because of the replacement of nuclear capacities with fossil one and anticipated increase in GHG emissions. Lithuania has two main options in energy sector: to construct new nuclear power plant also taking into account nuclear waste disposal problems or to burn imported fossil fuel and to apply carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for GHG emission reduction. These two main options should be carefully investigated in Lithuania based on various studies conducted in Lithuania and other countries dealing with geological carbon storage and nuclear waste disposal potentials. There are no long-lived nuclear waste geological storage capacities in Lithuania and there is no pilot projects on CCS developed in Lithuania; therefore, there are no experience in this field. The aim of the article is to review the state-of-the-art in geological CO2 and nuclear waste storage fields focusing on the assessment of comparative similarities and differences of the geological disposal of CO2 and nuclear waste and to perform comparison of these technologies possible application in Lithuania.","[Streimikiene, Dalia; Mikalauskiene, Asta; Pusinaite, Rasa] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Streimikiene, D (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines G 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt; astam@mail.lei.lt; rasapusinaite@yahoo.com,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,20,2,2,0,8,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

While other sources of PM have been regulated intensively during the past decades, RWC has been subject to only minor regulation despite of its impact on climate and health. This review covers recent research publications on RWC contributions to ambient PM in different regions of Europe, North America and Australasia, and on key species associated with RWC. Furthermore, factors governing emissions from wood stoves (as the typical appliance used in residential heating) are evaluated. State-of-the-art methods for estimating RWC as a source of ambient PM are discussed.

Considering that the individual models have various biases in rainfall amount simulation, instead of applying a fixed rainfall criterion as used in observation, we use model-dependent rainfall criteria to identify the simulated ASM onset, retreat, and duration. This model-dependent criterion is defined as the height in cumulative distribution function (CDF) of simulated precipitation that the observed criterion occurs. Based on this method, the multi-model ensembles (MMEs) of CMIP3 and CMIP5 both show a delayed monsoon onset but an earlier retreat relative to the observations, indicating that models tend to underestimate the monsoon period. The MME results show a skill in capturing the ASM domain which features monsoon rainfall characteristics, whereas a large spread is found among individual models. Overall, the state-of-the-art CMIP5 models show slightly improvements from the CMIP3 models in the simulations of ASM domain and evolutions. Models with a hybrid method based on bulk mass flux and CAPE closure schemes perform better than models with other types of convection parameterization.","[Tung, Yu-Shiang; Chen, Cheng-Ta] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei 11677, Taiwan; [Hsu, Pang-Chi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Pang-Chi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",National Taiwan Normal University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Chen, CT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 88,Sec 4,Tingzhou Rd, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.",chen@rain.geos.ntnu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council (NSC) program [NSC 100-2119-M-003-005-MY5]; NSFC [41375100]; Research Project of Chinese Ministry of Education [213014A],"National Science Council (NSC) program; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Project of Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China)","Comments from anonymous reviewers are much appreciated.

We propose an approach for automatically estimating layer boundaries by viewing this task as a probabilistic inference problem. Our solution uses Markov-Chain Monte Carlo to sample from the joint distribution over all possible layers conditioned on an image. Layer boundaries can then be estimated from the expectation over this distribution, and confidence intervals can be estimated from the variance of the samples. We evaluate the method on 560 echograms collected in Antarctica, and compare to a state-of-the-art technique with respect to hand-labeled images. These experiments show an approximately 50% reduction in error for tracing both bedrock and surface layers.","[Lee, Stefan; Mitchell, Jerome; Crandall, David J.; Fox, Geoffrey C.] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat & Comp, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat & Comp, Bloomington, IN USA.",,,,,,,,15,16,16,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1522-4880,,978-1-4799-5751-4,IEEE IMAGE PROC,,,2014,,,,,111,115,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BE2TU,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000370063600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study the technique is extended to a multimodel reforecast dataset consisting of forecasts from ECMWF and NCEP global models. Even though the ECMWF model is more advanced than the version of the NCEP model used ( it has more than double the horizontal resolution and is about five years newer), the forecasts produced by the multimodel MOS technique are more skillful than those produced by the MOS technique applied to either the NCEP or ECMWF forecasts alone. These results demonstrate that the MOS reforecast approach yields benefits for week-2 forecasts that are just as large for high-resolution state-of-the-art models as they are for relatively low resolution out-of-date models. Furthermore, operational forecast centers can benefit by sharing both retrospective reforecast datasets and real-time forecasts.","NOAA, CIRES, Climate Diagnost Ctr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; ECMWF, Seasonal Forecasting Grp, Reading, Berks, England",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Whitaker, JS (corresponding author), NOAA, CIRES, Climate Diagnost Ctr, 325 Broadway,R-CDC1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",jeffrey.s.whitaker@noaa.gov,,,,,,,14,27,28,0,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Applied modelling of crop diseases and pests has mostly targeted the development of support capabilities to schedule scouting or pesticide applications. There is a need for research to both broaden the scope and evaluate the capabilities of pest and disease models. Key research questions not only involve the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on known pathosystems, but also on new pathogens which could alter the (still incompletely documented) impacts of pests and diseases on agricultural systems. Yield loss data collected in various current environments may no longer represent a adequate reference to develop tactical, decision-oriented, models for plant diseases and pests and their impacts, because of the ongoing changes in climate patterns. Process-based agricultural simulation modelling, on the other hand, appears to represent a viable methodology to estimate the impacts of these potential effects. A new generation of tools based on state-of-the-art knowledge and technologies is needed to allow systems analysis including key processes and their dynamics over appropriate suitable range of environmental variables. This paper offers a brief overview of the current state of development in coupling pest and disease models to crop models, and discusses technical and scientific challenges. We propose a five-stage roadmap to improve the simulation of the impacts caused by plant diseases and pests; i) improve the quality and availability of data for model inputs; ii) improve the quality and availability of data for model evaluation; iii) improve the integration with crop models; iv) improve the processes for model evaluation; and v) develop a community of plant pest and disease modelers.

A multitude of human impacts, including climate change, affect the different compartments of the environment, and these effects interact with each other. As part of the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports (BEAR), we present an inventory and discussion of different human-induced factors and processes affecting the environment of the Baltic Sea region, and their interrelations. Some are naturally occurring and modified by human activities (i.e. climate change, coastal processes, hypoxia, acidification, submarine groundwater discharges, marine ecosystems, non-indigenous species, land use and land cover), some are completely human-induced (i.e. agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, river regulations, offshore wind farms, shipping, chemical contamination, dumped warfare agents, marine litter and microplastics, tourism, and coastal management), and they are all interrelated to different degrees. We present a general description and analysis of the state of knowledge on these interrelations. Our main insight is that climate change has an overarching, integrating impact on all of the other factors and can be interpreted as a background effect, which has different implications for the other factors. Impacts on the environment and the human sphere can be roughly allocated to anthropogenic drivers such as food production, energy production, transport, industry and economy. The findings from this inventory of available information and analysis of the different factors and their interactions in the Baltic Sea region can largely be transferred to other comparable marginal and coastal seas in the world.","[Reckermann, Marcus] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Int Balt Earth Secretariat, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Omstedt, Anders] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Box 461, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Soomere, Tarmo] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Dept Cybernet, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Soomere, Tarmo] Estonian Acad Sci, Kohtu 6, EE-10130 Tallinn, Estonia; [Aigars, Juris] Latvian Inst Aquat Ecol, Voleru Iela 4, LV-1007 Riga, Latvia; [Akhtar, Naveed; Zorita, Eduardo] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Inst Coastal Syst Anal & Modeling, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Beldowska, Magdalena] Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Pilsudskiego 46, PL-81378 Gdynia, Poland; [Beldowski, Jacek; Kulinski, Karol; Szymczycha, Beata] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Marine Chem & Biochem Dept, Powstancow Warszawy 55, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland; [Cronin, Tom; Pons-Seres de Brauwer, Cristian] DTU Wind Energy Dept, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Czub, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Marine Ecol Dept, Inst Oceanol, Powstancow Warszawy 55, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland; [Eero, Margit] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Bldg 201, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Hyytiainen, Kari Petri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1, Helsinki 00560, Finland; [Kiessling, Anders] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Nutr & Management Aquaculture, Box 7024, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Kjellstrom, Erik] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [McCrackin, Michelle; Undeman, Emma] Stockholm Univ, Balt Nest Inst, Balt Sea Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Meier, H.

The application of time-dependent and state-dependent nonlinear unit root tests separately provides mixed evidence regarding the time-series properties of CO2 emissions and a high degree of variability across the different tests. However, the use of hybrid nonlinear unit root tests, combining the presence of structural breaks with symmetric or asymmetric ESTAR adjustment, leads to the rejection of the unit root hypothesis in each of the countries under study with at least one of the hybrid tests.

Several state-of-the-art coupled models sharing either the same atmosphere or the same ocean are compared. Major results include 1) the dominant role of the atmosphere model in setting El Nino characteristics ( periodicity and base amplitude) and errors (regularity) and 2) the considerable improvement of simulated El Nino power spectra - toward lower frequency - when the atmosphere resolution is significantly increased.

Here we analyze how the main external drivers of ET (incident solar radiation and precipitation) vary regionally, using recent data from a eddy-covariance flux tower network (FLUXNET) and a multi-model re-analysis (GSWP-2). Trends in radiation (global dimming'' and brightening'') are expected to impact ET only in regions where ET correlates with radiation. In central Europe this correlation is particularly strong, and trends derived from weighing lysimeters and river-basin water budgets follow trends in radiation. In central North America the correlation is weak, and trends in precipitation rather than radiation explain trends in ET. Our results reconcile previous hypotheses by demonstrating the strongly regional and temporal differentiation of trends in evaporation. Citation: Teuling, A. J., et al.

The retrieval capabilities and uncertainties of the combined radar and microwave radiometers are quantified. We show that this combined active and passive remote sensing approach with SmallSat technologies addresses a gap in the current state-of-the-art remote sensing measurements of ice cloud properties, especially deriving vertical profiles of ice cloud particle sizes in the atmosphere together with the ambient thermodynamic conditions.

In response to wicked problems, environmental scientists are starting to welcome the participation of social scientists, humanists, and the creative arts. We argue that the need for interdisciplinary approaches to wicked problems opens up a number of tasks that environmental philosophers have every right to undertake. The first task is for philosophers to explore new and promising ways of initiating philosophical research through conducting collaborative learning processes on environmental issues. The second task is for philosophers to recognize the value of philosophical skills in their engagements with members of other disciplines and walks of life in addressing wicked problems. The wicked problems framework should be seen as an important guide for facilitating philosophical research that is of relevance to problems like climate change and sustainable agriculture.","[Thompson, Paul B.; Whyte, Kyle Powys] Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Whyte, KP (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, 503 S Kedzie Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kwhyte@msu.edu,,"Thompson, Paul/0000-0003-0555-9914",,,,,45,15,15,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1187-7863,1573-322X,,J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC,J.

While Europe has suffered from drought events in the last decade unlike ever seen since the beginning of weather recordings, harmonized long-term datasets across the continent are needed to monitor change and support predictions. Here we present soil moisture data from 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) in Europe (COSMOS-Europe for short) covering recent drought events. The CRNS sites are distributed across Europe and cover all major land use types and climate zones in Europe. The raw neutron count data from the CRNS stations were provided by 24 research institutions and processed using state-of-the-art methods. The harmonized processing included correction of the raw neutron counts and a harmonized methodology for the conversion into soil moisture based on available in situ information. In addition, the uncertainty estimate is provided with the dataset, information that is particularly useful for remote sensing and modeling applications. This paper presents the current spatiotemporal coverage of CRNS stations in Europe and describes the protocols for data processing from raw measurements to consistent soil moisture products. The data of the presented COSMOS-Europe network open up a manifold of potential applications for environmental research, such as remote sensing data validation, trend analysis, or model assimilation The dataset could be of particular importance for the analysis of extreme climatic events at the continental scale. Due its timely relevance in the scope of climate change in the recent years, we demonstrate this potential application with a brief analysis on the spatiotemporal soil moisture variability.

A detailed insight into the reaction mechanism of the CO2 absorption was obtained through state-of-the-art theoretical methods.

Climate change is a contemporary instantiation of the perpetual sense of crisis that characterises the human condition, and concepts such as sustainability and resilience serve as regulative ideals (cf. beauty, perfection, and truth) in the fight against ubiquitous unsustainability. Unsustainability is an aspect of time, and is thus, in Kantian terms, a fundamental schema underlying the categories of human understanding. Current growth will decay, therefore only as yet unforeseen adaptation and innovation can give humanity more time to encounter the next set of crises. On this account, the arts and humanities operate as a collective memento mori, reminding us of our fragility and fallibility. Only thus reminded can we act with the greatest possible care in the world, but this can never ensure sustainable development', which remains an inherently paradoxical policy slogan.","Univ Bath, Dept Educ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Stables, A (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Educ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",a.w.g.stables@bath.ac.uk,,"Stables, Andrew/0000-0002-6755-1806",,,,,11,16,16,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4622,,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

The spatial organization developed by an ethnic group within its environment reflects the dual relationship that it holds between itself as dwelling-place (inhabitation) and its place in nature (habitat). The range of potential solutions appears vast, yet limited, since the same range of variability observed in the past is comparable to what can be observed today across space. Such adaptive modes, in response to internal and external constraints, appear to have been completely mastered from the earliest periods, as if they were proper to humanity as a whole: they reflect functional mechanism.

We estimate the oceanic component from two state-of-the-art ocean models.

She is concerned with writing the intellectual history of a specifically Latin American tradition while also connecting it to broader global concerns, such as climate change. Svampa is interested in blurring the lines between academic and artistic work, with poetry, music, and the visual arts valued as forms of knowledge that incorporate both sensual and intellectual elements, capable of reflecting new challenges while creating spaces for change.","[Sequeira, Jessica] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Sequeira, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-9325,1469-9575,,J LAT AM CULT STUD,J.

Currently, AOD can be measured by (i) satellite instruments, which operate on a global scale but have limited accuracies; and (ii) ground-based instruments, which are more accurate but not widely available. Recent approaches focus on integrating measurements from these two sources to complement each other. In this paper, we further improve the prediction accuracy by using the observation that the AOD varies slowly in the spatial domain. Using a probabilistic approach, we impose this smoothness constraint by a Gaussian random field on the Earth's surface, which can be considered as a two-dimensional manifold. The proposed integration approach is computationally simple, and experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.","[Zheng, Shuai; Kwok, James T.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Zheng, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",szhengac@cse.ust.hk; jamesk@cse.ust.hk,"Zheng, Shuai/AAY-5781-2021","Zheng, Shuai/0000-0001-6719-2287",Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),This research was supported in part by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,,24,0,0,0,0,ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PALO ALTO,"2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA",2159-5399,2374-3468,,AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE,,,2014,,,,,1376,1382,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BN6JF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000485439701053,View Full Record in Web of Science

The article then illustrates that, contrary to the conventional view, the, cold, dry boundary conditions currently used do not necessarily represent the worst case of external climate conditions that can be expected.

In this study, we assimilate a state-of-the-art terrestrial water storage product derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations into NASA's Catchment land surface model (CLSM) at the global scale, with the goal of generating groundwater storage time series that are useful for drought monitoring and other applications. Evaluation using in situ data from nearly 4,000 wells shows that GRACE data assimilation improves the simulation of groundwater, with estimation errors reduced by 36% and 10% and correlation improved by 16% and 22% at the regional and point scales, respectively. The biggest improvements are observed in regions with large interannual variability in precipitation, where simulated groundwater responds too strongly to changes in atmospheric forcing. The positive impacts of GRACE data assimilation are further demonstrated using observed low-flow data. CLSM and GRACE data assimilation performance is also examined across different permeability categories. The evaluation reveals that GRACE data assimilation fails to compensate for the lack of a groundwater withdrawal scheme in CLSM when it comes to simulating realistic groundwater variations in regions with intensive groundwater abstraction. CLSM-simulated groundwater correlates strongly with 12-month precipitation anomalies in low-latitude and midlatitude areas. A groundwater drought indicator based on GRACE data assimilation generally agrees with other regional-scale drought indicators, with discrepancies mainly in their estimated drought severity.","[Li, Bailing; Beaudoing, Hiroko Kato; Getirana, Augusto; Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Li, Bailing; Rodell, Matthew; Kumar, Sujay; Beaudoing, Hiroko Kato; Getirana, Augusto; Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet; Policelli, Frederick] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Zaitchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Depart Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [de Goncalves, Luis Gustavo] Natl Inst Space Res, Ctr Weather Forecast & Climate Studies, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Cossetin, Camila] Climatempo, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Bhanja, Soumendra] Athabasca Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Athabasca, AB, Canada; [Mukherjee, Abhijit] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Geol & Geophys, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Tian, Siyuan] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Tian, Siyuan] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Long, Di] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Nanteza, Jamiat] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Lee, Jejung] Univ Missouri, Dept Geosci, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Goni, Ibrahim B.] Univ Maiduguri, Dept Geol, Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria; [Daira, Djoret; Bila, Mohammed] Lake Chad Basin Commiss, Ndjamena, Chad; [de Lannoy, Gabrielle] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Mocko, David] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Reston, VA USA; [Steele-Dunne, Susan C.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Water Management Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands; [Save, Himanshu; Bettadpur, Srinivas] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Space Res, Austin, TX USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Johns Hopkins University; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Athabasca University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Australian National University; Australian National University; Tsinghua University; Makerere University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; KU Leuven; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC); Delft University of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Li, BL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Li, BL (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",bailing.li@nasa.gov,"Bhanja, Soumendra N./P-9865-2018; Mukherjee, Abhijit/K-5930-2015; Mukherjee, Abhijit/AAI-2995-2021; Long, Di/N-8049-2013; Tian, Siyuan/GNH-3708-2022; Rodell, Matthew/E-4946-2012; de Goncalves, Luis/AAF-4293-2020; Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020; KUMAR, SUJAY/B-8142-2015","Bhanja, Soumendra N./0000-0002-9434-8483; Mukherjee, Abhijit/0000-0001-6972-8962; Mukherjee, Abhijit/0000-0002-0555-0875; Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039; Tian, Siyuan/0000-0002-7688-0249; Rodell, Matthew/0000-0003-0106-7437; Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Goni, Ibrahim Baba/0000-0002-5961-0810; Getirana, Augusto/0000-0001-9635-7220; Beaudoing, Hiroko/0000-0002-2838-0151; Nanteza, Jamiat/0000-0002-0320-440X; Li, Bailing/0000-0001-7991-219X; Bettadpur, Srinivas/0000-0003-3885-2228; KUMAR, SUJAY/0000-0001-8797-9482",,,,,103,118,119,16,117,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

For example, the most recent official Atmosphere and Ocean De-aliasing products (AOD1B-RL06) are applied for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions. The temporal resolution of AOD1B-RL06 is 3 h, and spectrally, they are computed up to degree and order 180. In this study, we explore a refined, e.g., geometrically, physically, and numerically improved, mass integration approach that is important for computing the atmosphere part of these products. Besides, the newly available ERA5 climate data are used to produce a new set of non-tidal atmosphere de-aliasing product (HUST-ERA5) that is computed hourly up to degree and order 100, covering 2002 onwards. Despite an overall agreement with AOD1B-RL06 (correlation >= 0.99), considerable discrepancies still exist between HUST-ERA5 and AOD1B-RL06. The possible reasons are therefore analyzed, and we find the input climate data, sampling rate and integration method may result in a product difference of similar to 0.3, similar to 0.15 and similar to 0.05 millimeter geoid height, respectively. The total differences between HUST-ERA5 and AOD1B-RL06 can lead to a mean variation of similar to 7.34 nm/s on the laser ranging interferometry (LRI) range-rate residuals, for example, during January 2019, which is already close to the LRI precision. This impact is invisible for the GRACE (-FO) gravity inversion because of the less accurate on-board KBR (K-band ranging) instrument, however, it will be non-negligible and should be considered when the LRI completely replaces the KBR in the future gravity missions.","[Yang, Fan; Luo, ZhiCai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, MOE Key Lab Fundamental Phys Quant Measurement, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan; Luo, ZhiCai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Hubei Key Lab Gravitat & Quantum Phys, PGMF, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan; Luo, ZhiCai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Hubei Key Lab Gravitat & Quantum Phys, Sch Phys, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan; Luo, ZhiCai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Geophys, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan; Luo, ZhiCai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, PGMF, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Forootan, Ehsan] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Geodesy Grp, Aalborg, Denmark; [Wang, ChangQing] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Kusche, Juergen] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Bonn, Germany",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Aalborg University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Bonn,"Forootan, E (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Geodesy Grp, Aalborg, Denmark.",efo@plan.aau.dk,"Luo, Zhicai/GSE-0602-2022","Forootan, Ehsan/0000-0003-3055-041X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41931074, 41804016, 42061134007, 41704013]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge financial supports through the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41931074, 41804016, 42061134007 and 41704013).

A better understanding of habitat requirements is needed to accurately predict the response of herbivore communities to shrub expansion. We examined patterns of browsing by moose (Alces alces), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus, L. muta) across the tundra of northern Alaska to determine whether forage requirements explain the distribution of herbivores in this ecosystem. In addition, we examined the potential for competition among these three shrub-dependent species. We recorded shrub characteristics and browsing levels at 59 sites along a 568 km riparian transect spanning from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Coast. Mean shrub height was positively correlated with browsing intensity for all three species (r = 0.40-0.71). The minimum shrub height threshold for hare occurrence (>= 87 cm, 95% CI: 67-94) was similar to that for moose (>= 81 cm, 95% CI: 65-96), whereas ptarmigan were nearly ubiquitous (>= 3 cm, lower 95% CI = 0). Diet overlap among herbivores was nearly complete, with all three species heavily browsing feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis). Our findings indicate that unlike moose and ptarmigan, forage availability does not appear to control the distribution of snowshoe hares in the Arctic. Resource competition may further affect distribution patterns within this guild as shrub cover continues to expand.","[Zhou, Jiake; Kielland, Knut] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, 101 Murie,982 North Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhou, Jiake; Kofinas, Gary; Kielland, Knut] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, 311 Irving 1 Bldg,902 North Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhou, Jiake; Kofinas, Gary] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Resilience & Adaptat Program, POB 75700, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Prugh, Laura] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Anderson Hall,3715 West Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tape, Ken D.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Northern Engn, Water & Environm Res Ctr, 539 Duckering Bldg,306 Tanana Loop, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Kofinas, Gary] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Nat Resources & Extens, POB 757200,ONeill 303, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Zhou, JK (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, 101 Murie,982 North Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.;Zhou, JK (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, 311 Irving 1 Bldg,902 North Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.;Zhou, JK (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Resilience & Adaptat Program, POB 75700, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",jzhou2@alaska.edu,,,Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation through a George Schaller Fellowship; Alaska EPSCoR NSF [OIA-1208927],Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation through a George Schaller Fellowship; Alaska EPSCoR NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),We thank Katie Christie and Martha Raynolds for their help during the development of field sampling protocol; Naomi O'Neal and Adele Wieiaczka for essential assistance on field sampling; Geoff Carroll from Alaska Department of Fish and Game for providing the aerial survey data; Andy Baltensperger for helpful comments on models.

It has been recognized that the EASM variations are intimately but not exclusively linked to the development and decay of El Nino or La Nina. Here we present observed evidence and numerical experiment results to show that anomalous North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in spring (April-May) can induce a tripole sea surface temperature pattern in the North Atlantic that persists into ensuing summer and excite downstream development of subpolar teleconnections across the northern Eurasia, which raises (or lowers) the pressure over the Ural Mountain and the Okhotsk Sea. The latter strengthens (or weakens) the east Asian subtropical front (Meiyu-Baiu-Changma), leading to a strong (or weak) EASM. An empirical model is established to predict the EASM strength by combination of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and spring NAO. Hindcast is performed for the 1979-2006 period, which shows a hindcast prediction skill that is comparable to the 14 state-of-the-art multimodel ensemble hindcast.

The tropical Pacific moored-buoy array has been shown to adequately provide this knowledge when operating as designed. Ocean model simulation of equatorial Pacific SSTA by moored-buoy winds reveals that recent western Pacific buoy losses exceed the array's minimal redundancy. Additional wind measurements are needed to adequately simulate ENSO-related SSTA development when large portions of the moored-buoy array have been lost or decommissioned. Prospects for obtaining this supplemental wind information in real time are evaluated from simulations of central equatorial Pacific SSTA development during 2017 and end-of-year Nino-3.4 conditions during the previous 25 years. Results show that filling multiple-buoy-dropout gaps with winds from a pair of scatterometers (2000-17) achieves simulation accuracy improving upon that available from the moored-buoy array in the case in which large portions of the array are out. Forcing with the reanalysis-product winds most commonly used in recent ENSO studies or the scatterometer measurements (without the buoy winds) degrades simulation accuracy. The utility of having accurate basinwide wind stress information is demonstrated in an examination of the role that easterly weather-scale wind events played in driving the unexpected development of La Nina in 2017 and by showing that wintertime Nino-3.4 conditions can be statistically forecast, with skill comparable to state-of-the-art coupled models, on the basis of accurate knowledge of equatorial Pacific wind variability over spring or summer.","[Chiodi, Andrew M.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Ocean & Atmosphere, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chiodi, Andrew M.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Chiodi, AM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Ocean & Atmosphere, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Chiodi, AM (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",andy.chiodi@noaa.gov,"Chiodi, Andrew/AAU-2272-2021","Chiodi, Andrew/0000-0001-7315-4121",Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division of the NOAA Climate Program Office [100007298]; NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory [4815]; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean under NOAA [NA15OAR4320063],Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division of the NOAA Climate Program Office; NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean under NOAA,"This study was supported by funding from the Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division of the NOAA Climate Program Office (FundRef 100007298), NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (cont. 4815) and the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean under NOAA Cooperative Agreement NA15OAR4320063.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS), starting with the crucial step of CO2 capture and separation, provides a promising approach to alleviate this issue. The major challenge for CO2 capture and separation is exploring efficient adsorbent materials with high storage capacity and selectivity. This review firstly summarized the significant advancement in a variety of state-of-the-art adsorbent materials. Then, particular attention was focused on the practical strategies to enhance CO2 capture and separation based on current adsorbent materials by topological structure design, chemical doping, chemical functionalization, open metal sites, and electric fields. These strategies paved constructive ways for the design and synthesis of novel adsorbent materials. Finally, we gave a perspective view on future directions in this rapidly growing field.","[Lu, Xiaoqing; Jin, Dongliang; Wei, Shuxian; Wang, Zhaojie; An, Changhua; Guo, Wenyue] China Univ Petr, Coll Sci, Qingdao 266580, Shandong, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum,"An, CH (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Coll Sci, Qingdao 266580, Shandong, Peoples R China.",anchh@upc.edu.cn; wyguo@upc.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhaojie/Z-1292-2018; An, chh/C-8317-2016; Lu, Xiaoqing/C-3246-2012","Wang, Zhaojie/0000-0002-6476-6449; Lu, Xiaoqing/0000-0002-7553-7131; JIN, Dongliang/0000-0002-7143-6878","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21303266, 51402362]; Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation [ZR2011EMZ002]; PetroChina Innovation Foundation [2013D-5006-0406]; Promotive Research Fund for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Scientists of Shandong Province [BS2013CL031]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); PetroChina Innovation Foundation; Promotive Research Fund for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Scientists of Shandong Province,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 21303266 and 51402362), the Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation (ZR2011EMZ002), the PetroChina Innovation Foundation (2013D-5006-0406), and the Promotive Research Fund for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Scientists of Shandong Province (BS2013CL031).",,185,89,93,15,291,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7488,2050-7496,,J MATER CHEM A,J.

This particular style, which was started as an art movement, has received many critics in the relation to the loss of art but nevertheless Minimalism has spread all over the world and influenced many disciplines, including architecture. In minimalist architecture, elements of design convey simplicity, basic geometrical forms, with no decoration, and the use of white color, modern materials and clean spaces. The less is more movement in architecture, which can be seen in the works of Mies van der Rohe and also in the International Style that celebrates materiality and rationality, is also understood as Minimalism. Moreover, an important historical connection to minimalist architecture is the relationship to popular representations of how the upscale modern family lived. Recently, the idea of minimalist architecture appears in Indonesia as a preferable housing style. Adapting minimalist architecture to be suitable for a tropical climate can be done partly by modifying the forms and the microclimate such as using passive system approach or additional equipment that creates comfort in the building. This paper investigates the idea of minimalist architecture in Jakarta, Indonesia, and how the idea is widely used for housing. Some questions related to this study are investigating whether minimalist architecture in Jakarta shares the same principles with minimalist architecture in its earlier time or it is only a trend in housing design. Not only this study analyzes the moment when the idea of Minimalism develops in the history of modern architecture but also some important characteristics of minimalist architecture in different era and space. In addition, this study also discusses how minimalist architecture that happens in Jakarta becomes a way of dealing with both modern and local conditions, including a break free from traditions.","[Lukito, Yulia Nurliani; Handoko, Bella Previta] Univ Indonesia, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture, Depok 16424, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Handoko, BP (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Fac Engn, Dept Architecture, Depok 16424, Indonesia.",bella.previta@gmail.com,,"Lukito, Yulia Nurliani/0000-0001-6218-9150","PITTA program University of Indonesia; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Sustainable Higher Education Research Alliance (SHERA) Program for Universitas Indonesia's Scientific Modeling, Application, Research and Training for City-centered Innovation and Techn [AID-497-A-1600004, IIE-00000078-UI-1]","PITTA program University of Indonesia; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Sustainable Higher Education Research Alliance (SHERA) Program for Universitas Indonesia's Scientific Modeling, Application, Research and Training for City-centered Innovation and Techn(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK))","The research for this paper is conducted partially with the support of PITTA program University of Indonesia.

In this paper, we present a supervised segmentation framework for ground-based sky/cloud images based on a systematic analysis of different color spaces and components, using partial least-squares regression.

Advances in radar hardware, data processing, numerical models, and emerging fields within urban hydrology necessitate an updated review of the state of the art in such radar rainfall data and applications. Three key areas with significant advances over the past decade have been identified: (1) temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall data required for different types of hydrological applications, (2) rainfall estimation, radar data adjustment and data quality, and (3) nowcasting of radar rainfall and real-time applications. Based on these three fields of research, the paper provides recommendations based on an updated overview of shortcomings, gains, and novel developments in relation to urban hydrological applications. The paper also reviews how the focus in urban hydrology research has shifted over the last decade to fields such as climate change impacts, resilience of urban areas to hydrological extremes, and online prediction/warning systems. It is discussed how radar rainfall data can add value to the aforementioned emerging fields in current and future applications, but also to the analysis of integrated water systems.","[Thorndahl, Soren; Nielsen, Jesper Ellerbaek; Rasmussen, Michael R.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Civil Engn, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Einfalt, Thomas] Hydro & Meteo GmbH & Co KG, D-23552 Lubeck, Germany; [Willems, Patrick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [ten Veldhuis, Marie-Claire] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Water Management, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Molnar, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Aalborg University; KU Leuven; Delft University of Technology; Technical University of Denmark; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Thorndahl, S (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Civil Engn, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.",st@civil.aau.dk,"Veldhuis, Marie-Claire ten/D-1011-2015; Thorndahl, Søren/GWZ-6775-2022; Thorndahl, Søren/GWZ-6762-2022; Ten Veldhuis, Marie-Claire/GQH-8249-2022; Molnar, Peter/F-3066-2013; Veldhuis, Marie-Claire ten/AAD-1688-2019; Willems, Patrick/A-9715-2010; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Veldhuis, Marie-Claire ten/0000-0001-9572-2193; Thorndahl, Søren/0000-0003-4654-6204; Ten Veldhuis, Marie-Claire/0000-0001-9572-2193; Molnar, Peter/0000-0001-6437-4931; Willems, Patrick/0000-0002-7085-2570; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; Nielsen, Jesper E./0000-0003-4596-0948",,,,,201,88,91,5,59,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

A control simulation can simulate the hydrometeorological climates in the region realistically, but the terrestrial rainfall is overestimated. During daytime, the precipitation is confined to the Drakensberg highland, and there is an onshore local breeze, while during midnight to morning, the rainfall is confined to the Agulhas Current, and the breeze is offshore. These variations are captured by the numerical simulation, although the timing of maximum rainfall is early over the land and delayed over the ocean. The sensitivity experiment in which the Drakensberg is absent shows a drastic modification in the diurnal variations over land and ocean. The terrestrial precipitation is largely decreased around the Drakensberg and is largest along the coast during daytime. The nocturnal marine precipitation along the Agulhas Current is also reduced. Although the daily residual breeze is still pronounced even without the Drakensberg, wind speed is weakened. We attribute this to the reduction of precipitation. In another sensitivity experiment with smoothened warm SST due to the Agulhas Current, the amplitudes of diurnal variations are not modified remarkably, but the coastal rainfall is diminished to some extent due to less evaporation along the Agulhas Current. This study concludes that the Drakensberg plays a crucial role for the diurnal cycle, and the impact of the Agulhas Current is limited on the diurnal cycle of the coastal precipitation in this region.","[Koseki, Shunya; Bhatt, Bhuwan Chandra; Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Koseki, Shunya; Bhatt, Bhuwan Chandra; Keenlyside, Noel] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Pohl, Benjamin] CNRS, Ctr Rech Climatol, UMR6282, Biogeosci, Dijon, France; [Pohl, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Dijon, France; [Keenlyside, Noel] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Njouodo, Arielle Stela Nkwinkwa] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, MARE Inst, Cape Town, South Africa; [Njouodo, Arielle Stela Nkwinkwa] Univ Cape Town, Nansen Tutu Ctr Marine Environm Res, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Bourgogne; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Koseki, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway.;Koseki, S (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.",shunya.koseki@gfi.uib.no,"Pohl, Benjamin/L-7696-2017; Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; Pohl, Benjamin/AAW-8018-2020","Pohl, Benjamin/0000-0002-9339-797X; Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Koseki, Shunya/0000-0001-7205-7434; Imbol Nkwinkwa N., Arielle Stela/0000-0001-6719-7221",EU FP7/2007-2013 PREFACE project [603521]; ERC STERCP project [64982]; NFR-SCAMPI project; NFR-PREFACE [233680/E10],EU FP7/2007-2013 PREFACE project; ERC STERCP project; NFR-SCAMPI project; NFR-PREFACE,"We greatly appreciate one anonymous reviewer and Prof. Richard Washington at Keble College, Oxford, for their constructive reviewing comments.

However, the MCR approach is based on presence/absence beetle data only, with no information on the spatial variation in relative dominance/importance of beetle species within their present climate ranges. This means that beetle-climate relationships are more difficult to test using conventional, probabilistic statistical methods. It is also unlikely that beetles have a normal (Gaussian) distribution in climate space, and hence calibration methods developed for correcting MCR values for bias in raw data are also questionable. In this paper, the underlying statistical weaknesses in the MCR method are examined, while an alternative approach, Ubiquity Analysis, is introduced. It is concluded that this approach offers much potential for reducing the uncertainties associated with MCR estimates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Complications arise from the fact that the near-surface processes are affected by the vertical turbulent exchange. This study provides climatological estimates of the turbulent exchange and quantifies aspects of the turbulent exchange important for the Arctic climate. By definition, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is the lowermost atmospheric layer where the vertical turbulent exchange (mixing) is non-negligible in description of meteorological processes. The study focuses on the unique Arctic PBL features rarely observed at lower latitudes, namely, turbulence development and mixing under conditions of strong atmospheric static stability and under strongly negative surface radiation balance. The proposed reconstruction of the Arctic PBL climatology is based on episodic turbulence field campaigns as well as on regular radiosounding, reanalysis and satellite data. We found that the main difficulty of the data analysis appears not from data scarcity as it has been traditionally claimed but from data inconsistency and low quality. The reconstruction reveals that the Arctic PBL is stably stratified in 70% to 100% of observations. But the continues periods of stably stratified PBL (SBL) development are typically less than 100 hours (4 days). The Arctic PBL is shallow. Its depth is typically less than 200 m and frequently less than 50 m. But over the Arctic Ocean, this shallow PBL is often well mixed due to the conductive heat transport through ice and the convection over polynyas. The Arctic PBL can often dynamically decouple from the rest of the atmosphere. During the periods of decoupling the temperature variability within the PBL is much larger (in wintertime) or smaller (in summertime) than in the air aloft. Stability of the PBL and developing of the temperature inversions maintain high relative humidity (often above 90%) and the Arctic haze and fog. Models are sensitive to the Arctic PBL dynamics. However the model resolution is usually inadequate to the requirements of the employed turbulence parameterization schemes.","[Esau, Igor] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, GC Rieber Climate Inst, Bergen, Norway; Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Esau, I (corresponding author), Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, GC Rieber Climate Inst, Bergen, Norway.",igore@nersc.no,"Esau, Igor/AAG-9769-2021","Esau, Igor/0000-0003-4122-6340",,,,,126,8,8,0,4,"NOVA SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, INC",HAUPPAUGE,"400 OSER AVE, STE 1600, HAUPPAUGE, NY 11788-3635 USA",,,978-1-60741-091-1,,,,2010,,,,,3,58,,,,,,56,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BOA58,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000276037800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, different GCMs are not always in agreement with each other over various regions. The reason is that GCMs' configurations, module characteristics, and dynamic forcings vary from one to another. Model ensemble techniques are extensively used to post-process the outputs from GCMs and improve the variability of model outputs. Root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC, or R) and uncertainty are commonly used statistics for evaluating the performances of GCMs. However, the simultaneous achievements of all satisfactory statistics cannot be guaranteed in using many model ensemble techniques. In this paper, we propose a multi-model ensemble framework, using a state-of-art evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (termed MOSPD), to evaluate different characteristics of ensemble candidates and to provide comprehensive trade-off information for different model ensemble solutions. A case study of optimizing the surface air temperature (SAT) ensemble solutions over different geographical regions of China is carried out. The data covers from the period of 1900 to 2100, and the projections of SAT are analyzed with regard to three different statistical indices (i.e., RMSE, CC, and uncertainty). Among the derived ensemble solutions, the trade-off information is further analyzed with a robust Pareto front with respect to different statistics. The comparison results over historical period (1900-2005) show that the optimized solutions are superior over that obtained simple model average, as well as any single GCM output. The improvements of statistics are varying for different climatic regions over China. Future projection (2006-2100) with the proposed ensemble method identifies that the largest (smallest) temperature changes will happen in the South Central China (the Inner Mongolia), the North Eastern China (the South Central China), and the North Western China (the South Central China), under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively.","[Yang, Tiantian; Tao, Yumeng] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Li, Jingjing] Calif State Univ, Dept Geosci & Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Zhu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Su, Lu] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [He, Xiaojia] Adm Ctr Chinas Agenda21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoming] Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Irvine; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; Zhejiang University; Beijing Normal University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research,"Yang, TT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",tiantiay@uci.edu,"Yang, Tiantian/P-5989-2016; Zhu, Qian/GXV-9916-2022","Yang, Tiantian/0000-0002-0148-396X; Zhu, Qian/0000-0002-2646-2604",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41622101]; NASA MIRO grant [NNX15AQ06A]; DOE [DE-IA0000018],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NASA MIRO grant; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41622101), the NASA MIRO grant (NNX15AQ06A) program, and the DOE (Prime Award No. DE-IA0000018).

While in situ validation of satellite LST data sets is a challenging task, it is needed to obtain quantitative information on their accuracy. In the standardised approach to multi-sensor validation presented here for the first time, LST data sets obtained with state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms from several sensors (AATSR, GOES, MODIS, and SEVIRI) are matched spatially and temporally with multiple years of in situ data from globally distributed stations representing various land cover types in a consistent manner. Commonality of treatment is essential for the approach: all satellite data sets are projected to the same spatial grid, and transformed into a common harmonized format, thereby allowing comparison with in situ data to be undertaken with the same methodology and data processing. The large data base of standardised satellite LST provided by the European Space Agency's GlobTemperature project makes previously difficult to perform LST studies and applications more feasible and easier to implement. The satellite data sets are validated over either three or ten years, depending on data availability. Average accuracies over the whole time span are generally within +/- 2.0 K during night, and within +/- 4.0 K during day. Time series analyses over individual stations reveal seasonal cycles. They stem, depending on the station, from surface anisotropy, topography, or heterogeneous land cover. The results demonstrate the maturity of the LST products, but also highlight the need to carefully consider their temporal and spatial properties when using them for scientific purposes.","[Martin, Maria Anna; Goettsche, Frank-Michael; Cermak, Jan] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Ghent, Darren; Remedios, John J.] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Pires, Ana Cordeiro] IPMA, Rua Cao Aeroporto, P-1749077 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cermak, Jan] KIT, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Leicester; Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Martin, MA (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",maria.martin@kit.edu; djg20@leicester.ac.uk; ana.pires@ipma.pt; frank.goettsche@kit.edu; jan.cermak@kit.edu; jjr8@leicester.ac.uk,"Göttsche, Frank-Michael/A-7362-2013; Cermak, Jan/B-7844-2009; C.

Well-known loess profiles in northern Italy have been re-examined, and previously unknown loess deposits in central and southern Italy have been reported. This work combines a meta-analysis of published data with new data, presented here for the first time, to provide the state of the art on the spatial distribution, characteristics, genesis, and deposition ages of loess in Italy. A database of 98 soil horizons from 91 soil profiles was created and made available. It stores information on soils formed from loess or containing layers that show admixture of loess. Soil data include the source of information, the topographic, geomorphological and geological setting, kind of parent material and land use, main soil horizon properties as described in the field, soil classification, particle size distribution and chemical data. Loess is reported from almost all regions of Italy. It is generally pedogenized throughout the entire loess body and forms the parent material of deep and complex soil profiles. The thickness of the loess deposits varies from a few decimeters to a few meters; pedogenesis and local reworking partially change the original loess characteristics. In this study, we propose a set of parameters that help recognizing loess in soils: particle size distribution and sorting, geomorphological setting, pedostratigraphic position, shape of the grains under optical and scanning electron microscope (SEM), and soil-micromorphological characteristics. The ages of the loess deposits range between 70 ka BP and 18 ka BP. There are also a number of samples that have been dated to the Holocene. The meta-analysis suggests that climate is not the only driver of loess deposition in Italy; geomorphological instability and human disturbance, as well as the influence of Saharan dust, most likely played major roles, too. This study demonstrates that loess is much more widespread in Italy than previously estimated. Yet, further research on the spatial and temporal distribution of loess deposition across the Mediterranean region is needed to better understand its genesis, sources and trajectories, periods of enhanced loess formation, and the role of loess deposits in ecosystem functioning and resilience.","[Costantini, Edoardo A.

Sustainable CO2 management based on carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has garnered considerable interest due to its critical role in resolving emission-control and energy-supply challenges. Here, a comprehensive review is presented that summarizes the state-of-the-art progress in developing promising materials for sustainable CO2 management in terms of not only capture, catalytic conversion (thermochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and possible combinations), and direct utilization, but also emerging integrated capture and in situ conversion as well as artificial-intelligence-driven smart material study. In particular, insights that span multiple scopes of material research are offered, ranging from mechanistic comprehension of reactions, rational design and precise manipulation of key materials (e.g., carbon nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, zeolites, ionic liquids), to industrial implementation. This review concludes with a summary and new perspectives, especially from multiple aspects of society, which summarizes major difficulties and future potential for implementing advanced materials and technologies in sustainable CO2 management. This work may serve as a guideline and road map for developing CCU material systems, benefiting both scientists and engineers working in this growing and potentially game-changing area.","[Zhang, Zhen; Zheng, Yun; Qian, Lanting; Luo, Dan; Dou, Haozhen; Wen, Guobin; Yu, Aiping; Chen, Zhongwei] Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem Engn, Waterloo Inst Nanotechnol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Chen, ZW (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem Engn, Waterloo Inst Nanotechnol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",zhwchen@connect.uwaterloo.ca,"Wen, Guobin/ABG-1502-2021; Chen, Zhongwei/A-5605-2015","Wen, Guobin/0000-0002-2191-6734; Chen, Zhongwei/0000-0003-3463-5509; Zhang, Zhen/0000-0002-3591-932X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (Mitacs); University of Waterloo; Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (Mitacs); University of Waterloo; Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology,"The authors appreciate the support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (Mitacs), the University of Waterloo, and the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology.",,419,6,6,88,132,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0935-9648,1521-4095,,ADV MATER,Adv.

Such teleconnections are indeed responsible for the main modes of precipitation variability observed over West Africa and represent an interesting benchmark for the models that have contributed to the fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC4). The evaluation is based on a maximum covariance analysis (MCA) applied on tropical SSTs and WAM rainfall. To distinguish between interannual and multi-decadal variability, all datasets are partitioned into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components prior to analysis. First applied to HF observations, the MCA reveals two major teleconnections. The first mode highlights the strong influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The second mode reveals a relationship between the SST in the Gulf of Guinea and the northward migration of the monsoon rainbelt over the West African continent. When applied to HF outputs of the twentieth century IPCC4 simulations, the MCA provides heterogeneous results. Most simulations show a single dominant Pacific teleconnection, which is, however, of the wrong sign for half of the models. Only one model shows a significant second mode, emphasizing the OAGCMs' difficulty in simulating the response of the African rainbelt to Atlantic SST anomalies that are not synchronous with Pacific anomalies. The LF modulation of these HF teleconnections is then explored through running correlations between expansion coefficients (ECs) for SSTs and precipitation. The observed time series indicate that both Pacific and Atlantic teleconnections get stronger during the twentieth century. The IPCC4 simulations of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries do not show any significant change in the pattern of the teleconnections, but the dominant ENSO teleconnection also exhibits a significant strengthening, thereby suggesting that the observed trend could be partly a response to the anthropogenic forcing. Finally, the MCA is also applied to the LF data. The first observed mode reveals a well-known inter-hemispheric SST pattern that is strongly related to the multi-decadal variability of the WAM rainfall dominated by the severe drying trend from the 1950s to the 1980s. Whereas recent studies suggest that this drying could be partly caused by anthropogenic forcings, only 5 among the 12 IPCC4 models capture some features of this LF coupled mode. This result suggests the need for a more detailed validation of the WAM variability, including a dynamical interpretation of the SST-rainfall relationships.","UDC, CNRM, GMGEC, Meteo France, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France; IPSL, Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Joly, M (corresponding author), UDC, CNRM, GMGEC, Meteo France, 42 Ave G Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France.",mathieu.joly@meteo.fr,,"AZIRI, Dhiya eddine/0000-0003-2008-868X; terray, Pascal/0000-0002-3982-6630",,,,,45,86,99,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

This is crucial to, among others, correctly assess the amount of solar energy received at a location at the moment of sediment deposition. The paleolatitude of an arbitrary location can in principle be reconstructed from tectonic plate reconstructions that (1) restore the relative motions between plates based on (marine) magnetic anomalies, and (2) reconstruct all plates relative to the spin axis using a paleomagnetic reference frame based on a global apparent polar wander path. Whereas many studies do employ high-quality relative plate reconstructions, the necessity of using a paleomagnetic reference frame for climate studies rather than a mantle reference frame appears under-appreciated. In this paper, we briefly summarize the theory of plate tectonic reconstructions and their reference frames tailored towards applications of paleoclimate reconstruction, and show that using a mantle reference frame, which defines plate positions relative to the mantle, instead of a paleomagnetic reference frame may introduce errors in paleolatitude of more than 15 degrees (>1500 km). This is because mantle reference frames cannot constrain, or are specifically corrected for the effects of true polar wander. We used the latest, state-of-the-art plate reconstructions to build a global plate circuit, and developed an online, user-friendly paleolatitude calculator for the last 200 million years by placing this plate circuit in three widely used global apparent polar wander paths. As a novelty, this calculator adds error bars to paleolatitude estimates that can be incorporated in climate modeling. The calculator is available at www.paleolatitude.org. We illustrate the use of the paleolatitude calculator by showing how an apparent wide spread in Eocene sea surface temperatures of southern high latitudes may be in part explained by a much wider paleolatitudinal distribution of sites than previously assumed.","[van Hinsbergen, Douwe J.

In recent years, the complexity of DGVMs has increased by incorporating new important processes like, e. g., nutrient cycling and land cover dynamics, while biogeophysical processes like surface radiation have not been developed much further. Canopy radiation models are however very important for the estimation of absorption and reflected fluxes and are essential for a proper estimation of surface carbon, energy and water fluxes. The present study provides an overview of current implementations of canopy radiation schemes in a couple of state-of-the-art DGVMs and assesses their accuracy in simulating canopy absorption and reflection for a variety of different surface conditions. Systematic deviations in surface albedo and fractions of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (faPAR) are identified and potential impacts are assessed. The results show clear deviations for both, absorbed and reflected, surface solar radiation fluxes. FaPAR is typically underestimated, which results in an underestimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) for the investigated cases. The deviation can be as large as 25% in extreme cases. Deviations in surface albedo range between -0.15 <= Delta alpha <= 0.36, with a slight positive bias on the order of Delta alpha approximate to 0.04. Potential radiative forcing caused by albedo deviations is estimated at -1.25 <= RF <= -0.8 (Wm(-2)), caused by neglect of the diurnal cycle of surface albedo. The present study is the first one that provides an assessment of canopy RT schemes in different currently used DGVMs together with an assessment of the potential impact of the identified deviations. The paper illustrates that there is a general need to improve the canopy radiation schemes in DGVMs and provides different perspectives for their improvement.","[Loew, A.; Raddatz, T.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [van Bodegom, P.

Questions are answered Like: What kind of modelling approaches are applied? What are their (dis)advantages? What are Important modelling aspects? The review showed that simplified building models can be classified into neural network models (black box), linear parametric models (black box or grey box) and lumped capacitance models (white box). Research has mainly dealt with network topology, but more research is needed on the influence of input parameters. The review showed that particularly the modelling of the influence of sun irradiation and thermal capacitance is not performed consistently amongst researchers. Furthermore, a model with physical moaning, dealing with both temperature and relative humidity, is still Lacking. Inverse modelling has been widely applied to determine models parameters. Different optimization algorithms have been used, but mainly the conventional Gaus-Newton and the newer genetic algorithms. However, the combination of algorithms to combine their strengths has not been researched. Despite all the attention for state of the art building performance simulation toots, simplified building models should not be forgotten since they have many useful applications. Further research is needed to develop a simplified hygric and thermal building model with physical moaning. (C) 2012. Higher Education Press Limited Company.

Recent studies have suggested that this plume is carried westward over the Atlantic Ocean at altitudes between 2 and 4 km and then northward with the monsoon flow at low levels to increase the atmospheric aerosol load over coastal cities in southern West Africa (SWA), thereby exacerbating air pollution problems. However, the processes by which these fire emissions are transported into the planetary boundary layer (PBL) are still unclear. One potential factor is the large-scale subsidence related to the southern branch of the monsoon Hadley cell over the tropical Atlantic. Here we use convection-permitting model simulations with COSMO-ART to investigate for the first time the contribution of downward mixing induced by clouds, a process we refer to as downward cloud venting in contrast to the more common process of upward transport from a polluted PBL. Based on a monthly climatology, model simulations compare satisfactory with wind fields from reanalysis data, cloud observations, and satellite-retrieved carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratio. For a case study on 2 July 2016, modelled clouds and rainfall show overall good agreement with Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) cloud products and Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals (GPM-IMERG) rainfall estimates. However, there is a tendency for the model to produce too much clouds and rainfall over the Gulf of Guinea. Using the CO dispersion as an indicator for the biomass burning plume, we identify individual mixing events south of the coast of Cote d'Ivoire due to midlevel convective clouds injecting parts of the biomass burning plume into the PBL. Idealized tracer experiments suggest that around 15 % of the CO mass from the 2-4 km layer is mixed below 1 km within 2 d over the Gulf of Guinea and that the magnitude of the cloud venting is modulated by the underlying sea surface temperatures. There is even stronger vertical mixing when the biomass burning plume reaches land due to daytime heating and a deeper PBL. In that case, the long-range-transported biomass burning plume is mixed with local anthropogenic emissions. Future work should provide more robust statistics on the downward cloud venting effect over the Gulf of Guinea and include aspects of aerosol deposition.","[Dajuma, Alima; Ogunjobi, Kehinde O.] Fed Univ Technol Akure FUTA, Dept Meteorol & Climate Sci, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria; [Vogel, Heike; Knippertz, Peter; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Dajuma, Alima; N'Datchoh, Evelyne Toure; Yoboue, Veronique] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Ogunjobi, Kehinde O.] Fed Univ Technol Akure FUTA, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria; [Siele, Silue] Univ Peleforo Gon Coulibaly, Korhogo, Cote Ivoire",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Dajuma, A (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure FUTA, Dept Meteorol & Climate Sci, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria.;Dajuma, A (corresponding author), Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",alima.dajuma@yahoo.com,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; TOURE, N'Datchoh Evelyne/AAP-2605-2021; Ogunjobi, Kehinde/GXV-1397-2022; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; TOURE, N'Datchoh Evelyne/0000-0003-3139-6581; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL).,,77,1,1,0,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Neither event was successfully predicted in operational prediction models. Because of the unusual evolutions of these events that rarely happened in the historical observations, few experience was ready for understanding and predicting the two El Nino events when they occurred. Also due to their specialties, considerable attention were attracted with aims to reveal the hidden mechanisms. This article reviews the recent progresses and knowledge that were obtained in these studies. Emerging from these studies, it was argued that the key factor that was responsible for the stalled El Nino in 2014 was the unexpected summertime Easterly Wind Surges (EWSs) or the lack of summertime Westerly Wind Bursts (WWBs). Most operational prediction models failed to reproduce such stochastic winds and thus made unrealistic forecasts. The two El Nino events awakened the research community again to incorporate the state-of-the-art climate models to simulate the stochastic winds and investigate their roles in the development of El Nino.","[Xie, Ruihuang] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Xie, Ruihuang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Mega Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Xie, Ruihuang] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Lab Ocean & Climate Dynam, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xianghui] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xianghui] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xianghui] Zhuhai Fudan Innovat Res Inst, Innovat Ctr Ocean & Atmosphere Syst, Zhuhai 518057, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Fudan University; Fudan University","Fang, XH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Fang, XH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Fang, XH (corresponding author), Zhuhai Fudan Innovat Res Inst, Innovat Ctr Ocean & Atmosphere Syst, Zhuhai 518057, Peoples R China.",fangxh@fudan.edu.cn,"Fang, Xianghui/ABA-7970-2021","Fang, Xianghui/0000-0002-1210-0055",,,,,95,3,3,2,22,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7313,1869-1897,,SCI CHINA EARTH SCI,Sci.

To a large extent. these two principles underlie the works that the monarch commissioned from his agents and ambassadors. Other criteria equally notable were strangeness and exceptionality. Alfonso and his courtesans always demonstrated a great fascination towards works that contained curious and surprising details, many of them being the fruit of the special skills that their creators deployed in a series of visual devices. This is the case with the spectacular effects in the paintings by Jan van Eyck or in the ability of Dello Deli to design compositions based on geometric perspective, an interest in the strange and the exceptional that also fed the monarch's interest in natural curiosities and antiquities in certain cases such as the Grotta by Virgilio, which brought together memory and magic legend. The search for magnificence and splendour added another dimension to the concept of beauty in Alfonso's court. Here the most paradigmatic expressions are to be found in the multiple spectacles organised by the king, in particular, the banquets, which were occasions for a sophisticated and sumptuous display of all types lavish objects, from tapestries and profane pieces of silver and gold work to the rich clothing of the participants. It was a climate of opulence that was accented still further with the introduction of a series of effects and resources (music, food, floral decorations, etc.) that gave them a strong and clear synaesthetic dimension. This resulted in ephemeral manifestations that, thanks to the accounts of chroniclers and historians, survived in the memory of the history of worship in Naples and helped to make Aragonese rule a golden period for the city.","[Molina Figueras, Joan] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"Figueras, JM (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Girona, Spain.",joan.molina@udg.edu,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,4,"FUNDACION SANTA MARIA REAL, CENTRO ESTUDIOS ROMANICO",CASTILLA Y LEON,"MONASTERIO SANTA MARIA REAL, AGUILAR CAMPO PALENCIA, CASTILLA Y LEON, 34800, SPAIN",0214-896X,2386-6454,,CODEX AQUILAR,Codex Aquilar.,,2019,,,,,201,222,,,,,,22,Medieval & Renaissance Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,NI0YO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000565085200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

They can explicitly include local vegetation dynamics relevant to migration (establishment, growth, seed (propagule) production), species-specific dispersal abilities and the competitive interactions with other species in the new environment. However, the inclusion of more detailed mechanistic formulations of range shift processes may also widen the overall uncertainty of the model. Thus, a quantification of these uncertainties is needed to evaluate and improve our confidence in the model predictions. In this study, we present an efficient assessment of parameter and model uncertainties combining low-cost analyses in successive steps: local sensitivity analysis, exploration of the performance landscape at extreme parameter values, and inclusion of relevant ecological processes in the model structure. This approach was tested on the newly implemented migration module of the state-of-the-art DGVM LPJ-GM, focusing on European forests. Estimates of post-glacial migration rates obtained from pollen and macrofossil records of dominant European tree taxa were used to test the model performance. The results indicate higher sensitivity of migration rates to parameters associated with the dispersal kernel (dispersal distances and kernel shape) compared to plant traits (germination rate and maximum fecundity) and highlight the importance of representing rare long-distance dispersal events via fat-tailed kernels. Overall, the successful parametrization and model selection of LPJ-GM will allow plant migration to be simulated with a more mechanistic approach at larger spatial and temporal scales, thus improving our efforts to understand past vegetation dynamics and predict future range shifts in a context of global change.","[Zani, Deborah; Lehsten, Veiko; Lischke, Heike] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Dynam Macroecol Land Change Sci, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Zani, Deborah; Lehsten, Veiko] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Lund University","Zani, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Dynam Macroecol Land Change Sci, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.;Zani, D (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden.",deborah.zani01@gmail.com,,"Lehsten, Veiko/0000-0002-0649-0042",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [205320M_182609],Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research has been supported by the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (grant no.

Therefore, numerous research studies have developed analytical methodologies and characterized primary (gases) and secondary emission products (mostly precipitation and aerosols) from various emitters. These previous studies have generally collected either reduced or oxidized N forms, and sampled them separately prior to determining their delta N-15 values. Distinctive isotopic signals have been reported for emissions from various sources, and seasonality of the delta N-15 values has been frequently attributed to shifts in relative contributions from sources with different isotopic signals. However, theoretical concepts suggest that temperature effects on isotopic fractionation may also affect the delta N-15 values of atmospheric reaction products. Here we use a sector-based multi-stage filter system to simultaneously collect seven reduced and oxidized N species downwind from five different source types in Alberta, Canada. We report delta N-15 values obtained with a state-of-the-art gold-furnace pre-concentrator online with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) to provide representative results even for oxidized-N forms. We find that equilibrium isotope effects and their temperature dependence play significant roles in determining the delta N-15 values of the secondary emission products. In the end, seasonal delta N-15 changes here are mainly caused by temperature effects on fractionation, and the delta N-15 values of only two N species from one source type can be retained as potential fingerprints of emissions.

ECHAM5 is a state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model incorporated into the integrated weather and climate model of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS-CSM). Land surface schemes in ECHAM5 are simple and do not provide an adequate representation of the vegetation canopy and snow/frozen soil processes. Two AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project)-type experiments using ECHAM5 and ECHAM5-CoLM are run over 30 yr and the results are compared with reanalysis and observational data. It is found that the pattern of land surface temperature simulated by ECHAM5-CoLM is significantly improved relative to ECHAM5. Specifically, the cold bias over Eurasia is removed and the root-mean-square error is reduced in most regions. The seasonal variation in the zonal mean land surface temperature and the in situ soil temperature at 20- and 80-cm depths are both better simulated by ECHAM5-CoLM. ECHAM5-CoLM produces a more reasonable spatial pattern in the soil moisture content, whereas ECHAM5 predicts much drier soils. The seasonal cycle of soil moisture content from ECHAM5-CoLM is a better match to the observational data in six specific regions. ECHAM5-CoLM reproduces the observed spatial patterns of both sensible and latent heat fluxes. The strong positive bias in precipitation over land is reduced in ECHAM5-CoLM, especially over the southern Tibetan Plateau and middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River during the summer monsoon rainy season.","[Xin, Yufei; Li, Jian; Rong, Xinyao; Zhang, Guo] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, China Meteorol Adm, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Dai, Yongjiu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Sun Yat Sen University,"Dai, YJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",daiyj6@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Dai, Yongjiu/D-6261-2014","Dai, Yongjiu/0000-0002-3588-6644; Xin, Yufei/0000-0003-0965-3270","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0200801, 2017YFA0604300, 2018YFC1507003]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20100300]; Basic Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences [2017Y004]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Basic Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences,"Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB0200801, 2017YFA0604300, and 2018YFC1507003), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20100300), and Basic Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (2017Y004).",,37,4,5,4,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

However, a general summary of research in the easternmost distribution of European oaks, represented mainly by Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., has been missing. Therefore, we herein overview the current state-of-the-art of oak dendrochronology in Eastern Europe. Many tree-ring width chronologies were created across this area mostly from living trees and applied in the investigation of climate-growth relationships or dendroecological studies, especially in Baltic States. In contrast, dendrochronological dating is fairly rare in the Baltic area because of a low occurrence of oak wood in historical constructions. The only long multi-centennial tree-ring width (TRW) chronology compiled using living trees as well as historical buildings exists in western Ukraine, though many preserved historical buildings still remain unexplored in some regions (e.g. Transcarpathia). The general lack of long and well-replicatedTRWchronologies resulted in usage of radiocarbon methods or TRW chronologies representing distant regions for dating purposes. Nevertheless, some regions show great dendrochronological potential for compilation of long tree-ring width chronologies and its usability in dendroarchaeology or paleo-climatology.","[Sochova, Irena; Kolar, Tomas; Rybnicek, Michal] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sochova, Irena; Kolar, Tomas; Rybnicek, Michal] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Sochova, I (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.;Sochova, I (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",sochova.irena@seznam.cz,"Rybníček, Michal/B-5714-2014; Kolar, Tomas/B-4846-2014","Rybníček, Michal/0000-0003-1299-8923; Kolar, Tomas/0000-0002-6461-7582; Sochova, Irena/0000-0002-0041-345X","Czech Science Foundation [21-08512S]; Internal Grant Agency FFWT MENDELU [LDF_VP_2020010]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program [LM2018123]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Internal Grant Agency FFWT MENDELU; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program","The paper was prepared with support of the Czech Science Foundation through (1) grant #21-08512S, Compilation of the Southwestern Ukrainian Centennial-long Oak Tree-ring Width Chronology; (2) the Internal Grant Agency FFWT MENDELU #LDF_VP_2020010, Compilation of recent oak tree ring standard chronology for the region of southwestern Ukraine; and (3) theMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program, grant #LM2018123.

However advances in technology need to be accompanied by social innovation in order to meaningfully address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainability transitions research extends the well-established field of socio-technical systems analysis by paying closer attention to environmental, economical, social, political and technical factors that can stimulate change. Yet in order to offer guidance towards future socio-technical solu-tions, a deeper understanding of the relations between humanity and technology is necessary. To fulfill this requirement we explore the the concept of technological mediation and identify four ICT mediated practices in sustainability transitions: information gathering, communicating, decision-making, and self-reflection. These practices are described in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 14 Life Below Water, then elaborated through a specific example: the development and use of remote sensing ocean data buoys.

In six countries, a standardised mesocosm experiment with two water depths and two nutrient levels was conducted concurrently between May and November 2011. Our results showed external nutrient loading to be of key importance for N and P loss in all countries. Almost all dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were lost or taken up in biomass in all mesocosms. We found no consistent effect of temperature on DIN and SRP loss but a significant, though weak, negative effect of temperature on total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loss in the deeper mesocosms, probably related to higher organic N and P accumulation in the water in the warmer countries. In shallow mesocosms, a positive trend in TN and TP loss with increasing temperature was observed, most likely related to macrophyte growth.","[Coppens, Jan; Erdogan, Aeyda; Beklioglu, Meryem] Middle E Tech Univ, Limnol Lab, Dept Biol, Univ Mahallesi,Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Hejzlar, Josef; Sorf, Michal] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Sorf, Michal] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Jeppesen, Erik; Olsen, Saara] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Erik; Olsen, Saara] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Erdogan, Aeyda] Bozok Univ, Fac Sci & Art, Dept Biol, TR-66900 Yozgat, Turkey; [Scharfenberger, Ulrike] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Scharfenberger, Ulrike] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Biol, Chem, Pharm, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Mahdy, Aldoushy] Al Azhar Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Assiut Branch, Assiut 71524, Egypt; [Noges, Peeter; Tuvikene, Arvo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Ctr Limnol, EE-61117 Tartumaa, Estonia; [Baho, Didier L.; Trigal, Cristina] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Trigal, Cristina] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Species Informat Ctr, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Papastergiadou, Eva; Stefanidis, Kostas] Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Rion 26504, Greece; [Beklioglu, Meryem] Middle E Tech Univ, Kemal Kurdas Ecol Res & Training Stn, Ankara, Turkey","Middle East Technical University; Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources - Turkey; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Bozok University; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Free University of Berlin; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Al Azhar University; Assiut University; Estonian University of Life Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Patras; Middle East Technical University","Coppens, J; Beklioglu, M (corresponding author), Middle E Tech Univ, Limnol Lab, Dept Biol, Univ Mahallesi,Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",jan.coppens@metu.edu.tr; meryem@metu.edu.tr,"Papastergladou, ES/J-8455-2012; Scharfenberger, Ulrike/B-7907-2017; Stefanidis, Kostas/H-7262-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Hejzlar, Josef/AAE-3963-2020; Šorf, Michal/H-1330-2014; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020","Scharfenberger, Ulrike/0000-0001-9564-5327; Stefanidis, Kostas/0000-0002-9121-3188; Šorf, Michal/0000-0002-9368-6421; Nõges, Peeter/0000-0003-2919-6038; Papastergiadou, Eva/0000-0003-4430-878X; Mahdy, Aldoushy/0000-0002-9272-0843; Trigal, Cristina/0000-0002-4886-3388; Erdogan, Seyda/0000-0001-7729-7664",,,,,69,11,11,1,89,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2016,1,,,,13,32,,10.1007/s10750-015-2505-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2505-9,,,20,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Marine & Freshwater Biology,DR1DF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000379645500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

From the perspective of ecological restoration, this paper attempts to build the evaluation index system of water ecological restoration and the urban design technology system guided by water environment, and puts forward urban design strategies from three urban design dimensions: macro (urban agglomeration or region and its basin), meso (city and its basin) and micro (block and its basin), and explores the implementation of urban water system planning and design based on the concept of ecological restoration This is the way.","[Li Minyong; Liu Jianwen] Xiamen Xingcai Vocat & Tech Coll, Sch Art & Architecture, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [He Yuanrong] Xiamen Univ Coll, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Technol, Xiamen, Peoples R China",,"Li, MY (corresponding author), Xiamen Xingcai Vocat & Tech Coll, Sch Art & Architecture, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",329094365@qq.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

Previous studies have well investigated its cooling effect on air temperature (T (air)). However, its effect on increasing air humidity which can intensify the humid heat was often overlooked, particularly over urban areas with high population density, high T (air), and consequently greater exposure to moist heat stress. In this study, using state-of-the-art reanalysis data at a high spatial resolution (similar to 9 km), we evaluated how changes in area equipped for irrigation (AEI) around a city affect urban moist heat stress (UMHS) in more than 1000 cities in China and India. In addition to T (air), wet-bulb temperature (T (WB)) and wet-bulb globe temperature (T (WBG)), which consider humidity and are closer to the perceived temperature, were assessed. We found that although AEI expansion lowers urban T (air), irrigation increases T (WB) and T (WBG) due to increased air humidity, thereby exacerbating the UMHS. This 'warming' effect of irrigation is more evident in northern India where AEI has expanded significantly in recent decades, and is prominent in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, when precipitation and air humidity are low. However, this effect is not evident in China due to the lower intensity of AEI expansion and differing climatic conditions. Overall, this study highlights the side-effect of irrigation on regional climate, providing crucial information for better understanding urban heat stress and for future city planning.","[Guo, Qiang; Oki, Taikan] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Guo, Qiang; Zhou, Xudong] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Satoh, Yusuke] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Satoh, Yusuke] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Guo, Q (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.;Guo, Q (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan.",qiang@rainbow.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010","Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678; Guo, Qiang/0000-0001-6539-5988; Zhou, Xudong/0000-0001-7180-8187","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [16H06291, 21H05002]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20202005]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan","This work was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI: 16H06291 and 21H05002), and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan, Grant Number JPMEERF20202005.

Therefore, the values of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), one of the most extensively used indices, were calculated from basic climate data with the help of the RayMan model. It was found by regarding the resulted mean PET values and the occurrence frequency of extreme heat stress periods (PET values above 41 degrees C) that the urban area exhibited the most unfavourable properties, followed by the suburban and rural areas. We also found very severe heat stress conditions in the summer, which may be explained by the torrid and arid climate, calm air conditions and the lack of abundant vegetation. Aiming to optimise human thermal conditions, thereby improving local life quality and facilitating international tourism, increment of vegetated areas and water surfaces would be required and, of course, highlighting the traditional methods taking into account the important aspects of sustainability.","[Toy, Suleyman] Ataturk Univ, Architecture & Design Fac, City & Reg Planning Dept, Erzurum, Turkey; [Aytac, Ahmet Serdar] Harran Univ, Sci & Art Fac, Dept Geog, Urfa, Turkey; [Kantor, Noemi] Univ Szeged, Fac Sci & Informat, Dept Climatol & Landscape Ecol, Szeged, Hungary",Ataturk University; Harran University; Szeged University,"Toy, S (corresponding author), Ataturk Univ, Architecture & Design Fac, City & Reg Planning Dept, Erzurum, Turkey.",stoy58@gmail.com,"Toy, Süleyman/N-1894-2019; Aytaç, Ahmet Serdar/E-2125-2019; heying, li/AAU-8317-2021","Toy, Süleyman/0000-0002-3679-280X; Aytaç, Ahmet Serdar/0000-0001-8638-038X; ",,,,,73,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

We extend the GABLS1 (GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary-Layer Study 1) model intercomparison for turbulent mixing with the other relevant physical processes in the stable boundary layer over sea ice. We use the Single Column Model (SCM) version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale meteorological model and run different combinations of boundary layer and radiation schemes, using a state-of-the art land surface scheme. With this intercomparison of schemes, we confirm a wide variety in the state of the atmosphere and the surface variables for the selected parameterization schemes. To understand this variety, a sensitivity analysis for one particular combination of parameterization schemes is performed, using a novel analysis method of process diagrams. The variation between the sensitivity runs indicates a relative orientation of model sensitivities to variations in each of the governing processes and these can explain the variety of model results obtained in the intercomparison of different parameterization schemes. Moreover, we apply the same method for several geostrophic wind speeds to represent a large range of synoptic conditions. Results indicate a shift in process significance for different wind regimes. For low wind regimes, the model sensitivity is larger for surface coupling and radiation, while for high wind speeds, the largest sensitivity is found for the turbulent mixing process. An interesting non-linear feature was found for turbulent mixing for frequently occurring wind speeds and low wind speed cases, where the 2m temperature increases for decreased amounts of mixing.","[Sterk, H.

This increased research focus on GLOFs is reflected in the gradually increasing number of papers published annually. This study offers an overview of recent GLOF research by analysing 594 peer-reviewed GLOF studies published between 2017 and 2021 (Web of Science and Scopus databases), reviewing the content and geographical focus as well as other characteristics of GLOF studies. This review is complemented with perspectives from the first GLOF conference (7-9 July 2021, online) where a global GLOF research community of major mountain regions gathered to discuss the current state of the art of integrated GLOF research. Therefore, representatives from 17 countries identified and elaborated trends and challenges and proposed possible ways forward to navigate future GLOF research, in four thematic areas: (i) understanding GLOFs - timing and processes; (ii) modelling GLOFs and GLOF process chains; (iii) GLOF risk management, prevention and warning; and (iv) human dimensions of GLOFs and GLOF attribution to climate change.","[Emmer, Adam; Mergili, Martin] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geog & Reg Sci, Graz, Austria; [Allen, Simon K.; Frey, Holger; Huggel, Christian; Sattar, Ashim] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Allen, Simon K.] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Carey, Mark; Moulton, Holly] Univ Oregon, Environm Studies Program, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Carey, Mark] Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Korup, Oliver; Veh, Georg; Fischer, Melanie] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [Korup, Oliver] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Potsdam, Germany; [Chen, Thomas Y.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Cook, Simon J.] Univ Dundee, Geog & Environm Sci, Dundee, Scotland; [Cook, Simon J.] Univ Dundee, UNESCO Ctr Water Law Policy & Sci, Dundee, Scotland; [Correas-Gonzalez, Mariana] UNCUYO, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, CONICET, Mendoza, Argentina; [Das, Soumik] JNU, Ctr Study Reg Dev, New Delhi, India; [Moreno, Alejandro Diaz] Reynolds Int Ltd, Mold, Wales; [Immerzeel, Walter W.; Nick, Faezeh] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Izagirre, Enaut] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Geol, Leioa, Spain; [Joshi, Ramesh Chandra; Reza, Masoom] Kumaun Univ, Dept Geog, Naini Tal, India; [Kougkoulos, Ioannis] Amer Coll Greece, Dept Sci & Math, Aghia Paraskevi, Greece; [Knapp, Riamsara Kuyakanon] Univ Cambridge, Dept Social Anthropol, Cambridge, England; [Knapp, Riamsara Kuyakanon] Univ Oslo, Dept Culture Studies & Oriental Languages IKOS, Oslo, Norway; [Li, Dongfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore; [Majeed, Ulfat; Rashid, Irfan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar, India; [Matti, Stephanie] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Piroton, Valentine] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium; [de Figueiredo, Anderson Ribeiro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Riveros, Christian] Inst Nacl Invest Glaciares & Ecosistemas Montana, Lima, Peru; [Riveros, Christian] Natl Agr Univ La Molina, Lima, Peru; [Shrestha, Finu; Steiner, Jakob] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Shrestha, Milan] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Walker-Crawford, Noah] UCL, London, England; [Wood, Joanne L.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Geog & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Yde, Jacob C.] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Drenkhan, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Humanities, Geog & Environm, Lima, Peru",University of Graz; University of Zurich; University of Geneva; University of Oregon; University of Oregon; University of Potsdam; University of Potsdam; Columbia University; University of Dundee; University of Dundee; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Utrecht University; University of Basque Country; Kumaun University; University of Cambridge; University of Oslo; National University of Singapore; University of Kashmir; University of Iceland; University of Liege; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; University Nacional Agraria La Molina; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of London; University College London; University of Exeter; Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Emmer, A (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geog & Reg Sci, Graz, Austria.",adam.emmer@uni-graz.at,"Reza, Masoom/H-2317-2018; Emmer, Adam/P-5500-2014; Cook, Simon/J-2393-2012","Reza, Masoom/0000-0002-9706-1103; Emmer, Adam/0000-0002-8268-990X; Mergili, Martin/0000-0001-5085-4846; Das, Soumik/0000-0002-1368-5438; Frey, Holger/0000-0003-0705-3570; Veh, Georg/0000-0003-4430-2601; Chen, Thomas Y./0000-0002-0294-3614; Cook, Simon/0000-0003-1532-6532; Huggel, Christian/0000-0001-9299-2665",International Permafrost Association (IPA),International Permafrost Association (IPA),"The authors would like to thank Guoqing Zhang and the anonymous referee for their valuable feedback to the initial version of this manuscript.

Machine learning methods offer automatic and objective models for ecohydrological processes based on observed data. However, i) the number of ecological records is often much smaller than hydrological observations, and ii) ecological measurements over the long-term are costly. Consequently, ecohydrological datasets are scarce and imbalanced. To address these problems, we propose jittered binary genetic programming (JBGP) to detect the most dominant ecohydrological parameters affecting the occurrence of Arctic charr across tributaries within the large subarctic Teno River catchment, in northernmost Finland and Norway. We quantitatively assessed the accuracy of the proposed model and compared its performance with that of classic genetic programming (GP), decision tree (DT) and state-of-the-art jittered-DT methods. The JBGP achieves the highest total classification accuracy of 90% and a Heidke skill score of 78%, showing its superiority over its counterparts. Our results showed that the dominant factors contributing to the presence of Arctic charr in Teno River tributaries include i) a higher density of macro-invertebrates, ii) a lower percentage of mires in the catchment and iii) a milder stream channel slope.","[Mehr, Ali Danandeh; Haghighi, Ali Torabi; Ahrari, Amirhossein; Marttila, Hannu] Univ Oulu, Water Energy & Environm Engn Res Unit, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Mehr, Ali Danandeh] Antalya Bilim Univ, Civil Engn Dept, TR-07190 Antalya, Turkey; [Erkinaro, Jaakko] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Hjort, Jan; Korpisaari, Maija] Univ Oulu, Geog Res Unit, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Korpisaari, Maija] Oulu Deaconess Inst Fdn Sr, Dept Sports & Exercise Med, Oulu 90100, Finland; [Korpisaari, Maija] Univ Oulu, Fac Med, Ctr Life Course Hlth Res, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Kuusela, Jorma] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, FI-99980 Utsjoki, Finland; [Dempson, Brian] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St John, NL A1C 5X1, Canada",University of Oulu; Antalya Bilim University; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Oulu; University of Oulu; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Mehr, AD (corresponding author), Antalya Bilim Univ, Civil Engn Dept, TR-07190 Antalya, Turkey.",ali.danandeh@antalya.edu.tr,,,Academy of Finland HYDRO-RDI project [337523]; Academy of Finland [315519]; Maa-ja vesitekniikan tuki r.y.

Yet large uncertainties exist on the resilience of this ecosystem to drought. A better quantification of tree hydraulics and mortality processes is needed to anticipate future drought effects on Amazon forests. Most state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models are relatively poor in their mechanistic description of these complex processes. Here, we implement a mechanistic plant hydraulic module within the ORCHIDEE-CAN-NHA r7236 land surface model to simulate the percentage loss of conductance (PLC) and changes in water storage among organs via a representation of the water potentials and vertical water flows along the continuum from soil to roots, stems and leaves. The model was evaluated against observed seasonal variability in stand-scale sap flow, soil moisture and productivity under both control and drought setups at the Caxiuana throughfall exclusion field experiment in eastern Amazonia between 2001 and 2008. A relationship between PLC and tree mortality is built in the model from two empirical parameters, the cumulated duration of drought exposure that triggers mortality, and the mortality fraction in each day exceeding the exposure. Our model captures the large biomass drop in the year 2005 observed 4 years after throughfall reduction, and produces comparable annual tree mortality rates with observation over the study period. Our hydraulic architecture module provides promising avenues for future research in assimilating experimental data to parameterize mortality due to drought-induced xylem dysfunction. We also highlight that species-based (isohydric or anisohydric) hydraulic traits should be further tested to generalize the model performance in predicting the drought risks.","[Yao, Yitong; Ciais, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas; Aleina, Fabio Cresto] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Joetzjer, Emilie] Unite Mixte Rech 3589 Meteo France CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31100 Toulouse, France; [Chave, Jerome] Univ Paul Sabatier, IRD, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol,UMR 5174, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Sack, Lawren] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bartlett, Megan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Viticulture & Enol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Meir, Patrick] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Fisher, Rosie] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway; [Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Ecole Nationale Formation Agronomique (ENSFEA); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Davis; Australian National University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Yao, YT (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",yitong.yao@lsce.ipsl.fr,"; viovy, nicolas/S-2631-2018","Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1121-1869; viovy, nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; YAO, YITONG/0000-0002-1713-6719","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut ecologie et environnement [16-CONV-0003]","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut ecologie et environnement","This research has been supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut ecologie et environnement (grant no. 16-CONV-0003 and Make Our Planet Great Again Scholarship grant).",,106,1,1,4,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

One of the important factors in the prevention of work accidents is safety culture communication. Safety culture communication is an important tool for employees to create, organize and improve attitudes, behaviors, values, beliefs and norms towards safety. There are very few studies on safety culture and safety climate concepts in Turkey. It has emerged that safety communication plays an extremely important role in the harmonization and participation of employees' safety procedures and policies. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of safety communication on employees' perceptions of safety culture. The main emphasis is on safety culture and safety communication. The sample of the study is composed of 268 people working at yacht harbours. According to the analysis results of the participant survey, there was a significant relationship between the level of safety culture of employees and the dimension of safety communication.

This study reports a tree-ring cellulose oxygen isotope (delta O-18) record from northeastern Japan spanning A.D. 1927-2010, overlapping with instrumental data, which we analyzed to determine if tree-ring delta O-18 in northeastern Japan records a signal consistent with the NPGO. Our results indicate that the tree-ring delta O-18 has a significant negative correlation with May-June (MJ) precipitation, as well as with short-term MJ relative humidity variation. Time-lagged temporal-domain comparisons indicate that the tree-ring delta O-18 is significantly correlated with the following year March-April (MA) and MJ NPGO index before the North Pacific climate transition in the late 1980s, particularly on decadal timescales. These relationships between our tree-ring delta O-18 and the climate patterns in the North Pacific are consistent with the actual early-summer precipitation. Spatial spring and early-summer sea-surface temperature anomalies exhibit a NPGO-like pattern in the following year. Spatial early-summer sea-level pressure anomalies also indicate North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) like patterns in the western North Pacific. These results suggest a lagged response of the NPGO to the EASM climate changes, and tree-ring delta O-18 in northeast Japan has a potential linkage with NPGO index from winter to early summer of the following year.","[Sakashita, Wataru; Miyahara, Hiroko] Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci, 1-736 Ogawa Cho, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878505, Japan; [Sakashita, Wataru] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Ten Nodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; [Sakashita, Wataru; Yokoyama, Yusuke; Aze, Takahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Dept Biogeochem, 2-15 Natsushima Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Obrochta, Stephen P.] Akita Univ, Fac Int Resource Sci, 1-1 Tegata Gakuen Machi, Akita 0108502, Japan; [Nakatsuka, Takeshi] RIHN, Kita Ku, 457-4 Motoyama, Kyoto 6038047, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Akita University; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN),"Sakashita, W (corresponding author), Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci, 1-736 Ogawa Cho, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878505, Japan.",sakashita.wataru.fu@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Miyahara, Hiroko/GPX-4725-2022","Obrochta, Stephen/0000-0001-9632-0372","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI program [JP15H05816, JP25287051, JP25247082, JP26247085, JP15KK0151, JP16K05571]; program for JSPS Research Fellows DC1 [JP12J10623]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25287051] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI program; program for JSPS Research Fellows DC1; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This investigation was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI program (Grant Numbers JP15H05816, JP25287051, JP25247082, JP26247085, JP15KK0151, and JP16K05571).

To capitalize on this resource, membrane processes and state-of-the-art membranes must efficiently recover methane (CH4) from biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2). Composite (a.k.a. mixed-matrix) membranes, prepared from common polymers and rationally selected/engineered fillers, are highly promising for this application. This review comprehensively examines filler materials that are capable of enhancing the CO2/CH4 separation performance of polymeric membranes. Specifically, we highlight novel synthetic strategies for engineering filler materials to develop high-performance composite membranes. Besides, as the matrix components (polymers) of composite membranes largely dictate the overall gas separation performances, we introduce a new empirical metric, the Filler Enhancement Index (F-index), to aid researchers in assessing the effectiveness of the fillers from a big data perspective. The F-index systematically decouples the effect of polymer matrices and critically evaluates both conventional and emerging fillers to map out a future direction for next-generation (bio)gas separation membranes. Beyond biogas separation, this review is of relevance to a broader community with interests in composite membranes for other gas separation processes, as well as water treatment applications.","[Chuah, Chong Yang; Goh, Kunli; Yang, Yanqin; Gong, Heqing; Li, Wen; Karahan, H.

This estimation approach has previously been applied to an intermediate-complexity climate model and to individual ESM components, e.g., ocean, sea ice, or carbon cycle components. Here, the Green's functions approach is applied to a state-of-the-art ESM that comprises a global atmosphere/land configuration of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) coupled to an ocean and sea ice configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). Horizontal grid spacing is approximately 110 km for GEOS and 37-110 km for MITgcm. In addition to the reference GEOS-MITgcm simulation, we carried out a series of model sensitivity experiments, in which 20 uncertain parameters are perturbed. These control parameters can be used to adjust sea ice, microphysics, turbulence, radiation, and surface schemes in the coupled simulation. We defined eight observational targets: sea ice fraction, net surface shortwave radiation, downward longwave radiation, near-surface temperature, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and ocean temperature and salinity at 300 m. We applied the Green's functions approach to optimize the values of the 20 control parameters so as to minimize a weighted least-squares distance between the model and the eight observational targets. The new experiment with the optimized parameters resulted in a total cost reduction of 9 % relative to a simulation that had already been adjusted using other methods. The optimized experiment attained a balanced cost reduction over most of the observational targets. We also report on results from a set of sensitivity experiments that are not used in the final optimized simulation but helped explore options and guided the optimization process. These experiments include an assessment of sensitivity to the number of control parameters and to the selection of observational targets and weights in the cost function. Based on these sensitivity experiments, we selected a specific definition for the cost function. The sensitivity experiments also revealed a decreasing overall cost as the number of control variables was increased. In summary, we recommend using the Green's functions estimation approach as an additional fine-tuning step in the model development process. The method is not a replacement for modelers' experience in choosing and adjusting sensitive model parameters. Instead, it is an additional practical and effective tool for carrying out final adjustments of uncertain ESM parameters.","[Strobach, Ehud] Agr Res Org, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Strobach, Ehud; Molod, Andrea; Barahona, Donifan; Trayanov, Atanas] Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Trayanov, Atanas] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Forget, Gael] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Menemenlis, Dimitris] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Systems and Applications Inc; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Strobach, E (corresponding author), Agr Res Org, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.;Strobach, E (corresponding author), Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",udist@volcani.agri.gov.il,,"Barahona, Donifan/0000-0001-5786-1344; Strobach, Ehud/0000-0003-1465-6855","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP); Physical Oceanography (PO) programs; NASA MAP-supported GMAO core","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP); Physical Oceanography (PO) programs; NASA MAP-supported GMAO core","The SRB data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Sciences Data Center NASA/GEWEX SRB Project.

Current parameterizations are designed by humans based on physical understanding, observations, and process modeling. As a result, they are numerically efficient and interpretable, but potentially oversimplified. However, the advent of global high-resolution simulations and observations enables a more robust approach based on machine learning. In this letter, a neural network-based parameterization is trained using a near-global aqua-planet simulation with a 4-km resolution (NG-Aqua). The neural network predicts the apparent sources of heat and moisture averaged onto (160km)(2) grid boxes. A numerically stable scheme is obtained by minimizing the prediction error over multiple time steps rather than single one. In prognostic single-column model tests, this scheme matches both the fluctuations and equilibrium of NG-Aqua simulation better than the Community Atmosphere Model does. Plain Language Summary Computer-based atmospheric models predict future conditions based on physical laws. Unfortunately, current computers are not powerful enough to simulate these physical laws exactly and must represent the atmosphere as a 3-D digital image, with a pixel size, also known as resolution, of 100-200km. Scientists typically approximate any processes that occur below this size, such as rain clouds, using idealized physical models. Unfortunately, the ability of these models to represent the atmosphere's true complexity is limited by a scientist's imagination. The recent availability of large data sets, computational resources, and developments in computer science allows a different approach based on machine learning. In this article, we train one popular kind of machine learning model, known as neural network, to approximate the small-scale processes in climate model based on a high-resolution atmospheric simulation. To produce an accurate prediction, we had to reduce the prediction error of many days, rather than just a few hours. The resulting neural network matches the high-resolution simulation better than a state of the art traditional climate model does, a heartening result which suggests that machine learning can be blended with traditional approaches to produce better predictions of future weather and climate.","[Brenowitz, N.

Accurate signals for consumers on energy efficiency (EE) are essential, as disinformation might lead to sub-optimal market allocations. Considering complex devices such as heat pumps (HPs), a conflict between simplicity of calculation on the one hand and accuracy on the other hand arises. For this reason, main differences on EE between real working conditions and test procedures carried out according to regulations are examined within this study: Firstly, the most important deviations between the test procedure and the current state of the art are presented. Secondly, their influence on the validity of HP labels is investigated using spreadsheet calculations and a MODELICA simulation model. The results indicate that the omission of important influence factors - such as local conditions and the applied control strategy - in the regulations leads to significant differences between reality and labelling. The band of uncertainty found within this study covers high deviations of + 80% to - 24% from the label value. Therefore, we provide several recommendations to mitigate these deviations and to optimize the information content of the label. Among these are the implementation of a higher spatial resolution of climate conditions, the consideration of higher insulation standards, and the inclusion of effects caused by price-driven controls of the HP unit.","[Nolting, Lars; Praktiknjo, Aaron] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, Energy Resources & Innovat Econ, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Steiger, Simone] Fraunhofer Inst Bldg Phys IBP, Fuerther Str 250, D-90429 Nurnberg, Germany",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Nolting, L (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, Energy Resources & Innovat Econ, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",LNolting@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,"Praktiknjo, Aaron/O-6105-2017; Praktiknjo, Aaron/AAX-4381-2020","Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Nolting, Lars/0000-0001-8800-5807",Aufbruch Bayern (Bavaria on the move) initiative of the state of Bavaria; Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany (BMWi) in the project VASE [03ET1366A],Aufbruch Bayern (Bavaria on the move) initiative of the state of Bavaria; Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany (BMWi) in the project VASE,"The authors acknowledge the contribution of Matthias Mitterhofer, who supported this publication by parametrizing the MODELICA model used within this study according to measurements.

This additional contribution is expected to be accompanied by radius variations and occurs on timescales not limited to that of the 11-yearcycle, and thus to be potentially significant for the climate of the Earth. We aim to constrain theoretically the radius and luminosity variations of the Sun that are due to the effect of the variable magnetic fields in its interior associated with the dynamo cycle. We have extended a one-dimensional stellar evolution code to include several effects of the magnetic fields on the interior structure, such as the contributions to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and to the energy conservation equation, the impact on the density and the equation of state, and the inhibition of convective energy transport. We investigate different magnetic configurations, based on both observational constraints and on the output of state-of-the-art mean field dynamo models. We explore both step-like and simply periodic time dependences of the magnetic field peak strength. We find that magnetic models have decreased luminosity and increased radii with respect to their nonmagnetic counterparts. In other words, the luminosity and radius variations are in anti-phase and in phase, respectively, with the magnetic field strength. For peak magnetic field strengths of the order of tens of kilogauss, luminosity variations ranging between 10(-6) and 10(-3) (in modulus) and radius variations between 10(-6) and 10(-5) are obtained. Modest but significant radius variations (up to 10(-5) in relative terms) are obtained for magnetic fields of realistic strength and geometry, providing a potentially observable signature of the intrinsic variations. Establishing their existence in addition to the accepted surface effects would have very important implications for the understanding of solar-induced long-term trends on climate.","[Spada, F.] Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, Gottingen, Germany; [Arlt, R.; Kueker, M.] Leibniz Inst Astrophys Potsdam AIP, Potsdam, Germany; [Sofia, S.] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Max Planck Society; Leibniz Institut fur Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP); Yale University,"Spada, F (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, Justus von Liebig Weg 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",spada@mps.mpg.de,,"Kuker, Manfred/0000-0002-6992-0898",Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies (YIBS); Karl Schwarzschild Postdoctoral Fellowship at AIP; G.

The abundance of simulation tools developed over recent decades, however, creates a difficulty because predictions from different models show large variability. Discrepancies between the conclusions of different modelling studies are often ascribed to differences in the physical and biogeochemical processes incorporated in equations of C and N cycles and their interactions. Here we review the literature to determine the state-of-the-art in modelling agricultural (crop and grassland) systems. In order to carry out this study, we selected the range of biogeochemical models used by the CN-MIP consortium of FACCE-JPI (http://www.faccejpi.com): APSIM, CERES-EGC, DayCent, DNDC, DSSAT, EPIC, PaSim, RothC and STICS. In our analysis, these models were assessed for the quality and comprehensiveness of underlying processes related to pedo-climatic conditions and management practices, but also with respect to time and space of application, and for their accuracy in multiple contexts. Overall, it emerged that there is a possible impact of ill-defined pedo-climatic conditions in the unsatisfactory performance of the models (46.2%), followed by limitations in the algorithms simulating the effects of management practices (33.1%). The multiplicity of scales in both time and space is a fundamental feature, which explains the remaining weaknesses (i.e. 20.7%). Innovative aspects have been identified for future development of C and N models. They include the explicit representation of soil microbial biomass to drive soil organic matter turnover, the effect of N shortage on SOM decomposition, the improvements related to the production and consumption of gases and an adequate simulations of gas transport in soil. On these bases, the assessment of trends and gaps in the modelling approaches currently employed to represent biogeochemical cycles in crop and grassland systems appears an essential step for future research.

Given large expanses of intact biomes, a long history of pre-Colombian civilizations, and recent urbanization trends, the urban ecosystem services (UES) concept has the potential to address issues of well-being for its citizens. We review relevant regional and global literature and use expert-based knowledge to identify the state of the art of the UES concept as applicable to green spaces in LAC and elucidate three overarching guidelines for management and future research needs: 1. LAC cities can be socio-ecologically unique; 2. Drivers of UES in LAC can be different than in other regions; and 3. Context and demand need to be accounted for when valuing UES. Overall, we show that research on UES is mostly from the global north and rarely accounts for the diverse and complex socio-political and ecological drivers of LAC's urbanization processes. We find that, as in other regions, the biophysical context and land use policies play a major role on UES provision. However, socioeconomic inequalities and weak governance are key drivers in UES supply and demand in LAC. Context-specific information on how to promote, educate, and apply UES is particularly important, not only in LAC, but in other regions where inequities, rapid urbanization, and climate change effects are stressing socio-political and ecological systems and their adaptive capacities. Standardized approaches from developed countries should be used to complement - not substitute - LAC context specific approaches for studying and applying UES.

The effective production rate of NOx is composed of the direct production in reactions associated with the ionization or dissociation process and of indirect production during subsequent ionic reactions and recombination. A state of the art ion chemistry model is used to study the dependence of the effective production rate of NOx on several atmospheric parameters such as density, temperature, and abundance of atmospheric constituents and trace gases. The resulting effective production rates vary significantly, depending on the atmospheric state, and reach values between 1.2 NOx per ion pair in the lower mesosphere and 1.9 NOx per ion pair in the lower thermosphere. In this paper, an alternative approach to obtain realistic NOx production rates without running a full ion chemistry model is discussed; a database setup and readout system is used to replace ion chemistry calculations. It is compared to the full ion chemistry model and to a thermospheric reduced ion chemistry model combined with constant rate estimation below the mesopause. Database readout performs better than the constant estimate at all altitudes, where above 100 km reduced ion chemistry better reproduces full ion chemistry, but database readout performs better in terms of numerical cost.","[Nieder, Holger; Sinnhuber, Miriam] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Winkler, Holger] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Marsh, Daniel R.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Bremen; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Nieder, H (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",Holger.Nieder@kit.edu,"Sinnhuber, Miriam/A-7252-2013; winkler, holger/F-6323-2012; Marsh, Daniel/A-8406-2008","Sinnhuber, Miriam/0000-0002-3527-9051; winkler, holger/0000-0001-8162-7996; Marsh, Daniel/0000-0001-6699-494X",Helmholtz Society within the Helmholtz Young Investigators group [NWG-642]; National Science Foundation,Helmholtz Society within the Helmholtz Young Investigators group; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors would like to thank Jan-Maik Wissing and May-Britt Kallenrode, University of Osnabruck, for the AIMOS data, and Charles Jackman, NASA, for ionization rate data.

One of the major components of the BIPVs is the photovoltaic integrated shading device (PVSDs) that generates electricity by converting the excessive solar radiation into energy to reduce the total energy consumption in the buildings. Being closely related to the zero-energy building concept, the PVSD components should be progressively slanted towards the building and dynamic sun positions in contrast with the fixed panels. Adjustable PVSDs in buildings would play an important role in energy conversion and daylight admission; although this concept is quite new and worth investigating whether the PVSD-control methodology could be the upcoming future of generating electricity while providing natural light. Therefore, for the first time in the literature, a systematic literature review on PVSD designs and advanced control strategies was conducted by surveying the state-of-art articles. Summarizing the current body of knowledge, the existing studies were collected between 2012 and 2021 in a literature matrix consisting of the mutual aspects like PVSD and building types, methods, climates and energy saving ratio. Given the provided overview and very detailed summary of the PVSD designs and related control strategies, this review would be a valuable guide for future studies.","[Kirimtat, Ayca; Krejcar, Ondrej] Univ Hradec Kralove, Ctr Basic & Appl Res, Fac Informat & Management, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic; [Tasgetiren, M.

We identified zonal moisture advection as the main cause of severe tropospheric drying during the extreme droughts in the southern GP in 2011 and northern GP in 2012. For both events, the eastward advection of anomalously dry and warm air in the free troposphere in spring set the stage for summer drought. This led to a sharp drop in relative humidity above the boundary layer, enhancing dry entrainment and suppressing deep convection. Further breakdown of the zonal advection into dynamic (caused by circulation anomalies) and thermodynamic (caused by moisture anomalies) contributions reveals dominance of thermodynamic advection in the tropospheric drying observed during the onset of both 2011 and 2012 droughts. The dependence of thermodynamic advection on the moisture gradient links springtime precipitation in the Rockies and southwestern US, the source region of the anomalous dry advection, to the GP summer precipitation (with correlations > 0.4 using gauge-based data). Identifying this previously overlooked precursor of the GP summer droughts improves our predictive understanding of drought onset mechanisms over the region.","[Erfanian, Amir; Fu, Rong] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Erfanian, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amir.erfanian@atmos.ucla.edu,"Fu, Rong/GMX-1257-2022","Fu, Rong/0000-0002-4065-248X; Erfanian, Amir/0000-0001-7033-7045","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office (NOAA-CPO) Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program [NA17OAR4310123]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office (NOAA-CPO) Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program","This research has been supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office (NOAA-CPO) Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program (grant no.

Such data are of paramount importance for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is the source region of several large rivers in Asia. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) 2.0 and 2.1 provide abundant fine resolution hydroclimatic data. However, evaluations on their applicability have not been carried out for the TP. This study aims to evaluate and improve their applicability in basin-scale hydrological applications in the TP. Gauge-based data, a hydrological model including biosphere and seven state-of-the-art global precipitation products are utilized to carry out the study in four large basins in the TP. We find that GLDAS2.1 shows significant warming trends from 2001 to 2010, whereas GLDAS2.0 shows cooling trends, although only significant in the Upper Yellow River basin. The contrasting trends imply that caution should be taken when using them to analyze climate change impacts. On a monthly scale, GLDAS2.1 precipitation on average is closer to the gauge-based data than GLDAS2.0, but both of them have high uncertainty. Therefore, further quality improvements in precipitation are of importance. We also find CMORPH-BLD has better performance than other products in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Relative Bias (RB), and root-mean-square error. Combining CMORPH-BLD with GLDAS2.0 forcing data generates more realistic runoff simulation than GLDAS2.1, with NSE and RB being 0.85 and 16% on average. The results provide unique insights into the studied data and are beneficial for water resource assessment in the TP.","[Qi, Wei; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Qi, Wei; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Soil & Groundwater Pollut, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Qi, Wei; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, State Environm Protect Key Lab Integrated Surface, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Chen, Deliang] Univ Gothenburg, Reg Climate Grp, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Chen, Deliang] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Southern University of Science & Technology; Southern University of Science & Technology; Southern University of Science & Technology; University of Gothenburg,"Liu, JG (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Liu, JG (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Soil & Groundwater Pollut, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Liu, JG (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, State Environm Protect Key Lab Integrated Surface, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",junguo.liu@gmail.com,"Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012; Qi, Wei/D-6246-2019; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013","Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618",National Science Fund for Distinguished Youth Scholars of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41625001]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060402]; National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFA0603704]; Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51809136]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M622516]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571022],National Science Fund for Distinguished Youth Scholars of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program; Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Youth Scholars of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41625001), Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant XDA20060402), National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFA0603704), the Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51809136), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M622516), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571022).

As a window component the transmitted spectrum of the LSC affects the color quality of daylight in the interior of a building. We evaluate eight state of the art nanocrystal luminophores as candidates for LSC windows applications, using ray-trace Monte Carlo simulations. LSCs are assessed with respect to different color quality criteria, using transparency ranging from 90% to 50%. We find that LSC device efficiency is inversely proportional to transparency. Also, luminophores with a wide absorption bandwidth in the visible have higher color temperatures and high color rendering index, leading to good visual comfort at appreciable device efficiency.","[Moraitis, P.; van Leeuwen, G.

Compared to its predecessor, System 4, SEAS5 is a substantially changed forecast system. It includes upgraded versions of the atmosphere and ocean models at higher resolutions, and adds a prognostic sea-ice model. Here, we describe the configuration of SEAS5 and summarise the most noticeable results from a set of diagnostics including biases, variability, teleconnections and forecast skill. An important improvement in SEAS5 is the reduction of the equatorial Pacific cold tongue bias, which is accompanied by a more realistic El Nino amplitude and an improvement in El Nino prediction skill over the central-west Pacific. Improvements in 2m temperature skill are also clear over the tropical Pacific. Sea-surface temperature (SST) biases in the northern extratropics change due to increased ocean resolution, especially in regions associated with western boundary currents. The increased ocean resolution exposes a new problem in the northwest Atlantic, where SEAS5 fails to capture decadal variability of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, resulting in a degradation of DJF 2m temperature prediction skill in this region. The prognostic sea-ice model improves seasonal predictions of sea-ice cover, although some regions and seasons suffer from biases introduced by employing a fully dynamical model rather than the simple, empirical scheme used in System 4. There are also improvements in 2m temperature skill in the vicinity of the Arctic sea-ice edge. Cold temperature biases in the troposphere improve, but increase at the tropopause. Biases in the extratropical jets are larger than in System 4: extratropical jets are too strong, and displaced northwards in JJA. In summary, development and added complexity since System 4 has ensured that SEAS5 is a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast system which continues to display a particular strength in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction.","[Johnson, Stephanie J.; Stockdale, Timothy N.; Ferranti, Laura; Balmaseda, Magdalena A.; Molteni, Franco; Magnusson, Linus; Tietsche, Steffen; Decremer, Damien; Weisheimer, Antje; Balsamo, Gianpaolo; Keeley, Sarah P.

Statistics and an expert survey show that the proportion of loose housing facilities and outdoor exercise areas in Switzerland increased from 5% in 1990 to around 40% in 2010. Experts identified the most common situation in dairy cattle loose housing as a naturally ventilated single-building stable with cubicles, solid floors and an outdoor exercise yard alongside. The design of a measuring concept to quantify emissions should represent emissions from naturally ventilated stables and outdoor exercise areas without influencing livestock activity or the stable climate. The tracer ratio method is established for measurements in naturally ventilated stables. This enables real-time measurements under practical conditions. To derive emission factors, measurements on several commercial farms are required. The great climatic variation in outdoor climate housing systems over the course of the year can be recorded by means of measurements spread systematically throughout the year. Measurements were taken over 24 hour periods as well as high temporal resolution map daily patterns and short-term events. The interpretation of these emission data requires to record relevant accompanying parameters with information on the animals, feeding, housing and traffic area soiling as well as on management and climate.","[Schrade, Sabine; Keck, Margret] Forsch Anstalt Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, D-8356 Ettenhausen, Germany; [Zeyer, Kerstin; Emmenegger, Lukas] Empa, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Schrade, S (corresponding author), Forsch Anstalt Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, D-8356 Ettenhausen, Germany.",sabine.schrade@art.admin.ch,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,16,AGRARFORSCHUNG,POSIEUX,"AGROSCOPE LIEBEFELD-POSIEUX, POSIEUX, CH-1725, SWITZERLAND",1663-7852,,,AGRARFORSCH SCHWEIZ+,Agrarforschung Schweiz,APR,2011,4,,,,170,175,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,756JK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290007300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We simulated the physiology of a pinon pine-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) that experienced mortality during a 5yr precipitation-reduction experiment, allowing a framework with which to examine our knowledge of drought-induced tree mortality. We used six models designed for scales ranging from individual plants to a global level, all containing state-of-the-art representations of the internal hydraulic and carbohydrate dynamics of woody plants. Despite the large range of model structures, tuning, and parameterization employed, all simulations predicted hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes co-occurring in dying trees of both species, with the time spent with severe hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, rather than absolute thresholds per se, being a better predictor of impending mortality. Model and empirical data suggest that limited carbon and water exchanges at stomatal, phloem, and below-ground interfaces were associated with mortality of both species. The model-data comparison suggests that the introduction of a mechanistic process into physiology-based models provides equal or improved predictive power over traditional process-model or empirical thresholds. Both biophysical and empirical modeling approaches are useful in understanding processes, particularly when the models fail, because they reveal mechanisms that are likely to underlie mortality. We suggest that for some ecosystems, integration of mechanistic pathogen models into current vegetation models, and evaluation against observations, could result in a breakthrough capability to simulate vegetation dynamics.","[McDowell, Nate G.; Xu, Chonggang; Dickman, Lee; Sevanto, Sanna; Williams, A.

Urban heat mitigation research promotes the use of reflective surfaces to counteract the negative effects of extreme heat. Surface reflectance is a key parameter for understanding, modeling and modifying the urban surface energy balance to cool cities and improve outdoor thermal comfort. The majority of urban surface studies address the impacts of horizontal surface properties at the material and precinct scales. However, there is a gap in research focusing on individual building facades. This paper analyses the results of a novel application of the empirical line method to calibrate a terrestrial low-cost multispectral sensor to recover spectral reflectance from urban vertical surfaces. The high correlation between measured and predicted mean reflectance values per waveband (0.940 (Red) < r(s) > 0.967 (NIR)) confirmed a near-perfect positive agreement between pairs of samples of ranked scores. The measured and predicted distributions exhibited no statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level. Accuracy measures indicate absolute errors within previously reported limits and support the utility of a single-target spectral reflectance recovery method for urban heat mitigation studies focusing on individual building facades.","[Fox, Jonathan; Osmond, Paul] UNSW, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Fox, Jonathan] UNSW, CRC Low Carbon Living Ltd, Tyree Energy Technol Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Peters, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Adelaide,"Fox, J (corresponding author), UNSW, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Fox, J (corresponding author), UNSW, CRC Low Carbon Living Ltd, Tyree Energy Technol Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jonathan.fox@unsw.edu.au; p.osmond@unsw.edu.au; alan.peters@adelaide.edu.au,,"Fox, Jonathan/0000-0001-7625-067X; Osmond, Paul/0000-0002-8533-6624",Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Low Carbon Living [RP2005]; Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship,"Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Low Carbon Living(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","This research was funded by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Low Carbon Living, project number RP2005, and the Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.",,149,11,12,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2225-1154,,,CLIMATE,Climate,SEP,2018,3,,,,,,56,10.3390/cli6030056,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6030056,,,26,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GY2TJ,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000448396100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focuses on the globular succulent plants of the Americas, the cacti, and their counterparts in Africa in the ice-plant, spurge and milkweed families. Though often held up as paragons of convergent morphological evolution, the environmental similarity of these plants has remained largely unexamined from a quantitative perspective. Five hotspots (centres of high species diversity of globular succulents) were selected, two in Mexico and three in South Africa. Their environments were compared using niche modelling tools, randomization tests of niche similarity and multivariate analyses to test for environmental similarity. Although the sites selected have similar but unrelated life forms, almost all our results highlighted more climate differences than similarities between the hotspots. Interprediction of niches within and between continents, a niche equivalence test, and MANOVA results showed significant differences. In contrast, a niche similarity test showed that the comparisons of CuatrocinegasRichtersveld, HuizacheKnersvlakte and HuizacheRichtersveld were similar. Differences in rainfall and temperature regimes and the potential effect of edaphic factors may be involved in the differences between the hotspots. In addition, differences in structure, morphology and physiology of the globular succulents may coincide with some of the climatic dissimilarities; i.e. given convergence as the evolution of similar morphologies under similar conditions, then it may be that differing environments diagnose inconspicuous morphological differences. Moreover, although fine-scale differences between sites were found, a coarser perspective shows that these sites are clearly similar as drylands with relatively moderate drought and mild temperatures, illustrating how all studies of convergence must address the issue of how similar two entities must be before they are considered convergent.","[Alvarado-Cardenas, Leonardo O.; Martinez-Meyer, Enrique; Hernandez, Hector M.; Olson, Mark E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, CU, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Feria, Teresa P.] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Biol, Edinburg, TX 78541 USA; [Eguiarte, Luis E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, CU, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Midgley, Guy] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, Climate Change Res Grp, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; South African National Biodiversity Institute,"Alvarado-Cardenas, LO (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, CU, AP 70-367, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",leonardo_ac@yahoo.com,"Midgley, Guy F./H-3585-2014","Midgley, Guy F./0000-0001-8264-0869; Martinez-Meyer, Enrique/0000-0003-1184-9264; Hernandez, Hector M./0000-0002-1741-5515","CONACyT through UNAM [48322]; CONACyT; PAPIIT/DGAPA [132404, IN228207]; Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens; Research Committee of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America","CONACyT through UNAM; CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PAPIIT/DGAPA(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)); Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens; Research Committee of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America","This work was supported by CONACyT (grant 48322, L.O.A.C.) through a graduate scholarship, the Programa de Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas, UNAM.

It focuses on the architect-educator Paul Ritter (1925-2010), who taught at the Nottingham School of Architecture from 1945 till 1964 and was appointed as head of the City of Perth's (Western Australia) newly formed Department of Planning in 1965. In his writings, Ritter combined emerging theories from diverse fields - psychoanalysis, educational theory, environmental education - in ways that were not purely theoretical, but rather that intended to be read as manifestoes for childhood creativity. This paper argues that a better understanding of select writings by Ritter and a comparison with educational reports produced by institutional reformers in the UK, sheds light on the educational climate of the late 1950s and 1960s and helps to uncover debates on how to train architects in a rapidly changing world.","[Couchez, Elke] UHasselt, Fac Architecture & Art, Hasselt, Belgium",Hasselt University,"Couchez, E (corresponding author), UHasselt, Fac Architecture & Art, Hasselt, Belgium.",elke.couchez@uhasselt.be,,"COUCHEZ, Elke/0000-0002-5119-4576","University of Queensland's Centre for Architecture, Theory, Criticism and History; Australian Research Council; Ghent University","University of Queensland's Centre for Architecture, Theory, Criticism and History; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Ghent University(Ghent University)","This paper is the first part of a diptych study on the notions of architecture, childhood and civics in the work of Paul Ritter.

Charcoal from the sediments filling the wells yielded radiocarbon ages of similar to 1000 B.C. The time in which wells were dug coincides with a period of general regional aridity and high ENSO activity in the American Southwest. Digging to access water may have occurred in response to period(s) of resource uncertainty, or as a logistical activity that engaged increasingly resource-tethered Late Archaic/Early Agricultural populations. These activities laid the foundation for agricultural practices that eventually became the dominant mode of subsistence in the low-lying areas of the Sonoran Desert. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, there is no agreed consensus on the workflow that should govern the design of outdoor shading installations with respect to microclimate and human thermal comfort. The present study addresses this research gap by developing a flexible workflow that informs the architectural design process with parametric thermal comfort simulations. The proposed workflow acknowledges that although an environmentally optimal design may exist, the designer is often forced to select a sub-optimal solution that can satisfy non-comparable design objectives including practical on-site constraints and political pressure from stakeholders with often conflicting interests. Considering that outdoor shading devices are often found at the fringe of public and private spaces, the influence of the aforementioned non-environmental objectives on the design process becomes significant. For these reasons, the proposed workflow utilises state-of-the-art techniques such as ComfortCover in order to map the 'usefulness' of shade over a specified area and to explore alternative forms of shading devices. Thus, shading optimisation becomes a matter of weighting alternatives and choosing appropriate solutions from the examined parametric space, rather than a fully automated process. This 'designer-first' approach evolved through extensive pilot-testing at the Old Venetian Port of Chania, Greece as part of a series of urban regeneration interventions coordinated by the Municipal Port Fund of Chania. This design process resulted in a typology of shading devices that offer optimal annual thermal comfort conditions while satisfying the rest of the design objectives as well.","[Vartholomaios, Aristotelis; Kalogirou, Nikolaos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Architecture, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Vartholomaios, A (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Architecture, Thessaloniki, Greece.",avarth@arch.auth.gr,"Vartholomaios, Aristotelis/AAV-5694-2021","Vartholomaios, Aristotelis/0000-0001-6177-1130",,,,,32,0,0,0,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

Hence, a multicity campaign was conducted during crop residue burning period in Indo Gangetic Plains (IGP) to study the impact on ambient air quality. Seventeen air pollutants along with live meteorological parameters, were measured using state of the art continuous air quality monitors. The average concentration of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 during the whole campaign were 196.7 +/- 30.6, 148.2 +/- 20, and 51.2 +/- 8.9 mu gm(-3) and daily average concentration were found several times higher than national ambient air quality standards for 24 h. Amritsar had the highest average concentration of PM2.5 (178.4 +/- 83.8 mu gm(-3)) followed by Rohtak and Sonipat (158.4 +/- 79.8, 156.5 +/- 105.3 mu gm(-3)), whereas Chandigarh recorded the lowest concentration (112.3 +/- 6.9 mu gm(-3)). The concentration of gaseous pollutants NO, NO2, NOx, and SO2 were also observed highest at Amritsar location, i.e., 6.6 +/- 2.6 ppb, 6.2 +/- 0.7 ppb, 12.7 +/- 3.0 ppb, and 7.5 +/- 3.3 ppb respectively. The highest average O-3 and CO were 22.5 +/- 19.3 ppb and 1.5 +/- 1.2 ppm during the campaign. The level of gaseous pollutants and Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found to be elevated during the campaign, which can play an important role in the formation of secondary air pollutants. The correlation of meteorology and air pollutants was also studied, and O-3 shows a significant relation with temperature and UV (R = 0.87 and 0.74) whereas VOCs shows a significant correlation with temperature (R = -0.21 to -0.47). Air quality data was also analyzed to identify sources of emissions using principal component analysis, and it identifies biomass burning and vehicular activities as major sources of air pollution.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying salt-tolerance in this family is of utmost importance for landscape integration and soil rehabilitation. In this mini-review, we present the state of the art of Casuarina research - from gene to ecosystem - in response to salinity, towards green growth and sustainable development. Based on literature retrieval from 2000 to 2021, a general overview of salt-stress tolerance in the Casuarinaceae is presented, and the extent of the contribution of root-nodule and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, as well as the related eco-physiological and molecular changes are discussed.","[Ribeiro-Barros, Ana I.; Ramalho, Jose C.] Univ Lisboa ULisboa, Inst Super Agron ISA, PlantStress&Biodivers Lab, Forest Res Ctr CEF, Lisbon, Portugal; [Ribeiro-Barros, Ana I.; Ramalho, Jose C.] Univ NOVA Lisboa UNL, GeoBioSci GeoTechnol & GeoEngn GeoBioTec, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol FCT, Caparica, Portugal; [Pawlowski, Katharina] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Stockholm University,"Ribeiro-Barros, AI (corresponding author), Univ Lisboa ULisboa, Inst Super Agron ISA, PlantStress&Biodivers Lab, Forest Res Ctr CEF, Lisbon, Portugal.",aribeiro@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Ramalho, José C/G-2427-2014; RIBEIRO-BARROS, ANA I/J-4322-2017","Ramalho, José C/0000-0002-7639-7214; Pawlowski, Katharina/0000-0003-2693-885X; RIBEIRO-BARROS, ANA I/0000-0002-6071-6460","European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through the COMPETE 2020-Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation; Portuguese national funds via FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [PTDC/AGR-FOR/4218/2012, UIDP/04035/2020, UIDB/00239/2020]",European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through the COMPETE 2020-Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation; Portuguese national funds via FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),"This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through the COMPETE 2020-Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation and Portuguese national funds via FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia Project PTDC/AGR-FOR/4218/2012, and the research units UIDP/04035/2020 (GeoBioTec), and UIDB/00239/2020 (CEF).",,39,2,2,4,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

Thereby, parallel operating cell controllers at each cell are implemented. The solution is compared to the state-of-the-art wired communication as well as to alternative methods. Besides the functional demonstration, the implementation of a double-stack communication protocol is also discussed. This ensures a flexible and scalable integration with different sensors and battery setups in the future.","[Rittweger, Florian; Schiepel, Philipp; Ernsting, Jonas; Riemschneider, Karl-Ragmar] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Dept Informat & Elect Engn, Hamburg, Germany",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg,"Rittweger, F (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Dept Informat & Elect Engn, Hamburg, Germany.",florian.rittweger@haw-hamburg.de,,,German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) [03ETE019B],German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK),"The work was supported by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK, former BMWi) within the project `LImeSI' (grant 03ETE019B).",,37,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-0981-0,,,,2022,,,,,,,,10.1109/SAS54819.2022.9881250,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SAS54819.2022.9881250,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing,BT9JJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000861380600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Efficient TRS glasses have advantages over other smart windows, such as traditional electrochromic glasses, for radiant energy control because they modulate the sunlight transmission based on light reflection, which prevents unnecessary indoor heating by sunlight through the fenestrations. The high translucence tunability not only allows the optimization of indoor temperature, it also provides glare control for building occupants' visual comfort. There are several aspects, however, that require further improvements to accelerate the commercialization of TRS glasses. This review aims to validate four state-of-the-art TRS glass technologies as ideal energy-efficient building glazing, by comparing their key optical switch response, challenges and potential solutions.

Given that their intensity and frequency are increasing, an in-depth understanding of their impacts is crucial to mitigate risks and potential negative effects. However, so far, scientific research on windstorm impacts has mainly focused on environmental dimensions, while socio-economic and institutional ones are rarely taken into consideration. Our analysis aims at enriching the current scientific knowledge on windstorm impacts on forest SES by providing an overview of the state-of-the-art academic investigations on windstorm impacts on socio-economic and institutional dimensions. Overall, 46 papers were reviewed to identify the most recurrent post-windstorm dynamics and drivers that influence resilience and adaptation of socio-economic, institutional and related governance dimensions of European forest SES. Results show that the current scientific knowledge on socio-economic impacts of windstorms mainly concentrates on forest-related stakeholders and sectors, paying little attention to the broader social, cultural and institutional drivers that contribute to forest SES resilience. Further, cascade effects linking environmental, social and institutional dimensions are poorly analyzed. This restricted focus could lead to an incomplete understanding of the dynamics shaping socio-economic adaptability to windstorms, affecting long-term and sustainable recovery from extreme natural events. To correctly frame effective, intersectoral and coordinated recovery strategies gaining a deeper understanding of human-environment interactions is needed, as well as acknowledging the positive influence of causal relationships in improving forest-related SES resilience.","[Romagnoli, Federica; Masiero, Mauro; Secco, Laura] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, TESAF, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",University of Padua,"Romagnoli, F (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, TESAF, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",federica.romagnoli@phd.unipd.it; mauro.masiero@unipd.it; laura.secco@unipd.it,,"SECCO, LAURA/0000-0001-7533-7474; Masiero, Mauro/0000-0001-5660-4362; Romagnoli, Federica/0000-0001-5671-5580",University of Padova [CAVA_SID19_02],University of Padova,This research has been by the University of Padova in the framework of the project Vaia FRONT (grant CAVA_SID19_02).,,130,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUN,2022,6,,,,,,939,10.3390/f13060939,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13060939,,,31,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,2K8YX,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000816615800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Apportioning N2O to these source processes is a challenging task, but better understanding of the processes is required to improve mitigation strategies. The N2O site-specific 15?N signatures from denitrification and nitrification have been shown to be clearly different, making this signature a potential tool for N2O source identification. We have applied for the first time quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) for the continuous analysis of the intramolecular 15?N distribution of soil-derived N2O and compared this with state-of-the-art isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). METHODS Soil was amended with nitrate and sucrose and incubated in a laboratory setup. The N2O release was quantified by FTIR spectroscopy, while the N2O intramolecular 15?N distribution was continuously analyzed by online QCLAS at 1?Hz resolution. The QCLAS results on time-integrating flask samples were compared with those from the IRMS analysis. RESULTS The analytical precision (2 sigma) of QCLAS was around 0.3 parts per thousand for the delta 15Nbulk and the 15?N site preference (SP) for 1-min average values. Comparing the two techniques on flask samples, excellent agreement (R2?=?0.99; offset of 1.2 parts per thousand) was observed for the delta 15Nbulk values while for the SP values the correlation was less good (R2?=?0.76; offset of 0.9 parts per thousand), presumably due to the lower precision of the IRMS SP measurements. CONCLUSIONS These findings validate QCLAS as a viable alternative technique with even higher precision than state-of-the-art IRMS. Thus, laser spectroscopy has the potential to contribute significantly to a better understanding of N turnover in soils, which is crucial for advancing strategies to mitigate emissions of this efficient greenhouse gas.

State of the art multiscale simulation methods work well in situations in which stationary and elliptic scenarios prevail but are prone to fail when the model involves dominant lower order terms which is common in applications. We suggest to overcome the associated difficulties through a reconstruction of subgrid variations into a modified basis by solving many independent (local) inverse problems that are constructed in a semi-Lagrangian step. Globally the method looks like a Eulerian method with multiscale stabilized basis. The method is extensible to other types of Galerkin methods, higher dimensions, nonlinear problems and can potentially work with real data. We provide examples inspired by tracer transport in climate systems in one and two dimensions and numerically compare our method to standard methods.","[Simon, Konrad; Behrens, Joern] Univ Hamburg, Dept Math, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Grindelberg 5, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Simon, K (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Dept Math, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Grindelberg 5, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany.",konrad.simon@uni-hamburg.de; joern.behrens@uni-hamburg.de,"Behrens, Jörn/A-1863-2013","Behrens, Jörn/0000-0001-9836-8716; Simon, Konrad/0000-0003-1525-3396",,,,,36,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-22747-0; 978-3-030-22746-3,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2019,,,,,393,409,,10.1007/978-3-030-22747-0_30,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22747-0_30,,,17,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Mathematics,BQ4FE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000589297100030,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reliable thickness of offshore permafrost is up to 100m according to direct methods. Both top and bottom permafrost are hardly detectable offshore. Special knowledge and good experience are indispensable even to recognize its location and extent.

Here, we demonstrate a promising approach to DAC that combines atmospheric CO2 absorption by an aqueous oligopeptide (e.g., glycylglycine) with bicarbonate crystallization by a simple guanidine compound (e.g., glyoxal-bis-iminoguanidine). In this phase-changing system, the peptide and the guanidine compounds work in synergy, and the cyclic CO2 capacity can be maximized by matching the pK(a) values of the two components. Compared with glycine, the simpler amino acid congener, the cyclic CO2 capacity of the glycylglycine peptide combined with glyoxalbis-iminoguanidine is twice as high (0.16 mol/mol).

This study uses an intersectional approach by investigating how gender intersects with variables, specific to a college student population (e.g., class level, college of major, sexual harassment on campus), to influence readiness to help. The results are from a survey about campus climate experiences, which includes a stratified random sample of college students from a large Southwestern university in the United States, with 964 respondents. We conducted bivariate crosstabulations, comparisons of means, and multiple regressions. The multiple regression analyses illustrate that for women, the single most robust relationship with BRH is experiences with sexual harassment. For men, the strongest correlate is being a student within the college of liberal and fine arts. The practical and research implications of these findings are discussed.","[Christensen, M.

Therefore, a non-linear theory, accounting for a relevant part of the mid-latitude variability, has been revised in terms of its signature in observational and model data. Theoretical and observational arguments suggest that two main features of mid-latitude northern hemispheric winter variability can be somewhat unambiguously separated, both in terms of signal and physical processes. The synoptic phenomena, which are travelling waves characterized by time scales of the order of 2-7 days and by spatial scales of the order of few thousands Km., can be associated with release of available energy driven by conventional baroclinic conversion. At lower frequencies (10-40 days), the planetary scale variability is related to the non linear orographic resonance processes.","[Calmanti, S.; Dell'Aquila, A.; Ruti, P.

This is owing to its simplicity and adaptability to a wide range of applications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain specific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for quantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical challenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data for better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the input space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized counterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of paramount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based testing framework for quantization assessment. DiverGet defines a space of metamorphic relations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions on the inputs. Then, it optimally explores these relations to reveal the disagreements among DNNs of different arithmetic precision. We evaluate the performance of DiverGet on state-of-the-art DNNs applied to hyperspectral remote sensing images. We chose the remote sensing DNNs as they're being increasingly deployed at the edge (e.g., high-lift drones) in critical domains like climate change research and astronomy. Our results show that DiverGet successfully challenges the robustness of established quantization techniques against naturally-occurring shifted data, and outperforms its most recent concurrent, DiffChaser, with a success rate that is (on average) four times higher.","[Yahmed, Ahmed Haj; Ben Braiek, Houssem; Khomh, Foutse] Polytech Montreal, SWAT Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Khomh, Foutse] Mila Quebec Artificial Intelligence Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bouzidi, Sonia] Natl Inst Appl Sci & Technol, Tunis, Tunisia; [Zaatour, Rania] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Universite de Carthage; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Yahmed, AH (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, SWAT Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ahmed.haj-yahmed@polymtl.ca; houssem.ben-braiek@polymtl.ca; foutse.khomh@polymtl.ca; sonia.bouzidi@insat.u-carthage.tn; raniaz@pik-potsdam.de,,,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQ); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Huawei Canada,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQ); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); Huawei Canada(Huawei Technologies),"We acknowledge the support from the following organizations and companies: Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQ), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and Huawei Canada.

In this chapter, we focus on the recurrent and large scale mass mortality events (MMEs) induced by marine heatwaves (MHWs), and their immediate and long-term impacts on structural octocorals from highly diverse coralligenous communities. By combining an accurate characterization of present and expected thermal stress conditions in coastal seawater from the surface down to 40 m depth with the state of the art on demography, population genetics, and responses to thermal stress, we analyze the ongoing eco-evolutionary impacts and explore future trajectories of these emblematic Mediterranean communities. Analysis of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) trends over the three decades revealed a marked increase in MHW events in the Mediterranean Sea. The immediate impacts of MMEs on structural octocoral populations were dramatic decreases of their biomass (similar to 60%). After 10-15 years since the occurrence of a NHW, there were no signs of population recovery, and in fact, a continued decrease was observed due to subsequent marine heatwaves. The modeling of Mediterranean SST suggests longer and more severe marine heatwaves as the century progresses. In this thermal context, the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the structural octocorals will likely result in an abrupt collapse of impacted populations. Indeed, from the eco-evolutionary interaction, the demographic decline is expected to increase the strength of genetic drift due to the low recolonization capacity of the species. This may lead to an extinction vortex, in spite of the occurrence of potentially thermoresistant individuals suggesting some potential for adaptation to future conditions. The ongoing collapse of Mediterranean habitat-forming octocorals may drive to a functional void with severe consequences for coralligenous communities and services they provide. The implementation of ambitious mitigation and adaptation policies compliant with the Paris agreement is urgently needed. In this context, we highlight the critical role of marine protected areas and the need for increasing their surface and improving their management.","[Garrabou, Joaquim; Ledoux, Jean-Baptiste; Bensoussan, Nathaniel; Gomez-Gras, Daniel] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona, Spain; [Garrabou, Joaquim] Univ Toulon & Var, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog MIO, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,IRD, Marseille, France; [Ledoux, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Porto, Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIIMAR CIMAR, Porto, Portugal; [Gomez-Gras, Daniel; Linares, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBIO, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite de Toulon; Universidade do Porto; University of Barcelona,"Garrabou, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona, Spain.;Garrabou, J (corresponding author), Univ Toulon & Var, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog MIO, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,IRD, Marseille, France.",garrabou@icm.csic.es; danielgomezgras@ucm.es; cristinalinares@ub.edu,"Linares, Cristina/A-5244-2018","Linares, Cristina/0000-0003-3855-2743","Interreg Med Programme [1197 | 1MED15_3.2_M2_337, 5216 | 5MED18_3.2_M23_007]; European Union [689518]; Spanish Government [CGL2012-32194]; FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04423/2020, UIDP/04423/2020]; ICREA Academia from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies; Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU15/05457]; MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE [RTI2018-095346-B-I00]","Interreg Med Programme; European Union(European Commission); Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission); FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); ICREA Academia from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies(ICREA); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE","This study has been partially supported by the Interreg Med Programme (Project MPA-Adapt -Grant number 1197 | 1MED15_3.2_M2_337 and Project MPA-ENGAGEgrant number: 5216 | 5MED18_3.2_M23_007), by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no 689518 (MERCES), by the Spanish Government (Smart project (CGL2012-32194) and Heatmed research project (RTI2018-095346-B-I00, MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), and by FCT -Foundation for Science and Technology (UIDB/04423/2020 and UIDP/04423/2020).

Buildings constitute a large part of the total energy consumption in the world. In this respect it is important to have the optimum heat balance in buildings. That is, in a cold climate one wants to have as well thermally insulated building envelopes as possible. However, even in cold climates there might often be relatively long periods of overheating in the buildings, for example, due to solar heat gains and excessive heat loads from miscellaneous indoor activities. In warm climates overheating is most often the case, for example, in office work spaces with large window glass facades and extensive use of electrical equipment. Insulation retrofit is among the most cost-effective measures, even more cost-effective than, for example, solar photovoltaics. The traditional thermal insulation materials of today have typically thermal conductivities between 33 and 40 mW/(mK). State-of-the-art thermal insulation includes vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) with conductivities between 3 and 4 mW/(mK) in fresh condition to typically 8 mW/(mK) after 25 years aging due to water vapor and air diffusion into the VIP core material, which has an open pore structure. Puncturing the VIP envelope causes an increase in the thermal conductivity to about 20 mW/(mK). The main emphasis of this work centers around the possibilities of inventing and developing innovative and robust highly thermal insulating materials. That is, within this work the objective is to go beyond VIPs and other current state-of-the-art technologies. New concepts are introduced, that is, advanced insulation materials (AIMs) as vacuum insulation materials (VIMs), gas insulation materials (GIMs), nano insulation materials (NIMs), and dynamic insulation materials (DIMs). These materials may have closed pore structures (VIMs and GIMs) or either open or closed pore structures (NIMs). The DIMs aim at controlling the material insulation properties, that is, solid state thermal conductivity, emissivity, and pore gas content. Fundamental theoretical studies aimed at developing an understanding of the basics of thermal conductance in solid state matter at an elementary and atomic level have been addressed. The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop tailor-made novel high performance thermal insulation materials and dynamic insulation materials, the latter one enabling to control and regulate the thermal conductivity in the materials themselves, that is from highly insulating to highly conducting. Furthermore, requirements of the future high performance thermal insulation materials and solutions have been proposed. At the moment, the NIM solution seems to represent the best high performance low conductivity thermal solution for the foreseeable future. If robust and practical DIMs can be manufactured, they have great potential due to their thermal insulation regulating abilities.","[Jelle, Bjorn Petter] SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Jelle, Bjorn Petter] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Gustavsen, Arild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Baetens, Ruben] Catholic Univ Leuven KUL, Dept Civil Engn, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); KU Leuven,"Jelle, BP (corresponding author), SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",bjorn.petter.jelle@sintef.no,"Baetens, Ruben/B-8546-2014","Jelle, Bjorn Petter/0000-0003-2026-6394",Research Council of Norway; AF Gruppen; Glava; Hunton Fiber as; Icopal; Isola; Jackon; maxit; Moelven ByggModul; Ramboll; Skanska; Statsbygg; Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); AF Gruppen; Glava; Hunton Fiber as; Icopal; Isola; Jackon; maxit; Moelven ByggModul; Ramboll; Skanska; Statsbygg; Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe,"This work has been supported by the Research Council of Norway, AF Gruppen, Glava, Hunton Fiber as, Icopal, Isola, Jackon, maxit, Moelven ByggModul, Ramboll, Skanska, Statsbygg, and Takprodusentenes forskningsgruppe through the SINTEF and NTNU research project 'Robust Envelope Construction Details for Buildings of the 21st Century' (ROBUST).",,84,124,131,5,112,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1744-2591,1744-2583,,J BUILD PHYS,J.

The sense of sustainability, thus, means searching for effective approaches involving ecological fuels, and processes with a little environmental concern. Approaches for utilization of such renewable resources like solar energy as a driving force, and biomass-derived compounds as feedstocks for simultaneous hydrogen production as the most promising energy carrier, are currently gaining their momentum as the solutions for sustainable energy generation and tackling climate change. In this paper, we review the scientific advances in photocatalytic hydrogen production from biomass-derived compounds via wet- and dry- photoreforming over metal-loaded-semiconductor photocatalysts. Based on the recent literature reports, we narrowed focus particularly to designing the state-of-the-art photocatalysts which renders substantial enhancement of their performance possible via localized surface plasmon resonance effect.","[Cwieka, Karol; Jablczynska, Katarzyna; Werner, Lukasz; Gradon, Leon] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Chem & Proc Engn, L Warynskiego 1, PL-00645 Warsaw, Poland; [Cwieka, Karol] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Woloska 141, PL-02507 Warsaw, Poland; [Czelej, Kamil] Univ Warsaw, Fac Phys, Inst Theoret Phys, Dept Complex Syst Modeling, Pasteura 5, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland; [Colmenares, Juan Carlos] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Phys Chem, Kasprzaka 44-52, PL-01224 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology; Warsaw University of Technology; University of Warsaw; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Cwieka, K (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Chem & Proc Engn, L Warynskiego 1, PL-00645 Warsaw, Poland.;Cwieka, K (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Woloska 141, PL-02507 Warsaw, Poland.;Colmenares, JC (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Phys Chem, Kasprzaka 44-52, PL-01224 Warsaw, Poland.",karol.cwieka@pw.edu.pl; jcarloscolmenares@ichf.edu.pl,,"Werner, Lukasz/0000-0003-3492-2364",National Science Centre in Poland [2015/18/E/ST5/00306]; OPUS-13 [2017/25/B/ST8/01592]; National Centre for Research and Development Poland [LIDER/19/0069/L-11/19/NCBR/2020]; Materials Technologies project granted by Warsaw University of Technology under the program Excellence Initiative: Research University (ID-UB); POB Technologie Materialowe of Warsaw University of Technology within the Excellence Initiative: Research University (IDUB) programme [1820/19/Z01/POB5/2021]; High Performance Computing facilities of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modeling (ICM) of the University of Warsaw [GB79-16],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); OPUS-13; National Centre for Research and Development Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); Materials Technologies project granted by Warsaw University of Technology under the program Excellence Initiative: Research University (ID-UB); POB Technologie Materialowe of Warsaw University of Technology within the Excellence Initiative: Research University (IDUB) programme; High Performance Computing facilities of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modeling (ICM) of the University of Warsaw",C.C. is very grateful for the partial support from the National Science Centre in Poland within Sonata Bis-5 project no. 2015/18/E/ST5/00306 and OPUS-13 project nr 2017/25/B/ST8/01592.r The work was partially supported by the National Centre for Research and Development Poland in the framework of the LIDER research project (contract no.

An improved forecast of the MJO may have important socioeconomic impacts due to the influence of MJO on both tropical and extratropical weather extremes. Although in the last decades state-of-the-art climate models have proved their capability for forecasting the MJO exceeding the 5-week prediction skill, there is still room for improving the prediction. In this study we use multiple linear regression (MLR) and a machine learning (ML) algorithm as post-processing methods to improve the forecast of the model that currently holds the best MJO forecasting performance, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. We find that both MLR and ML improve the MJO prediction and that ML outperforms MLR. The largest improvement is in the prediction of the MJO geographical location and intensity.","[Silini, Riccardo; Masoller, Cristina] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis, St Nebridi 22, Barcelona 08222, Spain; [Lerch, Sebastian] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Econ, Blucherstr 17, D-76185 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Mastrantonas, Nikolaos] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Mastrantonas, Nikolaos] Tech Univ Bergakad Freiberg TUBAF, Interdisciplinary Environm Res Ctr, Freiberg, Germany; [Kantz, Holger] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Barreiro, Marcelo] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Max Planck Society; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Silini, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis, St Nebridi 22, Barcelona 08222, Spain.",riccardo.silini@outlook.com,"Masoller, Cristina/M-3696-2014; Mastrantonas, Nikolaos/T-5654-2018","Masoller, Cristina/0000-0003-0768-2019; Kantz, Holger/0000-0001-6921-6094; Mastrantonas, Nikolaos/0000-0002-2430-3634; Lerch, Sebastian/0000-0002-3467-4375","H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [813844]; Vector Stiftung; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [PID2021-123994NB-C21]","H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; Vector Stiftung; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats(ICREA); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades(Spanish Government)","This research has been supported by the H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (grant no. 813844), the Vector Stiftung (Artificial Intelligence for Probabilistic Weather Forecasting), the Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, and the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades (grant no.

GCM simulations have frequently been validated against observations in terms of time-averaged variables while daily time series have not been studied extensively. In this paper, 30-year simulations of daily extreme temperatures are compared with the 30-year series recorded in Moravia. Attention is focused on the annual cycles, trimmed characteristics and average interdiurnal variability which are calculated for the average simulated series (4 gridpoints) and the average time series recorded in Moravia (5 stations). It is shown that daily extreme temperature variability is underestimated in the simulations, maximum (minimum) temperatures being underestimated (overestimated). Generally, the persistence of the simulated series is much higher, and small day-to-day changes are observed more frequenly than those in reality.

The juxtaposition of legal solutions at the national level has given rise to discussions on the optimal solutions for regulating model international surrogacy arrangements. Given the current social and political climate, the authors of this paper advocate for the reform of international adoption procedures as opposed to passing a new convention, in a way that respective provisions of international adoption convention should be adapted to capture the effects of international surrogacy arrangements - recognition of legal parentage, provided that it is in the best interests of the child, and that there is a biological link between the child and at least one intended parent.","[Alihodzic, Jasmina] Univ Tuzla, Fac Law, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Durakovic, Anita] Univ Dzemal Bijedic, Fac Law, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla; University of Mostar,"Alihodzic, J (corresponding author), Univ Tuzla, Fac Law, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",jasmina.altumbabic@untz.ba; anita.durakovic@unmo.ba,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,"UNIV MARIBOR, FAC LAW",MARIBOR,"MLADINSKA ULICA 9, MARIBOR, 2000, SLOVENIA",2463-7955,,,MED LAW SOC,Med.

The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode for the 11-yr moving sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the coupled models is commonly characterized by El Nino-like decadal variability with Bjerknes air-sea interaction. However, the second EOF mode can be separated into two groups, such that 1) some models have a zonal dipole SST pattern and 2) other models are characterized by a meridional dipole pattern. We found that models with the zonal dipole pattern in the second mode tend to simulate strong ENSO amplitude and asymmetry in comparison with those of the other models. Also, the residual patterns, which are defined as the summation of El Nino and La Nina SST composite anomalies, are very similar to the decadal dipole pattern, which suggests that ENSO residuals can cause the dipole decadal variability. It is found that decadal modulation of ENSO variability in these models strongly depends on the phase of the dipole decadal variability. The decadal changes in ENSO residual correspond well with the decadal changes in the dipole pattern, and the nonlinear dynamic heating terms by ENSO anomalies are well matched with the decadal dipole pattern.","[Kim, Geon-Il; Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kug, JS (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",jskug1@gmail.com,,,Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 201803212],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),"This study is supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant KMIPA 201803212.

While the problem of change-point detection is well studied in univariate setting, and there are few viable implementations for a general multivariate data, the existing methods do not perform well on compositional data. In this paper, we propose a parametric approach for change point detection in compositional data. Moreover, using simple transformations on data, we extend our approach to handle any general multivariate data.

Simultaneously, EROs fund speakers and campus organizations that have a history of intimidating members of academic communities. Debates about how and whether to respond to ERO tactics that are framed in terms of balancing 'freedom of speech' against 'inclusion' engage in a variety of color-evasive racism that sustains white supremacist ideology and protects white privilege. This framing legitimizes tactics that empower EROs with the right to silence their critics and foster a climate of oppression. Through an autoethnographic case study of struggles at a small liberal arts college with how to respond to ERO tactics, this article argues that rejecting the 'freedom of speech' versus 'inclusion' framing that so often characterizes the debates can help us to move beyond the paralysis that EROs have manufactured and rally against their tactics of intimidation and harassment.","[Rodriguez, Jason] Hobart & William Smith Coll, Dept Anthropol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA",,"Rodriguez, J (corresponding author), Hobart & William Smith Coll, Dept Anthropol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.",rodriguez@hws.edu,,,,,,,47,2,2,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1361-3324,1470-109X,,RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK,Race Ethn.

Recently, several attempts have extended DMD to the context of low-rank approximations. This extension is of particular interest for reduced-order modeling in various applicative domains, e.g., for climate prediction, to study molecular dynarnics or micro-electromechanical devices. This low-rank extension takes the form of a non-convex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, only sub-optimal algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute the solution ofthis problem. In this paper, we prove that there exists a closed-form optimal solution to this problem and design an effective algorithm to compute it based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A toy-example illustrates the gain in performance of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art techniques.","[Heas, Patrick; Herzet, Cedric] INRIA, Ctr Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Campus Univ Beaulieu, F-35000 Rennes, France",Inria,"Heas, P (corresponding author), INRIA, Ctr Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Campus Univ Beaulieu, F-35000 Rennes, France.",,,"Heas, Patrick/0000-0001-6860-7149",,,,,18,3,4,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1520-6149,,978-1-5090-4117-6,INT CONF ACOUST SPEE,,,2017,,,,,4456,4460,,,,,,5,"Acoustics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Acoustics; Engineering,BI7JW,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000414286204124,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main focus is a group of descriptions of glass-related crafts in an Arabic text titled Qamus al-sina at al-shamiyya (Dictionary of Damascene crafts), written in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century. Examples of the products of these craft practices are sought in the collection of the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art at Shangri La in Honolulu, Hawaii. The final section places the evidence in a wider economic context, with particular reference to the importation of European glass to the Middle East. The conclusion reflects upon the ways in which traditional Syrian crafts, including glassworking, adapted themselves to the increasingly challenging economic climate in the late Ottoman and Mandate periods.","Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Milwright, M (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",mmilwrig@uvic.ca,,,,,,,76,0,0,0,1,CORNING MUSEUM GLASS,CORNING,"CORNING GLASS CENTER, CORNING, NY 14831 USA",0075-4250,,,J GLASS STUD,J.

The model considers spatial and temporal relations while processing multiple time series simultaneously. Performing predictions of 6, 12, 24, and 48 h in advance, this model outperforms classical time series forecasting methods, including linear and nonlinear machine learning methods, simple deep learning architectures, and nongraph deep learning models.

There is a discussion that hydrology is an art born of the observation and investigation of rainfall and runoff. It is emphasised that accurate, relevant and timely information is paramount for decision making in the situation of extreme drought and the threat of climate change. Philosophical thoughts and observations are made on the data processes for decision making, systems thinking and planning in water resources. The need for appropriate models is emphasised, as sophisticated models with uncertain data coming in and certainly uncertain results coming out are no better than a simple model with the same data. Future decision making will be very multidisciplined, and some thoughts on educating the current and future generation of students with skills to cope with this are offered.

This paper shows that, in the aggregate, the benefits of undertaking the Kyoto reductions should exceed the corresponding costs-provided these are achieved cost-effectively. But, although Kyoto seeks to promote cost-effectiveness, it may yet prove very costly. Moreover, the agreement may not even achieve the reductions that it promises, either because emissions will relocate to the countries that are not required to stay within Kyoto-prescribed ceilings or because paper' trades will be promoted by the protocol's mechanisms. More fundamentally Kyoto does not deter non-compliance, and it only weakly deters non-participation.

This study provides a contemporary assessment of sea-level rise around Australia to the end of 2018, based on all available tide gauge records and satellite altimetry. The study provides the first national assessment of vertical land motion (VLM) around the coast, identifying margins more prevalent to subsidence, which in turn exacerbate the localised effects of a rising global mean sea level. These areas include coastlines between Townsville and Coffs Harbour, Burnie to Port Pirie, and Fremantle to Wyndham. State-of-the-art time-series analysis techniques applied to all high-quality tide gauge records exceeding 75 years in length (four sites) enabled improved insights into the temporal resolution of current rates of rise and accelerations in mean sea level around Australia than were previously available. Averaged across these four records in 2018, approximately 40% of the ''relative'' velocity observed (similar to 2.2 +/- 1.8 mm/y, 95% confidence limit [CL]) is attributable to VLM. When corrected for VLM, only the Fort Denison site exhibits geocentric'' mean sea-level velocity in 2018 exceeding 2 mm/y. The average geocentric velocity across all four sites in 2018 equates to 1.3 +/- 2.0 mm/y (95% CL). Interestingly, each long record exhibits similar temporal characteristics, whereby a low point in the velocity time series occurs sometime in the period from 1970 to 1990, after which velocity increases over time to a peak occurring sometime after ca. 2010, suggesting the presence of a small acceleration (albeit not statistically different to zero at the 95% CL) in the record.","[Watson, Phil J.] Coastal Educ & Res Fdn CERF, Coconut Creek, FL 33073 USA",,"Watson, PJ (corresponding author), Coastal Educ & Res Fdn CERF, Coconut Creek, FL 33073 USA.",philwatson.slr@gmail.com,,"Watson, Phil J/0000-0002-6008-7465",,,,,67,8,8,3,8,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

The importance of the paintings, one of the finest examples of European rock art paintings, was recognized shortly after their discovery in 1940. In the 60's of the past century the cave received a huge number of visitors and suffered a microbial crisis due to the impact of massive tourism and the previous adaptation works carried out to facilitate visits. In 1963, the cave was closed due to the damage produced by visitors' breath, lighting and algal growth on the paintings. In 2001, an outbreak of the fungus Fusarium solani covered the walls and sediments. Later, black stains, produced by the growth of the fungus Ochroconis lascauxensis, appeared on the walls. In 2006, the extensive black stains constituted the third major microbial crisis. In an attempt to know the dispersion of microorganisms inside the cave, aerobiological and microclimate studies were carried out in two different seasons, when a climate system for preventing condensation of water vapor on the walls was active (September 2010) or inactive (February 2010). The data showed that in September the convection currents created by the climate system evacuated the airborne microorganisms whereas in February they remained in suspension which explained the high concentrations of bacteria and fungi found in the air. This double aerobiological and microclimate study in Lascaux Cave can help to understand the dispersion of microorganisms and to adopt measures for a correct cave management.","[Martin-Sanchez, Pedro M.; Jurado, Valme; Porca, Estefania; Saiz-Jimenez, Cesareo] CSIC, IRNAS, Apartado 1052, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Bastian, Fabiola; Alabouvette, Claude] Univ Bourgogne, UMR INRA, Microbiol Sol & Environm, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Lacanette, Delphine] Univ Bordeaux, UMR 5295, I2M, F-33600 Pessac, France",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Sevilla (IRNAS); INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite de Bourgogne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Martin-Sanchez, PM (corresponding author), CSIC, IRNAS, Apartado 1052, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",saiz@irnase.csic.es,"Martin-Sanchez, Pedro M./ABI-4509-2020; Lacanette, Delphine/ABB-8410-2021; JURADO, VALME/E-3468-2016; SAIZ-JIMENEZ, CESAREO/I-8885-2012; Martin-Sanchez, Pedro M/A-8021-2016","Martin-Sanchez, Pedro M./0000-0003-2674-8650; Lacanette, Delphine/0000-0003-2954-5963; JURADO, VALME/0000-0003-0972-9909; SAIZ-JIMENEZ, CESAREO/0000-0003-0036-670X; Martin-Sanchez, Pedro M/0000-0003-2674-8650; BASTIAN, Fabiola/0000-0002-1685-7530","Ministry of Culture and Communication, France, project Ecologie microbienne de la grotte de Lascaux; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Research Programme in Technologies for the Assessment and Conservation of Cultural Heritage [TCP CSD2007-00058]; CSIC JAE-Predoc grant","Ministry of Culture and Communication, France, project Ecologie microbienne de la grotte de Lascaux; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Research Programme in Technologies for the Assessment and Conservation of Cultural Heritage(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); CSIC JAE-Predoc grant","This work was supported by the Ministry of Culture and Communication, France, project Ecologie microbienne de la grotte de Lascaux and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Research Programme in Technologies for the Assessment and Conservation of Cultural Heritage, TCP CSD2007-00058.

Greenhouses are considered as a mitigation measure to combat climate change and as a sustainable production system. The majority of greenhouses in the Mediterranean region are rudimentary, while those in Central and North Europe are characterized by equipment of a high technological level for greenhouse climate and fertigation management. However, the technological innovations and research originating from Central and North Europe glasshouses may not be appropriate for use in Mediterranean plastic greenhouses when considering the trade-off between agronomic needs and potential energy savings. Identifying energy measures suitable for the local climate will improve energy efficiency and crop performance toward the goal of greenhouse sustainability.

Here, we show an application of causality ideas in complex networks to infer properties of equatorial wave interactions associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the dominant component of the atmospheric system on intraseasonal timescales in the equatorial region. We use the normal mode function approach to obtain the time series of baroclinic Kelvin and Rossby mode energies, since both of these wave modes are known to play an important role in the MJO dynamics. The partial directed coherence method reveals the structure of the interaction among those modes and shows that the Kelvin mode is the main driver of the MJO system, transferring energy to the Rossby modes. Investigation on the Kelvin mode information source might help evaluating the state-of-the-art of MJO theories.","[Raphaldini, B.; Teruya, A. S. W.; Raupp, C. F. M.; Silva-Dias, P.

Developing sustainable, cost-effective pathways to convert CO2 into higher value chemicals is essential to curb its atmospheric presence. Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value-added chemicals using molecular catalysis currently attracts a lot of attention, since it provides an efficient and promising way to increase CO2 utilization. Introducing amino groups as substituents to molecular catalysts is a promising approach towards improving capture and reduction of CO2. This review explores recently developed state-of-the-art molecular catalysts with a focus on heterogeneous and homogeneous amine molecular catalysts for electroreduction of CO2. The relationship between the structural properties of the molecular catalysts and CO2 electroreduction will be highlighted in this review. We will also discuss recent advances in the heterogeneous field by examining different immobilization techniques and their relation with molecular structure and conductive effects.","[Abdinejad, Maryam; Hossain, M.

State-of-the-art ocean models still have trouble to simulate the correct mean path, while the physical processes causing the variability of the flow are not yet fully understood. Since changes in the currents can induce significant changes in the poleward heat transport by the oceans, this is an important issue in climate research. Bifurcation analysis in models of intermediate complexity, as used here, shows that there may be two mean paths at the same forcing conditions. By studying the stability of steady circulation patterns in two different ocean models, also transitions to time-dependence are found, which may well be related to observed variability in the Gulf Stream region.","Univ Utrecht, IMAU, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Katsman, CA (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, IMAU, Princetonplein 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Dijkstra, Henk A./H-2559-2016",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,FRIEDRICH VIEWEG & SOHN VERLAGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH,WIESBADEN,"POSTFACH 5829, D-65048 WIESBADEN, GERMANY",,,3-528-03151-4,NOTE NUM FL,,,2000,,,,,155,166,,,,,,12,"Mathematics, Applied; Mechanics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Mathematics; Mechanics,BT47D,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000173073200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The precipitation variability in both regions is strongly linked to the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) gradient and the tropical Pacific SST anomalies, which at decadal timescales are modulated by the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) modes of SST, respectively. On the other hand, it has been found that state-of-the-art models from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are able to reproduce some of the characteristics of the low-frequency SST variability modes. In this work we analyze how CMIP5 models simulate the observed response of precipitation in the Amazonia and Northeast regions to the AMV and the IPO and the atmospheric mechanisms involved. Results show that, in both CMIP5 simulations and observations, Amazonia and Northeast rainfall response to the AMV is the opposite, due to the modulation of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) position. Conversely, the IPO affects equally both regions as a consequence of anomalous subsidence over the entire northern Brazil triggered by warm SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific. Such results suggest that an improvement of the predictability of decadal SST modes will directly revert into a better prediction of changes in the Amazonia and Northeast rainfall at longer timescales.","[Villamayor, Julian; Mohino, Elsa] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Fis, Dept Geofis & Meteorol, Pza Ciencias, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Villamayor, Julian] Inst Geociencias IGEO, Madrid, Spain; [Ambrizzi, Tercio] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO); Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Villamayor, J (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Fis, Dept Geofis & Meteorol, Pza Ciencias, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.;Villamayor, J (corresponding author), Inst Geociencias IGEO, Madrid, Spain.",julian.villamayor@ucm.es,"Ambrizzi, Tercio/A-4636-2008; Mohino, Elsa/G-8620-2015; Villamayor, Julián/AAA-9001-2020","Mohino, Elsa/0000-0002-4342-6349; VILLAMAYOR MORENO, JULIAN/0000-0002-8844-7389","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [EEBB-I-15-09241-MINECO, BES-2013-063821-MINECO]; project PREFACE (EUFP7) [603521]; project MULCLIVAR [CGL2012-38923-C02-01-MINECO]; FAPESP [13/50521-7, 08/58101-9]; CNPq",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO); project PREFACE (EUFP7); project MULCLIVAR; FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors thank the editor Dr. Corti and the helpful comments of the two anonymous reviewers.

It therefore opens the possibility of using the Moon as a calibration standard to bridge gaps in satellite coverage and validate atmospheric retrieval algorithms. Our measurement technique also yields detailed information about the atmosphere at the measurement site, suggesting that lunar observations are a possible solution for aerosol monitoring during the polar winter and can provide nighttime measurements to complement aerosol data collected with sun photometers.

It turns out that actual state of the art sodar measurements are superior to all kinds of considered paramerizations at least for heights above 50 m. In addition, the mean diurnal cycle of wind and turbulence was evaluated as a function of height. It is shown that the atmospheric boundary layer - including the surface layer - is not in dynamic equilibrium with the surface fluxes.

However, modelled GIA is uncertain due to insufficient constraints on our knowledge of past glacial changes and to large simplifications in the underlying Earth models. Consequently, we show differences between models that exceed several mm/year in terms of surface displacement for the two major ice sheets: Greenland and Antarctica. Geodetic measurements of surface displacement offer the potential for new constraints to be made on GIA models, especially when they are used to improve structural features of the Earth's interior as to allow for a more realistic reconstruction of the glaciation history. We present the distribution of presently available campaign and continuous geodetic measurements in Greenland and Antarctica and summarise surface velocities published to date, showing substantial disagreement between techniques and GIA models alike. We review the current state-of-the-art in ground-based geodesy (GPS, VLBI, DORIS, SLR) in determining accurate and precise surface velocities. In particular, we focus on known areas of need in GPS observation level models and the terrestrial reference frame in order to advance geodetic observation precision/accuracy toward 0.1 mm/year and therefore further constrain models of GIA and subsequent present-day ice mass change estimates.","[King, Matt A.; Penna, Nigel] Univ Newcastle, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Altamimi, Zuheir] LAREG, ENSG, Inst Geog Natl, F-77455 Champs Sur Marne, France; [Boehm, Johannes] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Geodesy & Geophys E1281, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Bos, Machiel] Univ Porto, Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIMAR CIIMAR, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal; [Dach, Rolf] Univ Bern, Astron Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Elosegui, Pedro] CSIC IEEC, Inst Space Sci, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Fund, Francois] ESGT CNAM, Lab Geomat & Geodesie L2G, F-72000 Le Mans, France; [Fund, Francois] Nantes Atlantique Univ, Univ Nantes, UFR Sci Tech, CNRS,Lab Planet & Geodynam,UMR 6112, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Hernandez-Pajares, Manuel] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Lavallee, David] Delft Univ Technol, Delft Inst Earth Observat & Space Syst, NL-2600 GB Delft, Netherlands; [Cerveira, Paulo Jorge Mendes] BEWAG Geoserv GmbH, Eisenstadt, Austria; [Riva, Riccardo E.

Maintaining humidity levels within the optimal growth range enhances yield. Moreover, excessively high relative humidity leads to diseases and deterioration of the crops. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the various dehumidification technologies available in the agricultural industry. Several novel conceptual designs from the literature are also discussed. The principal humidity control approaches utilized in greenhouses are ventilation (natural and forced), maintaining a high temperature, condensation on a cold surface, and adsorption by hygroscopic materials. The most common method for dehumidification is ventilation due to its minimal infrastructure. Although this method is considered the simplest, it causes additional sensible heating loads, particularly in colder climates. The added heating load can be reduced, ideally eliminated, by employing heat recovery systems. Furthermore, dehumidification by controlled condensation on a cold surface enables the capture and re-use of the latent energy released in condensation. By adsorption of water vapor using hygroscopic material, the latent heat of condensation is converted to sensible heat, which can be used for space heating in the greenhouse. Such a system can reduce the greenhouse humidity while maintaining a more uniform temperature profile over the crop canopy and reducing energy consumption. Finally, it is essential to emphasize that an appropriate dehumidification method should prevent condensation on plant surfaces, and also its operational cost should be as low as reasonably achievable to remain beneficial for growers.","[Amani, Mohammad; Foroushani, Sepehr; Sultan, Muhammad; Bahrami, Majid] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Mechatron Syst Engn, Lab Alternat Energy Convers LAEC, Surrey, BC V3T 0A3, Canada; [Sultan, Muhammad] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Bosan Rd, Multan 60800, Pakistan",Simon Fraser University; Bahauddin Zakariya University,"Bahrami, M (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Mechatron Syst Engn, Lab Alternat Energy Convers LAEC, Surrey, BC V3T 0A3, Canada.",mbahrami@sfu.ca,"Amani, Mohammad/ABG-2024-2021; Sultan, Dr.Eng., Prof. Muhammad/AAE-7883-2020","Sultan, Dr.Eng., Prof. Muhammad/0000-0002-7301-5567; Amani, Mohammad/0000-0001-8120-9946","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, CollegeUniversity Idea to Innovation Grant From Waste to Clean Food [NSERC CUI2I 501951-16]; Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarships (QES); International Research and Development Centre (IDRC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, CollegeUniversity Idea to Innovation Grant From Waste to Clean Food(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarships (QES); International Research and Development Centre (IDRC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, CollegeUniversity Idea to Innovation Grant From Waste to Clean Food (NSERC CUI2I 501951-16) and the Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarships (QES).

While this substantially reduced ecosystem carbon storage, the impacts of these land cover changes on terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) have not been adequately resolved yet. Here, we combine high-resolution datasets of satellite-derived GPP and environmental predictor variables to estimate the potential GPP of forests, grasslands, and croplands around the globe. With a mean GPP of 2.0 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) forests represent the most productive land cover on two thirds of the total area suitable for any of these land cover types, while grasslands and croplands on average reach 1.5 and 1.8 kg C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Combining our potential GPP maps with a historical land-use reconstruction indicates a 4.4% reduction in global GPP from agricultural expansion. This land-use-induced GPP reduction is amplified in some future scenarios as a result of ongoing deforestation (e.g., the large-scale bioenergy scenario SSP4-3.4) but partly reversed in other scenarios (e.g., the sustainability scenario SSP1-1.9) due to agricultural abandonment. Comparing our results to simulations from state-of-the-art Earth System Models, we find that all investigated models deviate substantially from our estimates and from each other. Our maps could be used as a benchmark to reduce this inconsistency, thereby improving projections of land-based climate mitigation potentials.","[Krause, Andreas; Papastefanou, Phillip; Gregor, Konstantin; Layritz, Lucia S.; Buras, Allan; Rammig, Anja] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Zang, Christian S.] Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 3, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Li, Xing] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Xiao, Jingfeng] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Technical University of Munich; Seoul National University (SNU); University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Krause, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",andy.krause@tum.de,"Krause, Andreas/E-9665-2018; OCO, OCO/GVS-4314-2022","Krause, Andreas/0000-0003-3345-2989; ",Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts; Heinrich Boell Foundation; National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-2017870],Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts; Heinrich Boell Foundation; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),K.G. was supported by the Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts in the context of Bavarian Climate Research Network (bayklif).

This Green Growth vision invested in developing state-of-the-art green technologies to minimize greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. Following a change in administration, Korean green technologies were re-categorized into six core technologies for climate change response in 2014, and ten core technologies for carbon-neutrality in 2021. The government proposed the realization of an inclusive green state in the 3rd Five-Year Green Growth Plan announced in 2019. Following the Green New Deal announced in 2020, green technology policies and investments continue, with the declaration of 2050 carbon neutrality. In the past two years, government policies from the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Strategy to the 2050 Carbon-Neutral Scenario consider Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) as an important technology to reduce CO2 and meet carbon-neutral goals. This study examines major green technology policy trends, focusing on CCUS, beginning with the Green Growth era in 2008 to today. R&D investment costs related to green technology during the green growth period and CCUS-related investment costs over the past 10 years (2011-2020) are utilized in statistical analyses (correlation, trend) to investigate and analyze investment volatility in green and CCUS technologies related to climate change. Finally, the study will provide basic information for establishing CCUS-related R&D policies, which will continue to increase in achieving carbon neutrality.","[Jung, Seok-ho] Korea Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kim, Hongjin] Coalit Our Common Future, 45 Supyo Ro, Seoul 04551, South Korea; [Kang, Youngjun] Jeju Res Inst, 253 Ayeon Ro, Jeju 63147, South Korea; [Jeong, Eunhoo] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol SeoulTech, Dept Environm Engn, 232 Gongneung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Korea University; Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Jeong, E (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol SeoulTech, Dept Environm Engn, 232 Gongneung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",refresh@korea.ac.kr; coalition4@ourfuture.kr; yjkang@jri.re.kr; jeongeunhoo@gmail.com,,"JUNG, SEOK-HO/0000-0001-7429-0168",Convergence Research Policy Fellowship from the MSIT; KIST Convergence Research Policy Center; KIST Coalition for Our Common Future,Convergence Research Policy Fellowship from the MSIT; KIST Convergence Research Policy Center; KIST Coalition for Our Common Future,This work was supported by a Convergence Research Policy Fellowship from the MSIT and KIST Convergence Research Policy Center And Coalition for Our Common Future.,,19,0,0,20,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,MAR,2022,3,,,,,,501,10.3390/pr10030501,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10030501,,,13,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,0B2OT,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000774480700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Toward that end, rational catalyst design principles that lead to highly active catalytic centers and enhanced active site accessibility are undoubtedly of paramount importance. Here, we used Prussian blue nanoparticles to anchor Fe/Fe3C species to nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels as ORR catalysts. The strong interaction between nanosized Fe3C and the graphitic carbon shell led to synergistic effects in the ORR, and the protection of the carbon shell guaranteed stability of the catalyst. As a result, the aerogel electrocatalyst displayed outstanding activity in the ORR on par with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst at the same mass loading in alkaline media, good performance in acidic media, and excellent stability and crossover tolerance that rivaled that of the best nonprecious-metal ORR electrocatalysts reported to date.","[Liu, Yayuan; Lin, Dingchang; Zhao, Jie; Liu, Chong; Xie, Jin; Cui, Yi] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Haotian] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cui, Yi] Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,"Cui, Y (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Cui, Y (corresponding author), Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",yicui@stanford.edu,"Xie, Jin/C-9581-2017; Cui, Yi/L-5804-2013; Wang, Haotian/Y-4976-2019; LIN, DINGCHANG/I-8410-2018; Liu, Yayuan/AAE-7317-2019; Liu, Chong/ABD-6611-2021","Xie, Jin/0000-0002-6270-1465; Cui, Yi/0000-0002-6103-6352; Wang, Haotian/0000-0002-3552-8978; LIN, DINGCHANG/0000-0002-9354-5952; Liu, Yayuan/0000-0002-0718-4784; Zhao, Jie/0000-0003-4543-3494",Global Climate and Energy Projects (GCEP) at Stanford University,Global Climate and Energy Projects (GCEP) at Stanford University,We acknowledge the support from Global Climate and Energy Projects (GCEP) at Stanford University.,,47,64,64,11,247,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1998-0124,1998-0000,,NANO RES,Nano Res.,APR,2017,4,,,,1213,1222,,10.1007/s12274-016-1300-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12274-016-1300-x,,,10,"Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,EQ9CQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000398382300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the exogenous factors driving wood formation onset and the underlying cellular mechanisms are still poorly understood and quantified, and this hampers an effective assessment of terrestrial forest productivity and carbon budget under global warming. Here, we used an extensive collection of unique datasets of weekly xylem tissue formation (wood formation) from 21 coniferous species across the Northern Hemisphere (latitudes 23 to 67 degrees N) to present a quantitative demonstration that the onset of wood formation in Northern Hemisphere conifers is primarily driven by photoperiod and mean annual temperature (MAT), and only secondarily by spring forcing, winter chilling, and moisture availability. Photoperiod interacts with MAT and plays the dominant role in regulating the onset of secondary meristem growth, contrary to its as-yet-unquantified role in affecting the springtime phenology of primary meristems. The unique relationships between exogenous factors and wood formation could help to predict how forest ecosystems respond and adapt to climate warming and could provide a better understanding of the feedback occurring between vegetation and climate that is mediated by phenology. Our study quantifies the role of major environmental drivers for incorporation into state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESM5), thereby providing an improved assessment of long-term and high-resolution observations of biogeochemical cycles across terrestrial biomes.","[Huang, Jian-Guo; Ma, Qianqian; Rossi, Sergio; Guo, Xiali; Yu, Biyun; Zhang, Shaokang; Zhang, Yaling] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jian-Guo; Ma, Qianqian; Zhang, Jiao-Lin; Guo, Xiali; Liu, Feng; Yu, Biyun; Zhang, Shaokang] Chinese Acad Sci, Core Bot Gardens, Ctr Plant Ecol, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Rossi, Sergio; Deslauriers, Annie; Krause, Cornelia; Lemay, Audrey; Morin, Hubert] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondament, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; [Biondi, Franco; Ziaco, Emanuele] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, DendroLab, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Fonti, Patrick; King, Gregory; Peters, Richard L.] Swiss Fed Res Inst Forest, Dendrosci, Snow & Landscape, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Liang, Eryuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Makinen, Harri; Jyske, Tuula; Nojd, Pekka] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Dept Forests, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Oberhuber, Walter; Gruber, Andreas; Swidrak, Irene] Leopold Franzens Univ Innsbruck, Dept Bot, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Rathgeber, Cyrille B.

Increased aerosol loading may have reduced historical surface evaporation over some locations(3), but the magnitude and extent of this effect is uncertain. Any reduction in evaporation due to historical solar dimming may have resulted in an increase in river flow. Here we formally detect and quantify the historical effect of changing aerosol concentrations, via solar radiation, on observed river flow over the heavily industrialized, northern extra-tropics. We use a state-of-the-art estimate of twentieth century surface meteorology(4) as input data for a detailed land surface model(5), and show that the simulations capture the observed strong inter-annual variability in runoff in response to climatic fluctuations. Using statistical techniques, we identify a detectable aerosol signal in the observed river flow both over the combined region, and over individual river basins in Europe and North America. We estimate that solar dimming due to rising aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere around 1980 led to an increase in river runoff by up to 25% in the most heavily polluted regions in Europe. We propose that, conversely, these regions may experience reduced freshwater availability in the future, as air quality improvements are set to lower aerosol loading and solar dimming.","[Gedney, N.; Weedon, G.

J,"Tonn, B",,,,"Tonn, B",,,Imprecise probabilities and scenarios,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper argues that imprecise probability can be used to describe uncertainty about scenarios. Scenarios are conceptualized as written descriptions of potential future worlds that are based on assessments of economic, political, social, technological, and environmental trends [This description of scenarios follows that provided by Peter Schwartz. P. Schwartz [9], The Art of the Long View, Doubleday, New York, 1991 [9]. Because written, qualitative scenarios are beginning to find application in important policy contexts, such as with respect to global climate change [N. Nakicenovic, R. Swart [5], Emission Scenarios: Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 2000 [5], where uncertainty estimates are of some importance to policy makers, there is a growing need to address the question of whether uncertainty estimates can be assessed over qualitative scenarios. Section I of this short paper contrasts imprecise probability with standard classical (or precise) probability. Section 2 provides a technique for assessing the amount of information (referred to as 'determinateness') expressed by imprecise (i.e. lower and upper) probabilities over a set of scenarios. Section 3 discusses how to assess to what degree the scenarios may represent the whole space of potential futures. Section 4 brings all the pieces together to show how scenario developers can use measures of determinateness and the coverage of a set of scenarios over all potential possible futures to improve the development and use of scenarios.

Hydrological monitoring is a widely employed method to understand the initiation mechanism of water-induced landslides under various climate conditions. Hydrological monitoring systems can provide relevant information that can be utilized in landslide early warning systems to mitigate the risk by issuing early warnings. These monitoring systems can be significantly enhanced, and wider deployments can be achieved through the recent developments within the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate a case study on an automated hydrological monitoring system supported by the IoT-based state-of-the-art technologies employing public mobile networks. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, suction sensors, and piezometers were used in the hydrological monitoring system to monitor the hydrological activities. The monitoring system was deployed in a case study area in central Norway at two locations of high susceptible geological units. During monitored period, the IoT-based hydrological monitoring system provided novel and valuable insights into the hydrological response of slopes to seasonally cold climates in terms of VWC and matric suction. The effects of rainfall, snow melting, ground freezing, and thawing were captured. The current study also made an attempt to integrate the collected data into a physical-based landslide susceptibility model to obtain a more consistent and reliable hazard assessment.","[Oguz, Emir Ahmet; Thakur, Vikas] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Depina, Ivan] SINTEF, Dept Rock & Geotech Engn, Torgarden 4760, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Myhre, Bard; Rustad, Helge] SINTEF, Dept Connect Technol & Platforms, Torgarden 4760, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Devoli, Graziella] Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate NV, Middelthuns Gate 29, N-0368 Oslo, Norway; [Depina, Ivan] Univ Split, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Geodesy, Matice Hrvatske 15, Split 21000, Croatia",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; SINTEF; Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate; University of Split,"Oguz, EA (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",emir.a.oguz@ntnu.no,,"Thakur, Vikas/0000-0001-8883-8075; Oguz, Emir Ahmet/0000-0002-1158-1926; Depina, Ivan/0000-0002-6063-1993; Myhre, Bard/0000-0002-0911-7083",R&D project KlimaDigital - Research Council of Norway [281059]; Croatian Government [KK.01.1.1.02.0027]; European Union through the Regional Development Fund - the Competitiveness and Cohesion Operational Programme,R&D project KlimaDigital - Research Council of Norway; Croatian Government; European Union through the Regional Development Fund - the Competitiveness and Cohesion Operational Programme,"The authors acknowledge support from the R&D project KlimaDigital (2018-2022, grant number: 281059) that is funded by the Research Council of Norway and several public and private partners.

Simultaneously, we are seeing a diversification of public expectations on the broader sustainable use of forest resources beyond timber production. As a result, the science and art of silviculture needs to adapt to these changing realities. In this piece, we argue that silviculturists are gradually shifting from the application of empirically derived silvicultural scenarios to new sets of approaches, methods and practices, a process that calls for broadening our conception of silviculture as a scientific discipline. We propose a holistic view of silviculture revolving around three key themes: observe, anticipate and adapt. In observe, we present how recent advances in remote sensing now enable silviculturists to observe forest structural, compositional and functional attributes in near-real-time, which in turn facilitates the deployment of efficient, targeted silvicultural measures in practice that are adapted to rapidly changing constraints. In anticipate, we highlight the importance of developing state-of-the-art models designed to take into account the effects of changing environmental conditions on forest growth and dynamics. In adapt, we discuss the need to provide spatially explicit guidance for the implementation of adaptive silvicultural actions that are efficient, cost-effective and socially acceptable. We conclude by presenting key steps towards the development of new tools and practical knowledge that will ensure meeting societal demands in rapidly changing environmental conditions. We classify these actions into three main categories: re-examining existing silvicultural trials to identify key stand attributes associated with the resistance and resilience of forests to multiple stressors, developing technological workflows and infrastructures to allow for continuous forest inventory updating frameworks, and implementing bold, innovative silvicultural trials in consultation with the relevant communities where a range of adaptive silvicultural strategies are tested. In this holistic perspective, silviculture can be defined as the science of observing forest condition and anticipating its development to apply tending and regeneration treatments adapted to a multiplicity of desired outcomes in rapidly changing realities.","[Achim, Alexis; Moreau, Guillaume; Flamand-Hubert, Maude; Thiffault, Evelyne] Univ Laval, Ctr Rech Sur Mat Renouvelables, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Pavillon Abitibi Price,2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Coops, Nicholas C.; Byrne, Kenneth E.; Eskelson, Bianca N., I; Goodbody, Tristan R.

One of the culturally most robust human routines is the heavy reliance of the Western societies on conventional meat sources such as beef, pork, and poultry, which were recently accused of causing particularly high climate costs. In this light, the UN (FAO) has suggested the increasing use of insects as an alternative source of animal protein intended for human diets. Yet, insects have not reached the mainstream of Western cuisine. Currently, a frequent promotion strategy of insects is to highlight the Utilitarian benefits associated with their consumption (e.g., with respect to the environment or one's health). The present research addresses the efficacy of such claims in a consumer research study involving 180 participants recruited from the general population in Germany. Arguing based on social-cognitive research in the area of moral and environmental psychology, we hypothesized and found that a focus on beneficial, but temporally distant motives (e.g., health)-counterintuitively-decreases consumption in comparison to immediate, hedonic advertisements (e.g., tasty). Furthermore, our study provides process evidence suggesting pretrial expectations induced by a particular claim mediate the relationship between claims and consumption. Thus, the present research not only refutes a state-of-the-art approach in the promotion of insects as food, but also provides an alternative approach and process evidence by integrating psychological factors.","[Berger, Sebastian; Wyss, Annika M.] Univ Bern, Inst Org, Dept Org & Human Resource Management, Bern, Switzerland; [Bartsch, Christian] Essento Food AG, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Christina] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Christandl, Fabian] Fresenius Univ Appl Sci, Sch Psychol, Cologne, Germany",University of Bern; University of Cologne,"Berger, S (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Org, Dept Org & Human Resource Management, Bern, Switzerland.",sebastian.berger@iop.unibe.ch,,"Wyss, Annika Marit/0000-0001-5134-2375",,,,,37,32,32,2,18,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-861X,,,FRONT NUTR,Front.

We collected 972 samples in Jiuquan during the period March 2019 through January 2020. The annual levels of PM10 (73.7 mu g/m(3)) exceeded the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (CAAQS) Grade II of 70 mu g/m(3). The percentages of the sum of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium, inorganic elements, organic carbon and elemental carbon in PM10 mass ranged 6.8-15.8%, 9.9-12.2%, 9.0-27.7%, and 1.5-4.7%, respectively. Analyses of sources indicated that soil dust was a major contributor to PM10 levels in Jiuquan city accounting for 24.8-30.5%. Fugitive dust and coal combustion were the second and third largest contributors to PM10, respectively. Our results suggest that natural emissions can make air quality regulation futile.

Abiotic stresses significantly impair plants' physiological, biochemical, molecular and cellular mechanisms, limiting crop productivity under adverse climate conditions. However, plants can implement essential mechanisms against abiotic stressors to maintain their growth and persistence under such stressful environments. In nature, plants have developed several adaptations and defence mechanisms to mitigate abiotic stress. Moreover, recent research has revealed that signalling molecules like hydrogen sulfide (H2S) play a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of environmental stresses in plants by implementing several physiological and biochemical mechanisms. Mainly, H2S helps to implement antioxidant defence systems, and interacts with other molecules like nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), phytohormones, etc. These molecules are well-known as the key players that moderate the adverse effects of abiotic stresses. Currently, little progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of the protective role of H2S; however, it is imperative to understand the molecular basis using the state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas gene-editing tool. Subsequently, genetic engineering could provide a promising approach to unravelling the molecular basis of stress tolerance mediated by exogenous/endogenous H2S. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the beneficial roles of H2S in conferring multiple abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Further, we also discuss the interaction and crosstalk between H2S and other signal molecules; as well as highlighting some genetic engineering-based current and future directions.","[Raza, A.; Sharif, Y.; Zhang, C.; Chen, H.] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ FAFU, Coll Agr, Oil Crops Res Inst,Key Lab, Ctr Legume Crop Genet & Syst Biol,Minist Educ Gen, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China; [Tabassum, J.] Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mubarik, M.

However, there is still no consensus on either the exact amount of ice needed to transport this sediment or how such a large volume of ice could be produced. Using an iceberg model that includes sediment, we simulate the delivery of sediment to the North Atlantic during such an event. Our model assumes that sediment is uniformly distributed within the ice with a concentration of 4%. Unlike sediment models which assume that the sediment lies in a single layer, this model can carry sediment all the way from the western to the eastern North Atlantic. We use a variety of different estimates for the total volume of ice released to model the sediment layer thickness and we show that to best fit the observations 60 x 10(4) km(3) (with a plausible range of 30-120 x 10(4) km(3)) of ice needs to be released. This is equivalent to a 0.04 Sv (10(6) m(3) s(-1), with a plausible range of 0.02-0.08 Sv) release of freshwater over the 500 yr of a typical Heinrich Event. This is a smaller flux of water than is required to show a significant impact on the global climate in most current state of the art GCMs. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Roberts, William H.

Partition-based regression typically introduces a quality-of-fit-driven decomposition of the domain. The emphasis in this work is on a topologically meaningful segmentation. Thus, the proposed regression approach is based on a segmentation induced by a discrete approximation of the Morse-Smale complex. This yields a segmentation with partitions corresponding to regions of the function with a single minimum and maximum that are often well approximated by a linear model. This approach yields regression models that are amenable to interpretation and have good predictive capacity. Typically, regression estimates are quantified by their geometrical accuracy. For the proposed regression, an important aspect is the quality of the segmentation itself. Thus, this article introduces a new criterion that measures the topological accuracy of the estimate. The topological accuracy provides a complementary measure to the classical geometrical error measures and is very sensitive to overfitting. The Morse-Smale regression is compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of geometry and topology and yields comparable or improved fits in many cases. Finally, a detailed study on climate-simulation data demonstrates the application of the Morse-Smale regression. Supplementary Materials are available online and contain an implementation of the proposed approach in the R package msr, an analysis and simulations on the stability of the Morse-Smale complex approximation, and additional tables for the climate-simulation study.","[Gerber, Samuel; Pascucci, Valerio; Whitaker, Ross T.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Ruebel, Oliver] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bremer, Peer-Timo] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Gerber, S (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",sgerber@cs.utah.edu,"Gerber, Samuel/AAK-1278-2020","Gerber, Samuel/0000-0001-9521-3145","Livermore Elks; National Institute of Health [U54-EB005149, 2-P41-RR12553-08]; NSF [CCF-073222]; U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy through the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program's Visualization and Analytics Center for Enabling Technologies (VACET) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES [P41RR012553] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING [U54EB005149] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [P41GM103545] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Livermore Elks; National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy through the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program's Visualization and Analytics Center for Enabling Technologies (VACET)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","The authors thank Peter G.

However, since the spectral signatures of artificial surfaces are similar to other bright natural surfaces, it is still a difficult task to separate artificial surfaces from other natural surfaces. Therefore, this study proposed a new Artificial Surface Index (ASI) to extract artificial surfaces based on the multispectral Landsat 8 imagery. We examined the performance of ASI in eight study areas with a variety of landscapes, including desert, coastal, inland urban and rural areas dominated by different climates and land cover categories. We also compared ASI with seven state-of-the-art built-up area or impervious surface indices that are developed for similar purposes. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that ASI has advantages in suppressing non-artificial surfaces with similar spectral signatures to artificial surfaces, such as deserts, bare soil, and harvested croplands. Furthermore, ASI improves the separability between artificial and non-artificial surfaces by 2% to 75% (measured by Jeffries-Matusita Distance), 13% to 164% (measured by Transformed Divergence), and 3% to 131% (measured by Spectral Discrimination Index) compared to the other seven indices across the eight study areas. The newly proposed ASI index has the potential to support a variety of human-activity-related studies, such as change detection of artificial surfaces, urban planning, land resource management at local, continental, and even global scales.","[Zhao, Yongquan; Zhu, Zhe] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT USA",University of Connecticut,"Zhao, YQ (corresponding author), U-4087,1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",yongquan.zhao@uconn.edu,,"Zhao, Yongquan/0000-0002-8360-6731",,,,,50,3,3,3,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1569-8432,1872-826X,,INT J APPL EARTH OBS,Int.

The implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) such as green walls in cities contributes to reducing the effects of a systemic issue: climate change. This field of research is constantly evolving, and there is a growing need for systematic analysis to understand the current scenario, identify gaps, and accelerate new lines of research. This review aims to demonstrate the impact of green walls on urban comfort by providing a systematic review of the state of the art in the field of temperature reduction and acoustic absorption, identifying the factors that influence urban comfort through the use of vegetation, and highlighting research gaps that can be further explored. The most relevant results have shown that the temperature reduction is mainly influenced by the shading capacity of the selected vegetation type, the evapotranspiration process of the plants, and the presence of substrate. Also, the acoustic absorption capacity is influenced to a greater extent by the system's configuration, the substrate's characteristics, and the vegetation's density. In both cases, the environmental conditions in which they are found can vary the impact to a greater or lesser extent. The results of this research are relevant for the implementation of green walls as a climate change mitigation tool in cities and the development of new research approaches.","[Oquendo-Di Cosola, V; Olivieri, F.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Construcc & Tecnol Arquitecton, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Av Juan Herrera 4, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Ruiz-Garcia, L.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Agroforestal, Av Complutense S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; ETS de Arquitectura; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Oquendo-Di Cosola, V (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Construcc & Tecnol Arquitecton, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Av Juan Herrera 4, Madrid 28040, Spain.",valentina.oquendo@upm.es,"OLIVIERI, FRANCESCA/L-7799-2014","OLIVIERI, FRANCESCA/0000-0002-0951-4863; Ruiz-Garcia, Luis/0000-0001-6656-6507; Oquendo-Di Cosola, Valentina/0000-0002-3783-3933",,,,,112,2,2,24,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

One such approach, named HydroBlocks, accomplishes this task while maintaining computational efficiency via Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), more commonly known as tiles in ESMs. In HydroBlocks, these HRUs are learned via a hierarchical clustering approach from available global high-resolution environmental data. However, until now there has yet to be a river routing approach that is able to leverage HydroBlocks' approach to modeling field-scale heterogeneity; bridging this gap will make it possible to more formally include riparian zone dynamics, irrigation from surface water, and interactive floodplains in the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic river routing scheme in HydroBlocks that is intertwined with the modeled field-scale land surface heterogeneity. Each macroscale polygon (a generalization of the concept of macroscale grid cell) is assigned its own fine-scale river network that is derived from very high resolution (similar to 30 m) digital elevation models (DEMs); the inlet-outlet reaches of a domain's macroscale polygons are then linked to assemble a full domain's river network. The river dynamics are solved at the reach-level via the kinematic wave assumption of the Saint-Venant equations. Finally, a two-way coupling between each HRU and its corresponding fine-scale river reaches is established. To implement and test the novel approach, a 1.0 degrees bounding box surrounding the Atmospheric Radiation and Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in northern Oklahoma (United States) is used. The results show (1) the implementation of the two-way coupling be tween the land surface and the river network leads to appreciable differences in the simulated spatial heterogeneity of the surface energy balance, (2) a limited number of HRUs (similar to 300 per 0.25 degrees cell) are required to approximate the fully distributed simulation adequately, and (3) the surface energy balance partitioning is sensitive to the river routing model parameters. The resulting routing scheme provides an effective and efficient path forward to enable a two-way coupling between the high-resolution river networks and state-of-the-art tiling schemes in ESMs.","[Chaney, Nathaniel W.; Torres-Rojas, Laura] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Vergopolan, Noemi] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fisher, Colby K.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Climate Analyt, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Duke University; Princeton University; Princeton University,"Chaney, NW (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",nathaniel.chaney@duke.edu,"Vergopolan, Noemi/P-4954-2016","Vergopolan, Noemi/0000-0002-7298-0509; Torres-Rojas, Laura/0000-0001-7319-2355","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Climate Program Office [NA19OAR4310241, NA19OAR4310244]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This research has been supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Climate Program Office (grant nos.

In this work we compare four state-of-the-art satellite fire products with the gridded, ground-based EFFIS dataset for Mediterranean Europe and analyse their statistical differences. The data are compared for spatial and temporal similarities at different aggregations to identify a spatial scale at which most of the observations provide equivalent results. The results of the analysis indicate that the datasets show high temporal correlation with each other (0.5/0.6) when aggregating the data at resolution of at least 1.0 degrees or at NUTS3 level. However, burned area estimates vary widely between datasets. Filtering out satellite fires located on urban and crop land cover classes greatly improves the agreement with EFFIS data. Finally, in spite of the differences found in the area estimates, the spatial pattern is similar for all the datasets, with spatial correlation increasing as the resolution decreases. Also, the general reasonable agreement between satellite products builds confidence in using these datasets and in particular the most-recent developed dataset, FireCCI51, shows the best agreement with EFFIS overall. As a result, the main conclusion of the study is that users should carefully consider the limitations of the satellite fire estimates currently available, as their uncertainties cannot be neglected in the overall uncertainty estimate/cascade that should accompany global or regional change studies and that removing fires on human-dominated land areas is key to analyze forest fires estimation from satellite products.","[Turco, Marco; Tourigny, Etienne] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Earth Sci Dept, C Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Herrera, Sixto] Univ Cantabria, Grp Meteorol, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Ciencias Computac, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Chuvieco, Emilio] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, Environm Remote Sensing Res Grp, Calle Colegios 2, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain; [Provenzale, Antonello] CNR, Inst Geosci & Earth Resources, Via Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Alcala; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR),"Turco, M (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Earth Sci Dept, C Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",turco.mrc@gmail.com,"García, Sixto Herrera/A-2573-2015; Chuvieco, Emilio/N-6448-2016; Turco, Marco/B-5814-2011; Tourigny, Etienne/L-3431-2016","García, Sixto Herrera/0000-0002-5384-179X; Chuvieco, Emilio/0000-0001-5618-4759; Turco, Marco/0000-0001-8589-7459; Tourigny, Etienne/0000-0003-4628-1461","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [740073, 748750]; European Union's Horizon 2020 ECOPOTENTIAL project [641762]",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(SKA South Africa); European Union's Horizon 2020 ECOPOTENTIAL project,"The authors thank EFFIS (European Forest Fire Information System of the European Commission Joint Research Centre, http://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu) for providing access to fire series EFFIS.

To protect water resources and their integrity for future use and to improve biodiversity, besides following advanced deficit irrigation strategies in fruit cultivation, attention could well be directed towards what are at present underused plant materials able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality. To this end, the state of the art as regards deficit irrigation strategies and the response of some very interesting emerging fruit crops [jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.), loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), pistachio (Pistacia vera L) and pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)] are reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies and the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops in the face of water stress are discussed. The response of these crops to deficit irrigation, with special attention paid to the effect on yield but also on fruit quality and health-related chemical compounds, was analysed in order to assess their suitability for saving water in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems and to analyze their potential role as alternatives to currently cultivated fruit crops with higher water requirements. Finally, the factors involved in establishing an identity brand (hydroSOS) to protect fruits obtained under specific DI conditions are discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It produces the environment for humans and at the same time studies the relationship between people and their environment. Architecture is not only the design of space, but the establishment of relations within this space (specifically, the relation between environment and users). In line with this, recent decades have seen constant emphasis on the importance of environmental and behavioral knowledge and interpretation within architectural theory in order to achieve environmental and cultural sustainability. The practice of applying these methods and knowledge in architecture, however, has still not been developed. One of the basic questions to be discussed in this context is the status of architecture: is architecture art or the design of environmental objects? There is a general tendency in contemporary architectural discourse to think about the built environment as objects and, consequently, about the perception of objects, rather than environmental perception. In other words, the emphasis is on dealing with objects as art, rather than as an environment. It is important to point out that design disciplines have a different concept of theory in comparison to scientific disciplines. Environmental and behavioral theories challenge the exclusivity of `architecture as an artistic paradigm' and point to the necessity of improving the theory of architectural design, as well as the introduction and application of theories from other scientific areas in architectural design. This paper starts from the assumption that architectural education has a very important position in this process. It is of utmost importance to acquaint students with the relevant theoretical paradigms in order to explain the existence of different forms of architectural thinking about users, but also the entire environment. Grounding theory in architectural design doesn't limit design creativity but opens possibilities for shifting the focus to the standpoint of a transactional paradigm in the context of contemporary architectural theory and practice. Such an approach leads to improving the architectural practice response to the aspects of the environment, climate, and place, as well as to the needs of contemporary society and culture, the unpredictability of human behavior, and the characteristics of local context.","[Trajkovic, J.

The major advances achieved in this period are: Meteorological databases are now available to the research community, partly as station data, with a growing number of freely available gridded datasets on decadal and centennial time scales. The free availability of meteorological datasets supports the development of more accurate forcing functions for Baltic Sea models. In the last decade, oceanographic data have become much more accessible and new important measurement platforms, such as FerryBoxes and satellites, have provided better temporally and spatially resolved observations. Our understanding of how large-scale atmospheric circulation affects the Baltic Sea climate, particularly in winter, has improved. Internal variability is strong illustrating the dominant stochastic behaviour of the atmosphere. The heat and water cycles of the Baltic Sea are better understood. The importance of surface waves in air-sea interaction is better understood, and Stokes drift and Langmuir circulation have been identified as likely playing an important role in surface water mixing in sea water. We better understand sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics in the coastal zone where sea ice interaction between land and sea is crucial. The Baltic Sea's various straits and sills are of increasing interest in seeking to understand water exchange and mixing. There has been increased research into the Baltic Sea coastal zone, particularly into upwelling, in the past decade. Modelling of the Baltic Sea-North Sea system, including the development of coupled land-sea-atmosphere models, has improved. Despite marked progress in Baltic Sea research over the last decade, several gaps remain in our knowledge and understanding. The current understanding of salinity changes is limited, and future projections of salinity evolution are uncertain. In addition, modelling of the hydrological cycle in atmospheric climate models is severely biased. More detailed investigations of regional precipitation and evaporation patterns (including runoff), atmospheric variability, highly saline water inflows, exchange between sub-basins, circulation, and especially turbulent mixing are still needed. Furthermore, more highly resolved oceanographic models are necessary. In addition, models that incorporate more advanced carbon cycle and ecosystem descriptions and improved description of water-sediment interactions are needed. There is also a need for new climate projections and simulations with improved atmospheric and oceanographic coupled model systems. These and other research challenges are addressed by the recently formed Baltic Earth research programme, the successor of the BALTEX programme, which ended in 2013. Baltic Earth will treat anthropogenic changes and impacts together with their natural drivers. Baltic Earth will serve as a network for earth system sciences in the region, following in the BALTEX tradition but in a wider context. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Prior to moving Waypoint's forensic programs into the Atrium, the Therapeutic Climate Study (TCS) was launched in order to monitor changes in perceived and objective safety indicators among forensic staff and patients. The present study consisted of a 5-year cross-sectional sequential design, consisting of both survey and hospital administrative data. Across all years of data collection, inpatients (N-total = 256) reported higher perceived safety when compared to staff (N-total = 932). However, changes in perceived safety were not linear and only slightly improved for staff over time. Sociodemographic characteristics and perceived recovery measures predicted perceived safety for staff and inpatients, regardless of the move. Male staff reported higher perceived quality of patient-service provider relationships and lower perceived safety, whereas female staff reported higher perceived patient cohesion and higher perceived safety. Both staff and inpatients who perceived the hospital's principles and practices as more recovery-oriented reported higher perceived safety. Inpatients who have been at the hospital longer reported lower perceived safety, regardless of the move. Hospital administrative data showed the number of incidents in a centralized emergency response system spiked right after the move but eventually tapered off, whereas the rates of violent incidents had increased and remained higher since moving to the new building. Results from this study suggest that staffs' and inpatients' sense of safety is determined by multiple factors, of which physical environment seems to play a less central role.","[Bridekirk, Jonathan] York Univ, Dept Psychol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Ham, Elke; Ball, Laura C.; Thege, Barna Konkoly] Waypoint Ctr Mental Hlth Care, Waypoint Res Inst, Penetanguishene, ON, Canada; [Thege, Barna Konkoly] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; University of Toronto,"Bridekirk, J (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Psychol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",jbride@yorku.ca,"Konkolÿ Thege, Barna/U-2253-2019","Konkolÿ Thege, Barna/0000-0002-0861-8978; Ham, Elke/0000-0001-7368-3090; Bridekirk, Jonathan/0000-0002-7493-8515",,,,,28,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1499-9013,1932-9903,,INT J FORENSIC MENT,Int.

In order to establish the non-human-induced effect of climate change on herpetofaunal diversity, we collected data from Pleistocene sites in the Sierra de Atapuerca complex (Burgos, Spain), which records the last few million years of changes. Diversity was measured in terms of richness and evenness indices and its relationship to the climatic parameters was analysed with OLS regression models. The highest diversity (richness and evenness; 1-D) occurred in periods considered to be analogues of the current interglacial, whereas minimum diversity values were reached during periods when conditions were harsher (cooler or glacial stage). In all cases, the diversity values were always restored subsequently, pointing to great resilience. Temperature proves to be the most influential climatic factor. Accordingly, amphibians and reptiles have been able to overcome previous climatic changes successfully. In contrast, the effects of anthropization have generated an uncommon loss of diversity, the like of which has not been seen in the last few million years. The data presented here demonstrate that the current amphibian loss seems to be driven by anthropogenic influence, with climate a factor of a secondary importance.","[Martinez-Monzon, Almudena; Bisbal-Chinesta, Josep-Francesc; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] CERCA, IPHES, Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social, Tarragona, Spain; [Martinez-Monzon, Almudena; Bisbal-Chinesta, Josep-Francesc; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Univ Rovira & Virgili URV, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Tarragona, Spain; [Cuenca-Bescos, Gloria] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Earth Sci, Aragosaurus IUCA, Zaragoza, Spain",ICREA; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Zaragoza,"Martinez-Monzon, A (corresponding author), CERCA, IPHES, Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social, Tarragona, Spain.;Martinez-Monzon, A (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili URV, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Tarragona, Spain.",amartinez@iphes.cat; cuencag@unizar.es; jbisbal@iphes.cat; hablain@iphes.cat,"Gloria, Cuenca-Bescós/A-3616-2013; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre/G-6005-2015","Gloria, Cuenca-Bescós/0000-0001-5125-9651; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre/0000-0002-9920-2707; Martinez-Monzon, Almudena/0000-0001-5120-9478; Bisbal-Chinesta, Josep Francesc/0000-0002-6017-5414",Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya [2019FI_B00487]; AGAUR [2017-SGR-859]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2016-80000-P]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CEX2019-000945-M];  [PGC2018-093925-B-C33],"Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR)(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); ","All the authors want to thank all the excavation team of the Atapuerca sites who contributed to the extraction, sieving and washing of sediments each year, within the project PGC2018-093925-B-C33.

Its main conclusion is that the storm and wave climate in most of the northeast Atlantic and in the North Sea has undergone significant variations on timescales of decades; it has indeed roughened in recent decades, but the present intensity of the storm and wave climate seems to be comparable with that at the beginning of this century. Part of this variability is found to be related to the North Atlantic oscillation. An analysis of a high-resolution climate change experiment, mimicking global warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations, results in a weak increase of storm activity and (extreme) wave heights in the Bay of Biscay and in the North Sea, while storm action and waves slightly decrease along the Norwegian coast and in most of the remaining North Atlantic area. A weak increase in storm surges in the southern and eastern part of the North Sea is expected. These projected anthropogenic changes at the time of CO2 doubling fall well within the limits of variability observed in the past. A major methodical obstacle for the assessment of changes in the intensity of storm and wave events are inhomogeneities in the observational record, both in terms of local observations and of analyzed products (such as weather maps), which usually produce an artificial increase of extreme winds. This occurs because older analyses were based on fewer observations and with more limited conceptual and numerical models of the dynamical processes than more recent analyses. Therefore the assessment of changes in storminess is based on local observations of air pressure and high-frequency variance at tide gauges. Data of this sort is available for 100 yr and sometimes more. The assessment of changes in the wave climate is achieved using a two-step procedure; first a state-of-the-art wave model is integrated with 40 yr of wind analysis; the results are assumed to be reasonably homogeneous in the area south of 70 degrees N and east of 20 degrees W; then a regression is built that relates monthly mean air pressure distributions to intramonthly percentiles of wave heights at selected locations with the help of the 40-yr simulated data; finally, observed monthly mean air pressure fields from the beginning of this century are fed into the regression model to derive best guesses of wave statistics throughout the century.","Clima Maritimo, Madrid, Spain; Det Norske Meteorol Inst, Bergen, Norway; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; Danmarks Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; Sveriges Meteorol & Hydrologiska Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden; Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Gdynia, Poland; Potsdam Inst Klimafolgenforsch, Potsdam, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Inst Meereskunde, D-2000 Hamburg, Germany; GKSS, Inst Gewasserphys, Geesthacht, Germany",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Max Planck Society; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Institute of Meteorology & Water Management; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Hamburg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"von Storch, H (corresponding author), Inst Hydrophys, GKSS Res Ctr, POB 21502, Geesthacht, Germany.",storch@gkss.de,"Kaas, Eigil/M-2590-2014; Miętus, Mirosław G./P-7486-2018; von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012","Kaas, Eigil/0000-0001-6970-2404; Miętus, Mirosław G./0000-0002-9488-071X; von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069; Schmith, Torben/0000-0003-3442-4381",,,,,56,270,272,0,39,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

The city, included within the Aurelian Walls, seemed to turn into a shipyard for the construction of several buildings linked to the function of a capital while neighborhoods for new social classes were being made to crown around the Old Town. It was, therefore, to create a dichotomy in the architecture of Rome for which public buildings, full of symbols, were represented by an eclecticism sometimes oversized, while private houses absorbed the traits of the modern architecture that already had spread across the Alps and into Italy took the name of Liberty. Hampered by the cultural climate, extremely closed towards European art, the architects gradually introduced the new style that, however, in Rome never reached the inspiring models. The fusion of the new trends with the constructive tradition gave rise to a particular architectural language recognizable in several buildings of the time. Among them deserves attention, the restructuring carried out in the first thirty years of the '900, in what is now the Great Hall of the building of the Faculty of Architecture in Piazza Borghese: an interesting solution that, even in its small size, contains the own characters of the architecture of the period bringing out the contrast between the linearity of Art Nouveau and the character of fortress attributed to specific architectural elements.","[Carnevali, Laura] Univ Sapienza, Dipartimento Storia Disegno & Restauro Architettu, Rome, Italy; [Bagordo, Giovanni Maria] Univ Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Edile & Ambientale, Naples, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Naples Federico II,"Carnevali, L (corresponding author), Univ Sapienza, Dipartimento Storia Disegno & Restauro Architettu, Rome, Italy.",laura.carnevali@uniroma1.it; gianmariabagordo@gmail.com,,"CARNEVALI, Laura/0000-0002-3219-3228",,,,,1,0,0,0,1,SCUOLA PITAGORA EDITRICE,NAPOLI,"PIAZZA SANTA MARIA DEGLI ANGELI, 1, NAPOLI, 80132, ITALY",,,978-88-6542-416-2,FABBR CONOSCENZA,,,2015,,,,,1421,1426,,,,,,6,Architecture; Art,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Art,BF3JE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000380548200159,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, quantification of GHGs from agricultural production systems has been the subject of intensive scientific investigation recently to help researchers, development workers, and policy makers to understand how mitigation can be integrated into policy and practice. However, GHG quantification from smallholder production system should also take into account farm productivity to make such research applicable for smallholder farmers. Therefore, estimation of farm productivity should also be an integral consideration when quantifying smallholder mitigation potential. A wide range of methodologies have been developed to estimate crop yields from smallholder production systems. In this chapter, we present the synthesis of the state-of-the-art of crop yield estimation methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. Besides the plot level measurements and sampling, use of crop models and remote sensing are valuable tools for production estimation but detailed parameterization and validation of such tools are necessary before such tools can be used under smallholder production systems. The decision on which method to be used for a particular situation largely depends on the objective, scale of estimation, and desired level of precision. We emphasize that multiple approaches are needed to optimize the resources and also to have precise estimation at different scales.","[Sapkota, Tek B.; Jat, M. L.; Jat, R.

Practiced for over 2,000 years by a variety of ancient civilizations, the art of manipulation for the purpose of correcting and restoring joint function has continued to flourish, despite opposition The climate, however is changing. The art of chiropractic is increasingly being seen as a uniquely devised and administered technique whereby high velocity, low amplitude thrusting maneuvers are specifically directed by the skilled practitioner toward spinal segments and peripheral articulations in an effort to correct aberrant mechanical function. The corrections are effected while utilizing the transverse and spinal processes of individual vertebrae as contacting levers. Hippocrates is credited with the advice to, Look well to the spine for the cause of disease, as displaced or degenerative vertebrae may irritate spinal nerve roots while exiting the intervertebral foramina and consequently, interfere with normal nerve function. Similarly, it is a fundamental precept of chiropractic philosophy that irritation of the nervous system by mechanical, chemical, or psychogenic means is considered as causative in the development of disease. The scientific evidence associated with chiropractic intervention in the treatment and management of musculoskeletal disorders and visceral diseases is growing. This paper discusses the history philosophy and efficacy of joint manipulation and its influence on the development of chiropractic treatment.","Canadian Mem Chiropract Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M4G 3E6, Canada; Canadian Mem Chiropract Coll, Dept Chiropract Principles & Practice, Toronto, ON M4G 3E6, Canada",,"Crawford, JP (corresponding author), Canadian Mem Chiropract Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 1900 Bayview Ave, Toronto, ON M4G 3E6, Canada.",,,,,,,,66,4,4,0,4,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1066-7814,,,CAN J APPL PHYSIOL,Can.

Community Earth System Model (CESM version 1.2.1) is a state-of-the-art coupled model that is widely used and participates in Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects. Community Atmospheric Model (CAM), the atmospheric component of CESM, is based on the finite-volume dynamic core, which utilizes staggered Arakawa-D grids. However, the dynamics-physics (D-P) coupling in CAM causes the prognostic winds of the dynamic core be interpolated onto non-staggered locations, which affects the wind structure for computing the air-sea interaction and dynamical coupling. In this study we propose a new scheme that eliminates the extra interpolation during D-P coupling for the atmosphere-ocean interaction. We show that it improves the simulated climatology in key regions including eastern boundary upwelling regions and Southern Oceans. Compared with the default scheme, the new approach simulates strong surface wind near coast in eastern boundary upwelling regions. As a result, existing problems of the model, such as warm SST biases in these regions, are reduced. Meanwhile, for Southern Ocean, the prevailing westerlies are enhanced in new scheme, resulting in meridional sea ice transport. As a result, the overestimation of sea ice extent and negative bias in SST is reduced. This new scheme is generally applicable to coupled models with staggered dynamics-physics, such as spectral-element method based CAM.","[Ma, Jialiang; Xu, Shiming; Wang, Bin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmosphere Sci & Geo, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shiming] Univ Corp Polar Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Xu, SM (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xu, SM (corresponding author), Univ Corp Polar Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xusm@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wang, Bin/P-9121-2014; Wang, Bin/D-9724-2012","Wang, Bin/0000-0001-7374-3786; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-3133-7197; Ma, Jialiang/0000-0001-5071-2004","National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFA0603902]; National Science Foundation of China [41575076]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [2019Z07L01001]; Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao)","National Key R & D Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao)","The authors would like to express sincere thanks to the editor and referees for the invaluable efforts in helping improve the manuscript.

Parts of East Asia, including southern Mongolia, northern China, and the Taklamakan Desert, are important dust source regions. Accurate simulations of dust storm events are crucial for protecting human health and assessing the climatic impacts of dust events. However, even state-of-the-art aerosol models still contain large uncertainties in soil dust simulations, particularly for the dust emissions over East Asia. In this study, we attempted to reduce these uncertainties by using an inverse modeling technique to simulate dust emissions. We used the measured mass concentration of particles less than 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) in the surface air over East Asia, in combination with an inverse model, to understand the dust sources. The global three-dimensional GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) was used as a forward model. The inverse model analysis yielded a 76% decrease in dust emissions from the southern region of the Gobi Desert, relative to the a priori result. The a posteriori dust emissions from the Taklamakan Desert and deserts in eastern and Inner Mongolia were two to three fold higher than the a priori dust emissions.

Water temperature research has experienced crucial advances, both in terms of developing new monitoring and modelling tools, as well as understanding the mechanisms of temperature feedbacks with biogeochemical and ecological processes. However, water practitioners and regulators are challenged with translating the widespread and complex technological, modelling and conceptual advances made in river temperature research into improvements in management practice. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the state-of-the-art monitoring and modelling tools available to inform ecological research and practice. In so doing, we identify pressing research gaps and suggest paths forward to address practical research and management challenges. The proposed research directions aim to provide new insights into spatio-temporal stream temperature dynamics and unravel drivers and controls of thermal river regimes, including the impacts of changing temperature on metabolism and aquatic biogeochemistry, as well as aquatic organisms. The findings of this review inform future research into ecosystem resilience in the face of thermal degradation and support the development of new management strategies cutting across spatial and temporal scales.","[Ouellet, Valerie; Hannah, David M.; Krause, Stefan] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Ouellet, Valerie; Hannah, David M.; Krause, Stefan] Univ Birmingham, Inst Global Innovat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [St-Hilaire, Andre; Proulx-Ouellet, Sebastien] INRS Eau Terre Environm, 490 Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada; [St-Hilaire, Andre] Canadian River Inst, 10 Bailey Dr,POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Dugdale, Stephen J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); University of Nottingham,"Ouellet, V (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",v.ouellet@bham.ac.uk,"St-Hilaire, André/W-7120-2019","Ouellet-Proulx, Sebastien/0000-0003-3816-6340; Krause, Stefan/0000-0003-2521-2248",,,,,243,31,31,12,53,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

In buildings equipped with climate control systems, the diseases related to the air quality can be significantly reduced if smart intervening procedures. aiming to control the concentration of pollutants in the indoor air, can be implemented in the heating, ventilation air conditioning unit. When reliable information about both the indoor and outdoor air quality is made available, the climate control system can provide the most appropriate amount of ventilation, ensuring safe and comfortable living conditions. In this paper, a dedicated, miniaturized, low-cost electronic nose based on state-of-the-art metal oxide sensors and signal processing techniques was developed. The proposed device is targeted to the quantification of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in mixtures with relative humidity and volatile organic compounds by using an optimized gas sensor array and highly effective pattern recognition techniques. The electronic nose was tested in an environment reproducing real operating conditions. Exploiting the unique response patterns of the different sensors in the array and the capability of a simple fuzzy-logic system it was possible to identify and discriminate concentrations as low as 20 ppb for NO2 and 5 ppm for CO in the test gas environment, allowing to reach the necessary sensitivity towards the target pollutants together with the selectivity towards the typical interfering gas species.

This study aims to compare the overall energetic efficiency and comfort provision of controlled natural ventilation in energy efficient offices and in the non-refurbished building stock with the related mechanically ventilated reference. The goal is to determine the energy savings for modern offices with low heating demand and higher summer cooling loads compared to existing office buildings, where heating loads dominate. To make sure that the simulation assumptions match the reality, the air-flow modelling of a single-sided ventilation strategy is validated by comparing it with results from tracer-gas measurements. Simulation results indicate that properly designed and controlled natural ventilation shows a good functionality in both state-of-the-art buildings and in the stock. In the moderate climate of Stuttgart/Germany no mechanical cooling is necessary. For state-of-the-art buildings ventilation energy losses in the heating season are easily compensated by lower cooling demand in the warm period of the year. In the building stock the conclusions are less clear, especially for densely occupied offices. Energy losses in the heating season can be compensated in the warm period, but primary energy savings are dependent on primary energy factors and hence how heat, cold and electricity are generated.

Exosomatic memory is the attribution of knowledge to objects, such as art or writing, which allows epistemology to be transmitted beyond the individual to subsequent generations of people. Exosomatic memory is the key to the transmission of culture and knowledge, beyond the individual who learns exclusively from personal experience. This places technologies such as writing and art in a key position for the education of culture and knowledge. Stiegler develops these ideas, following Martin Heidegger, Leroi-Gourhan and Derrida from the Palaeolithic to the contemporary. Maori use of natural objects as exosomatic transmission of intergenerational learning exceeds the technological enframing of modernity outlined by Heidegger. For indigenous peoples, exosomatic memory is cultural, technological and ecological. Stiegler argues that the impact of cybernetics on knowledge production is accelerating the technological enframing of knowledge (2018). Consequently, information technologies are leaving the human mind behind, in passive receptivity rather than dynamic creativity. The prefrontal cortex is slower than the internet, exacerbating a widening lag in active understanding, in favour of passive absorption. Alienation and epistemological entropy are trapping us in climate change and the anthropocentric Capitalocene. Maori insight may cut the Gordian knot and sidestep the alienation and determinism of technological modernity.","[Irwin, Ruth; White, Te Haumoana] RMIT Univ, Educ, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Irwin, R (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Educ, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",ruth.irwin@gmail.com,,"Irwin, Ruth/0000-0002-9665-9330",,,,,40,2,2,2,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1857,1469-5812,,EDUC PHILOS THEORY,Educ.

In addition to their substantial effect on visible and infrared radiation, they affect the signal of millimeter radars by producing nonnegligible attenuation. Such attenuation must be properly corrected if the information of millimeter radars is used in quantitative retrievals for inferring ice microphysical properties. This study proposes a multisensor scheme for refining the vertical distribution of supercooled liquid water content (SLWC) compared to state-of-the-art methods that equipartition the liquid water path measured by microwave radiometer to all pixels identified as cloudy by the radars and warmer than -40 degrees C. Our methodology is applicable in high-latitude, mixed-phase environments based on the synergy between radar and lidar binary cloud phase masking, microwave radiometer, and radio sounding observations. The technique is demonstrated via data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program climate research facility at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Path integrated attenuation (PIA) at W- and G-band frequencies (>95 GHz) is then assessed. Results indicate that the different in-cloud distributions of the liquid condensate lead to round-trip PIA discrepancies of cloudy volumes that range in [2, 5] dB at W- and G-band frequencies. These differences far exceed those encountered when changing some of the algorithm's arbitrary assumptions and weighting functions.","[Kalogeras, Petros; Battaglia, Alessandro] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Kalogeras, Petros; Battaglia, Alessandro] NCEO, Leicester LE4 5SP, Leics, England; [Battaglia, Alessandro] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Ingn Ambiente Terr & Infrastrutture, I-10129 Turin, Italy",University of Leicester; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Kalogeras, P (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",pk256@leicester.ac.uk,,"Battaglia, Alessandro/0000-0001-9243-3484",U.S. Atmospheric System Research [DESC0017967]; U.K.-NCEO,U.S. Atmospheric System Research; U.K.-NCEO,This work was supported by the U.S. Atmospheric System Research under Grant DESC0017967.

This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Coordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply-demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, the potential for smart city policies to help make significant energy (and related greenhouse gas) savings in urban transport and building construction and operation is investigated. The main fmdings are that although significant potential exists, it will not be realised unless supporting policies are in place.

Analyzing methane atmospheric mixing and stable isotope ratios in air trapped in polar ice sheets helps in reconstructing the evolution of its sources and sinks in the past. This is important to improve predictions of atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios in the future under the influence of a changing climate. The aim of this study is to assess whether past atmospheric delta C-13(CH4) variations can be reliably reconstructed from firn air measurements. Isotope reconstructions obtained with a state of the art firn model from different individual sites show unexpectedly large discrepancies and are mutually inconsistent. We show that small changes in the diffusivity profiles at individual sites lead to strong differences in the firn fractionation, which can explain a large part of these discrepancies. Using slightly modified diffusivities for some sites, and neglecting samples for which the firn fractionation signals are strongest, a combined multisite inversion can be performed, which returns an isotope reconstruction that is consistent with firn data. However, the isotope trends are lower than what has been concluded from Southern Hemisphere (SH) archived air samples and high-accumulation ice core data. We conclude that with the current datasets and understanding of firn air transport, a high precision reconstruction of delta C-13 of CH4 from firn air samples is not possible, because reconstructed atmospheric trends over the last 50 yr of 0.3-1.5 parts per thousand are of the same magnitude as inherent uncertainties in the method, which are the firn fractionation correction (up to similar to 2 parts per thousand at individual sites), the Kr isobaric interference (up to similar to 0.8 parts per thousand, system dependent), inter-laboratory calibration offsets (similar to 0.2 parts per thousand) and uncertainties in past CH4 levels (similar to 0.5 parts per thousand).","[Sapart, C.

There are two traits for the kind of temperature change scenario. Firstly, the kind of temperature change scenario considers the regional and seasonal differences in North-South transect of eastern China. The character of the temperature change is similar to the observation data due to the observational constraint. Secondly, the kind of temperature change scenario causes the maximal possible impact on the simulated NPP to discuss the maximal uncertainty in the simulated NPP to the temperature change in North-South transect of eastern China. Other two kinds of temperature change scenarios are also applied to explain the above two traits and to analyze variations due to different kinds of temperature change scenarios. It is shown that the kind of temperature change scenario resulted of the CNOP-P approach, which is called as the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario, exhibits the regional and seasonal temperature differences in North-South transect of eastern China. The NPP decreases by 1.84% in northern China, and respectively increases by 4.09% and 18.99% in northeastern and southern China as the results of the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario, though the NPP increases in small part of northern China and decreases in part of northeastern China. The variations in the NPP caused by the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario are different to those by the other two types of temperature change scenarios in northern, northeastern China and southern China. The impact of the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario on the NPP is intenser than that of the other two types of temperature change scenarios. The seasonal analyses demonstrate that the differences among the variations in the NPP due to three types of temperature change scenarios principally stem from the variations in spring, summer and autumn. The above results imply that the regional and seasonal temperature change play a key role in estimating the uncertainty of the NPP, and the CNOP-P approach could afford a possible temperature change scenario to reflect the regional and seasonal temperature change.

There is a growing demand from the ecosystem modeling community to use these products for model evaluation and data assimilation. Yet, from the perspective of an ecosystem modeler these products are of limited use unless: (i) the phytoplankton products provided by the remote-sensing community match those required by the ecosystem modelers; and (ii) information on per-pixel uncertainty is provided to evaluate data quality. Using a large dataset collected in the North Atlantic, we re-tune a method to estimate the chlorophyll concentration of three phytoplankton groups, partitioned according to size [pico- (< R m), nano- (2-20 mu m) and micro-phytoplankton (>20 mu m)]. The method is modified to account for the influence of sea surface temperature, also available from satellite data, on model parameters and on the partitioning of microphytoplankton into diatoms and dinoflagellates, such that the phytoplankton groups provided match those simulated in a state of the art marine ecosystem model (the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model, ERSEM). The method is validated using another dataset, independent of the data used to parameterize the method, of more than 800 satellite and in situ match-ups. Using fuzzy-logic techniques for deriving per-pixel uncertainty, developed within the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), the match-up dataset is used to derive the root mean square error and the bias between in situ and satellite estimates of the chlorophyll for each phytoplankton group, for 14 different optical water types (OWT). These values are then used with satellite estimates of OWTs to map uncertainty in chlorophyll on a per pixel basis for each phytoplankton group. It is envisaged these satellite products will be useful for those working on the validation of, and assimilation of data into, marine ecosystem models that simulate different phytoplankton groups.","[Brewin, Robert J.

Allen, Allen, Cumming and Johan take a closer look at the links between different types of capitalism and the natural environment. The authors stress the importance of adopting an institutional perspective to explain differences in environmental outcomes. Wood compares the transitions of energy usage and mixes between liberal and coordinated market economies from a historical perspective. He looks for parallels between the energy transition from coal to oil and gas to the current renewables. Nicklich and Endo answer the question 'Do globalization and globally perceived occurrences of environmental problems lead to a convergence of energy supply?'. They compare the fields of German and Japanese wind power with a particular focus on Greenpeace after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.

However, the over-smoothing issue of GCN would produce indistinguishable features among nodes, leading to poor expressivity and weak capability of modeling complex dependencies and dynamics. To address this issue, we present a novel clustering spatial-temporal (ClusterST) unit, which incorporates unsupervised learning into GCN for extracting discriminative features. Specifically, we first exploit a neural network to learn a dynamic clustering, i.e., learning to partition the neighbors of each node into clusters at each time step. Two probabilistic losses are proposed to improve the separability of clusters. Then, the extracted features of different clusters can be distinguished. Based on the dynamically formed clusters, a vanilla GCN is applied to aggregate features within each cluster. By purely exploiting such a ClusterST unit, large improvements over the state-of-the-art are achieved. Furthermore, ClusterST units with a different number of clusters can be regarded as basic components to construct an inception-like ClusterST network for going deeper. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large-scale traffic datasets and observe an average improvement of $18.19\%$ and $7.62\%$ over state-of-the-art baselines, respectively. The code and models will be publicly available.","[Luo, Guiyang; Yuan, Quan; Li, Jinglin] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Luo, Guiyang; Yuan, Quan] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hui] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automation, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Innovat Ctr Parallel Vis, Qingdao 266000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Syst Engn, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Xidian University; Beijing Jiaotong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Macau University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, H (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62102041, 62203040, 61876023, 62272053]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62102041, Grant 62203040, Grant 61876023, and Grant 62272053.",,60,0,0,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1524-9050,1558-0016,,IEEE T INTELL TRANSP,IEEE Trans.

With parameters derived from the site, the Environmental Protection Agency Stormwater Management Model (EPA-SWMM) predicted event total runoff volume and event peak runoff rates to within +10% to -20% and +25% to -15% of the observations, respectively. The analysis further indicated that approximately 55% of the cumulative precipitation that fell on the JJCC extensive green roof during the monitoring period (warm weather months, June 2014-November 2017) was captured and retained. The average percent retained on an event-basis was 77%, and average event runoff coefficient was 0.7, implying a substantial reduction in the volume and rate of runoff generated from the roof compared to the pre-green roof condition, when most, if not all, of the precipitated water would have immediately resulted in runoff. Our research suggests that, on average, 96% of rainfall events 6.35 mm or less were retained within the green roof, whereas 27% of the total event volume was retained for events greater than 12.7 mm in depth. A sensitivity analysis suggests if the substrate depth were increased, better stormwater capture performance would be achieved, but only up 127 mm, whereas increased precipitation coupled with warmer temperatures as a result of climate change could decrease the performance by up to 5%, regardless of substrate depth. An equivalency analysis suggested that even shallow green roofs can significantly reduce the required stormwater detention volume that New York City requires on new development. This particular green roof appears to be more than 18 times as cost-effective as a subsurface cistern would be for managing an equivalent volume of stormwater in Midtown Manhattan.","[Abualfaraj, Noura; Woerdeman, Sloane; Montalto, Franco A.] Drexel Univ, Coll Engn, CAEE Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cataldo, Joseph; Elborolosy, Yara; Fagan, Daniel] Cooper Union Adv Sci & Art, Albert Nerken Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Carson, Tyler] Arcadis New York Inc, Long Isl City, NY 13057 USA",Drexel University,"Montalto, FA (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Coll Engn, CAEE Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nafaraj@gmail.com; catald@cooper.edu; yaraelborolosy7392@gmail.com; fagan.cooper@gmail.com; sjw83@drexel.edu; Tyler.Carson@arcadis.com; fam26@drexel.edu,,,Consortium for Climate Risks in the Urban Northeast; Jacob K.

The primary foci for this study are marine low cloud observations over a heavily instrumented site on the Azores archipelago in the Eastern North Atlantic and their associated raindrop size distribution (DSD) properties, relative low cloud contributions to the precipitation, and additional sampling (instrument, environmental) considerations. The contribution from low clouds (e.g., cloud top < 4 km) to the overall precipitation over midlatitude oceans is poorly understood, in part because of the lack of coupled, high-quality measurements of precipitation and low cloud properties. Cloud regime and precipitation breakdowns performed for a multiyear (2014-2017) record emphasize diurnal precipitation and raindrop size distribution characteristics for both low and deeper clouds, as well as differences between the two disdrometer types used. Results demonstrate that marine low clouds over this Eastern North Atlantic location account for a significant (45%) contribution to the total rainfall and exhibit a diurnal cycle in cloud (thickness, top, and base) and precipitation characteristics similar to satellite records. Additional controls on observed surface rainfall characteristics of low clouds allowed by the extended ground-based facility data sets are also explored. From those analyses, it is suggested that the synoptic state exerts a significant control on low cloud and surface precipitation properties.","[Giangrande, Scott E.; Wang, Die; Bartholomew, Mary Jane; Jensen, Michael P.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Mechem, David B.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geog & Atmospher Sci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Hardin, Joseph C.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Wood, Robert] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; University of Kansas; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Giangrande, SE (corresponding author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",sgrande@bnl.gov,"Wood, Robert/A-2989-2008; Jensen, Michael/M-5722-2017; Hardin, Joseph/F-7973-2018; WANG, Die/C-8141-2018","Wood, Robert/0000-0002-1401-3828; Jensen, Michael/0000-0003-4731-6814; Hardin, Joseph/0000-0002-8489-4763; WANG, Die/0000-0002-4175-4306","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0012704]; Office of Biological and Environmental Research; Atmospheric Systems Research (ASR) program of Office of Biological and Environmental Research; Climate Model Development and Validation (CMDV) - Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the U.S. DOE, Office of Science; DOE Office of Science [DE-SC0016522]","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Biological and Environmental Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Atmospheric Systems Research (ASR) program of Office of Biological and Environmental Research; Climate Model Development and Validation (CMDV) - Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the U.S. DOE, Office of Science; DOE Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This paper has been authored by employees of Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC, under contract DE-SC0012704 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

To continue the goal of enhanced polar mesoscale modeling, polar optimization should now be applied toward the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Evaluations and optimizations are especially needed for the boundary layer parameterization, cloud physics, snow surface physics, and sea ice treatment. Testing and development work for Polar WRF begins with simulations for ice sheet surface conditions using a Greenland-area domain with 24-km resolution. The winter month December 2002 and the summer month June 2001 are simulated with WRF, version 2.1.1, in a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC. The results motivated several improvements to Polar WRF, especially to the Noah land surface model (LSM) and the snowpack treatment. Different physics packages for WRF are evaluated with December 2002 Simulations that show variable forecast skill when verified with the automatic weather station observations. The WRF simulation with the combination of the modified Noah LSM, the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic boundary layer parameterization, and the WRF single-moment microphysics produced results that reach or exceed the success standards of a Polar MM5 simulation for December 2002. For summer simulations of June 2001, WRF simulates an improved surface energy balance, and shows forecast skill nearly equal to that of Polar MM5.","[Hines, Keith M.; Bromwich, David H.] Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Polar Meteorol Grp, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bromwich, David H.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hines, KM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Polar Meteorol Grp, 1090 Carmack Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",hines.91@osu.edu,"Bromwich, David/C-9225-2016",,,,,,64,163,172,3,33,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

For instance, global climate change-the biggest challenge we have ever faced-is directly impacting wellbeing, and even the existence of humankind, in the long run. During the last two decades, the notion of the smart city-particularly the sustainable development of smart cities-has become a popular topic not only for scholars, particularly in the fields of technology, science, urban and environmental planning, development, and management, but also for urban policymakers and professional practitioners. This was due to digital technologies becoming a powerful enabler in stimulating paradigmatic shifts in urban development-related visions, strategies, implementation, and learning. This paper offers a critical review of the key literature on the issues relating to approaches, advances, and applications in the sustainable development of smart cities. It also introduces contributions from the Special Issue, and speculates on the prospective research directions to place necessary mechanisms to secure a smart and sustainable urban future for all.","[Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Han, Hoon] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, City Planning Program, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kamruzzaman, Md.] Monash Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University,"Yigitcanlar, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au; h.han@unsw.edu.au; md.kamruzzaman@monash.edu,"Kamruzzaman/AAG-5909-2020; Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012; Han, Hoon/ABC-7783-2022","Kamruzzaman/0000-0001-7113-942X; Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; Han, Hoon/0000-0003-3200-7728",,,,,71,7,8,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,DEC,2019,23,,,,,,4554,10.3390/en12234554,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12234554,,,11,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,KM4IF,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000514090100152,View Full Record in Web of Science

Processes determining salinity and oxygen conditions in the basins are influenced both by long term gradual climate change, e.g. global warming, but also by short-term meteorological variations and events. Specifically one main factor influencing cod spawning conditions, the advection of highly saline and well-oxygenated water masses from the North Sea, is observed in irregular frequencies and causes strong interannual variations in stock productivity. This study investigates the possibility to use the available hydrographic process knowledge to predict the annual spawning conditions for Eastern Baltic cod in its most important spawning ground, the Bornholm Basin, only by salinity measurements from a specific location in the western Baltic. Such a prediction could serve as an environmental early warning indicator to inform stock assessment and management. Here we used a hydrodynamic model to hindcast hydrographic property fields for the last 40+ years. High and significant correlations were found for months early in the year between the 33m salinity level in the Arkona Basin and the oxygen-dependent cod spawning environment in the Bornholm Basin. Direct prediction of the Eastern Baltic cod egg survival in the Bornholm Basin based on salinity values in the Arkona Basin at the 33 m depth level is shown to be possible for eggs spawned by mid-age and young females, which currently predominate the stock structure. We recommend to routinely perform short-term predictions of the Eastern Baltic cod spawning environment, in order to generate environmental information highly relevant for stock dynamics. Our statistical approach offers the opportunity to make best use of permanently existing infrastructure in the western Baltic to timely provide scientific knowledge on the spawning conditions of Eastern Baltic cod. Furthermore it could be a tool to assist eco-system-based fisheries management with a cost-effective implementation by including the short term predictions as a simple indicator in the annual assessments.","[von Dewitz, Burkhard; Hoeflich, Katharina; Hinrichsen, Hans-Harald] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Tamm, Susanne] Fed Maritime & Hydrog Agcy, Hamburg, Germany; [Voss, Ruediger] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Sustainable Fishery, Kiel, Germany",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel,"von Dewitz, B (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",bdewitz@geomar.de,"Voss, Rudi/A-6113-2011","Hoflich, Katharina/0000-0001-7719-5596; Voss, Rudi/0000-0002-4299-8791","BONUS (INSPIRE project); BONUS (BIO-C3 project); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme [Art 185]; European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (Forschungszentrum Julich Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (Germany)) [03F0682A]; BMBF [03F0682A]; Granholms stiftelse; Baltic Eye at Stockholm University Baltic Sea Centre","BONUS (INSPIRE project); BONUS (BIO-C3 project); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme; European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (Forschungszentrum Julich Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (Germany)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Granholms stiftelse; Baltic Eye at Stockholm University Baltic Sea Centre","The research leading to these results has received funding from BONUS (INSPIRE and BIO-C3 projects), the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (Forschungszentrum Julich Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (Germany) and BMBF (Grant No. 03F0682A).

We found that ozone abundances fluctuated interannually by about +/- 7% (or +/- 6 ppbv from the 20-year mean of similar to 80 ppbv). In the 20-year mean, ozone transported from Asia and ozone produced locally were the dominant sources of ozone, accounting for 31% and 23%, respectively, of ozone abundances over the Middle East, with an interannual variability of +/- 30% and +/- 15%, respectively. We found that the interannual variations in the Asian and local sources were related to the strengths of the South Asian High and the Arabian anticyclone, respectively. In years when the Asian influence was weaker in the region, transport from other areas, such as North America, was enhanced. Consequently, variations in ozone transported from Asia were strongly anti-correlated with variations in ozone transported from North America, for example, with a correlation coefficient of r = -0.75. This trade-off between transport from Asia and other regions was found to be linked to the position and strength of the subtropical westerly jet over central Asia. When the westerly jet is displaced poleward, transport of ozone from Asia is enhanced and transport from North America and other regions in the Northern Hemisphere is diminished. In contrast, when the jet is displaced equatorward, transport of ozone from Asia is diminished and transport from North America and other regions in the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced. These results suggest that climate-related changes in the position of the westerly jet will have implications for the transport of pollution into the Middle East.","[Liu, Jane J.; Jones, Dylan B.

Critically, the fit between available marine forecast products, fish harvesters' needs, and harvester's decision-making processes has not been rigorously assessed. This paper addresses these gaps by documenting a) weather-related decision-making by harvesters, and its relationship to forecasts across multiple regions and fisheries on Canada's East coast (Newfoundland) and b) the dynamics of forecast production priorities. Methods: A multi-disciplinary, community-engaged research approach, conducted in partnership with the Newfoundland and Labrador Fish Harvesting Safety Association (NL-FHSA). Data consist of semi-structured interviews with fish harvesters and weather forecasters, focused on marine forecast production and use. Results: Results emphasize that there is a subjective art to both production and use of marine forecasts. Forecasters and harvesters share several common values regarding forecasts, but different emphases: forecasters favor some combination of accuracy, consistency, and utility, while harvesters are largely concerned with utility. Finally, harvesters' decision-making is based on nuanced and contextual interpretations of a few key hazards (winds and, to a lesser extent, waves). Conclusion: This community-engaged research has triggered experimentation with forecasts tailored to fisheries utility within Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). It lays the groundwork for ongoing, mutually beneficial dialogue between forecasters and harvesters, engaging harvesters with the forecasting process while familiarizing forecasters with harvester's decision-making processes. Ongoing industry partnerships (NL-FHSA) continue to sustain momentum from this study towards further enhancing the utility of future marine forecasts for small-scale harvesters.","[Finnis, Joel] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF, Canada; [Shewmake, James W.; Neis, Barb] Mem Univ Newfoundland, SafetyNet Ctr Occupat Hlth & Safety Res, St John, NF, Canada; [Telford, Devon] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Meteorol Serv Canada, Gander, NF, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; Memorial University Newfoundland; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada,"Finnis, J (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF, Canada.",jfinnis@mun.ca,,"Shewmake, James/0000-0002-2015-6358",MITACS Accelerate program; MEOPAR-NCE,MITACS Accelerate program; MEOPAR-NCE,This work was supported by the MEOPAR-NCE and the MITACS Accelerate program.,,29,10,10,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1059-924X,1545-0813,,J AGROMEDICINE,J.

The supermodel approach enables a quicker correction of the model errors. In this study we connect different versions of SPEEDO, a global atmosphere-ocean-land model of intermediate complexity, into a supermodel. We focus on a weighted supermodel, in which the supermodel state is a weighted superposition of different imperfect model states. The estimation, the training, of the optimal weights of this combination is a critical aspect in the construction of a supermodel. In our previous works two algorithms were developed: (i) cross pollination in time (CPT)-based technique and (ii) a synchronization-based learning rule (synch rule). Those algorithms have so far been applied under the assumption of complete and noise-free observations. Here we go beyond and consider the more realistic case of noisy data that do not cover the full system's state and are not taken at each model's computational time step. We revise the training methods to cope with this observational scenario, while still being able to estimate accurate weights. In the synch rule an additional term is introduced to maintain physical balances, while in CPT nudging terms are added to let the models stay closer to the observations during training Furthermore, we propose a novel formulation of the CPT method allowing the weights to be negative. This makes it possible for CPT to deal with cases in which the individual model biases have the same sign, a situation that hampers constructing a skill-fully weighted supermodel based on positive weights. With these developments, both CPT and the synch rule have been made suitable to train a supermodel consisting of state of the art weather and climate models.","[Schevenhoven, Francine] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; [Schevenhoven, Francine] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Schevenhoven, Francine] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO USA; [Carrassi, Alberto] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol & NCEO, Reading, Berks, England; [Carrassi, Alberto] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron Augusto Righi, Bologna, Italy",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Reading; University of Bologna,"Schevenhoven, F (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway.;Schevenhoven, F (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.;Schevenhoven, F (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO USA.",francine.schevenhoven@uib.no,,,H2020 European Research Council [648982]; Trond Mohn Foundation [BFS2018TMT01]; NSF [2015618]; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NCEO02004],H2020 European Research Council; Trond Mohn Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This research has been supported by the H2020 European Research Council (grant no.

The pants work by mechanically shortening when a cyclist wearing the pants enters an area of Seattle, USA, which is projected to be impacted by sea-level rise in 30-80 years. This interaction 'bends time' by allowing cyclists to feel future climate change data in the present. First, we discuss the research through design process of creating the High Water Pants including foundational research, a description of the design concept and results of a preliminary study with the pants. Second, we discuss three implications of the pants for human-computer interaction (HCI): (1) they offer the concept of a 'present/future' paradigm for embodied speculation, (2) our research process demonstrates how to successfully involve more-than-human perspectives, and (3) we articulate how the High Water Pants respond to shifts in HCI's framing of sustainability.","[Biggs, Heidi R.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Desjardins, Audrey] Univ Washington, Sch Art Art Hist Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Biggs, HR (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",heidbigg@iu.edu; adesjard@uw.edu,,,,,,,50,4,4,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-6708-0,,,,2020,,,,,,,,10.1145/3313831.3376429,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376429,,,13,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS1SH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000695438100101,View Full Record in Web of Science

The range of specializations and adaptations of phytoplankton to a wide variety of environmental conditions is astounding. This demonstrates the susceptibility of highly different populations to react rapidly to environmental changes generated by natural stressors and anthropogenic impacts. The aim of this work is to critically review the state of the art of knowledge about the impact of anthropogenic stress factors on phytoplankton composition and structure. At present, the two most important environmental stressors are represented by climate change and eutrophication, which act globally and at regional/local scales, respectively. Along with effects mediated by many other legacy and emerging stressors (briefly reviewed), the effects of these two main changes have been analysed at different levels of phytoplankton organization, i.e. individuals, populations and communities. It is stressed that a better knowledge will be obtained by extending the focus of studies from organisms detectable by light microscopy to the whole range of protists and microbial populations detected with the use of omics technologies, including e.g. next generation sequencing and ecological metabolomics.","[Salmaso, Nico; Tolotti, Monica] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy",Fondazione Edmund Mach,"Salmaso, N (corresponding author), Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy.",nico.salmaso@fmach.it,"Tolotti, Monica/D-4441-2018; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015","Tolotti, Monica/0000-0003-2674-8597; Salmaso, Nico/0000-0001-6057-3642",,,,,333,11,11,14,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2021,1,,SI,,251,284,,10.1007/s10750-020-04323-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04323-w,,20-Jun,34,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,PA1MX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000539847500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main hazards originating from coastal storms are inundation and erosion, and their magnitude and extent needs to be accurately assessed for effective management of coastal risk. The use of state-of-art morphodynamic process-based models is becoming standard, with most being applied to straight coastlines with gentle slopes. In this study, the XBeach model is used to assess the coastal response of a curvilinear sensitive deltaic coast with coarse sediment and steep slopes (intermediate-reflective conditions). The tested hypothesis is that changes in wave direction may cause large variations in the magnitude of storm-induced hazards. The model is tested against field data available for the Sant Esteve Storm (December 2008), obtaining an overall BSS (Brier Skill Score) score on the emerged morphological response of 0.68. Later, the 2008 event is used as baseline scenario to create synthetic events covering the range from NE to S. The obtained results show that storm-induced hazards along a highly curvilinear coast are very sensitive to changes in wave direction. Therefore, even under climate scenarios of relatively steady storminess, a potential shift in wave direction may significantly change hazard conditions and thus, need to be accounted for in robust damage risk assessments.","[Sanuy, Marc; Jimenez, Jose A.] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Lab Engn Maritima, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Campus Nord D1, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Sanuy, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Lab Engn Maritima, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Campus Nord D1, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",marc.sanuy@upc.edu; jose.jimenez@upc.edu,"Jimenez, Jose A./I-7827-2014; Jimenez, Jose A./N-3267-2019","Jimenez, Jose A./0000-0003-0900-4684; Jimenez, Jose A./0000-0003-0900-4684","EU [603458]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE) [CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport","EU(European Commission); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE); Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport","This study was conducted in the framework of the RISC-KIT (Grant No 603458) and the M-CostAdapt (CTM2017-83655-C2-1-R) research projects, funded by the EU and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO/AEI/FEDER, UE) respectively.

Traditional debates tend toward global solutions, blaming either dramatic climate change or dispersals of Homo sapiens to new regions. Inherent limitations to archaeological and paleontological data sets often require reliance on scant, poorly resolved lines of evidence. However, recent developments in scientific technologies allow for more local, context-specific approaches. In the present article, we highlight how developments in five such methodologies (radiocarbon approaches, stable isotope analysis, ancient DNA, ancient proteomics, microscopy) have helped drive detailed analysis of specific megafaunal species, their particular ecological settings, and responses to new competitors or predators, climate change, and other external phenomena. The detailed case studies of faunal community composition, extinction chronologies, and demographic trends enabled by these methods examine megafaunal extinctions at scales appropriate for practical understanding of threats against particular species in their habitats today.","[Swift, Jillian A.; Petraglia, Michael; Boivin, Nicole; Roberts, Patrick] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany; [Swift, Jillian A.] Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Dept Anthropol, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA; [Bunce, Michael] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Trace & Environm DNA Lab, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Dortch, Joe] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Rock Art Res & Management, Perth, WA, Australia; [Douglass, Kristina] Penn State Univ, Dept Anthropol, State Coll, PA USA; [Douglass, Kristina] Penn State Univ, Inst Energy & Environm, State Coll, PA USA; [Faith, J.

Despite a growing number of single-species studies that identified phenological mismatches as a nearly universal consequence of climate change, we have a limited understanding of the spatial variation in the intensity of this phenomenon and what influences this variation. In this study, we tested for geographic patterns in phenological mismatches between six species of shorebirds and their invertebrate prey at 10 sites spread across similar to 13 degrees latitude and similar to 84 degrees longitude in the Arctic over three years. At each site, we quantified the phenological mismatch between shorebirds and their invertebrate prey at (1) an individual-nest level, as the difference in days between the seasonal peak in food and the peak demand by chicks, and (2) a population level, as the overlapped area under fitted curves for total daily biomass of invertebrates and dates of the peak demand by chicks. We tested whether the intensity of past climatic change observed at each site corresponded with the extent of phenological mismatch and used structural equation modeling to test for causal relationships among (1) environmental factors, including geographic location and current climatic conditions, (2) the timing of invertebrate emergence and the breeding phenology of shorebirds, and (3) the phenological mismatch between the two trophic levels. The extent of phenological mismatch varied more among different sites than among different species within each site. A greater extent of phenological mismatch at both the individual-nest and population levels coincided with changes in the timing of snowmelt as well as the potential dissociation of long-term snow phenology from changes in temperature. The timing of snowmelt also affected the shape of the food and demand curves, which determined the extent of phenological mismatch at the population level. Finally, we found larger mismatches at more easterly longitudes, which may be affecting the population dynamics of shorebirds, as two of our study species show regional population declines in only the eastern part of their range. This suggests that phenological mismatches may be resulting in demographic consequences for Arctic-nesting birds.","[Kwon, Eunbi; Weiser, Emily L.; Sandercock, Brett K.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA;

Part III: Interannual variability,JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOIL-WATER; STORAGE; PARAMETERIZATION; CLIMATE,"The Land Dynamics (LaD) model is tested by comparison with observations of interannual variations in discharge from 44 large river basins for which relatively accurate time series of monthly precipitation (a primary model input) have recently been computed. When results are pooled across all basins, the model explains 67% of the interannual variance of annual runoff ratio anomalies (i.e., anomalies of annual discharge volume, normalized by long-term mean precipitation volume). The new estimates of basin precipitation appear to offer an improvement over those from a state-of-the-art analysis of global precipitation (the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation, CMAP), judging from comparisons of parallel model runs and of analyses of precipitation-discharge correlations. When the new precipitation estimates are used, the performance of the LaD model is comparable to, but not significantly better than, that of a simple, semiempirical water-balance relation that uses only annual totals of surface net radiation and precipitation. This implies that the LaD simulations of interannual runoff variability do not benefit substantially from information on geographical variability of land parameters or seasonal structure of interannual variability of precipitation. The aforementioned analyses necessitated the development of a method for downscaling of long-term monthly precipitation data to the relatively short timescales necessary for running the model. The method merges the long-term data with a reference dataset of 1-yr duration, having high temporal resolution. The success of the method, for the model and data considered here, was demonstrated in a series of model-model comparisons and in the comparisons of modeled and observed interannual variations of basin discharge.","NOAA, Div Water Resources, US Geol Survey, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Milly, PCD (corresponding author), NOAA, Div Water Resources, US Geol Survey, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, POB 308, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA.",,"Dunne, Krista/N-4230-2019; Milly, Paul C.

At present, it is believed that such extremes are enhanced by stronger surface heating of the atmosphere, when soil moisture content is below average. However, the impact of land cover on the exchange of water and energy and the interaction of this exchange with the soil water balance during heatwaves is largely unknown. Here we analyse observations from an extensive network of flux towers in Europe that reveal a difference between the temporal responses of forest and grassland ecosystems during heatwaves. We find that initially, surface heating is twice as high over forest than over grassland. Over grass, heating is suppressed by increased evaporation in response to increased solar radiation and temperature. Ultimately, however, this process accelerates soil moisture depletion and induces a critical shift in the regional climate system that leads to increased heating. We propose that this mechanism may explain the extreme temperatures in August 2003. We conclude that the conservative water use of forest contributes to increased temperatures in the short term, but mitigates the impact of the most extreme heat and/or long-lasting events.","[Teuling, Adriaan J.; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Teuling, Adriaan J.] Wageningen Univ, Hydrol & Quantitat Water Management Grp, NL-6709 PA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Stoeckli, Reto] MeteoSwiss, Climate Sci, Climate Anal, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; [Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Moors, Eddy] Alterra, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ciais, Philippe; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] LSCE, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [van den Hurk, Bart] KNMI, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; [Ammann, Christof] Agroscope ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bernhofer, Christian; Gruenwald, Thomas] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Dellwik, Ebba] Tech Univ Denmark, Riso Natl Lab Sustainable Energy, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Gianelle, Damiano; Sottocornola, Matteo] IASMA Res & Innovat Ctr, Fdn E Mach, Environm & Nat Resources Area, I-38040 Trento, Italy; [Gielen, Bert] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Klumpp, Katja] Grassland Ecosyst Res UREP, INRA, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Montagnani, Leonardo] Forest Serv & Agcy Environm, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Montagnani, Leonardo] Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Moureaux, Christine] Univ Liege, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Wohlfahrt, Georg] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Max Planck Society; Wageningen University & Research; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Technische Universitat Dresden; Technical University of Denmark; Fondazione Edmund Mach; University of Antwerp; INRAE; VetAgro Sup; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Liege; University of Innsbruck,"Teuling, AJ (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ryan.teuling@wur.nl; sonia.seneviratne@env.ethz.ch,"Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/F-6684-2011; Sottocornola, Matteo/E-9092-2010; Gianelle, Damiano Dr./G-9437-2011; Moors, Eddy/J-5165-2012; Montagnani, Leonardo/F-1837-2016; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; van den Hurk, Bart/ABI-1654-2020; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Teuling, Ryan/D-2318-2014; Wohlfahrt, Georg/D-2409-2009; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Dellwik, Ebba/Q-4521-2016","Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1121-1869; Gianelle, Damiano Dr./0000-0001-7697-5793; Moors, Eddy/0000-0003-2309-2887; Montagnani, Leonardo/0000-0003-2957-9071; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; van den Hurk, Bart/0000-0003-3726-7086; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Teuling, Ryan/0000-0003-4302-2835; Wohlfahrt, Georg/0000-0003-3080-6702; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Dellwik, Ebba/0000-0002-0891-9113; Gielen, Bert/0000-0002-4890-3060; Bernhofer, Christian/0000-0003-1061-3073; Ammann, Christof/0000-0002-0783-5444",CarboEuropeIP; FAO-GTOS-TCO; iLEAPS; University of Tuscia; Universite Laval and Environment Canada; US Department of Energy; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [825.07.009]; ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation; European Commission [FP7-ENV-2008-1-226701]; CCES MAIOLICA project; NCCR; Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry; National Science Foundation,CarboEuropeIP(European Commission); FAO-GTOS-TCO; iLEAPS; University of Tuscia; Universite Laval and Environment Canada; US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); CCES MAIOLICA project; NCCR(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to the members of the FLUXNET community (http://www.fluxdata.org/DataInfo/default.aspx) and in particular the CarboEuropeIP network for their efforts in acquiring the eddy covariance data.

This is particularly true for the polar regions, where the observational arrays are sparsely distributed. In high southern latitudes, a comprehensive assimilation of all available observations, including satellite data, is necessary for an accurate depiction of the atmospheric circulation. Recent studies have found the operational analyses of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts to be superior to those of other weather-forecasting centers in depicting the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns over Antarctica. Re-analysis programs at major weather-forecasting centers have produced atmospheric numerical analyses using a frozen data-assimilation system. These projects have also derived precipitation and evaporation fields using an ensemble of short-term forecasts. From these new sources, Antarctic P - E (precipitation minus evaporation/sublimation) is compared and evaluated against the long-term glaciological synthesis, as well as results fi om previous studies. The comparisons indicate significant regional disagreements exist between P - E from the re-analysis forecasts and the glaciological data. For the ensemble forecasting method, the continental-average evaporation is the largest area of uncertainty and differs by art order of magnitude between the re-analysis datasets. This finding supports the use of the atmospheric moisture budget fur determining P - E collectively in atmospheric diagnostic studies for Antarctica.","Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Polar Meteorol Grp, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Ohio State Univ, Atmospher Sci Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; NOAA, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Off Res & Applicat, Washington, DC 20233 USA",Ohio State University; Ohio State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Bromwich, DH (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Polar Meteorol Grp, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Bromwich, David/C-9225-2016",,,,,,39,10,11,0,3,INT GLACIOLOGICAL SOC,CAMBRIDGE,"LENSFIELD RD, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1ER, ENGLAND",0260-3055,,0-946417-22-9,ANN GLACIOL-SER,,,1998,,,,,220,226,,,,,,7,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BM76J,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000079713100035,View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance of the two ML algorithms is compared to that of an existing state-of-the-art regression (RE) retrieval algorithm. The performance of the three algorithms is assessed using independent in situ SSTs from drifting buoys. Overall, the three models have similar biases; 0.01, 0.01 and -0.02 K for the XGB, NN and RE, respectively. The XGB model performs best with respect to standard deviation; 0.36 K. While the NN model performs slightly better than the RE model with respect to standard deviation, 0.50 and 0.55 K, respectively, the RE model is found to be more sensitive to changes in the in situ SST. Moreover, the XGB model is the least sensitive with an overall sensitivity of 0.78, compared to 0.90 for the RE model and 0.88 for the NN model. The good performance of the two ML algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art RE algorithm in this initial study demonstrates that there is a large potential in the use of ML algorithms for the retrieval of SST from PMW satellite observations.","[Alerskans, Emy; Nielsen-Englyst, Pia; Hoyer, Jacob L.] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zinck, Ann-Sofie P.] Univ Utrecht, IMAU, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Nielsen-Englyst, Pia] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Space, Lyngby, Denmark",Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Utrecht University; Technical University of Denmark,"Alerskans, E (corresponding author), Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ea@dmi.dk,,"Zinck, Ann-Sofie Priergaard/0000-0001-5407-0934; Nielsen-Englyst, Pia/0000-0001-6915-3388; Alerskans, Emy/0000-0001-8206-5999",European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Sea Surface Temperature [4000109848/13/I-NB]; Danish e-Infrastructure Corporation; Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre; VILLUM Foundation; Niels Bohr Institute,European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Sea Surface Temperature; Danish e-Infrastructure Corporation; Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre; VILLUM Foundation(Villum Fonden); Niels Bohr Institute,"The authors are grateful for computing resources and technical assistance provided by the Danish Center for Climate Computing, a facility built with support of the Danish e-Infrastructure Corporation, Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre, VILLUM Foundation, and the Niels Bohr Institute.

The building envelope therefore plays an important mediator, whether as climate change perceived or as cultural patrimony intangible, between the building and its surrounding conditions. Nowadays, the countries of the hot desert are introducing policy based on completely glazed constructions with neglecting their climate change as applied for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This results in poor building efficiency and identity crises. Therefore, any attempt seeks to decrease excess sun exposure and make efficient sunlight availability. This leads to climate change adaptation and the happiness of the inhabitants as a sustainable development technique, decreasing buildings ' energy consumption, which is an effective way to eliminate emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). In this context, this paper presents the assessment principles for daylight performance in the case-study. This lays out approaches for optimizing daylight and energy efficiency in hot-arid climates by comparing different scenarios for building with international style at Ajman University - UAE, in order to reach to the best solution, that through the best use of performance simulation analysis and parametric generic algorithm software (Revit - Insight 360 plugin). Three phases of the methodology are taken: (1) the daylight and energy efficiency are analyzed for the case-study, (2) the results are assessed and compared to the hotarid climate, (3) the optimum solutions and recommendations are determined.

This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.Y","[Donlon, Craig J.; Cullen, Robert; Giulicchi, Luisella; Vuilleumier, Pierrik; Francis, C.

However, quantitative knowledge about vulnerability reduction via private precautionary measures is scarce and their effects are hardly considered in loss modeling and risk assessments. However, this is a prerequisite to enable temporally dynamic flood damage and risk modeling, and thus the evaluation of risk management and adaptation strategies. To quantify the average reduction in vulnerability of residential buildings via private precaution empirical vulnerability data (n = 948) is used. Households with and without precautionary measures undertaken before the flood event are classified into treatment and nontreatment groups and matched. Postmatching regression is used to quantify the treatment effect. Additionally, we test state-of-the-art flood loss models regarding their capability to capture this difference in vulnerability. The estimated average treatment effect of implementing private precaution is between 11 and 15 thousand EUR per household, confirming the significant effectiveness of private precautionary measures in reducing flood vulnerability. From all tested flood loss models, the expert Bayesian network-based model BN-FLEMOps and the rule-based loss model FLEMOps perform best in capturing the difference in vulnerability due to private precaution. Thus, the use of such loss models is suggested for flood risk assessments to effectively support evaluations and decision making for adaptable flood risk management.","[Sairam, Nivedita; Schroeter, Kai; Luedtke, Stefan; Merz, Bruno; Kreibich, Heidi] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany; [Sairam, Nivedita] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Merz, Bruno] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Potsdam,"Sairam, N (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany.;Sairam, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.",nivedita@gfz-potsdam.de,"Schröter, Kai/B-1482-2013; Kreibich, Heidi/G-9408-2012","Schröter, Kai/0000-0002-3173-7019; Ludtke, Stefan/0000-0002-7888-9175; Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; Sairam, Nivedita/0000-0003-4611-9894; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440","European Union [676027]; reinsurance company Deutsche Ruckversicherung; German Research Network Natural Disasters (German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)) [01SFR9969/5]; MEDIS project (BMBF) [0330688]; project Hochwasser 2013 (BMBF) [13N13017]; German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; University of Potsdam; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG, Dusseldorf","European Union(European Commission); reinsurance company Deutsche Ruckversicherung; German Research Network Natural Disasters (German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF))(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); MEDIS project (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); project Hochwasser 2013 (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ; University of Potsdam; Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG, Dusseldorf","This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement 676027 MSCA ETN System-Risk.

However, many ocean-atmosphere global coupled models, including the state-of-the-art Climate Forecast System (CFS) version 2 have difficulty in reproducing this link realistically. In this study, we analyze the retrospective forecasts by the CFS model for the period 1982-2010 with an objective to identify the reasons behind the failure of the model to simulate the observed links between Indian summer monsoon and EQUINOO. It is found that, in the model hindcasts, the rainfall in the core monsoon region was mainly due to westward propagating synoptic scale systems, that originated from the vicinity of the tropical convergence zone (TCZ). Our analysis shows that unlike in observations, in the CFS, majority of positive (negative) EQUINOO events are associated with El Nino (La Nina) events in the Pacific. In addition to this, there is a strong link between EQUINOO and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the model. We show that, during the negative phase of EQUINOO/IOD, northward propagating TCZs remained stationary over the Bay of Bengal for longer period compared to the positive phase of EQUINOO/IOD. As a result, compared to the positive phase of EQUINOO/IOD, during a negative phase of EQUINOO/IOD, more westward propagating synoptic scale systems originated from the vicinity of TCZ and moved on to the core monsoon region, which resulted in higher rainfall over this region in the CFS. We further show that frequent, though short-lived, westward propagating systems, generated near the vicinity of TCZ over the Bay moved onto the mainland were responsible for less number of break monsoon spells during the negative phase of EQUINOO/IOD in the model hindcasts. This study underlines the necessity for improving the skill of the coupled models, particularly CFS model, to simulate the links between EQUINOO/IOD and the Indian summer monsoon for reliable predictions of seasonal and intraseasonal variation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall.","[Vishnu, S.; Francis, P.

Investigations of the mechanisms that control SCE variations were almost exclusively focused on the year-to-year variability of forcing variables and SCE integrated over a certain period of the year (e.g. season). Here, we use state-of-the-art climate reanalysis dataset to analyze the contribution of different surface energy fluxes to the inception and development of below-normal spring SCE from an intraseasonal perspective. During years identified with lower-than-average SCE by the end of spring, higher-than-average net longwave radiation and sensible heat that is greater than the decrease of net shortwave radiation in the early spring snowmelt season induces the initial SCE deficit. This can be mainly explained by the finding that the increase of downwelling longwave radiation because of increased water vapor significantly exceeds the attenuation of downwelling short-wave radiation due to increased cloudiness. When a SCE deficit has been incepted in early spring, net shortwave radiation in late spring gradually becomes higher than average through snow albedo feedback, which further accelerates snowmelt. This suggests that shortwave radiation is not responsible for the initiation of negative SCE anomaly by the end of spring but acts as an amplifying feedback once the snow melt is started.","[Wang, Tao; Peng, Shushi; Ottle, Catherine; Ciais, Philippe] CEA, UVSQ, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Peng, Shushi] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, UMR5183, Grenoble, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Wang, T (corresponding author), CEA, UVSQ, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",twang.pku@gmail.com,"OTTLE, Catherine/K-3895-2012; wang, tao/H-2830-2013; PENG, Shushi/AAS-2603-2020; Wang, Tao/ABE-7107-2020; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Peng, Shushi/J-4779-2014","OTTLE, Catherine/0000-0003-1304-6414; wang, tao/0000-0003-4792-5898; PENG, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Peng, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X",Agence Nationale de la Recherche CLimat; Agriculture et Societe SIberienne-QUelle Evolution; Changing permafrost in the arctic and its global effects in the 21st century,Agence Nationale de la Recherche CLimat(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Agriculture et Societe SIberienne-QUelle Evolution; Changing permafrost in the arctic and its global effects in the 21st century,"We are thankful for support from Agence Nationale de la Recherche CLimat, Agriculture et Societe SIberienne-QUelle Evolution and 'Changing permafrost in the arctic and its global effects in the 21st century' project funding.

After introducing the hygrothermal performance challenges of the Meefs system, numerical case analyses are performed in three different climatic conditions. The results for 26 cases are presented. A core result is that the drying of any exterior renovation system is mandatory to guarantee safe operation in different European climate conditions. This emphasizes proper design needs in all climates. Based on the analyses, design recommendations can be given for the Meefs system.

Their biogeographical responses to Quaternary climate changes have been poorly studied; however, they could have responded as cold-adapted species. We investigated the biogeographic history of a steppe beetle, Hycleus polymorphus, using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences (COI, CAD, ITS2), and species distribution modelling (SDM) under present and past bioclimatic envelopes. We first performed a phylogenetic assessment to define species boundaries within the H. polymorphus species group. Specimens previously treated as Hycleus humerosus on morphological grounds are assigned to H. polymorphus, and those identified as Hycleus zebraeus assigned to Hycleus atratus. ITS2 data analyses revealed a strong phylogeographical structure of H. polymorphus populations, with four haplogroups corresponding to the (i) Italian Alps, (ii) French Alps and Pyrenees, (iii) South Balkan and Pontic mountains, and (iv) North Dinaric Alps. Based on these analyses and the SDM, we propose that during a glacial period, following the spread of steppic habitat, H. polymorphus underwent a range expansion from Asia to SouthWest Europe. Within the Mediterranean area, during the last interglacial the climatic suitability for the species was limited to mountains that acted as refugia and prompted allopatric divergence into four main lineages.","[Riccieri, Alessandra; Bologna, Marco A.] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale G Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Mancini, Emiliano] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol C Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00186 Rome, Italy; [Iannella, Mattia; Salvi, Daniele] Univ Aquila, Dept Hlth Life & Environm Sci, Via Vetoio Snc, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Salvi, Daniele] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal",Italfarmaco; Roma Tre University; Sapienza University Rome; University of L'Aquila; Universidade do Porto,"Riccieri, A (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale G Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy.",alessanara.riccieri@uniroma3.it,"Iannella, Mattia/AAO-4709-2020; Riccieri, Alessandra/AAC-6139-2021; Salvi, Daniele/I-6360-2013","Iannella, Mattia/0000-0003-4695-0194; Riccieri, Alessandra/0000-0003-3719-9941; MANCINI, Emiliano/0000-0002-7988-4544; Salvi, Daniele/0000-0002-3804-2690; BOLOGNA, Marco Alberto/0000-0003-2498-8917","MIUR, Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, Italy (Programmi di ricerca scientifica di rilevante interesse nazionale) [PRIN 99C5271884-007, PRIN 2004057217]; MIUR, Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, Italy (CRUI Programma di mobilita Pietro della Valle 2017); University Roma Tre, Department of Science [L. 232/2016, commi 314-337]; program 'Rita Levi Montalcini' (MIUR)","MIUR, Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, Italy (Programmi di ricerca scientifica di rilevante interesse nazionale); MIUR, Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, Italy (CRUI Programma di mobilita Pietro della Valle 2017); University Roma Tre, Department of Science; program 'Rita Levi Montalcini' (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We would like to thank people who provided samples for this study, or helped us in field collection: P.

Europe has a well-established air quality research infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered during 2013-2019. It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol was followed strictly for all 22 datasets, making the source apportionment results more comparable. In addition, it enables quantification of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, range from 43.7 to 100%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total 16.0% yearly contribution to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4%). Overall, this comprehensive protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust and consistent source apportionment results. Our work presents a comprehensive overview of OA sources in Europe with a unique combination of high time resolution (30-240 min) and long-term data coverage (9-36 months), providing essential information to improve/validate air quality, health impact, and climate models.","[Chen, Gang; Canonaco, Francesco; Tobler, Anna; Baltensperger, Urs; Chazeau, Benjamin; Daellenbach, Kaspar R.; El Haddad, Imad; Manousakas, Manousos, I; Slowik, Jay G.; Prevot, Andre S.

The often-intense social, health, and cultural stressors from multiple pathways- including climate change, resource extraction, socio-economic shifts, and the enduring legacies of colonization-affect social cohesion, community wellness, sense of place and heritage, livelihoods, and many cultural structures. Indigenous peoples are at the frontline of these changes and, as a result, a priority of many communities is to develop strategies to support community wellness, foster livelihoods, maintain cultural values, enhance resilience, and preserve and promote cultural continuity. Responding to these stressors and needs, and building from previous research conducted in the region that indicated a desire to ensure cultural continuity, the Inuit Community Governments of Rigolet, Makkovik, and Postville, in the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, designed and piloted the IlikKuset-Ilingannet (Culture-Connect!) Program. This program was premised on the Inuit relational epistemology of piliriqatigiinniq ('working in a collaborative way for the common good'), and united five youth with five adult mentors per community (n = 30) to learn cultural skills, including trapping, snowshoe-making, carving, art, and sewing. This research found that participating in the program supported hands-on knowledge transmission, created new or enhanced relationships between and among the youth and mentors; revitalized cultural pride and wellbeing; promoted cultural preservation and promotion; and showed promise as a strategy for supporting cultural sustainability and resilience to change. This resonates with growing emphasis on Indigenous-led programs supporting cultural preservation, promotion, reclamation, and resurgence, and contributes to a wholistic understanding of, and strategies for, Northern sustainabilities.","[Cunsolo, Ashlee] Labrador Inst Mem Univ, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF, Canada; [Shiwak, Inez] Rigolet Inuit Community Govt, My Word Storytelling & Digital Media Lab, Rigolet, NF, Canada; [Wood, Michele] Nunatsiavut Dept Hlth & Social Dev, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF, Canada",,"Cunsolo, A (corresponding author), Labrador Inst Mem Univ, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF, Canada.",ashlee.cunsolo@mun.ca; inezs@rigolet.ca; michele.wood@nunatsiavut.com,,,,,,,39,9,9,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2510-0475,2510-0483,978-3-319-46150-2; 978-3-319-46148-9,SPR POLAR SCI,,,2017,,,,,285,303,,10.1007/978-3-319-46150-2_21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46150-2_21,10.1007/978-3-319-46150-2,,19,Area Studies; Environmental Studies; International Relations,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Area Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,BM7KL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000468016600022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of the present study was to identify the factors that influence interannual variations in the somatic growth rate of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea. This work covers otolith samples collected from commercial catches and during scientific surveys from 1951 to 2017 in the Polish zone of the southern part of the Baltic. Otolith increment widths, which represent changes in fish growth, were analyzed with linear mixed models to investigate different intrinsic and extrinsic sources of fish growth variation. The stock biomass of pelagic species (herring and sprat Sprattus sprattus), sea surface temperature, Baltic Sea Index and land precipitation over the catchment area were considered potential predictors of herring growth. Methods to identify the optimal time window for environmental factors were incorporated in the modeling. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis, tests for identification of regime shifts in fish growth and a spatial correlation analysis were applied to the data. The developed multidecadal otolith-based biochronology showed that the growth of Baltic herring is under the strong influence of interspecific competition between herring and sprat, but the biochronology also indicated a high correlation with precipitation patterns over the runoff area and hydrological conditions within the Baltic Sea. A detailed investigation revealed that the relationships between herring growth and abiotic conditions or other ecosystem components can vary over time. The recognized complex ecological effects on herring growth necessitate the application of holistic ecosystem-based approaches for sustainable management and exploitation of small pelagic fish resources.","[Smolinski, Szymon] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland",National Marine Fisheries Research Institute,"Smolinski, S (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.",ssmolinski@mir.gdynia.pl,"Smoliński, Szymon/AAZ-1088-2020","Smoliński, Szymon/0000-0003-2715-984X","BONUS Swedish Research Council Formas [185]; EU; Academy of Finland; Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; National Centre for Research and Development, Poland; Swedish Research Council Formas","BONUS Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; National Centre for Research and Development, Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas)","This work resulted from the BONUS BLUEWEBS project which has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU, the Academy of Finland, Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany, the State Education Development Agency of Latvia, the National Centre for Research and Development, Poland, and the Swedish Research Council Formas.

A portfolio approach is required that allows for a suite of goals ranging from the maintenance of existing high-value conservation assets (the Mona Lisas) to alternative management approaches in the altered parts of the landscape (the broader art collection). Management goals can be set on the basis of the relative values, services provided, and array of approaches available.

Our aim was to elucidate such effects for two management types using soil fractionation in combination with radiocarbon dating. Two Swiss grasslands sites at approximately 2020 m elevation (MAT +2.2 degrees C, MAP 1050 mm) were used, which were hay meadows until 60 years ago when one was changed to grazed pasture. The sites are located in close vicinity to each other and have similar climate and parent material. Soils at each site were shallow (maximum 20 cm) and had high stone contents and thus a limited carbon (C) storage capacity. Total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the two soils were similar (6.11 +/- 0.69 and 6.07 +/- 0.91 kg C m(-2), respectively), as were proportions of readily available SOC and Q(10) values measured by means of respiration in the laboratory. Grazing caused lower soil nutrient contents and slight soil compaction. Carbon in labile fractions and its radiocarbon age were particularly useful to distinguish management effects. Significantly more SOC was located in the pasture topsoil (0-4 cm) with a higher share of particulate organic C. Particulate and microaggregate-associated C was slightly younger under pasture, indicating incorporation of recent plant tissue by cattle. At both sites, (14)C-derived mean residence times of SOC increased in the order particulate < micro-aggregate < silt and clay-associated matter and were greater below 4 cm than in the topsoil. Age differences in old silt and clay C could not be attributed entirely to management effects. We discuss pitfalls for turnover estimates of bulk soils introduced by choosing non-unique fractions. Together, the data suggest that a change from haying to cattle grazing may cause a strong decoupling of microbial processes within the soil's architecture and that in such ecosystems SOM under pastures may be more vulnerable to environmental disturbances.","[Leifeld, J.; Fuhrer, J.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",,,,,46,45,48,3,53,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-0754,,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

In a subsequent climate chamber experiment, the wheat variety Apogee was inoculated with individual single conidium isolates derived from the original poly conidium isolates used in the field. Disease symptoms on wheat heads were visually assessed, and the yield as well as the fungal incidence on harvested grains (field only) was determined. Furthermore, grains were analysed using LC-MS/MS to determine the content of Fusarium mycotoxins. In samples from field and climate chamber experiments, 60 to 4,860 mu g kg(-1) nivalenol and 2,400 to 17,000 mu g kg(-1) moniliformin were detected in grains infected with F. poae and F. avenaceum, respectively. Overall, isolate mixtures and individual isolates of F. avenaceum proved to be more pathogenic than those of F. poae, leading to a higher disease level, yield reductions up to 25%, and greater toxin contamination. For F. poae, all variables except for yield were strongly influenced by variety (field) and by isolate (climate chamber). For F. avenaceum, variety had a strong effect on all variables, but isolate effects on visual disease were not reflected in toxin production.

Higher level of thermal comfort attracts more visitors to such places; hence, brings benefits to the community. Previous research works have used the body energy balance or adaptation model for predicting the thermal comfort in outdoor spaces. However, limited research works have applied computational methods in this field. For the first of its' type, this study applied a systematic approach using a class of soft-computing methodology known as the extreme learning machine (ELM) to forecast the thermal comfort of the subject visitors at an open area in Iran. For data collection, this study used common thermal indices for assessing the thermal perceptions of the subjects. The fieldworks comprised of measuring the micro climatic conditions and interviewing the visitors. This study compared the results of ELM with other conventional soft-computing methods (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic programming (GP)). The findings indicate that the ELM results match with the field data. This implies that a model constructed by ELM can accurately predict visitors' thermal sensations. We conclude that the proposed model's predictability performance is reliable and superior compared to other approaches (i.e., GP and ANN). Besides, the ELM methodology significantly reduces training time for a Neural Network as compared to the conventional methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies hint that a lateral shift between prominent gravity wave sources in the tropospheric mid-latitudes and the location where gravity wave activity is present in the stratosphere causes at least part of the discrepancy. This lateral shift cannot be represented by the column-based gravity wave drag parameterisations used in most general circulation models. However, recent high-resolution analysis and re-analysis products of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecast System (ECMWF-IFS) show good agreement with the observations and allow for a detailed investigation of resolved gravity waves, their sources, and propagation paths. In this paper, we identify resolved gravity waves in the ECMWF-IFS analyses for a case of high gravity wave activity in the lower stratosphere using small-volume sinusoidal fits to characterise these gravity waves. The 3D wave vector together with perturbation amplitudes, wave frequency, and a fully described background atmosphere are then used to initialise the Gravity Wave Regional or Global Ray Tracer (GROGRAT) gravity wave ray tracer and follow the gravity waves backwards from the stratosphere. Finally, we check for the indication of source processes on the path of each ray and, thus, quantitatively attribute gravity waves to sources that are represented within the model. We find that stratospheric gravity waves are indeed subject to far (> 1000 km) lateral displacement from their sources, which already take place at low altitudes (< 20 km). Various source processes can be linked to waves within stratospheric gravity wave (GW) patterns, such as the orography equatorward of 50 degrees S and non-orographic sources above the Southern Ocean. These findings may explain why superpressure balloons observe enhanced gravity wave momentum fluxes in the lower stratosphere over the Southern Ocean despite an apparent lack of sources at this latitude. Our results also support the need to improve gravity wave parameterisations to account for meridional propagation.","[Strube, Cornelia; Preusse, Peter; Ern, Manfred; Riese, Martin] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch Stratosphare IEK 7, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Strube, Cornelia] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Strube, C (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch Stratosphare IEK 7, D-52425 Julich, Germany.;Strube, C (corresponding author), Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany.",c.strube@fz-juelich.de,"Riese, Martin/A-3927-2013; Ern, Manfred/I-8839-2016","Riese, Martin/0000-0001-6398-6493; Ern, Manfred/0000-0002-8565-2125","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [919/4-2, FOR 1898]; German Ministry for Education and Research [01 LG 1907]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was partly funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) project (grant no.

Herein, a low-cost, robust device with a high record-breaking vapor generation rate (98.7 kg m(-2) h(-1), an order of magnitude higher than the best result reported) has been achieved with a conductive bulk porous carbon material, assisted by low-voltage electrical power.

In this study, the intrawinter changes in the atmospheric teleconnection and its regional impacts associated with ENSO are investigated using data from 386 weather stations throughout Korea, China, and Japan. It has recently been shown that the relative roles of western North Pacific (WNP) and equatorial central Pacific (CP) precipitation anomalies play an important role in determining the ENSO teleconnection in the North Pacific. Here we show that the ENSO impacts over East Asia can also be largely explained by a combination of WNP and equatorial CP forcing. Further, the diverse regional impacts among different ENSO events can be explained to a large extent by the relative roles of the WNP and equatorial CP precipitation.

The primary science focus of ECOSTRESS is centered on evapotranspiration (ET), which is produced as Level-3 (L3) latent heat flux (LE) data products. These data are generated from the Level-2 land surface temperature and emissivity product (L2_LSTE), in conjunction with ancillary surface and atmospheric data. Here, we provide the first validation (Stage 1, preliminary) of the global ECOSTRESS clear-sky ET product (L3_ET_PT-JPL, Version 6.0) against LE measurements at 82 eddy covariance sites around the world. Overall, the ECOSTRESS ET product performs well against the site measurements (clear-sky instantaneous/time of overpass: r(2) = 0.88; overall bias = 8%; normalized root-mean-square error, RMSE = 6%). ET uncertainty was generally consistent across climate zones, biome types, and times of day (ECOSTRESS samples the diurnal cycle), though temperate sites are overrepresented. The 70-m-high spatial resolution of ECOSTRESS improved correlations by 85%, and RMSE by 62%, relative to 1-km pixels.

While most small-scale studies have reconstructed information from historical archive data and focused on a specific time period, large-scale studies have tended to rely on inverse modeling techniques to interpret land-use change dynamics based on remote-sensing data for example, the global land-use products of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) and Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) datasets. All studies have shown that the cropland areas in China increased between 1700 and 1950, although they indicate different magnitudes and rates. A decrease in forest coverage was also reported in all studies. Little information was available on urban and grassland areas over the same period. Rapid urbanization in China has been particularly evident in the past 50 years. Meanwhile, spatially explicit reconstructions of historical land-use change in China since 1700 remain highly uncertain due to the lack of reliable data. Extensive work on primary data collection is required, including land-use records and drivers for future change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Lacustrine carbonate records provide an excellent opportunity to address this issue with frequently high depositional rates, and the ability to extract biological and chemical proxy data related to palaeoclimate variations. However, these archives are also some of the most difficult to date due to associated problems with radiocarbon sample contamination. We present the tephrochronological findings from Crudale Meadow, Orkney, one of the most northerly former marl lakes in the British Isles. Thirteen intervals containing tephra are chemically characterised, of which six may be correlated to known eruptions. The results provide a tephrochronological framework from which it is possible to refine the age estimates of less securely dated cryptotephras, and also provide a basis from which to frame ongoing climate reconstructions using state-of-the-art proxy methods. The results presented here demonstrate that Crudale Meadow is a key record in the development of a regional tephrostratigraphic framework, and an important site in developing a refined network of well-dated high-resolution palaeoclimatic records across northern Europe.","[Timms, Rhys G.

Due to the recent global climate change, storm intensity has increased and inundation of coastal areas is inevitable. The pattern of coastal flooding depends on the geomorphologic and oceanographic characteristics of the coastal zone. The current research aims to delineate the susceptibility of Omani coast to the sudden sea level rise from cyclones and tsunamis using the coastal vulnerability index (CVI). Five physical parameters were implemented to perform the CVI, namely: The coastal geomorphology, elevation, slope, tidal range and bathymetry of the nearshore zone. Data were extracted from remotely sensed images and government resources assisted by field surveying. Geospatial analysis using geographical information system (GIS) was performed to manipulate and process the CVI from the collected data. Results showed that high vulnerable coastal regions to sea level rise account for 805 km of the coast, mostly along Al-Batinah plain in the north and along some scattered sectors at the eastern coast of the country. Major settlements and infrastructures are located at high CVI category. Moderate vulnerable coasts total 695 km mostly at the headlands along the Arabian Sea, whereas the low vulnerability coasts include the remaining shores along Musandam Peninsula and the eastern coast. This study provides a national map of the coastal vulnerability to the sea level rise, which is important for urban planning and decision supports for a sustainable management of Omani coastal zone.","[Hereher, Mohamed; Al-Awadhi, Talal; Al-Hatrushi, Salim; Charabi, Yassine; Mansour, Shawky; Al-Nasiri, Noura; Sherief, Youssef; El-Kenawy, Ahmed] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Geog Dept, Muscat, Oman; [Hereher, Mohamed] Damietta Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, New Damietta, Egypt; [Mansour, Shawky] Alexandria Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Geog & GIS, Alexandria, Egypt; [Sherief, Youssef] Zagazig Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Geog, Zagazig, Egypt; [El-Kenawy, Ahmed] Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura, Egypt",Sultan Qaboos University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Damietta University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"Hereher, M (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Geog Dept, Muscat, Oman.;Hereher, M (corresponding author), Damietta Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, New Damietta, Egypt.",meldesoky@squ.edu.edu,"Charabi, Yassine/E-4121-2013; Hereher, Mohamed E./J-8287-2014; Al-Awadhi, Talal/AAF-1581-2019; Kenawy, Ahmed/Y-9137-2018","Charabi, Yassine/0000-0003-2054-688X; Hereher, Mohamed E./0000-0003-4875-8286; Al-Awadhi, Talal/0000-0002-2266-9077; Kenawy, Ahmed/0000-0001-6639-6253",Sultan Qaboos University HM Trust Fund [SR/ART/GEOG/17/01],Sultan Qaboos University HM Trust Fund,This research was funded by the Sultan Qaboos University HM Trust Fund (Project# SR/ART/GEOG/17/01).

Mediterranean crops are frequently subjected to high evapotranspiration demands, soil water deficits, high temperatures, and photo-oxidative stress. These conditions will become more severe due to global warming which poses major challenges to the sustainability of the agricultural sector in Mediterranean countries. Selection of crop varieties adapted to future climatic conditions and more tolerant to extreme climatic events is urgently required. Plant phenotyping is a crucial approach to address these challenges. High-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) helps to monitor the performance of improved genotypes and is one of the most effective strategies to improve the sustainability of agricultural production. In spite of the remarkable progress in basic knowledge and technology of plant phenotyping, there are still several practical, financial, and political constraints to implement HTPP approaches in field and controlled conditions across the Mediterranean. The European panorama of phenotyping is heterogeneous and integration of phenotyping data across different scales and translation of phytotron research to the field, and from model species to crops, remain major challenges. Moreover, solutions specifically tailored to Mediterranean agriculture (e.g., crops and environmental stresses) are in high demand, as the region is vulnerable to climate change and to desertification processes. The specific phenotyping requirements of Mediterranean crops have not yet been fully identified. The high cost of HTPP infrastructures is a major limiting factor, though the limited availability of skilled personnel may also impair its implementation in Mediterranean countries. We propose that the lack of suitable phenotyping infrastructures is hindering the development of new Mediterranean agricultural varieties and will negatively affect future competitiveness of the agricultural sector. We provide an overview of the heterogeneous panorama of phenotyping within Mediterranean countries, describing the state of the art of agricultural production, breeding initiatives, and phenotyping capabilities in five countries: Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey.

The use of only daytime summer imagery reporting Inverted UHI undermines the holistic view of the phenomenon. Therefore, this study analyses the seasonal patterns for UHISurf and UHIUCL in three climate zones (Delhi, Pune, and Montreal). The three cities experience a high traditional night-time UHIUCL (Delhi 7 degrees C, Pune 6 degrees C, Montreal 1.89 degrees C). Landsat captures a prominent daytime UHISurf (15 degrees C) in Montreal with temperate climate and daytime inverted UHISurf (-4 degrees C) for Delhi in summer. Seasonally, the nighttime UHI is prominent in summer and monsoon for Delhi, summer and spring for Pune, and summer for Montreal. Due to UHI effect, the heatwaves can be more intense in semi-arid and tropical cities than temperate cities.","[Budhiraja, Bakul] OP Jindal Global Univ, UHI & Urban Air Qual, Sonipat, India; [Pathak, Prasad] Flame Univ, Dept Phys & Nat Sci, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Pathak, Prasad] Flame Univ, FLAME Ctr Earth & Environm, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Agarwal, Girish] OP Jindal Global Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Res, Sonipat, India; [Sengupta, Raja] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sengupta, Raja] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ, Canada",O.P.

Long simulations from two coupled models with different horizontal resolutions and one uncoupled model of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System are analyzed. Specifically, the observed feature that the interannual variability of the seasonal monsoon is largely determined by large-scale seasonally persistent modes rather than the nature and frequency of the intraseasonal oscillations has been examined in the model simulations. The importance of ocean-atmosphere interaction has also been examined by comparing the coupled and uncoupled model simulations. The models simulate the spatial structure of the mean and variability of the monsoon fairly well, although the details over the Indian land region are inadequate in all simulations. The variability of the rainfall is overestimated in the models, especially in the uncoupled version. The coupled simulations produce more realistic precipitation and circulation patterns, while the improvement in the mean and variability due to higher horizontal resolution is marginal. Composite and pattern correlation analyses indicate the presence of a large-scale seasonally persistent structure that largely determines the interannual variability of the seasonal mean monsoon. Consistent with the observations, the probability distributions of the pattern correlations indicate that the nature and frequency of the intraseasonal oscillations remain unchanged between strong and weak monsoon years. Similar to the observations, the model results provide hope for seasonal prediction of monsoon.","[Achuthavarier, Deepthi; Krishnamurthy, V.] George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Krishnamurthy, V.] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Inst Global Environm & Soc, Calverton, MD 20705 USA",George Mason University,"Achuthavarier, D (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",deepthi@cola.iges.org,,,National Science Foundation [0334910]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA040AR4310034]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNG04GG46G],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (0334910), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA040AR4310034), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNG04GG46G).

However, besides site-specific studies, little is known about how SM varies locally (1-100-m scale). Consequently, quantifying the SM variability and its impact on the Earth system remains a long-standing challenge in hydrology. We reveal the striking variability of local-scale SM across the United States using SMAP-HydroBlocks - a novel satellite-based surface SM data set at 30-m resolution. Results show how the complex interplay of SM with landscape characteristics and hydroclimate is primarily driven by local variations in soil properties. This local-scale complexity yields a remarkable and unique multi-scale behavior at each location. However, very little of this complexity persists across spatial scales. Experiments reveal that on average 48% and up to 80% of the SM spatial information is lost at the 1-km resolution, with complete loss expected at the scale of current state-of-the-art SM monitoring and modeling systems (1-25 km resolution).","[Vergopolan, Noemi; Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Vergopolan, Noemi] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Vergopolan, Noemi] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Sheffield, Justin; Eigenbrod, Felix] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Chaney, Nathaniel W.; Torres-Rojas, Laura] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Pan, Ming] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Western Weather & Water Extremes, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Beck, Hylke E.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Ferguson, Craig R.] SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Crow, Wade] USDA, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA",Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Southampton; Duke University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Vergopolan, N (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Vergopolan, N (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Vergopolan, N (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",noemi@princeton.edu,"Chaney, Nathaniel/L-9110-2015","Chaney, Nathaniel/0000-0001-7120-1713; Torres-Rojas, Laura/0000-0001-7319-2355; Vergopolan, Noemi/0000-0002-7298-0509; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630","Modernizing Observation Operator and Error Assessment for Assimilating In-situ and Remotely Sensed Snow/Soil Moisture Measurements into NWM project from NOAA [NA19OAR4590199]; NASA [NNH19ZDA001N-HMA]; NASA-NOAA [80HQTR21T0015]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology [OSR-2017-CRG6]; UK Research and Innovation, Global Challenges Research Fund [NE/P021093/1]","Modernizing Observation Operator and Error Assessment for Assimilating In-situ and Remotely Sensed Snow/Soil Moisture Measurements into NWM project from NOAA; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA-NOAA; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); UK Research and Innovation, Global Challenges Research Fund","This work was supported by the Modernizing Observation Operator and Error Assessment for Assimilating In-situ and Remotely Sensed Snow/Soil Moisture Measurements into NWM project from NOAA (grant number NA19OAR4590199), the Understanding Changes in High Mountain Asia project project from NASA (grant number NNH19ZDA001N-HMA), the NASA-NOAA Interagency Agreement through the High Mountain Asia program (grant number 80HQTR21T0015), the A new paradigm in precision agriculture: assimilation of ultra-fine resolution data into a crop-yield forecasting model project from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (grant number OSR-2017-CRG6), and the Building REsearch Capacity for sustainable water and food security In drylands of sub-saharan Africa (BREC-cIA) project from the UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund (grant number NE/P021093/1).",,79,1,1,8,8,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The specific electronic and structural features that allow activating the highly stable CO2 molecule are dissected by exploiting state-of-the art first principles methods. The effects of surface oxygen vacancies as well as the different roles of copper and iron on the adsorption and the activation of carbon dioxide at the CuFeO2 most stable surface are analyzed. These results highlight the key role of oxygen defects in favoring the CO2 adsorption and in promoting the formation of a radical anion CO2 center dot- or a carbonate-like adsorbate so providing the scientific grounds for implementing new rational design strategies and improving the performances of CuFeO2-based photoelectrodes for CO2 reduction.","[Baiano, Carmen; Schiavo, Eduardo; Talarico, Giovanni; Pavone, Michele] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Chim, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Gerbaldi, Claudio; Bella, Federico; Meligrana, Giuseppina] Politecn Torino, GAME Lab, Dept Appl Sci & Technol DISAT, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Maddalena, Pasqualino; Munoz-Garcia, Ana B.] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Fis Ettore Pancini, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Baiano, Carmen] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Naples Federico II; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Pavone, M (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Chim, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Naples, Italy.;Munoz-Garcia, AB (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Fis Ettore Pancini, Via Cintia 21, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",michele.pavone@unina.it; anabelen.munozgarcia@unina.it,"Talarico, Giovanni/A-7369-2009; Maddalena, Pasqualino/G-7114-2011; Pavone, Michele/A-5859-2010; Schiavo, Eduardo/G-1576-2018; Gerbaldi, Claudio/A-5377-2011","Talarico, Giovanni/0000-0002-4861-0444; Maddalena, Pasqualino/0000-0001-5823-3331; Pavone, Michele/0000-0001-7549-631X; BAIANO, Carmen/0000-0002-5913-0876; Schiavo, Eduardo/0000-0002-2237-4308; Gerbaldi, Claudio/0000-0002-8084-0143",Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) [PRIN 2015XBZ5YA],"Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",M.P. acknowledges funding from the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) under grant PRIN 2015XBZ5YA.,,78,32,32,8,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2468-8231,,,MOL CATAL,Mol.

Reducing CO2 to value-added products is an attractive solution to this severe problem, along with addressing the energy crisis, to which the catalysts being employed are of vital importance. Due to their high porosity and tunable compositions, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show great potential in energy conversion systems. By thermal or chemical treatment methods, the MOFs are easily turned into MOF-derived carbon nanomaterials. The much higher level of conductivity enables MOF-derived carbon nanomaterials to be employed in CO2 conversion processes.

This study focuses on vertical wind shear (V(s)) over the tropical Atlantic during hurricane season, the increase of which has been historically associated with diminished hurricane activity and intensity. A suite of state-of-the-art global climate model experiments is used to project changes in V(s) over the 21st century. Substantial increases in tropical Atlantic and East Pacific shear are robust features of these experiments, and are shown to be connected to the model-projected decrease in the Pacific Walker circulation. The relative changes in shear are found to be comparable to those of other large-scale environmental parameters associated with Atlantic hurricane activity. The influence of these V(s) changes should be incorporated into projections of long-term hurricane activity.","NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami,"Vecchi, GA (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton Forrestal Campus Route 1,POB 308, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA.",gabriel.a.vecchi@noaa.gov,"Soden, Brian/ABC-3659-2021; Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Soden, Brian/0000-0001-9693-8236",,,,,23,206,209,0,28,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Examples of pagan actions at such sites, including at Avebury and Stonehenge, demonstrate not only that their engagements with sacred sites are diverse and that identities - such as that of 'new indigenes' - arising there from are complex, but also that heritage management has not entirely neglected the issues. In addition to managed open access solstice celebrations at Stonehenge, a climate of inclusivity and multivocality has resulted in fruitful negotiations at the Rollright Stones.","Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sch Social Sci & Law, Sheffield S10 2BP, S Yorkshire, England; Amer Int Univ, London W8 5BN, England",Sheffield Hallam University,"Blain, J (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sch Social Sci & Law, Collegiate Crescent Campus, Sheffield S10 2BP, S Yorkshire, England.",J.Blain@shu.ac.uk; robert.wallis@richmond.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,27,27,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1359-1835,,,J MAT CULT,J.

Simulation results are compared with real driving emissions tests, using a portable emissions measurement device on a light and heavy vehicle. Quantifying the gap between macro -level simulation and actual emissions, the paper contributes by showing that pollutants are significantly underestimated, especially for heavy vehicles.

Bailly argued that Atlantis was the root civilization of mankind, which had invented the arts and sciences and civilized the Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians. He situated this primordial people in the far north of Eurasia, and argued that as the cooling of the Earth buried their ancestral home beneath sheets of ice, the Atlanteans were lost to history. Bailly drew eclectically upon science, classical mythology, linguistics, and orientalism to substantiate his case, and argued that the Brahmans who shaped Indian civilization were Sanskrit-speaking Atlanteans. His theories reflected many of the prevailing ideas of the age, such as the climate determinism of Montesquieu and Buffon and the superiority of the dynamic West over the decadent Orient. Though Bailly did not racialize the Atlanteans, his works laid the foundations for the subsequent emergence of the Aryan myth.","New Coll Florida, Div Social Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA",State University System of Florida; New College Florida,"Harvey, DA (corresponding author), New Coll Florida, Div Social Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA.",dharvey@ncf.edu,,,,,,,69,2,2,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1479-2443,1479-2451,,MOD INTELLECT HIST,Mod.

However, state-of-the-art methods for the safe and efficient design of bicycle facilities are based on difficult-to-collect data and potentially dubious assumptions regarding cyclist behavior. Simulation models offer a way forward, but existing bicycling models in the academic literature have not been validated with actual data.. These shortcomings are addressed by obtaining real-world bicycle data and implementing a multilane, inhomogeneous cellular automaton simulation model that can reproduce observations. The existing literature is reviewed to inform the data collection and model development. It is found that the model emulates field conditions while possibly underpredicting bike path capacity. Since the simulation model can observe individual cyclists, it is ideally suited to determine level of service based on difficult-to-observe cycling events such as passing. Future work on data collection and model development is suggested.","[Gould, Gregory; Karner, Alex] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Gould, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ggould@ucdavis.edu,"Karner, Alex/I-6672-2019","Karner, Alex/0000-0002-3651-8157; Rowangould, Gregory/0000-0003-3315-5028",,,,,22,37,41,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

However, the timing and the regions of the production and consumption of the renewable energy do not always match, and different energy storage technologies are needed to secure the uninterrupted energy supply. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a flexible media for the storage and transportation of renewable energy. These liquid hydrogen batteries are reversibly hydrogenated and dehydrogenated using catalysts at elevated temperatures. Commercial LOHC concepts are already available. Another flexible route to store energy is through circular hydrogen carriers, such as methanol and methane produced from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). These fuels have a long history as fossil fuels. In this review, the chemistry and state-of-the-art of LOHCs are explored and discussed against defined criteria with comparison made to existing energy storage systems.

However, such an understanding is hindered by the immense chemical complexity of environmental mixtures of organics; for example, atmospheric organic aerosol consists of at least thousands of individual compounds, all of which likely evolve chemically over their atmospheric lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate the utility of describing organic aerosol (and other complex organic mixtures) in terms of average carbon oxidation state, a quantity that always increases with oxidation, and is readily measured using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Field and laboratory measurements of the average carbon oxidation state, using several such techniques, constrain the chemical properties of the organics and demonstrate that the formation and evolution of organic aerosol involves simultaneous changes to both carbon oxidation state and carbon number.","[Kroll, Jesse H.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kroll, Jesse H.; Kessler, Sean H.] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Atmospher Particle Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Jimenez, Jose L.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jimenez, Jose L.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Canagaratna, Manjula R.; Kolb, Charles E.; Worsnop, Douglas R.] Aerodyne Res Inc, Ctr Aerosol & Cloud Chem, Billerica, MA 01821 USA; [Wilson, Kevin R.; Bluhm, Hendrik; Mysak, Erin R.; Smith, Jared D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Altieri, Katye E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mazzoleni, Lynn R.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Wozniak, Andrew S.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Worsnop, Douglas R.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Worsnop, Douglas R.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Worsnop, Douglas R.] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Phys, Kuopio, Finland",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Carnegie Mellon University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Aerodyne Research; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Princeton University; Michigan Technological University; Old Dominion University; University of Helsinki; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Eastern Finland,"Kroll, JH (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jhkroll@mit.edu,"Altieri, Katye/M-5231-2014; Worsnop, Douglas R/D-2817-2009; Donahue, Neil M/A-2329-2008; Altieri, Katye/GWV-4512-2022; Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020; Mazzoleni, Lynn/H-6545-2011; Jimenez, Jose L/A-5294-2008; Kolb, Charles E./A-8596-2009","Altieri, Katye/0000-0002-6778-4079; Worsnop, Douglas R/0000-0002-8928-8017; Donahue, Neil M/0000-0003-3054-2364; Altieri, Katye/0000-0002-6778-4079; Mazzoleni, Lynn/0000-0002-0226-7337; Jimenez, Jose L/0000-0001-6203-1847; Wozniak, Andrew/0000-0002-7079-3144","US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [R833746]; US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-05ER63995]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [ATM-0904292, ATM-0449815, ATM-0919189]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA08OAR4310565]; Office of Energy Research, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, and Chemical Sciences Division of the US DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL); Camille and Henry Dreyfus foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [0919189] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency); US Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Office of Energy Research, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, and Chemical Sciences Division of the US DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL); Camille and Henry Dreyfus foundation; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This work was supported by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science To Achieve Results (STAR) program (grant R833746 to J.H.K., N.M.D., D.R.W.), the US Department of Energy (DOE: grant DE-FG02-05ER63995), the National Science Foundation (NSF: grant ATM-0904292 to C.E.K., D.R.W. and M.R.C.; grants ATM-0449815 and ATM-0919189 to J.L.J.) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA: grant NA08OAR4310565).

Previous studies have analyzed NDCs largely in terms of their implied contribution to limit global warming, their implications on the energy sector or on mitigation costs. Nevertheless, a gap in the literature exists regarding the understanding of implications of the NDCs on countries' Energy-Water Land nexus resource systems. The present paper explores this angle within the regional context of Latin America by employing the Global Change Assessment Model, a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model capable of representing key system-wide interactions among nexus sectors and mitigation policies. By focusing on Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, we stress potential implications on national-level water demands depending on countries' strategies to enforce energy-related emissions reductions and their interplays with the land sector. Despite the differential implications of the Paris pledges on each country, increased water demands for crop and biomass irrigation and for electricity generation stand out as potential trade-offs that may emerge under the NDC policy. Hence, this study underscores the need of considering a nexus resource planning framework (known as Nexus Approach) in the forthcoming NDCs updating cycles as a mean to contribute toward sustainable development.","[Da Silva, Silvia R.

New technologies, pilot networks, targeted deployments of instruments, and state-of-the art coupled numerical models have enabled advances in research and forecast capabilities and illustrate a potential framework for future development. Here, applications and key results made possible by the different ocean observing efforts in support of studies and forecasts of TCs and ECs, as well as recent advances in observing technologies and strategies are reviewed. Then a vision and specific recommendations for the next decade are discussed.","[Domingues, Ricardo; Zhang, Jun A.; Le Henaff, Matthieu] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Domingues, Ricardo; Halliwell, George; Kim, Hyun-Sook; Zhang, Jun A.; Le Henaff, Matthieu; Foltz, Gregory R.; Bringas, Francis; LaCour, Benjamin; Mehra, Avichal; Dong, Jili; Knaff, John A.; Goni, Gustavo] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Shirahama Oceanog Observ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Shionomisaki Wind Effect Lab, Kyoto, Japan; [Chardon-Maldonado, Patricia] Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing Syst, Mayaguez, PR USA; [Chardon-Maldonado, Patricia] Univ Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, PR USA; [Todd, Robert E.; Jayne, Steven R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Kim, Hyun-Sook] IM Syst Grp Inc, Rockville, MD USA; [Lin, I-I] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Sato, Katsufumi; Narazaki, Tomoko; Fukuoka, Takuya] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Shay, Lynn K.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Miles, Travis; Glenn, Scott] Univ Miami, Dept Ocean Sci, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Centurioni, Luca] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA; [Ali, M.

Being CO2 (or R744) recognized across the world as the most promising working fluid for supermarket applications, commercial transcritical R744 refrigeration systems have emerged as leading hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free technologies. This study is intended to implement an in-depth review study covering the most important aspects related to the state-of-the-art pure R744 refrigeration plants for food retail applications, including the evolution of system architectures, some field measurements, the main available results from an energy, environmental and economic perspective as well as the indispensable future investigations. It could be concluded that, in spite of some persisting barriers which still prevent such technologies from a wider adoption, the usage of R744 as the only refrigerant in supermarkets is no longer open to dispute, even in warm locations.

In the 1950s, a powerful coalition of academics, businesspeople, and politicians launched a plan to move the state away from its traditional reliance on low-wage industries by founding a research park between Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, believing that scientific firms would value the park's proximity to several nearby colleges and universities. The essay argues that local boosters emphasized the area's cultural opportunities and intellectual climate as major quality-of-life considerations not only for high-tech companies, but also the scientists and engineers that they hoped to employ. Research Triangle Park thus created a blueprint for subsequent development strategieslater promoted by Florida, among other scholars and consultantsthat made arts, education, and other cultural institutions central to the marketing of an urban area's identity.","[Cummings, Alex Sayf] Georgia State Univ, POB 4117, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Cummings, AS (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, POB 4117, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",alexcummings@gsu.edu,,,Recent Doctoral Recipients Fellowship from the Andrew W.

This study presents a series of acylhydrazone-based covalent organic gels (COGs). The COGs are stable in acidic media and show high proton conductivity over the temperature range of -40 to 60 degrees C under anhydrous conditions. Compared with other reported organic conductive materials, both a state-of-the-art conductivity of 3.8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at -40 degrees C and superior long-term stability are demonstrated.

The company, recognizing the present and future role that photovoltaics will play in the world energy scenario, has established links with LABSOLAR to receive training and build knowledge on PV. This paper describes the design and installation of the so far largest PV system in the country: a 45.5kWp grid-connected thin-film. system, comprising six sub-systems using PV: modules from four different a-Si manufacturers, one cadmium: telluride(CdTe) and one copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) manufacturer.

This paper utilizes a case study with a Swedish martial arts club, renowned for its social inclusion culture and undertaking of a refugee initiative. I analyze this material according to Archer's (1995) morphogenetic approach. The results show that several issues prevent the refugees' social inclusion. According to the morphogenetic approach, these issues are due to structural- and cultural conditions, which partially set the stage for how the club responds to diversity. In contemplating incidents that hamper the initiative, informants deliberated how refugees fail to adopt specific ways of training and behaving. The narratives reflect the broader Swedish political climate concerning migrants'adaptation, where assimilation, rather than integration, is preferred. Thus, the paper contributes towards the (critical) realist-understanding of sport and social inclusion and offers insights into generative mechanisms that underpin exclusionary practices.","[Mickelsson, Tony Blomqvist] Sodertorn Univ, Ctr Baltic & Eastern European Studies, Sch Social Sci, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Mickelsson, TB (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Ctr Baltic & Eastern European Studies, Sch Social Sci, Huddinge, Sweden.",Tony.mickelsson.blomqvist@sh.se,,,,,,,54,1,1,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-0437,1743-0445,,SPORT SOC,Sport Soc.,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/17430437.2022.2069013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17430437.2022.2069013,,22-Apr,17,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Sociology",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sociology,0W4DT,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000788980200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While encouraging results have been obtained with a careful examination of the spatial aspects of the model error estimates, less attention has been devoted to the time correlation aspects of model errors and their impact on the assimilation cycle. In this work we employ a Lagged Analysis Increment Covariance (LAIC) diagnostic to gain insight in the temporal evolution of systematic model errors in the ECMWF operational data assimilation system, evaluate the effectiveness of the current weak constraint 4D-Var algorithm in reducing these types of errors and, based on these findings, start exploring new ideas for the development of model error estimation and correction strategies in data assimilation.","[Bonavita, Massimo] ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Bonavita, M (corresponding author), ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.",massimo.bonavita@ecmwf.int,,"Bonavita, Massimo/0000-0002-0392-284X",,,,,30,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

Bio-hydrogen is not a primary energy source, but it is compatible with electrochemical and combustion processes for energy conversion; this gas can be stored, transported and utilised to fulfil energy needs, and it also contributes to minimise carbon-based emissions reducing environmental pollution and climate change. In the present manuscript, a reviewis performed about the state of the art of the dark fermentation process and its integration with other processes in an attempt to increase the efficiency of substrate conversion. The two-stage configurations studied involve the bioprocesses for hydrogen production and waste treatment by coupling the dark fermentation process with an alternative biological route such as anaerobic digestion, microbial electrochemical systems or photo-fermentation to promote an efficient stabilisation and use of the organic matter.","[Judith Martinez, E.; Blanco, Daniel; Gomez, Xiomar] Univ Leon, Nat Resources Inst IRENA, Chem & Environm Bioproc Engn Grp, Av Portugal 41, Leon 24009, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Martinez, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Nat Resources Inst IRENA, Chem & Environm Bioproc Engn Grp, Av Portugal 41, Leon 24009, Spain.",ejmartr@unileon.es,"MARTINEZ TORRES, ELIA JUDITH/M-8654-2013","MARTINEZ TORRES, ELIA JUDITH/0000-0002-4426-4353",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [CTQ2015-68925-R],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional(European Commission),This research was possible thanks to the financial support of the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional through the project CTQ2015-68925-R.,,167,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-7609,2363-761,978-3-030-10516-7; 978-3-030-10515-0,BIOFUEL BIOREFIN TEC,,,2019,,,,,149,179,,10.1007/978-3-030-10516-7_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10516-7_7,10.1007/978-3-030-10516-7,,31,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,BQ8PF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000621179500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The built environment has a massive impact on the environment: climate change, resource and water use, loss of biodiversity. Changing the way and what we build is fundamental. Integral sustainable design theory offers a chance to rethink our approach and to genuinely shift paradigms. The theory is challenging and to date has been largely ignored in architectural design. This paper describes research that has used the theory to evaluate the sustainability of an existing re-used building. The results indicate that the theory has potential to shift thinking from quantitative performance criteria to embrace qualitative and experiential aspects in a holistic way. The interconnections between the art and science of building are revealed. The research also reveals questions to be resolved if integral sustainable design theory is to be further adopted.

In order to optimise the reliability and efficiency of parametric insurance, it is essential to have well-defined trigger points for any post-disaster payout. This requires a robust localised hazard assessment for a given region. However, due to the rarity of severe, landfalling tropical cyclones, it is difficult to obtain a robust hazard assessment based on historical observations. A recent approach makes use of unrealised, high impact tropical cyclones from state-of-the-art ensemble prediction systems to build a physically consistent event set, which would be equivalent to about 10,000 years of observations. In this study, we demonstrate that (1) alternative trigger points of parametric typhoon insurance can be constructed from a local perspective and the added value of such trigger points can be analysed by comparing with an experimental set-up informed by current practice; (2) the estimation of the occurrence of tropical cyclone-related losses on the provincial level can be improved. We further discuss the potential future development of a general tropical cyclone compound parametric insurance.","[Ng, Kelvin S.; Leckebusch, Gregor C.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Leckebusch, Gregor C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Ye, Qian] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ying, Wenwen; Zhao, Haoran] Swiss Reinsurance Co Ltd, Beijing Branch, Beijing 100026, Peoples R China",University of Birmingham; Free University of Berlin; Beijing Normal University,"Ng, KS (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",k.s.ng@bham.ac.uk; g.c.leckebusch@bham.ac.uk; qianye@bnu.edu.cn; wenwen_ying@swissre.com; haoran_zhao@swissre.com,"Ng, Kelvin S./AAE-8671-2022","Ng, Kelvin S./0000-0002-1464-1701",,,,,66,0,0,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2021,12,,,,,,174,10.3390/cli9120174,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9120174,,,25,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,XW9RQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000735947200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this question, a procedure integrating both the state-of-the-art of crop growth models and IPCC scenarios with fine spatial resolution input data was developed. Spatially distributed simulations were run at a sub-regional scale in marginal humid areas (MHAs) surrounding rivers, artificial lakes or irrigation canals, considering time horizons centered on 2030 and 2050. Results indicate that giant reed productivity is expected to increase in the future due to early canopy closure and more favourable temperature condition for photosynthesis.

The procedure and results produced should be considered as an useful information supporting tool for mid-term planning policies targeting the recovery of MHAs in non-agricultural contexts.","[Ginaldi, Fabrizio; Cappelli, Giovanni Alessandro; Ceotto, Enrico] CREA AA Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, Via Corticella 133, I-40128 Bologna, Italy",,"Ginaldi, F (corresponding author), CREA AA Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Agr & Environm, Via Corticella 133, I-40128 Bologna, Italy.",fabrizio.ginaldi@crea.gov.it,,"Cappelli, Giovanni Alessandro/0000-0003-4430-9838; Ginaldi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-9137-9754","Emilia-Romagna Region under the project REBAF (Recupero Energetico Biomasse Alvei Fluviali), Progetto POR-FESR 2014-2020","Emilia-Romagna Region under the project REBAF (Recupero Energetico Biomasse Alvei Fluviali), Progetto POR-FESR 2014-2020","This study was financed by the Emilia-Romagna Region under the project REBAF (Recupero Energetico Biomasse Alvei Fluviali), Progetto POR-FESR 2014-2020.",,8,1,1,0,0,ETA-FLORENCE RENEWABLE ENERGIES,FLORENCE,"VIA A  GIACOMINI 28, FLORENCE, 50132, ITALY",,,,,,,2018,,,,,259,262,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,BP1RY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000540663800046,View Full Record in Web of Science

San Pedro de Atacama, for example, is a small town where earth blocks (adobes) and rammed earth (tapial) are important ways to construct, an art passed on through generations. Energy properties of earth are very interesting: thermal conductivity is low; heat storage capacity is high; color is variable and can be used to absorb or to reject solar radiation. However, nowadays the government social dwelling service is proposing a different type of construction, which does not maintain any relation with the tradition. This paper presents simulation studies and monitoring of four different San Pedro houses, constructed by using different techniques and materials. Results can be used to discuss the thermal performance needed in desert climate and the reliability of social dwelling service houses, under construction at this time in the town.","[Palme, Massimo; Guerra, Jose; Alfaro, Sergio] Univ Catolica Norte, Sch Architecture, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Palme, M (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Sch Architecture, Av Angamos 610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.",mpalme@ucn.cl; jguerra@ucn.cl; salfaro@ucn.cl,"Palme, Massimo/H-5322-2011; RAMIREZ, JOSE GUERRA/AAQ-1743-2021","Palme, Massimo/0000-0003-1166-2926; ",CIAE laboratory of the UCN School of Architecture; MECESUP Project of the Chilean Government,CIAE laboratory of the UCN School of Architecture; MECESUP Project of the Chilean Government,This work was supported by CIAE laboratory of the UCN School of Architecture and MECESUP Project of the Chilean Government.

Microcystins are potently hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic as well as carcinogenic. Thus microcystins are threat to tourism, agriculture and animal's health. However, there is a still lacuna in the knowledge of regulation of microcystins production. Presence of toxic and non-toxic cyanobacterial strains together and occurrence of various microcystin variants in aquatic bodies compounded the problem. Although several analytical techniques for microcystin detection such as bioassay, ELISA, HPLC and LC-MS etc. have been already prevalent, the development of biosensors offered rapid and accurate detection, high reproducibility and portability. Sequencing of Microcystis spp., opened the new vistas towards the development of biosensor at molecular and genetic level.

This study aims to contribute to this domain by first, generating a labelled tree species dataset using Google Maps static API to supply aerial images and Trees In Camden inventory to supply species information, GPS coordinates (Latitude and Longitude), and tree diameter. Furthermore, this study investigates how state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Network models including VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3 can handle the species classification problem of the urban trees using aerial images.

Such models commonly suffer from overdissipation of mesoscale eddies by routinely used subgrid dissipation (viscosity) operators and a resulting depletion of energy in the large-scale structures which are crucial for draining available potential energy into kinetic energy. More broadly, subgrid momentum closures may lead to both overdissipation or pileup of eddy kinetic energy and enstrophy of the smallest resolvable scales. The aim of this chapter is twofold. First, it reviews the theory of two-dimensional and geostrophic turbulence. To a large part, this is textbook material with particular emphasis, however, on issues relevant to modeling the global ocean in the eddy-permitting regime. Second, we discuss several recent parameterizations of subgrid dynamics, including simplified backscatter schemes by Jansen and Held, stochastic superparameterizations by Grooms and Majda, and an empirical backscatter scheme by Mana and Zanna.","[Danilov, Sergey] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Danilov, Sergey; Juricke, Stephan; Kutsenko, Anton; Oliver, Marcel] Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Jacobs University","Oliver, M (corresponding author), Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany.",sergey.danilov@awi.de; s.juricke@jacobs-university.de; a.kutsenko@jacobs-university.de; oliver@member.ams.org,"Oliver, Marcel/AAG-8775-2020; Danilov, Sergey/S-6184-2016; Danilov, Sergey/HGB-2692-2022","Oliver, Marcel/0000-0003-0921-4032; Danilov, Sergey/0000-0001-8098-182X; Juricke, Stephan/0000-0003-4614-2509",,,,,117,10,11,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2524-4264,2524-4272,978-3-030-05704-6; 978-3-030-05703-9,MATH PLANET EARTH,,,2019,,,,,145,192,,10.1007/978-3-030-05704-6_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05704-6_5,10.1007/978-3-030-05704-6,,48,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Mathematics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,BQ9GG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000624470500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wet snow accumulations on overhead power lines are estimated using observations from a network of surface synoptic weather stations, while areas of severe in-cloud icing (rime icing) are identified from high resolution numerical weather prediction model simulations. Ice loads at 50 year return period were estimated using the Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) method and interpolated to a high resolution map using regression kriging. The results indicate a significant variation with elevation and latitude, with the highest loads expected in the wettest parts of the Scottish Highlands. In-cloud icing occurs mainly above 300-400 m and is the dominant icing type above 400-600 in depending on the location. The final icing map demonstrates how state of the art atmospheric icing models can be successfully utilized to estimate the icing climate even when only very limited measurements of actual icing are available.

In this study, we examined a conceptual model of academic attainment including two aspects of the pedagogical environment experienced by students, namely the cognitive demands set by professors and the social support provided by both professors and other students. Along with these climate variables, three psychosocial dispositions of students, self-esteem, perceived academic control, and coping strategies, were also included. A sample of 854 undergraduate students in the faculties of Arts and Science from a mid-western Research-1 (Canadian) university was used to estimate the effect parameters in the model. The results suggest that both cognitive demands and social support affected the students' perceived academic control and coping strategies. In turn, the pedagogical environment and the psychosocial dispositions affected the students' academic achievement. Implications for establishing and maintaining supportive pedagogical environments and for helping students improve their perceived control and coping strategies are discussed.","Univ Manitoba, St Johns Coll, Fac Educ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M5, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M5, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Off Univ 1, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M5, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Sociol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M5, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba,"Clifton, RA (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, St Johns Coll, Fac Educ, 92 Dysart Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2M5, Canada.",Clifton@MS.UManitoba.CA,"Perry, Raymond/AAU-6160-2021; Roberts, Laura Weiss/Q-3845-2019","Roberts, Laura Weiss/0000-0003-4270-253X",,,,,44,29,30,0,17,KLUWER ACADEMIC-HUMAN SCIENCES PRESS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0361-0365,,,RES HIGH EDUC,Res.

Although many researchers favor the application of ester fluids, utilities are still uncertain and application of these alternatives remains a challenge. The intent of this survey is to present recent research progress and highlight the state of the art of key aspects that should be emphasized in future research. The contemporary research scenarios pertaining to the performance of ester fluids versus mineral oils, miscibility, and retrofilling of insulating fluids are discussed. In addition, pre-breakdown phenomena, usage of esters in on-load tap changers, environmental and fire resistance properties, and use of esters in cold climates are also discussed. Importantly, challenges and future aspects that should be investigated to improve the existing knowledge of ester dielectric fluids for applications in transformer technology are highlighted.","[Rao, U.

In fact, the installation site also affects the degradation rate of the PV panels and, thus, long-term energy production and reliability. Prior-art lifetime analysis in PV inverters has not yet investigated the impact of PV panel degradations. This paper, thus, evaluates the lifetime of PV inverters considering panel degradation rates and mission profiles. Evaluations have been carried out on PV systems installed in Denmark and Arizona. The results reveal that the PV panel degradation rate has a considerable impact on the PV inverter lifetime, especially in the hot climate (e.g., Arizona), where the panel degrades at a faster rate. In that case, the PV inverter lifetime prediction can be deviated by 54%, if the impact of PV panel degradations is not taken into account.","[Sangwongwanich, Ariya; Yang, Yongheng; Sera, Dezso; Blaabjerg, Frede] Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Yang, YH (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.",ars@et.aau.dk; yoy@et.aau.dk; des@et.aau.dk; fbl@et.aau.dk,"Yang, Yongheng/N-7735-2015; Blaabjerg, Frede/A-5008-2008; Sera, Dezso/P-6785-2019; Sangwongwanich, Ariya/V-9577-2019","Yang, Yongheng/0000-0002-1488-4762; Blaabjerg, Frede/0000-0001-8311-7412; Sera, Dezso/0000-0001-9050-2423; Sangwongwanich, Ariya/0000-0002-2587-0024","European Commission within the European Union's Seventh Frame-work Program (FP7/2007-2013) through the SOLAR-ERA.NET Transnational Project [PV2.3-PV2GRID]; Energinet.dk (ForskEL, Denmark) [2015-1-12359]; Research Promotion Foundation (RPF, Cyprus) [KOINA/SOLAR-ERA.NET/0114/02]","European Commission within the European Union's Seventh Frame-work Program (FP7/2007-2013) through the SOLAR-ERA.NET Transnational Project; Energinet.dk (ForskEL, Denmark); Research Promotion Foundation (RPF, Cyprus)","This work was supported in part by the European Commission within the European Union's Seventh Frame-work Program (FP7/2007-2013) through the SOLAR-ERA.NET Transnational Project (PV2.3-PV2GRID), by Energinet.dk (ForskEL, Denmark, Project 2015-1-12359), and in part by the Research Promotion Foundation (RPF, Cyprus, Project KOINA/SOLAR-ERA.NET/0114/02).",,48,105,106,1,31,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0885-8993,1941-0107,,IEEE T POWER ELECTR,IEEE Trans.

Companies readily provided examples of their current glassware and sometimes also donated items such as tools or photographs in keeping with the museum's interest in creating educational exhibitions for public display. These collections, and the correspondence that accompanies them, offer an important, tightly datable glimpse of American glass and of the museum's concerns of the period. This article discusses the earliest phase of this collecting, between 1886 and 1896, in which the New England Glass Company donated examples of its new Pomona glass, three Pittsburgh area glassmakers provided colored, pressed, and cut glass, and the museum acquired 39 examples of Louis Comfort Tiffany's new Favrile glass.","Smithsonian Inst, Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Home & Community Life, Washington, DC 20560 USA",American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Smithsonian Institution,"Myers, SH (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Home & Community Life, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",shm141@msn.com,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,2,CORNING MUSEUM GLASS,CORNING,"CORNING GLASS CENTER, CORNING, NY 14831 USA",0075-4250,,,J GLASS STUD,J.

Historical documents suggest that the killing of the last summer-resident polar bears on the St. Matthew Islands was an indirect consequence of the controversy between the United States and Great Britain over management of the fur seal harvest and the associated pelagic hunting of these seals. Although polar bears have continued to be present near the St. Matthew Islands in winter, when sea ice is present, a metapopulation of summer-resident bears has not-reestablished on these islands. In 1972, the State of Alaska considered a proposal to reestablish a summer-resident polar bear population on the St. Matthew Islands, and since 2008, when the United States listed the polar bear as a threatened species, such reestablishment has been suggested as a conservation strategy. However, given the observed changes in local Bering Sea ice conditions in recent decades, the lack of detailed information on the population ecology and habitat dependencies of the historical St. Matthew bears, and the unavailability of an analogous extant metapopulation of polar bears for comparison, it is highly unlikely that reestablishment of summer-resident polar bears on the St. Matthew Islands could be realized.","[Klein, David R.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Sowls, Art] Alaska Maritime Natl Wildlife Refuge, Homer, AK 99603 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Klein, DR (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",dklein7@alaska.edu,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Alaska Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit; Institute of Arctic Biology; Department of Biology and Wildlife of the University of Alaska Fairbanks,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Alaska Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit; Institute of Arctic Biology; Department of Biology and Wildlife of the University of Alaska Fairbanks,"We appreciate the logistical and other support of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge during expeditions to the St. Matthew Islands.

However, the link between biophilic design and vernacular architecture has yet to be thoroughly explored, especially in the context of China, which is the gap this article aims to fill. Investigating the vernacular architecture of the Naxi, this research found that biophilic design attributes and features existed in vernacular buildings and settlements. A matrix framework was developed to facilitate the in-depth investigation of the interrelated elements of the Naxi such as local climate, topography, culture, their belief system, conventions, arts and literature. Among other results, we found that the local culture was influenced by animism and distinct cosmic models. Also, the buildings were constructed using the traditional ways of material preparation and conventions of occupancy. This research serves as an important springboard to bridge between studies in biophilic design and studies in vernacular architecture and settlements.","[Li, Mengbi] Victoria Univ, Year Coll 1, Inst Sustainable Ind & Liveable Cities, Footscray, Vic 3011, Australia; [Chau, Hing-Wah] Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, Inst Sustainable Ind & Liveable Cities, Built Environm Discipline Grp, Footscray, Vic 3011, Australia; [Aye, Lu] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Victoria University; Victoria University; University of Melbourne,"Aye, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",lua@unimelb.edu.au,"Aye, Lu/J-8733-2013; Chau, Hing-wah/AAZ-4639-2021","Aye, Lu/0000-0002-5495-1683; Chau, Hing-Wah/0000-0002-3501-9882; Li, Mengbi/0000-0001-7499-8940",Inspiring discussions with Xing Ruan,Inspiring discussions with Xing Ruan,"This article is based on a study that drew on the support from many colleagues.

This is particularly true when the ideology those monuments were erected to promote is hotly contested within society. Throughout the American South, cities and states are grappling with the issue of what to do with Confederate statuary, especially in the current political climate which has highlighted America's lingering race issues and the violence attached to them. Russia was faced with a similar issue two decades earlier when the Soviet Union was dismantled, but its monumental propaganda still stood on virtually every street corner and square. This problem is analyzed in this essay by systematically analyzing these monuments according to their various historical and ideological values, as categorized by the prominent art historical Alois Riegl. Strategies employed by Russian policymakers in the late twentieth century are analyzed as a potential solution for officials throughout the South as they grapple with the issue today.","[Buhler, Clinton J.] Dixie State Univ, Humanities Dept, 225 South Univ Ave, St George, UT 84770 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Dixie State University,"Buhler, CJ (corresponding author), Dixie State Univ, Humanities Dept, 225 South Univ Ave, St George, UT 84770 USA.",buhler@dixie.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,3,EDIZIONI UNIVERSITA MACERATA,MACERATA,"CENTRO DIREZIONALE, VIA CARDUCCI, 63-A, MACERATA, 62100, ITALY",2039-2362,,,CAPITAL CULT,Capital.

A series of simulations for computing wind cooling potential have been performed using the UTCI index temperatures. The comfort cooling effect of wind has been estimated by modelling with wind taken into account, and under calm wind (0.05 m/s) (Delta UTCI). A novel wind rose biometeorological data visualisation tool that integrates an additional thermal comfort dimension into the conventional climatology wind rose visualisation was developed in this study. The new wind rose graphic tool identifies predominant wind directions, and whether or not they are desirable from the human thermal comfort point of view. This tool's utility lies in its identification of the optimal building orientation in its surrounding urban morphology, based on the cooling potential of wind resources when enhanced ventilation is desirable for thermal comfort.","[Sadeghi, Mahsan; de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wood, Graeme] Arup, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Samali, Bijan] Western Sydney Univ, Ctr Infrastruct Engn, Sydney, NSW 2751, Australia",University of Sydney; Western Sydney University,"de Dear, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",Richard.Dedear@sydney.edu.au,"de Dear, Richard/AAP-8963-2020","de Dear, Richard/0000-0002-3414-290X; Sadeghi, Mahsan/0000-0002-3155-7376","Centre for Infrastructure Engineering (CIE) at the Western Sydney University (WSU); School of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney","Centre for Infrastructure Engineering (CIE) at the Western Sydney University (WSU); School of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney","This research project was financially supported by the Centre for Infrastructure Engineering (CIE) at the Western Sydney University (WSU) and the School of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney.

If, for example, one day is sunny and warm, there is a high tendency that the next day remains similar. In this paper, we review recent results showing that the long-term persistence, characterized by the correlation C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days, decays for large s as a power law. For continental stations, the exponent is always close to 0.7, while for stations on islands as well as for sea surface temperatures, the exponent is close to 0.4. In contrast to the temperature fluctuations, the fluctuations of the rainfall usually are not characterized by long-term power-law correlations but rather by short-term correlations. The universal persistence law for the temperature fluctuations on continental stations represents an ideal (and uncomfortable) test bed for the state-of-the-art global climate models and allows to evaluate their performance.

Following a review of recent advances in dynamic daylight computation capabilities, climate-based daylighting metrics, occupant behavior and glare analysis, a fully integrated design analysis method is introduced that simultaneously considers annual daylight availability, visual comfort and energy use: Annual daylight glare probability profiles are combined with an occupant behavior model in order to determine annual shading profiles and visual comfort conditions throughout a space. The shading profiles are then used to calculate daylight autonomy plots, energy loads, operational energy costs and green house gas emissions. The paper then shows how simulation results for a sidelit space can be visually presented to simulation non-experts using the concept of a daylighting dashboard.

However, there are still uncertainties concerning physical mechanisms that control their altitude, geographical, and seasonal distributions. Using the Max Planck Institute Martian General Circulation Model (MPI-MGCM), incorporating a state-of-the-art whole atmosphere subgrid-scale gravity wave parameterization (Yigit et al., 2008), we demonstrate that internal gravity waves generated by lower atmospheric weather processes have a wide-reaching impact on the Martian climate. Globally, GWs cool the upper atmosphere of Mars by similar to 10% and facilitate high-altitude CO2 ice cloud formation. CO2 ice cloud seasonal variations in the mesosphere and the mesopause region appreciably coincide with the spatio-temporal variations of GW effects, providing insight into the observed distribution of clouds. Our results suggest that GW propagation and dissipation constitute a necessary physical mechanism for CO2 ice cloud formation in the Martian upper atmosphere during all seasons.","[Yigit, Erdal] George Mason Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Medvedev, Alexander S.; Hartogh, Paul] Max Planck Inst Solar Syst Res, Gottingen, Germany",George Mason University; Max Planck Society,"Yigit, E (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",eyigit@gmu.edu,"Yiğit, Erdal/J-3084-2019; Medvedev, Alexander S./AAC-3242-2019","Yiğit, Erdal/0000-0002-2819-2521; Medvedev, Alexander S./0000-0003-2713-8977",German Science Foundation (DFG) [HA3261/8-1]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS 1452137],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The modeling data supporting the figures presented in this paper can be obtained from EY (eyigit@gmu.edu).This work was partially supported by German Science Foundation (DFG) grant HA3261/8-1.

The anticommons thesis is simple: when too many people own pieces of one thing, nobody can use it. Usually, private ownership creates wealth. But too much ownership has the opposite effect it leads to wasteful underuse. This is a free market paradox that shows up all across the global economy. If too many owners control a single resource, cooperation breaks down, wealth disappears, and everybody loses. Conceptually, underuse in an anticommons mirrors the familiar problem of overuse in a tragedy of the commons. The field of anticommons studies is now well-established. Over a thousand scholars have detailed examples from across the innovation frontier, including drug patenting, telecom licensing, climate change, compulsory land purchase, oil field unitisation, music and art copyright, and post-socialist economic transition.

It argues that the genre consistently drew audiences from most social strata and should not be considered, as some historians have suggested, a uniquely 'bourgeois' form of entertainment closely associated with the rise of the middle classes. It also argues that operetta crystallized a range of wider concerns about Russian culture and politics during the era of the Great Reforms. Many critics attacked operetta's frivolity and eroticism (held to be inconsistent with the aims of art), while radicals and conservatives regarded it as symptomatic of a new climate of political uncertainty (the former with hope, the latter with trepidation). The critical responses to operetta thus testified to its popularity and to the rapidity of change in Russia during the 1860s and 1870s.","Univ Dundee, Sch Humanities, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Dundee,"Frame, M (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Humanities, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",m.frame@dundee.ac.uk,,"Frame, Murray/0000-0003-1572-8064",,,,,87,2,2,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0265-6914,,,EUR HIST Q,Eur.

Through words and images, medico-tourist guides perpetuated a myth of the Cote d'Azur as the privileged site of beauty and health, especially to its visiting invalids, who sought in the climate a miraculous natural cure. Poetic descriptions of the landscape's naturally regenerative potential pervade these works, not only by physicians and tourist writers but by the invalids themselves experiencing a pleasurable recovery on the coast. This article argues that such descriptions were, consciously or not, couched in a medical rhetoric, where the landscape's typical topographic elements were understood as both beautiful and healing.

Often the rationale is to aid efforts to downscale GCM output for the purpose of producing more confident climate change impact scenarios. Discrete weather typing techniques, although proven to be successful do not capture weather type intensity and within-type variability can often be high. In this study an objective indexing method, developed for Egypt and the British Isles area is applied to the Iberian peninsula. Air flow index values are then used as predictor variables in simple linear regression models to estimate monthly mean grid point rainfall amounts. Separate models art: evaluated for the winter and summer halves of the year and also for surface and mid-tropospheric flow (500hPa). The models are evaluated and compared indicating that the index values provide good estimation of rainfall but variability in performance between season and site is noted.","Univ Coll Northampton, Sch Environm Sci, Northampton NN2 7AL, England",University of Northampton,"Spellman, G (corresponding author), Univ Coll Northampton, Sch Environm Sci, Northampton NN2 7AL, England.",,,"Spellman, Greg/0000-0003-0600-7185",,,,,14,15,16,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG WIEN,VIENNA,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 VIENNA, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

In the past decades, CO2 capture technology relied on classical liquid amine scrubbing. Due to its high energy consumption and corrosive property, CO2 capture using solid materials has recently come under the spotlight. A variety of porous solid materials were reported such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks. However, amine-functionalized porous materials outperform all others in terms of CO2 adsorption capacity and regeneration efficiency. This review provides a brief overview of CO2 capture by various amines and mechanistic aspects for newcomers entering into this field. This review also covers a state-of-the-art regeneration method, visible/UV light-triggered CO2 desorption at room temperature.

A systematic approach for selecting hydropower sites within river networks may help to minimize the detrimental effects of small hydropower on biodiversity. In addition, a better understanding of reach- and basin-scale impacts is key for designing planning tools. We synthesize the available information about (1) reach-scale and (2) basin-scale impacts of small hydropower plants on biodiversity and ecosystem function, and (3) interactions with other anthropogenic stressors. We then discuss state-of-the-art, spatially explicit planning tools and suggest how improved knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary impacts of hydropower can be incorporated into project development. Such tools can be used to balance the benefits of hydropower production with the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Adequate planning tools that consider basin-scale effects and interactions with other stressors, such as climate change, can maximize long-term conservation.","[Lange, Katharina; Meier, Philipp; Trautwein, Clemens; Schmid, Martin; Weber, Christine] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Surface Waters & Biogeochem, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Lange, Katharina; Brodersen, Jakob] Eawag, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Robinson, Christopher T.] Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Robinson, Christopher T.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Brodersen, Jakob] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Aquat Ecol & Evolut, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bern,"Lange, K (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Surface Waters & Biogeochem, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.;Lange, K (corresponding author), Eawag, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.",katharina.lange@eawag.ch,"Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009","Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691; Weber, Christine/0000-0003-1404-2247; Lange, Katharina/0000-0002-5016-4527",Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER-SoE) [CTI/2013/0288],Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER-SoE),We thank the Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution group for discussions.

Yet little is known about the timing and geographical origin of distemper viruses and to what extent it was influenced by environmental change and human activities. To address this, we (i) performed the first comprehensive time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the two distemper viruses, (ii) mapped distemper antibody and virus detection data from marine mammals collected between 1972 and 2018, and (iii) compiled historical reports on distemper dating back to the eighteenth century. We find that CDV and PDV diverged in the early seventeenth century. Modern CDV strains last shared a common ancestor in the nineteenth century with a marked radiation during the 1930s-1950s. Modern PDV strains are of more recent origin, diverging in the 1970s-1980s. Based on the compiled information on distemper distribution, the diverse host range of CDV and basal phylogenetic placement of terrestrial morbilliviruses, we hypothesize a terrestrial CDV-like ancestor giving rise to PDV in the North Atlantic. Moreover, given the estimated timing of distemper origin and radiation, we hypothesize a prominent role of environmental change such as the Little Ice Age, and human activities like globalization and war in distemper virus evolution.","[Stokholm, Iben; Olsen, Morten Tange] Univ Copenhagen, GLOBE Inst, Evolutionary Genom Sect, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Stokholm, Iben; Siebert, Ursula] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Busum, Germany; [Puryear, Wendy; Sawatzki, Kaitlin] Tufts Univ, Cummings Sch Vet Med, Dept Infect Dis & Global Hlth, North Grafton, MA USA; [Knudsen, Steen Wilhelm] NIVA Denmark Water Res, Njalsgade 76, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark; [Terkelsen, Thilde] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Ole Maales Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Becher, Paul] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Virol, Bunteweg 17, D-30559 Hannover, Germany","University of Copenhagen; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation; Tufts University; University of Copenhagen; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation","Stokholm, I; Olsen, MT (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, GLOBE Inst, Evolutionary Genom Sect, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.;Stokholm, I (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Busum, Germany.",iben.stokholm@sund.ku.dk; morten.olsen@sund.ku.dk,"Olsen, Morten Tange/J-4783-2013; Knudsen, Steen/C-1072-2015","Olsen, Morten Tange/0000-0001-6716-6345; Knudsen, Steen/0000-0003-0428-9940; Stokholm, Iben/0000-0003-4097-251X; Sawatzki, Kaitlin/0000-0002-7933-3064","University of Copenhagen; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover; Velux Foundations [123012]; 'BONUS BALTHEALTH' project; BONUS - Innovation Fund Denmark [6180-00001B, 6180-00002B]; BONUS - Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; BONUS - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03F0767A]; BONUS - Academy of Finland [311966]; BONUS - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); BONUS - EU",University of Copenhagen; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover; Velux Foundations(Velux Fonden); 'BONUS BALTHEALTH' project; BONUS - Innovation Fund Denmark; BONUS - Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; BONUS - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; BONUS - Academy of Finland; BONUS - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); BONUS - EU,"This work has been supported by grants from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover to I.S., the Velux Foundations to M.T.O.

Introduction,INTERFACE FOCUS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,artificial photosynthesis; carbon dioxide fixation; nitrogen fixation; food and fuel security; environmental sustainability; Sustainocene,TERRESTRIAL; CLIMATE; FUEL; FOOD,"This paper introduces a theme issue of Interface Focus derived from papers presented at the Royal Society supported meeting 'Do we need a global project on artificial photosynthesis?' held at Chicheley Hall in July 2014. At that meeting, leaders of national solar fuels and chemicals projects and research presented 'state of the art' on artificial photosynthesis (AP) in the context of the policy challenges for globalizing a practical technology to address climate change and energy and food security concerns. The discussions included contributions from many experts with legal and policy skills and uniquely focused on producing principles for prioritizing and specializing work while enhancing the funding and attendant public policy profile. To this end, representatives of major public, philanthropic and private potential stakeholders in such a project (such as the Wellcome Trust, the Moore Foundation, Shell, the Leighty Foundation, the EPSRC and Deutsche Alternative Asset Management) were invited to provide feedback at various points in the meeting. For this Interface Focus issue, speakers at the Chicheley Hall meeting were required to present a snapshot of their cutting edge research related to AP and then draw upon the Chicheley Hall discussions to innovatively analyse how their research could best be advanced by a global AP project. Such multidisciplinary policy analysis was not a skill many of these researchers were experienced or trained in. Nonetheless their efforts here represent one of the first published collections to attempt such a significant task. This introduction contains a brief summary of those papers, focusing particularly on their policy aspects. It then summarizes the core discussions that took place at the Chicheley Hall meeting and sets out some of the central ethical principles that were considered during those discussions.","[Faunce, Thomas] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Faunce, Thomas] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Med Biol & Environm, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Faunce, T (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Fellows Rd, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",thomas.faunce@anu.edu.au,,"Faunce, Thomas/0000-0002-6767-6190",,,,,23,4,4,0,19,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2042-8898,2042-8901,,INTERFACE FOCUS,Interface Focus,6-Jun,2015,3,,,,,,20150029,10.1098/rsfs.2015.0029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2015.0029,,,5,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,CM7LP,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,12/21/22,WOS:000357874700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four representative power plants onshore (with 2.3 and 3.2 MW turbines) and offshore (4.0 and 6.0 MW turbines) with 2015 state-of-the-art technology data provided by Siemens Wind Power were assessed. The energy payback time was found to be less than 1 year for all technologies. The emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to less than 7 g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore and 11 g CO2-eq/kWh for offshore. Climate change impacts were found to be a good indicator for overall hotspot identification however attention should also be drawn to human toxicity and impacts from respiratory inorganics. The overall higher impact of offshore plants, compared to onshore ones, is mainly due to larger high impact material requirements for capital infrastructure. In both markets the bigger turbines with more advanced direct drive generator technology is shown to perform better than the smaller geared ones. Capital infrastructure is the most impactful life cycle stage across impacts. It accounts for more than 79% and 70% of climate change impacts onshore and offshore respectively. The end-of-life treatment could lead to significant savings due to recycling, ca. 20-30% for climate change. In the manufacturing stage the impacts due to operations at the case company do not exceed 1% of the total life cycle impacts. This finding highlights the shared responsibility across multiple stakeholders and calls for collaborative efforts for comprehensive environmental management across organizations in the value chain. Real life examples are given in order to showcase how LCA results can inform decisions, e.g. for concept and product development and supply chain management. On a systems level the results can be used by energy planners when comparing with alternative energy sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In various traditional healthcare systems, diet-based approaches have always played an important role, which has often survived until today. Therefore, investigating traditional foods aimed at health promotion could render not only novel bioactive substances but also mechanistic insights. However, compared to pharmacologically focused research on natural products, investigating such nutrition-based interventions is even more complicated owing to interacting compounds, less potent and relatively subtle effects, the food matrix, and variations in composition and intake. At the same time, technical advances in 'omics' technologies, cheminformatics, and big data analysis create new opportunities, further strengthened by increasing insights into the biology of health and homeostatic resilience. These are to be combined with state-of-the-art ethnobotanical research, which is key to obtaining reliable and reproducible data.

To this aim, a systematic literature review was carried out revealing that the largest amount of empirical data on suppression costs and related measures derived from North American case studies. Conversely, information on direct wildfire suppression cost categories is usually incomplete or missing throughout Europe, especially in fire-prone Mediterranean countries, even though these areas have been, and continue to be, severely impacted by wildfires, underlining the need to update research in this field, thereby supporting cost-effective fire management plans.","[Mattioli, W.; Ferrara, C.; Lombardo, E.] Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Via Valle Quistione 27, I-00166 Rome, Italy; [Barbati, A.] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst DIBAF, Via S Camillo de Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Salvati, L.] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Methods & Models Econ Terr & Finance, Fac Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Tomao, A.] Univ Macerata, Dept Econ & Law, Via Armaroli 43, I-62100 Macerata, Italy; [Tomao, A.] Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale Santa Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Tuscia University; Sapienza University Rome; University of Macerata; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Mattioli, W (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Via Valle Quistione 27, I-00166 Rome, Italy.",walter.mattioli@crea.gov.it; carlotta.ferrara@crea.gov.it; emanuela.lombardo@crea.gov.it; barbati.sisfor@unitus.it; luca.salvati@uniroma1.it; antonio.tomao@crea.gov.it,"Tomao, Antonio/ABG-3180-2021",,European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG-ECHO) [826400],European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG-ECHO),"The study was supported by the project PREVAIL PREVention Action Increases Large fire response preparedness (826400 - PREVAIL - UCPM-2018-PP-AG), funded by the European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG-ECHO).",,103,1,1,8,8,COMMONWEALTH FORESTRY ASSOC,CRAVEN ARRMS,"CRIB, DINCHOPE, CRAVEN ARRMS SY7 9JJ, SHROPSHIRE, ENGLAND",1465-5489,2053-7778,,INT FOREST REV,Int.

However, understanding of the factors that control SST variability is lacking, especially during the monsoons when in situ observations are sparse. Here we use a ground-breaking observational approach to determine the controls on the SST variability in the southern Bay of Bengal. We achieve this through the first full closure of the ocean mixed layer energy budget derived entirely from in situ observations during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE). Locally measured horizontal advection and entrainment contribute more significantly than expected to SST evolution and thus oceanic variability during the observation period. These processes are poorly resolved by state-of-the-art climate models, which may contribute to poor representation of monsoon rainfall variability. The novel techniques presented here provide a blueprint for future observational experiments to quantify the mixed layer heat budget on longer time scales and to evaluate these processes in models.","[Vijith, V.; Vinayachandran, P.

Although the proof of concept is demonstrated elsewhere, here we report an analytical framework that elucidates the key parameters involved in BECR and how it may be elevated on the technology readiness scale. We first analyze the ideal BECR cycle to demonstrate the technology's performance (cooling load and coefficient of performance) in the reversible limit, identify two main practical considerations, and then analyze the non-ideal BECR cycle to simulate realistic performance.

Others are more hidden and take the form of changes to the composition and quality of the teaching staff. This study focuses on the latter. We ask how schools respond to spells of high teacher turnover and assess organizational and human capital effects. Our analysis uses two decades of administrative data on math and English language arts middle school teachers in North Carolina to determine school responses to turnover across different policy environments and macroeconomic climates. Based on models controlling for school contexts and trends, we find that turnover has marked, and lasting, negative consequences for the quality of the instructional staff and student achievement.

Primary causes are the high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation, transportation, manufacturing and the intensive land usage (deforestation). The current share of renewable biofuel production in the overall fuel demand has been found insufficient to replace fossil fuels. Microalgae can deliver a sustainable and complementary biofuel platform with some important advantages. This review aims to offer a state-of-the art review of algal biomass conversion methods into various biofuel products, including biodiesel, syngas, biogas, bioethanol. Emerging more sustainable biofuel/bioenergy production technologies are highlighted. Attention is also paid to sustainable cultivation methods, including wastewater treatment and bioremediation to capture CO2 and fix nitrogen and phosphorus, produced from industrial, agricultural and municipal sources.

This paper considers how physical modelling may be used to study the mechanisms associated with natural hazards that have direct geotechnical implications. Physical modelling may be conducted to understand trigger mechanisms as well as the mechanisms they initiate, and this knowledge may be used to inform the processes of geotechnical risk assessment. Close control over material properties and well defined boundary conditions in physical models enable repeatability that permits parametric studies to be conducted. Physical model testing can also be used to validate analytical and numerical methods and assess techniques for hazard reduction or rehabilitation. Examples of physical modelling studies to obtain a greater understanding of the mechanisms associated with sliding slopes, earthquake surface fault rupture and slope instabilities due to climate change driven permafrost degradation are presented and the current state-of-the-art assessed.","[Davies, M.

Climate conditions and the atmospheric CO2 concentration, hereafter [CO2], influence the establishment and performance of plants; thus, these factors have a direct influence on vegetation cover. In addition, vegetation dynamics (competition for space, light, nutrients, and water) and stochastic events (mortality and fires) determine the state of vegetation, response times to environmental perturbations and successional development. In spite of this, state-of-the-art reconstructions of past transient vegetation changes have not been accounted for in landscape evolution models. Here, a widely used dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) was used to simulate vegetation composition/cover and surface runoff in Chile for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the mid-Holocene (MH) and the present day (PD). In addition, transient vegetation simulations were carried out from the LGM to PD for four sites in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile at a spatial and temporal resolution adequate for coupling with landscape evolution models. A new landform mode was introduced to LPJ-GUESS to enable a better simulation of vegetation dynamics and state at a sub-pixel resolution and to allow for future coupling with landscape evolution models operating at different spatial scales. Using a regionally adapted parameterization, LPJ-GUESS was capable of reproducing PD potential natural vegetation along the strong climatic gradients of Chile, and simulated vegetation cover was also in line with satellite-based observations. Simulated vegetation during the LGM differed markedly from PD conditions. Coastal cold temperate rainforests were displaced northward by about 5 degrees and the tree line and vegetation zones were at lower elevations than PD. Transient vegetation simulations indicate a marked shift in vegetation composition starting with the past glacial warming that coincides with a rise in [CO2]. Vegetation cover between the sites ranged from 13 % (LGM: 8 %) to 81 % (LGM: 73 %) for the northern Pan de Azficar and southern Nahuelbuta sites, respectively, but did not vary by more than 10 % over the 21 000 year simulation. A sensitivity study suggests that [CO2] is an important driver of vegetation changes and, thereby, potentially landscape evolution. Comparisons with other paleoclimate model drivers highlight the importance of model input on simulated vegetation. In the near future, we will directly couple LPJ-GUESS to a landscape evolution model (see companion paper) to build a fully coupled dynamic-vegetation/landscape evolution model that is forced with paleoclimate data from atmospheric general circulation models.","[Werner, Christian; Steinkamp, Joerg; Forrest, Matthew; Hickler, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmid, Manuel; Ehlers, Todd A.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Wilhelmstr 56, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Fuentes-Espoz, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, Dept Silviculture & Nat Conservat, Av Santa Rosa 11315, La Pintana, Santiago Rm, Chile; [Liakka, Johan] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Thormohlens Gate 47, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Maldonado, Antonio] CEAZA, Raul Bitran 1305, La Serena, Chile; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Geosci, Altenhoeferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Universidad de Chile; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Werner, C (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",christian.werner@senckenberg.de,"Ehlers, Todd A/A-9582-2012; Maldonado, Antonio/D-7568-2013; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Steinkamp, Joerg/G-5622-2010; Fuentes, Juan-Pablo/C-7819-2014","Ehlers, Todd A/0000-0001-9436-0303; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Steinkamp, Joerg/0000-0002-7861-8789; Fuentes, Juan-Pablo/0000-0002-7679-5482; Maldonado, Antonio/0000-0002-1748-6639; Forrest, Matthew/0000-0003-1858-3489; Werner, Christian/0000-0001-7032-8683","German science foundation priority research program Earth-Shape: Earth surface shaping by biota [EH329-14-1, HI1538/5-1]",German science foundation priority research program Earth-Shape: Earth surface shaping by biota,This study was funded as part of the German science foundation priority research program Earth-Shape: Earth surface shaping by biota (grant no.

The task is a significant challenge because the CNN has to recognize the object and then classify it in real-time. Moreover, some extra difficulties are presented in the task, such as similarity in terms of color, the intersection of components, the component size, and climate conditions. The failure scenarios have been simulated in a laboratory containing all the structures found in real-world power lines along railways. The laboratory allowed us to build the image dataset containing 708 images with annotations that have been used for training the neural network. Three versions of the Yolo V3 were compared against the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network called Tiny Yolo. Results have shown that Yolo V3 version 2 adequately detects the objects and faults, reaching a precision of 98%, a recall of 95%, and a MAP of 96:58%.","[Augusto Costa, J.

Music (and the arts more generally) has the potential to play a role in influencing behaviour and effecting structural change by showcasing the issues at play and raising awareness around the magnitude of the crisis. However, digital music making contains an embedded political ecology and problematic history which must be assessed and acknowledged in order to effectively leverage this power. Therefore this paper will situate digital music within a cultural history of industrialisation, with all of the ecology contained therein. Building upon this, a set of approaches will be laid out that draw from established ICT4S concepts of limits theory and heuristic design, combined with artistic practice, proposing potential ways forward that will encourage digital music making to move towards a sustainable future and position musical tools to challenge societal norms.","[Seznec, Yann] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Media Technol & Interact Design, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Seznec, Y (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Media Technol & Interact Design, Stockholm, Sweden.",yannse@kth.se,,,Sound for Energy Project - Swedish Energy Agency [51645-1],Sound for Energy Project - Swedish Energy Agency,This work is supported by the Sound for Energy Project (see: https://soundforenergy.net) which is funded by Swedish Energy Agency (Project No. 51645-1),,45,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-8286-8,,,,2022,,,,,172,178,,10.1109/ICT4S55073.2022.00028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICT4S55073.2022.00028,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BT9EB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000859727000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, when applied to sequences of limited length, these methods often tend to overestimate the actual multifractal properties. To address this aspect, we introduce here a generalization of Higuchi's estimator of the fractal dimension as a new way to characterize the multifractal spectrum of univariate time series or sequences of relatively short length. This multifractal Higuchi dimension analysis (MF-HDA) method considers the order-q moments of the partition function provided by the length of the time series graph at different levels of subsampling. The results obtained for different types of stochastic processes, a classical multifractal model, and various real-world examples of word length series from fictional texts demonstrate that MF-HDA provides a reliable estimate of the multifractal spectrum already for moderate time series lengths. Practical advantages as well as disadvantages of the new approach as compared to other state-of-the-art methods of multifractal analysis are discussed, highlighting the particular potentials of MF-HDA to distinguish mono- from multifractal dynamics based on relatively short sequences.","[Carrizales-Velazquez, Carlos; Guzman-Vargas, Lev] Inst Politecn Nacl, Inst Politecn Technol, Unidad Profes Interdisciplinaria Ingn & Tecnol Av, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Donner, Reik V.] Magdeburg Stendal Univ Appl Sci, Dept Water Environm Construct & Safety, Magdeburg, Germany; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Dept Earth Syst Anal 1, Potsdam, Germany; [Donner, Reik V.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Dept Earth Syst Anal & Res 1, Dept Complex Sci 4, Potsdam, Germany; [Donner, Reik V.] Leibniz Assoc Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Guzman-Vargas, L (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Inst Politecn Technol, Unidad Profes Interdisciplinaria Ingn & Tecnol Av, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",lguzmanv@ipn.mx,"Donner, Reik/F-4400-2017","Donner, Reik/0000-0001-7023-6375","Instituto Politecnico Nacional and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Mexico; Federal Ministry for Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) via the JPI Climate/JPI Oceans project ROADMAP [01LP2002B]","Instituto Politecnico Nacional and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Federal Ministry for Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) via the JPI Climate/JPI Oceans project ROADMAP(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work was partially supported by programs EDI and COFAA from Instituto Politecnico Nacional and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Mexico.

SMLC is used to simulate land cover scenarios of China for the years 2039, 2069 and 2099, for which HLZ scenarios are first simulated in terms of HadCM3 climatic scenarios that are downscaled in zonal model of spatial climate change in China. This paper also analyzes spatial distribution of land cover types, area change and mean center shift of each land cover type, ecotope diversity, and patch connectivity under the land cover scenarios. The results show that cultivated land would decrease and woodland would expand greatly with climatic change, which coincides with consequences expected by implementation of Grain-for-Green policy. Nival area would shrink, and desertification area would expand at a comparatively slow rate in future 100 years. Climate change would generally cause less ecotope diversity and more patch connectivity. Ecosystems in China would have a pattern of beneficial cycle after efficient ecological conservation and restoration. However, if human activities would exceed regulation capacity of ecosystems themselves, the ecosystems in China might deteriorate more seriously. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

On synoptic time-scales, the negative phase of the NAO often corresponds to the occurrence of a blocking episode over Greenland. Hence, the dynamics and predictability of these blocking events is of interest for the prediction of the NAO and its related impacts over a wide region. Ensemble sensitivity analysis utilises the information contained in probabilistic forecast ensembles to calculate a statistical relationship between a forecast metric and some precursor condition. Here the method is applied to 15-day forecasts of a set of 26 Greenland blocking events using the state-of-the-art European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecasting system. The ensemble sensitivity analysis shows that Greenland blocking does not develop in isolation in these forecasts, but instead the blocking is sensitive to remote precursors, such as 500 and 50 hPa geopotential height, particularly in the low-frequency flow. In general, there are more significant sensitivities to anomalies in the Tropics than in the polar regions. Stratospheric sensitivities tend to emerge at later lead times than tropospheric sensitivities. The strongest and most robust sensitivities correspond to a Rossby wave precursor reaching from the Pacific basin across North America.","[Parker, Tess; Woollings, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford, England; [Weisheimer, Antje] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Weisheimer, Antje] Univ Oxford, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Phys, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Oxford,"Parker, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",tess.parker@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Parker, Teresa J/O-9868-2018","Parker, Teresa J/0000-0003-4201-3929; Weisheimer, Antje/0000-0002-7231-6974","NERC [ncas10003, NE/L01047X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,87,3,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

We utilize new spatially explicit state-of-the-art models that incorporate principles from heat and mass transfer engineering, physiology, morphology, and behavior that have been modified to provide spatially explicit hypotheses using GIS. We demonstrate how temporal and spatial changes in microclimate resulting from differences in topography and vegetation cover alter animal energetics, and behavior. We explore the impacts of these energetic predictions on elk energetics in burned and unburned stands of conifer in winter in Yellowstone National Park, chuckwalla lizard distribution limits in North America, California Beechey Ground squirrel and Dusky Footed woodrat mass and energy requirements and activity patterns on the landscape, their predator prey interactions with a rattlesnake, Crotalus viridis, and shifts in that food web structure due to topographic and vegetative variation. We illustrate how different scales of data/observation provide different pieces of information that may collectively define the real distributions of a species. We then use sensitivity analyses of energetic models to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of changes in core temperature (fever) global climate (increased air temperature under a global warming scenario) and vegetation cover (deforestation) on winter survival of elk, the geographic distribution of chuckwallas and the activity overlap of predator and prey species within a subset of commonly observed species in a terrestrial food web. Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground, hence ground surface temperature, at the same elevation, same hourly 2 m air temperatures, and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic, since multiple distributions of their responses to climate, topography, and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics, especially at high (30 m) resolution. This preliminary analysis suggests that the model has far-reaching implications for hypothesis testing in ecology at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Porter, WP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 250 N Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Tracy, Christopher R/E-5619-2011; Ramankutty, Navin/AAM-6074-2020","Ramankutty, Navin/0000-0002-3737-5717",,,,,40,135,138,3,97,SOC INTEGRATIVE COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,MCLEAN,"1313 DOLLEY MADISON BLVD, NO 402, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",1540-7063,,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Direct measurement of the global ocean surface current is of great scientific interest and application value for understanding multiscale ocean dynamics, air-sea interaction, ocean mass and energy balance, and ocean carbon budget, as well as their variabilities under climate change. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art developments of ocean dynamics and technology on the observation of multiscale ocean circulation and related scientific frontiers. Presently, measurements of global ocean surface currents, which are mainly geostrophically derived from satellite altimeter data, are only available to resolve quasi-geostrophic current at large- to mesoscale in the off-equatorial open ocean. This becomes a bottleneck impeding the application and the development of ocean circulation dynamics. With the ambition of breaking the bottleneck, Ocean Surface Current multiscale Observation Mission (OSCOM) will launch a satellite equipped with a Doppler Scatterometer to directly measure ocean surface currents for the first time with a very high horizontal resolution of 5?10 km and a 3-day global coverage. Through carrying a Surface Temperature Infrared Radiometer and a Surface Temperature Microwave Radiometer, the OSCOM satellite is supposed to have the capability of observing ocean surface current, ocean surface vector wind, and sea surface temperature simultaneously. With a cutting-edge design, OSCOM will provide an in-depth picture of non-equilibrium ocean state and air-sea interaction from mesoscale to submesoscale, and helps to construct the fine structure of deep ocean current through a combination with Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography profiling. Those direct measurements and derived dynamic parameters will further facilitate analyses of ocean carbon budget and ocean biogeochemical cycle, and provide a novel and improved pathway to data assimilation, coupling of General Circulation Models, and the Earth System Modelling for ocean prediction and climate change.","[Du, Yan; Jiang, Xingwei; Zhang, Yuhong; Sun, Qiwei; Jing, Zhiyou; Tang, Shilin; Li, Yineng; Chen, Ju; Chu, Xiaoqing; Xu, Chi; Wang, Tianyu; He, Yinghui; Han, Bing; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Minyang; Wu, Wei; Xia, Yifan; Qian, Yu-Kun; Shi, Ping; Zhan, Haigang; Peng, Shiqiu] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Du, Yan; Jiang, Xingwei; Zhang, Yuhong; Sun, Qiwei; Jing, Zhiyou; Tang, Shilin; Li, Yineng; Chen, Ju; Chu, Xiaoqing; Xu, Chi; Wang, Tianyu; He, Yinghui; Han, Bing; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Minyang; Wu, Wei; Xia, Yifan; Qian, Yu-Kun; Shi, Ping; Zhan, Haigang; Peng, Shiqiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Sci & Technol Operat Oceanog, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Du, Yan; Jiang, Xingwei; Zhang, Yuhong; Sun, Qiwei; Jing, Zhiyou; Tang, Shilin; Li, Yineng; Chen, Ju; Chu, Xiaoqing; Xu, Chi; Wang, Tianyu; He, Yinghui; Han, Bing; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Minyang; Wu, Wei; Xia, Yifan; Qian, Yu-Kun; Shi, Ping; Zhan, Haigang; Peng, Shiqiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad South China Sea Ecol & Environm Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Du, Yan; Dong, Xiaolong; Zhu, Di; Sun, Qiwei; Wang, Zhenzhan; Wang, Minyang; Wu, Wei; Xia, Yifan; Peng, Shiqiu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Du, Yan; Zhang, Yuhong; Sun, Qiwei; Jing, Zhiyou; Tang, Shilin; Li, Yineng; Chen, Ju; Chu, Xiaoqing; Xu, Chi; Wang, Tianyu; He, Yinghui; Han, Bing; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Minyang; Wu, Wei; Xia, Yifan; Qian, Yu-Kun; Shi, Ping; Zhan, Haigang; Peng, Shiqiu] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiaolong; Zhu, Di; Wang, Zhenzhan] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Space Sci Ctr, Key Lab Microwave Remote Sensing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xingwei] Natl Satellite Ocean Applicat Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Niu, Xinhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Tech Phys, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wen; Zhu, Cheng; Chen, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Microsatellites, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Space Science Center, CAS; National Satellite Ocean Application Service; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Innovation Academy for Microsatellites, CAS","Du, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Du, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Sci & Technol Operat Oceanog, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Du, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad South China Sea Ecol & Environm Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Dong, XL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",duyan@scsio.ac.cn; dongxiaolong@mirslab.cn,"DU, Yan/C-4496-2013; Wang, Minyang/GSE-6230-2022; Chu, Xiaoqing/F-5179-2010","DU, Yan/0000-0002-7842-0801; Sun, Qiwei/0000-0002-7128-224X; Chu, Xiaoqing/0000-0001-6036-6301","Strategic Priority Program on Space Science, the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA15020901]; Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) [GML2019ZD0302, GML2019ZD0303, 2019BT02H594]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830538, 42090042]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong [2017A030313233]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0301103, 2018YFA0605704]","Strategic Priority Program on Space Science, the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); National Key Research and Development Program of China","We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and helpful discussions with R.X.

Accelerator mass spectrometry has made radiocarbon dating the most precise method to determine the death of living organisms that occurred within the last 50,000 years. However, the method is not without limitations and this review article provides Africanist archaeologists with cautionary insights as to when, where, and how to utilize radiocarbon dates. Specifically, the review will concentrate on the potential of carbon reservoirs and recycled organic remains to inflate apparent age estimates, diagenesis of carbon isotopes in variable pH ecologies, and hot-humid climates and non-climate-controlled archives that can compromise the efficacy of samples. Legacy radiocarbon ages must be critically examined for what method was used to generate the age, and calibration radiocarbon ages from critical periods of African prehistory lack precision to resolve significant debates. A multipronged dating strategy and careful selection of radiocarbon sample materials are advocated from the earliest stages of research design.","[Wright, David K.] Coll Humanities, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",,"Wright, DK (corresponding author), Coll Humanities, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",msafiri@snu.ac.kr,"Wright, David K./H-3311-2019","Wright, David K./0000-0003-1704-0423","National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013S1A5B6043901, NRF-2013S1A5A8021512]",National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This study was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2013S1A5B6043901 and NRF-2013S1A5A8021512).,,128,25,25,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0263-0338,1572-9842,,AFR ARCHAEOL REV,Afr.

Even more controversy surrounds the hypothesis of periodicity in the fossil record, with conflicting views still being published in the scientific literature, often even based on the same state-of-the- art datasets. From an empirical point of view, limitations of the currently available data on extinctions and possible causes remain an important issue. From a theoretical point of view, it is likely that a focus on single extinction causes and strong periodic forcings has strongly contributed to this controversy. Here I show that if there is a periodic extinction signal at all, it is much more likely to result from a combination of a comparatively weak periodic cause and various random factors. Tests of this unified model of mass extinctions on the available data show that the model is formally better than a model with random extinction causes only. However, the contribution of the periodic component is small compared to factors such as impacts or volcanic eruptions.","Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Feulner, G (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",feulner@pik-potsdam.de,"Feulner, Georg/A-1933-2011","Feulner, Georg/0000-0001-9215-5517",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FE 1060/1-1]; European Space Agency (ESA); European Astrobiology Network Association (EANA),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space Agency); European Astrobiology Network Association (EANA),"It is a pleasure to thank Coryn Bailer-Jones, Adrian Melott, Stefan Rahmstorf and Brian Thomas for comments on earlier drafts of this paper, two anonymous reviewers and Adrian Melott for constructive reviews that helped improve the text, as well as John Alroy for providing the PaleoDB data.

The aim of work is to analyze the state-of-the-art of microalgae photobioreactors integrated into combustion processes through a technological mapping based on a patent survey. The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) criteria were considered. More than 700 patent families were mapped. The results indicated an increase in the applications since 2007-2013 and reduction in the contributions of new documents in recent years. The leading countries in patents are represented by USA and China, responsible for 20 and 12%, respectively.

Additionally, the role of intrinsic catalyst composition and structure in determining the selectivity of CO2 conversion under NTP conditions is also discussed in light of the need for rational design of catalysts for NTP catalysis. Finally, a perspective on future challenges and opportunities in the development of next-generation catalysts for NTP catalysis and the advanced hybrid NTP catalysis process for practical industrial applications are discussed.","[Xu, Shanshan; Hardacre, Christopher; Fan, Xiaolei] Univ Manchester, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Chen, Huanhao] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China",University of Manchester; Nanjing Tech University,"Hardacre, C; Fan, XL (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.;Chen, HH (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.",h.chen@njtech.edu.cn; c.hardacre@manchester.ac.uk; xiaolei.fan@manchester.ac.uk,,"FAN, Xiaolei/0000-0002-9039-6736","University of Manchester; Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professors Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [22008109]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20200704]; EPSRC [EP/R026939/1, EP/R026815/1, EP/R026645/1, EP/R027129/1, EP/M013219/1]",University of Manchester; Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professors Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"S X acknowledges financial support of the Dean's Doctoral Scholar Awards from the University of Manchester.

Due to these threats, concern about the aesthetic dimension of architecture is pushed to the background. Few manifestos, or rather programs, frequently concern themselves with social, ecological or economic aspects, apart from the aesthetic ones. And yet this intangible, immeasurable dimension is an inherent part within the essence of architecture as art. The following paper is an attempt to analyze the minimalist trend in the context of contemporary threats: the de-aestheticization of architecture and limiting its autonomy. The aim of the article is to show that architects working in the minimalist trend, by returning to the basics of design, searching for the essence of architecture, strive to maintain the independence of this creative field, and by searching for the value of beauty, they strive to restore architecture to its aesthetic dimension.","[Mielnik, Anna; Kozlowski, Tomasz] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Chair Architectural Design, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Mielnik, A (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Chair Architectural Design, Krakow, Poland.",anna.mielnik@pk.edu.pl; tomasz.kozlowski@pk.edu.pl,,,,,,,25,0,0,2,3,"POLSKA AKAD NAUK, POLISH ACAD SCIENCES",WARSZAWA,"PL DEFILAD 1, WARSZAWA, 00-901, POLAND",0079-3450,2450-0038,,TEKA KOM URBAN ARCH,Teka Komisji Urban.

Recent scholars have acknowledged that natural beauty is important in Adornian aesthetics, but many do so in a manner that repeats the subordination of natural beauty and the aesthetic experience of nature to that of art. Against this tendency, in this article I demonstrate that not only does Adorno contest the inferiority of the aesthetic experience of nature but his unconventional description and theoretical articulation of natural beauty is especially pertinent for our time of climate crisis. By unpacking his endorsement of Walter Benjamin's casting both nature and history in terms of transience, I argue that Adorno proposes an experience of natural beauty that is expressive of social historical content, offers a vision of a different relationship with nature, and discloses ethical claims on us to act in this world.","[Danies, Jordan] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Danies, J (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",0891-625X,1527-9383,,J SPECUL PHILOS,J.

The prominence of sandstone in this region is primarily owing to palaeo-basin infilling during the late Carboniferous and a climate dominated by seasonal precipitation patterns, both now and in the past. Consequently, a range of weathering and erosion processes have operated at wide-ranging spatial scales upon the sandstone outcrops. The chapter describes prominent sandstone landscapes (plateaus, mesa-butte topography, scarplands, slopes) and landforms (e.g. ichnofossil structures, honeycombs, rock arches, rock doughnuts) of central South Africa and reflects on their associated cultural heritage and geoheritage linkages. For instance, almost all known San rock art sites are associated with sandstone, yet rapid weathering of such rock is jeopardizing the longevity of this cultural legacy.","[Grab, Stefan] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Phys Geog, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Grab, S (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Phys Geog, Johannesburg, South Africa.",stefan.grab@wits.ac.za,,,,,,,33,3,4,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2213-2090,2213-2104,978-3-319-03560-4; 978-3-319-03559-8,WOR GEOMORPHOL LANDS,,,2015,,,,,11,21,,10.1007/978-3-319-03560-4_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03560-4_2,10.1007/978-3-319-03560-4,,11,"Geography, Physical; Geology",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology,BE5AK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000372461700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper gives details of a cost-benefit analysis completed for a small liberal arts college in Illinois, Principia College, which is considering buying a single large-scale turbine. The process set forth here can easily be adapted to any college, university, or school. It is found that the project has a positive net present value for both a 20-year scenario and a 30-year scenario.

Many were illustrated in ancient art. Centuries of breeding and selection, transport in commerce and exploration, and developments in cultivation have disguised the exact origins of many species. The largely tropical order, Zingiberales, has contributed many exotics, but in most families breeding efforts have lagged, and requirements for warm growing temperatures have limited cultivation. In addition, the large size of many species in the Costaceae, Heliconiaceae, and Zingiberaceae families has meant greenhouse cultivation is impractical in the temperate climates. Thus, research that could promote the development of many species has been slower than for more manageable temperate flowers. This review focuses on research with a variety of species that the author and others have conducted and highlights some future directions and challenges.

We bring these two ideas together in our GRU-ODE-Bayes method. We then demonstrate that the proposed method encodes a continuity prior for the latent process and that it can exactly represent the Fokker-Planck dynamics of complex processes driven by a multidimensional stochastic differential equation. Additionally, empirical evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state of the art on both synthetic data and real-world data with applications in healthcare and climate forecast.

Consequently, urban centers are looking to alternative sources of water supply that can supplement variable rainfall and meet the demands of population growth. A diversified portfolio of water sources is required to ensure public health, as well as social, economical and environmental sustainability. One of the options considered is the augmentation of drinking water supplies with advanced treated recycled water. This paper aims to provide a state of the art review of water recycling for drinking purposes with emphasis on membrane treatment processes. An overview of significant indirect potable reuse projects is presented followed by a description of the epidemiological and toxicological studies evaluating any potential human health impacts.

Here we present and evaluate the sea-ice component of a new NEMO-LIM3.6-based ocean-sea-ice setup for the North Sea and Baltic Sea region (NEMO-Nordic). The setup includes a new depth-based fast-ice parametrization for the Baltic Sea. The evaluation focuses on long-term statistics, from a 45-year long hindcast, although short-term daily performance is also briefly evaluated. We show that NEMO-Nordic is well suited for simulating the mean sea-ice extent, concentration, and thickness as compared to the best available observational data set. The variability of the annual maximum Baltic Sea ice extent is well in line with the observations, but the 19612006 trend is underestimated. Capturing the correct ice thickness distribution is more challenging. Based on the simulated ice thickness distribution we estimate the undeformed and deformed ice thickness and concentration in the Baltic Sea, which compares reasonably well with observations.","[Pemberton, Per] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-42671 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Hordoir, Robinson; Hoglund, Anders; Schimanke, Semjon; Axell, Lars] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Loeptien, Ulrike] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Haapala, Jari] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Pemberton, P (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-42671 Gothenburg, Sweden.",per.pemberton@smhi.se,"Hordoir, Robinson/AAZ-6174-2020; Loeptien, Ulrike/AAW-6325-2021","Loeptien, Ulrike/0000-0002-8765-4183; Schimanke, Semjon/0000-0002-7208-2207","BONUS; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185); European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration; SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland [292 985]; Swedish research council for environment, agriculture sciences, and spatial planning (FORMAS)","BONUS; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185); European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration; SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland; Swedish research council for environment, agriculture sciences, and spatial planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This research is part of the BONUS STORMWINDS project with financial support from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration and from the Swedish research council for environment, agriculture sciences, and spatial planning (FORMAS).

Chronological details of the rise and fall of this important polity are obscure because of the limited corpus of dated hieroglyphic records and by a restricted set of radiocarbon dates for the site. Here we compile and review these data and evaluate them within the context of political and climatic change in northern Yucatan at the end of the Classic period. The available data point to the end of elite activity at Chichen Itza around AD 1000, a century after the collapse of Puuc Maya cities and other interior centers. Evidence supports a population shift in the eleventh century towards some coastal locations during a time associated with the end of monumental construction and art at Chichen Itza. Our results suggest that regional political disintegration came in two waves. The first was the asynchronous collapse of multiple polities between AD 850 and 925 associated with a regional drying trend and punctuated by a series of multi-decadal droughts in the ninth and tenth centuries. The second wave was the political collapse at Chichen Itza that coincides with the longest and most severe drought recorded in regional climate records between AD 1000 and 1100. This is a time that some scholars have characterized as a dark age across the northern Maya lowlands. Political developments during the Postclassic period (AD 1000-1517) correspond with a return to higher rainfall. These patterns support a strong relationship between political disintegration and climatic stress in the Maya lowlands. This research employs Bayesian radiocarbon models in conjunction with calendar dates on carved monuments and climate proxies to evaluate the rise and fall of Maya political centers and serves as an example of the impact of climate change on rainfall-dependent societies in Mesoamerica.

In this article, different approaches to retrieve the optical-equivalent snow grain size (ropt) or, alternatively, the specific surface area (SSA) using satellite, airborne, and ground-based observations are compared and used to evaluate ICON-ART (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) simulations. The retrieval methods are based on optical measurements and rely on the ropt-dependent absorption of solar radiation in snow. The measurement data were taken during a three-week campaign that was conducted in the North of Greenland in March/April 2018, such that the retrieval methods and radiation measurements are affected by enhanced uncertainties under these low-Sun conditions. An adjusted airborne retrieval method is applied which uses the albedo at 1700 nm wavelength and combines an atmospheric and snow radiative transfer model to account for the direct-to-global fraction of the solar radiation incident on the snow. From this approach, we achieved a significantly improved uncertainty (< 25%) and a reduced effect of atmospheric masking compared to the previous method. Ground-based in situ measurements indicated an increase of r(opt) of 15 mu m within a five-day period after a snowfall event which is small compared to previous observations under similar temperature regimes. ICON-ART captured the observed change of r(opt) during snowfall events, but systematically overestimated the subsequent snow grain growth by about 100%. Adjusting the growth rate factor to 0.012 mu m(2) s(-1) minimized the difference between model and observations. Satellite-based and airborne retrieval methods showed higher r(opt) over sea ice (< 300 mu m) than over land surfaces (< 100 mu m) which was reduced by data filtering of surface roughness features. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals revealed a large spread within a series of subsequent individual overpasses, indicating their limitations in observing the snow grain size evolution in early spring conditions with low Sun.","[Jaekel, Evelyn; Carlsen, Tim; Ehrlich, Andre; Wendisch, Manfred; Schaefer, Michael; Rosenburg, Sophie] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Inst Meteorol LIM, Stephanstr 3, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Carlsen, Tim] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0371 Oslo, Norway; [Nakoudi, Konstantina] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res AWI, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Zanatta, Marco; Rohde, Anika] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76344 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Birnbaum, Gerit; Helm, Veit; Herber, Andreas; Istomina, Larysa] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res AWI, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Istomina, Larysa; Mei, Linlu] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Leipzig University; University of Oslo; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Bremen","Jaekel, E (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Inst Meteorol LIM, Stephanstr 3, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",e.jaekel@uni-leipzig.de; tim.carlsen@geo.uio.no; a.ehrlich@uni-leipzig.de; m.wendisch@uni-leipzig.de; michael.schaefer@uni-leipzig.de; sr88ziri@studserv.uni-leipzig.de; konstantina.nakoudi@awi.de; marco.zanatta@kit.edu; Gerit.Birnbaum@awi.de; veit.helm@awi.de; Andreas.Herber@awi.de; larysa.istomina@awi.de; mei@iup.physik.uni-bremen.de; anika.rohde@kit.edu,"Ehrlich, André/H-9670-2013; Wendisch, Manfred/E-4175-2013; Carlsen, Tim/G-2195-2017","Ehrlich, André/0000-0003-0860-8216; Wendisch, Manfred/0000-0002-4652-5561; Rohde, Anika/0000-0002-6450-9960; Carlsen, Tim/0000-0003-0695-9047; Nakoudi, Konstantina/0000-0001-9639-3109; Helm, Veit/0000-0001-7788-9328","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 [268020496-TRR 172]; European Research Council (ERC) [758005]; DFG [424326801-SPP1158]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)-project ID 268020496-TRR 172, within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3.

Benefited from the substantial cost reduction of clean electricity, the room-temperature electrolysis has been emerging as a competitive strategy for Cl molecule unitization. In this review, we mainly focus on the state-of-the-art technologies involving electrocatalysts and devices, and introduce the representative works about room-temperature C1 molecule electrolysis in recent years, which will serve as a timely reference for catalyst design and device fabrication for efficient and practical conversion of C1 molecules. The challenges and perspectives are also discussed to suggest possible research directions toward fuel production from C1 molecules by room-temperature electrolysis in the future.","[Wang, Xin; Fu, Yongzhu] Zhengzhou Univ, Coll Chem, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Lv, Ximeng; Zheng, Gengfeng] Fudan Univ, Dept Chem, Lab Adv Mat, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Catalysis & Innovat Mat, R China, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University; Fudan University,"Fu, YZ (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Coll Chem, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.;Zheng, GF (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Chem, Lab Adv Mat, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Catalysis & Innovat Mat, R China, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.",gfzheng@fudan.edu.cn; yfu@zzu.edu.cn,"Fu, Yongzhu/J-8214-2019","Fu, Yongzhu/0000-0003-3746-9884; Lv, Ximeng/0000-0002-0482-2349","Certificate of Postdoctoral Research Grant in Henan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Henan province [212300410281]; Natural Science Foundation of China [21975225, 22025502, 21975051]",Certificate of Postdoctoral Research Grant in Henan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Henan province; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the Certificate of Postdoctoral Research Grant in Henan Province, Natural Science Foundation of Henan province (Grant No. 212300410281) and Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21975225, 22025502, and 21975051) .",,195,0,0,10,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2589-7780,,,ENERGYCHEM,EnergyChem,SEP,2022,5,,,,,,100086,10.1016/j.enchem.2022.100086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enchem.2022.100086,,,23,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Materials Science,3Z8SG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000844684200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using NASA's retrospective S2S ensemble forecast in conjunction with a terrestrial biosphere model, and using an independent, remote sensing-based data set for validation, we demonstrate an ability to accurately forecast spring-summer carbon uptake at multi-month leads. Averaged across mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere land, the GPP forecast initialized on January 1 produces statistically significant skill through summer. The skill achieved, however, is spatially variable, with some regions appearing to extract skill from accurate forecasts of snowpack removal and others extracting skill from the initialization of carbon and nitrogen states. Our results reveal some heretofore unexplored facets of climate predictability and provide a look at what might be possible with future S2S forecast systems that are fully integrated with biogeochemical cycles.","[Lee, Eunjee] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res 2, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Lee, Eunjee; Koster, Randal D.; Ott, Lesley E.; Zeng, Fan-Wei; Kolassa, Jana; Reichle, Rolf H.] NASA, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Joiner, Joanna] NASA, Atmospher Chem & Dynam Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Zeng, Fan-Wei; Kolassa, Jana] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD USA; [Arsenault, Kristi R.] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Reston, VA USA; [Arsenault, Kristi R.; Hazra, Abheera] NASA, Hydrol Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Hazra, Abheera] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Shukla, Shraddhanand] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Systems and Applications Inc; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lee, E (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res 2, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA.;Lee, E (corresponding author), NASA, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",eunjee.lee@nasa.gov,"Reichle, Rolf H/E-1419-2012; Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012; Joiner, Joanna/D-6264-2012","Reichle, Rolf H/0000-0001-5513-0150; Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383; Joiner, Joanna/0000-0003-4278-1020; Kolassa, Jana/0000-0001-6644-8789; Arsenault, Kristi/0000-0002-6830-6271","NASA GMAO core grant; NASA Interdisciplinary Science program; NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program","NASA GMAO core grant; NASA Interdisciplinary Science program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","This work was supported by the NASA GMAO core grant, the NASA Interdisciplinary Science program, and the NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program.

Enhancing yield potential to meet the population explosion around the world and maintaining grain quality in wheat plants under climate change are crucial for food security and human nutrition. Global warming resulting from greenhouse effect has led to more frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO(2)) along with rising temperature has a huge impact on ecosystems, agriculture and human health. There are numerous studies investigating the eCO(2) and heatwaves effects on wheat growth and productivity, and the mechanisms behind. This review outlines the state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the effects of eCO(2) and heat stress, individually and combined, on grain yield and grain quality in wheat crop.

Utilizing a state-of-the-art time series deep learning neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), we created a system that predicts SMAP level-3 moisture product with atmospheric forcings, model-simulated moisture, and static physiographic attributes as inputs. The system removes most of the bias with model simulations and improves predicted moisture climatology, achieving small test root-mean-square errors (<0.035) and high-correlation coefficients >0.87 for over 75% of Continental United States, including the forested southeast. As the first application of LSTM in hydrology, we show the proposed network avoids overfitting and is robust for both temporal and spatial extrapolation tests. LSTM generalizes well across regions with distinct climates and environmental settings. With high fidelity to SMAP, LSTM shows great potential for hindcasting, data assimilation, and weather forecasting.","[Fang, Kuai; Shen, Chaopeng] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kifer, Daniel; Yang, Xiao] Penn State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Shen, CP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",cshen@engr.psu.edu,,"Shen, Chaopeng/0000-0002-0685-1901; Fang, Kuai/0000-0001-5246-5131; Kifer, Daniel/0000-0002-4611-7066",Penn State College of Engineering; Institute for CyberScience; Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0010620]; U.S. National Science Foundation [CCF 1317560],Penn State College of Engineering(General Electric); Institute for CyberScience; Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Daily seamless soil moisture is presented in the supporting information Data S1.

Here we employ two global databases linking plant functional types to decomposition rates of wood and leaf litter (Cornwell et al., 2008; Weedon et al., 2009) to improve future projections of climate and carbon cycle using an intermediate complexity Earth System model. Implementing separate wood and leaf litter decomposabilities and their temperature sensitivities for a range of plant functional types yielded a more realistic distribution of litter stocks in all present biomes with the exception of boreal forests and projects a strong increase in global litter stocks by 35 GtC and a concomitant small decrease in atmospheric CO2 by 3 ppm by the end of this century. Despite a relatively strong increase in litter stocks, the modified parameterization results in less elevated wildfire emissions because of a litter redistribution towards more humid regions.","[Brovkin, V.; Kleinen, T.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [van Bodegom, P.

Yet ecological degradation continues and little has been done to address climate change. We investigated early-career conservation researchers' (ECR) perspectives on, and prioritization of, actions furthering sustainability. We conducted a survey (n = 67) and an interactive workshop (n = 35) for ECR attendees of the 5th European Congress of Conservation Biology (2018). Building on these data and discussions, we identified ongoing and forthcoming advances in conservation science. These include increased transdisciplinarity, science communication, advocacy in conservation, and adoption of a transformation-oriented social-ecological systems approach to research. The respondents and participants had diverse perspectives on how to achieve sustainability. Reformist actions were emphasized as paving the way for more radical changes in the economic system and societal values linked to the environment and inequality. Our findings suggest that achieving sustainability requires a strategy that (1) incorporates the multiplicity of people's views, (2) places a greater value on nature, and (3) encourages systemic transformation across political, social, educational, and economic realms on multiple levels. We introduce a framework for ECRs to inspire their research and practice within conservation science to achieve real change in protecting biological diversity.","[Raatikainen, Kaisa J.] Univ Turku, Geog Sect, Dept Geog & Geol, Turku, Finland; [Raatikainen, Kaisa J.; Pohjanmies, Tahti; Peura, Maiju; Nieminen, Eini; Mustajarvi, Linda; Helle, Ilona; Ahti, Pauliina A.; Hocevar, Sara] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Raatikainen, Kaisa J.; Pohjanmies, Tahti; Peura, Maiju; Nieminen, Eini; Mustajarvi, Linda; Helle, Ilona; Ahti, Pauliina A.; Hocevar, Sara] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Resource Wisdom, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Purhonen, Jenna] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Mus Art & Cultural Studies, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Purhonen, Jenna] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Resource Wisdom, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Pohjanmies, Tahti] Natl Resources Inst Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Shennan-Farpon, Yara] Zool Soc London, ZSL Inst Zool, London, England; [Shennan-Farpon, Yara] UCL, UCL Dept Anthropol, London, England; [Ahti, Pauliina A.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Basile, Marco] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Basile, Marco] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland; [Basile, Marco] Univ Freiburg, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, Freiburg, Germany; [Bernardo, Nicola] Donana Biol Stn CSIC, Seville, Spain; [Bertram, Michael G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Bertram, Michael G.; Martin, Jake M.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Bouarakia, Oussama] Univ Venda, SARChI Chair Biodivers Value & Change, Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Bouarakia, Oussama] Mohammed V Univ Rabat, Fac Sci, Res Ctr BIOBIO, Lab Biodivers Ecol Genome, Rabat, Morocco; [Bouarakia, Oussama] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, MNHN, Inst Syst Evolut Biodiversite, Paris, France; [Brias-Guinart, Aina; Torrents-Tico, Miquel] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Brias-Guinart, Aina; Torrents-Tico, Miquel] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Global Change & Conservat Lab, Fac Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Fijen, Thijs] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Froidevaux, Jeremy S.

Such distributed systems involve open data sources belonging to different platforms. On the other side, there are various users and applications who want to access and work on all these systems in convenient ways using single sign-on. If not secured, it may cause a major threat to disclose sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. This paper presents a novel implementation approach of securing distributed components of the SDDI in the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London. It establishes proper authorization and authentication to allow privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components.

Here we exploit a bidecadally resolved C-14 data set obtained from New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) to undertake high-precision alignment of key climate data sets spanning iceberg-rafted debris event Heinrich 3 and Greenland Interstadial (GI) 5.1 in the North Atlantic (similar to 30,400 to 28,400 years ago). We observe no divergence between the kauri and Atlantic marine sediment C-14 data sets, implying limited changes in deep water formation. However, a Southern Ocean (Atlantic-sector) iceberg rafted debris event appears to have occurred synchronously with GI-5.1 warming and decreased precipitation over the western equatorial Pacific and Atlantic. An ensemble of transient meltwater simulations shows that Antarctic-sourced salinity anomalies can generate climate changes that are propagated globally via an atmospheric Rossby wave train.","[Turney, Chris S.

Presently, no guidance is available to alert decision makers to anomalous AR activity within the subseasonal time scale (similar to 2-5 weeks). Here, we construct and evaluate an empirical prediction scheme for anomalous AR activity based solely on the initial state of two prominent modes of tropical variability: the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The MJO-the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropical troposphere-modulates landfalling AR activity along the west coast of North America by exciting large-scale circulation anomalies over the North Pacific. In light of emerging science regarding the modulation of the MJO by the QBO-the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical stratosphere-we demonstrate that the MJO-AR relationship is further influenced by the QBO. Evaluating the prediction scheme over 36 boreal winter seasons, we find skillful subseasonal forecasts of opportunity when knowledge of the MJO and the QBO can be leveraged to predict periods of increased or decreased AR activity. Certain MJO and QBO phase combinations provide empirical subseasonal predictive skill for anomalous AR activity that exceeds that of a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model. Given the wide-ranging impacts associated with landfalling ARs, even modest gains in the subseasonal prediction of anomalous AR activity may support decision making and benefit numerous sectors of society.","[Mundhenk, Bryan D.; Barnes, Elizabeth A.; Maloney, Eric D.; Baggett, Cory F.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Mundhenk, BD (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",bryan.mundhenk@colostate.edu,"Barnes, Elizabeth A/O-1790-2014; Maloney, Eric D/A-9327-2008","Barnes, Elizabeth A/0000-0003-4284-9320; Maloney, Eric D/0000-0002-2660-2611","National Science Foundation Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program [AGS-1441916]; NOAA Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections Program S2S Prediction Task Force [NA16OAR4310064]; NOAA NWS Office of Science and Technology grant [NA16NWS4680022]","National Science Foundation Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NOAA Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections Program S2S Prediction Task Force; NOAA NWS Office of Science and Technology grant","Financial support for this study was provided, in part, by the National Science Foundation Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program under grant AGS-1441916, the NOAA Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections Program S2S Prediction Task Force under grant NA16OAR4310064, and the NOAA NWS Office of Science and Technology grant NA16NWS4680022.",,42,86,86,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2397-3722,,,NPJ CLIM ATMOS SCI,npj Clim.

The relevance of the paper is determined by the fact that the above mentioned issues are currently understudied. Consequently, the author has considered scholarly literature, in which the essence and specificity of innovative technologies are characterized, as well as the essence of preparing students for innovative technologies implementation. The preparation includes the following components: the complex of psycho-pedagogical orientations determining certain forms and methods of teaching; organizational and tutorial tools of the teaching process; the complex of systemic interrelated forms and methods of pedagogical impact applied according to a certain algorithm; monitoring and correction of the obtained results, which facilitate achieving the anticipated result of training future specialists. The process of implementing innovative technologies is associated with the responsiveness of acquiring knowledge, abilities and skills in vocal art; individual choosing and interpretation of works; forming the capacity for self-analysis and self-evaluation, self-improvement in performing and teaching activities. The pedagogical conditions that facilitate students' mastering innovative technologies and their ability to apply them effectively in singer's performing and teaching activities have been substantiated. The first pedagogical condition involves providing comfortable psychological climate and style of pedagogical communication in the teaching process, i.e. factors that influence students' self-confidence, their ability to experiment, and readiness for overcoming failures. The second pedagogical condition is considered to be the level of development of students' personal qualities (emotional and volitional, intellectual qualities; determination; performance capabilities; moral traits like responsibility for vocal development of their pupils), which determine the efficiency of their preparation for innovative creative activity. The third pedagogical condition involves organization of gradual preparation of students-singers for professional innovative creativity in performing, methodical and theoretical, pedagogical and practical forms of teaching activities. It has been concluded that after implementing the above mentioned pedagogical conditions it is possible to achieve higher level of students' competence in innovative technologies; there appear more opportunities for them to improve their learning, performing and future pedagogical activities.","[Jia, Liu] South Ukrainian Natl Pedag Univ, Dept Music Art & Choreog, 4 Fontanska Doroha Str, Odesa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University Named After K.

We briefly introduce the analog data assimilation (AnDA), an up-to-date version of the DINEOF algorithm, and a new NN-based end-to-end learning framework for the representation of spatio-temporal irregulary-sampled data. We evaluate how some of these methods are a significant improvements, particularly by catching up the small scales ranging up to 30-40km, inaccessible by the conventional methods so far.

Estimates of standard random error for each month at each grid location are also provided in this data release. One of the primary intended uses of this dataset is the validation of climatic-scale precipitation fields that are produced by numerical models. Nearly coincident with this dataset development, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric: Research have joined in a cooperative effort to reanalyze meteorological fields from the present back to the 1940s using a fixed state-of-the-art data assimilation system and large input database. In this paper, monthly accumulations of reanalysis precipitation are compared with the GPCP combined rain gauge-satellite dataset over the period 1988-95. A unique feature of this comparison is the use of standard error estimates that are contained in the GPCP combined dataset. These errors are incorporated into the comparison to provide more realistic assessments of the reanalysis model performance than could be attained by using only the mean fields. Variability on timescales from intraseasonal to interannual are examined between the GPCP and reanalysis precipitation. While the representation of large-scale features compares well between the two datasets, substantial differences are observed on regional scales. This result is not unexpected since present-day data assimilation systems are not designed to incorporate observations of precipitation. Furthermore, inferences of deficiencies in the reanalysis precipitation should nor be projected to other fields in which observations have been assimilated directly into the reanalysis model.","NOAA, NWS, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, Camp Springs, MD USA; NOAA, NESDIS, Res Off, Camp Springs, MD USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Atmospheres Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Greenbelt, MD USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Systems and Applications Inc,"Janowiak, JE (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, 4700 Silver Hill Rd,Room 605,Stop 9910, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",John.janowiak@noaa.gov,"Livezey, Robert/ABC-7350-2020; Huffman, George J/F-4494-2014","Huffman, George J/0000-0003-3858-8308",,,,,39,128,133,0,11,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Even though models have reached broad agreement on projected TC intensification(3-)(5), observed trends in TC intensity remain inconclusive and under active debate(6-)(10 )in all ocean basins except the North Atlantic, where aircraft reconnaissance data greatly reduce uncertainties'. The conventional satellite-based estimates are not accurate enough to ascertain the trend in TC intensity(11), suffering from contamination by heavy rain, clouds, breaking waves and spray(12). Here we show that weak TCs (that is, tropical storms to category-1TCs based on the Saffir-Simpson scale) have intensified in all ocean basins during the period 1991-2020, based on huge amounts of highly accurate ocean current data derived from surface drifters. These drifters have submerged 'holy sock' drogues at 15 m depth to reduce biases induced by processes at the air-sea interface and thereby accurately measure near-surface currents, even under the most destructive TCs. The ocean current speeds show a robust upward trend of similar to 4.0 cm s(-1) per decade globally, corresponding to a positive trend of 1.8 m s(-1) per decade in the TC intensity. Our analysis further indicates that globally TCs have strengthened across the entirety of the intensity distribution. These results serve as a historical baseline that is crucial for assessing model physics, simulations and projectionsgiven the failure of state-of-the-art climate models in fully replicating these trends(13).","[Wang, Guihua; Wu, Lingwei] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guihua; Wu, Lingwei] Fudan Univ, CMA FDU Joint Lab Marine, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Mei, Wei] Univ N Carolina, Dept Earth Marine & Environm Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA",Fudan University; Fudan University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Wang, GH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wang, GH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, CMA FDU Joint Lab Marine, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wanggh@fudan.edu.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFC1510100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41976003],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),G.W. and L.W. were supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2019YFC1510100) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41976003).,,50,1,1,4,4,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,17-Nov,2022,7936,,,,496,+,,10.1038/s41586-022-05326-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05326-4,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,6G6CX,36385539,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000884842400025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet information about Holocene glacier coverage in the Alps before the Little Ice Age stems mostly from studying advances of glacier tongues at lower elevations. Here we present a new approach to reconstructing past glacier low stands and ice-free conditions by assessing and dating the oldest ice preserved at high elevations. A previously unexplored ice dome at Wei ss seespitze summit (3500 m), near where the Tyrolean Iceman was found, offers almost ideal conditions for preserving the original ice formed at the site. The glaciological settings and state-of-the-art micro-radiocarbon age constraints indicate that the summit has been glaciated for about 5900 years. In combination with known maximum ages of other high Alpine glaciers, we present evidence for an elevation gradient of neoglaciation onset. It reveals that in the Alps only the highest elevation sites remained ice-covered throughout the Holocene. Just before the life of the Iceman, high Alpine summits were emerging from nearly ice-free conditions, during the start of a Mid-Holocene neoglaciation. We demonstrate that, under specific circumstances, the old ice at the base of high Alpine glaciers is a sensitive archive of glacier change. However, under current melt rates the archive at Wei ss seespitze and at similar locations will be lost within the next two decades.","[Bohleber, Pascal; Stocker-Waldhuber, Martin; Fischer, Andrea] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Interdisciplinary Mt Res, Innsbruck, Austria; [Bohleber, Pascal] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Schwikowski, Margit; Fang, Ling] Paul Scherrer Inst, Villigen, Switzerland; [Schwikowski, Margit] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, Bern, Switzerland; [Schwikowski, Margit; Fang, Ling] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",Austrian Academy of Sciences; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Bohleber, P (corresponding author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Interdisciplinary Mt Res, Innsbruck, Austria.;Bohleber, P (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy.",pascal.bohleber@oeaw.ac.at,"Fischer, Andrea/A-9366-2012; Bohleber, Pascal/AAM-8839-2020","Fischer, Andrea/0000-0003-1291-8524; Schwikowski, Margit/0000-0002-0856-5183",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 29256-N36]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [790280],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant,"The authors would like to thank the members of the field work teams at Weissseespitze.

The current agriculture has become highly dependent on a flow of chemical input from pesticide and insecticide industry, itself remaining as a source of a problem both for human and global health. Protected agriculture is among the answers to the looming crisis in water and climate change. We reviewed the current systems of protected agriculture as they migrate from 'open' to 'semi-closed' and 'fully-closed' systems of plant production from the sustainability point of view. Not a long time ago, the problems related to the soilborne diseases acted as a trigger for a remarkable shift to use of simpler growth media. Now the plant factories and similar approaches are applying the state of the art techniques of fertilization and lighting to deliver a clean product; but still they remain dependent on a large flow of external inputs, as well as an intensive monitoring and management platform. On the other side are the emerging agroecological perspectives that are in support of a concept of disease management based on higher biodiversity in the plant culture media and the surrounding environment. Such systems try to address the pest and disease issue by use of a much more complex media, and a high biodiversity in the production environment that could reduce the management intensity and thus reduce the cost. As these systems are more self-sufficient, they have the ability to create more 'closed' systems of production. However, there is no a consensus in the scientific society in this regard, therefore a clear dilemma between a selection of simple or complex growing media exists, which determines the technologies to be developed and used. The same problem persists in the studies of bio-regenerative life support system where sophisticated designs for plant production units destined for potential use in outer space are attempted. This review tries to shed light on the future image of both approaches from the sustainability outlook based on the degree of inherent self-sufficiency or recyclability of inputs, which could be further interpreted as the level of 'closedness' of the systems.","[Hadavi, Ebrahim] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran; [Ghazijahani, Noushin] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Microbiol, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Hadavi, E (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran.",hadavi@kiau.ac.ir,"Hadavi, Ebrahim/H-2167-2012","Hadavi, Ebrahim/0000-0002-3616-0490",,,,,67,2,2,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2210-4410,2210-4429,978-3-319-99076-7; 978-3-319-99075-0,SUSTAIN AGR REV,Sustain.

Middle Stone Age (MSA) lithics, site distributions and locations are analysed in relation to palaeovegetation maps of the last glacial/interglacial cycle, which are used as a proxy for earlier climate cycles. A push and pull model is then postulated for the spread of Homo sapiens out of refugia in eastern Africa, involving both volcanism (push) and habitat availability (pull).

We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

The present study aimed to explore the impact of climatic variables and reservoir on the incidence of HFRS in Huludao City, an epidemic focus of the disease in northeastern China. Methods: Structure Equation Model (SEM), a statistical technique for testing and estimating causal relationships, was conducted based on climatic variables, virus-carrying index among rodents, and incidence of HFRS in the city during the period 1990 to 2006. The linear structural relationships (LISREL) software (Scientific Software International, Lincolnwood, IL) was used to fit SEMs. Results: Temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and virus-carrying index among rodents have shown positive correlations with the monthly incidence of HFRS, while air pressure had a negative correlation with the incidence. The best-fit SEM model fitted well with the data-based correlation matrix, P value was more than 0.56, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) equaled to 0, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was more than 0.99. Conclusion: Climate and reservoirs have affected the incidence of HFRS in Huludao City, located in northeastern China. Climate affects HFRS incidence mainly through the effect on reservoir in the study area. HFRS prevention and control should give more consideration to rodent control and climate variations.","[Guan, Peng; Huang, Desheng; Zhou, Baosen] China Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China; [Huang, Desheng] China Med Univ, Dept Math, Coll Basic Med Sci, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China; [He, Miao] China Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Informat Ctr, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China; [Shen, Tiefeng] Huludao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Infect Dis Control, Huludao 125000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Junqiao] Liaoning Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Shenyang 110005, Peoples R China",China Medical University; China Medical University; China Medical University,"Zhou, BS (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China.",pguan@mail.cmu.edu.cn; dshuang@mail.cmu.edu.cn; job-mail@263.net; stfhld@hotmail.com; guojunqiao@lncdc.com; bszhou@mail.cmu.edu.cn,"Guan, Peng/GWM-9170-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(NNSFC) [70503028, 30771860]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry [[2008] 890]; CMU Development [[2008] 5]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(NNSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); CMU Development","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(NNSFC), No. 70503028 and No. 30771860.

MSWEP V2 compares substantially better with Stage IV gauge-radar P data than other state-of-the-art P datasets for the United States, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MSWEP V2 methodology. Global comparisons suggest that MSWEP V2 exhibits more realistic spatial patterns in mean, magnitude, and frequency. Long-term mean P estimates for the global, land, and ocean domains based on MSWEP V2 are 955, 781, and 1,025 mm yr(-1), respectively. Other P datasets consistently underestimate P amounts in mountainous regions. Using MSWEP V2, P was estimated to occur 15.5%, 12.3%, and 16.9% of the time on average for the global, land, and ocean domains, respectively. MSWEP V2 provides unique opportunities to explore spatiotemporal variations in P, improve our understanding of hydrological processes and their parameterization, and enhance hydrological model performance.","[Beck, Hylke E.; Wood, Eric F.; Pan, Ming; Fisher, Colby K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Miralles, Diego G.] Univ Ghent, Lab Hydrol & Water Management, Ghent, Belgium; [van Dijk, Albert I.

This study determines the level of thermal comfort in residential courtyards in hot-climate regions, taking Baghdad as a case study. Design/methodology/approach This study develops a novel Courtyard Thermal Usability Index (CTUI) to quantify the ability of courtyards to provide thermal comfort to occupants. CTUI is the fraction of useable thermally comfortable hours in courtyards of the total occupation hours during a specific period. To operationalise CTUI, the research employs the Envi-met 4.2 simulation tool to determine the annual thermal conditions of 360 courtyards. An adaptive thermal comfort model developed by Al-Hafith in 2020 for Iraq is used to judge simulated thermal conditions and determine CTUI. Findings CTUI enables determining the level of thermal comfort courtyards offer to occupants by showing the ratio of the thermally comfortable period versus the occupation period. Results show that, in Iraq, annually, courtyards offer up to 38% comfortable hours out of the total potential occupation hours. The rest of the time the courtyard will not be comfortable, mostly due to overheating. When designing courtyards, the most effective geometric property impacting courtyards' thermal conditions is width/height. The most important microclimatic factor impacting occupants' thermal sensation is mean radiant temperature (MRT). This study can be used to inform designing thermally efficient courtyards for hot-climate regions. Originality/value This study presents the first assessment of the thermal efficiency of courtyards in hot-climate regions depending on an assessment of their ability to provide thermal comfort to occupants. The study presents a novel index that can be used to quantify the ability of courtyards to provide a thermally comfortable environment to occupants.","[Al-Hafith, Omar] Nottingham Trent Univ, Coll Art Architecture Design & Humanities, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, City Campus, Nottingham, England; [Satish, B.

Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.","[Ringkjob, Hans-Kristian; Haugan, Peter M.; Solbrekke, Ida Marie] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Ringkjob, HK (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",Hans-Kristian.Ringkjob@uib.no,,"Ringkjob, Hans-Kristian/0000-0002-0539-5959",University of Bergen,University of Bergen,This research received funding from the University of Bergen.,,200,273,274,15,48,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

One factor of uncertainty is the importance of tropical CH4 emissions into the global mix. Isotopic signatures of major sources remain poorly constrained, despite their usefulness in constraining the global methane budget. Here, a collection of new delta C-13(CH4) signatures is presented for a range of tropical wetlands and rice fields determined from air samples collected during campaigns from 2016 to 2020. Long-term monitoring of delta C-13(CH4) in ambient air has been conducted at the Chacaltaya observatory, Bolivia and Southern Botswana. Both long-term records are dominated by biogenic CH4 sources, with isotopic signatures expected from wetland sources. From the longer-term Bolivian record, a seasonal isotopic shift is observed corresponding to wetland extent suggesting that there is input of relatively isotopically light CH4 to the atmosphere during periods of reduced wetland extent. This new data expands the geographical extent and range of measurements of tropical wetland and rice delta C-13(CH4) sources and hints at significant seasonal variation in tropical wetland delta C-13(CH4) signatures which may be important to capture in future global and regional models.","[France, James L.; Fisher, Rebecca E.; Lowry, David; Lanoiselle, Mathias; Nisbet-Jones, Peter B.

However, as renewable technologies rely on diverse natural resources, the design of decarbonized energy systems inevitably leads to environmental trade-offs. This paper presents the case study of a comprehensive impact assessment for different future development scenarios of a decentralized renewable energy system in Germany. It applies an adapted ecological scarcity method (ESM) that improves decision-support by ranking the investigated scenarios and revealing their main environmental shortcomings: increased mineral resource use and pollutant emissions due to required technical infrastructure and a substantial increase in land use due to biomass combustion. Concerning the case study, the paper suggests extending the set of considered options, e.g., towards including imported wind energy. More generally, the findings underline the need for a comprehensive environmental assessment of renewable energy systems that integrate electricity supply with heating, cooling, and mobility. On a methodical level, the ESM turns out to be a transparent and well adaptable method to analyze environmental trade-offs from renewable energy supply. It currently suffers from missing quantitative targets that are democratically sufficiently legitimized. At the same time, it can provide a sound basis for an informed discussion on such targets.","[Lambrecht, Hendrik; Lewerenz, Steffen; Hottenroth, Heidi; Tietze, Ingela; Viere, Tobias] Pforzheim Univ, Inst Ind Ecol INEC, Tiefenbronner Str 65, D-75175 Pforzheim, Germany",,"Lambrecht, H (corresponding author), Pforzheim Univ, Inst Ind Ecol INEC, Tiefenbronner Str 65, D-75175 Pforzheim, Germany.",Hendrik.lambrecht@hs-pforzheim.de; steffen.lewerenz@hs-pforzheim.de; heidi.hottenroth@hs-pforzheim.de; ingela.tietze@hs-pforzheim.de; tobias.viere@hs-pforzheim.de,"Viere, Tobias/ABG-5990-2021; Viere, Tobias/AAS-2692-2020; Tietze, Ingela/AAF-1169-2020","Viere, Tobias/0000-0001-9030-2405; Tietze, Ingela/0000-0003-0358-8885","Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg-Ministry for Science, Research and Art and European Regional Development Fund-Innovation and Energiewende [ENsource-2, FEIH_ZAFH_1248932]","Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg-Ministry for Science, Research and Art and European Regional Development Fund-Innovation and Energiewende","This research was funded by the Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg-Ministry for Science, Research and Art and European Regional Development Fund-Innovation and Energiewende, in the context of the center for applied research Urban Energy Systems and Resource Efficiency (ENsource-2, grant number FEIH_ZAFH_1248932).",,32,1,1,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2020,21,,,,,,5655,10.3390/en13215655,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13215655,,,14,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,OQ6JZ,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000588888500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyze P-to-S seismic phase conversions from the sediment-crust boundary recorded by the Passive Imaging of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (PI-LAB) experiment to infer the sediment thickness across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge covering 0- to 80-Myr-old seafloor. We find P(d)s-P delay times of 0.04-0.37s, or 5- to 82-m thickness. Sediment thickness increases with age. Thickness agrees with global estimates for young (<15-20Myr) seafloor but is thinner on older lithosphere. Our result may represent a lower limit on sediment thickness, given that several of our stations are on topographic highs. The sedimentation rate decrease observed from 5 to 1.2 mm/kyr at similar to 10 Myr suggests a recent increase in productivity related to climate change, eolian dust fluxes, and/or biogenic marine activity. Plain Language Summary Studies on marine sediment production rate provide historical information on the past climates and sedimentation processes. Unfortunately, such data from the seafloor is sporadic across the oceans, limited to localized drilled sites and seismic profiles. Here we analyze the sediment characteristics along the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ocean, starting from age 0 at the ridge to sediments 80 million years old. We use newly acquired seismic data from the recent state-of-the-art Passive Imaging of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary experiment. Thirty-nine seismometers were put at the ocean bottom down to about 5,000m below sea level and left recording seismic data for one year between 2016 and 2017. Conversion of seismic phases from the boundary between the crust and the sediment were analyzed to determine the sediment seismic velocity and thickness below each station. It was found that the thickness increases with age at a slower rate than previously thought and that an abrupt increase in the sedimentation rate occurred in the last 10 million years, from 1.2 to 5mm per thousand years. The recent increase in productivity may be due to factors such as changes in climate, changes in the eolian dust fluxes from Africa to the Atlantic, and/or changes in biogenic marine activity.","[Agius, M.

Oxalic acid is globally the most abundant dicarboxylic acid, formed via chemical oxidation of gas-phase precursors in the aqueous phase of aerosols and droplets. Its lifecycle and atmospheric global distribution remain highly uncertain and are the focus of this study. The first global spatial and temporal distribution of oxalate, simulated using a state-of-the-art aqueous-phase chemical scheme embedded within the global 3-dimensional chemistry/transport model TM4-ECPL, is here presented. The model accounts for comprehensive gas-phase chemistry and its coupling with major aerosol constituents (including secondary organic aerosol). Model results are consistent with ambient observations of oxalate at rural and remote locations (slope = 1.16 +/- 0.14, r(2) = 0.36, N = 114) and suggest that aqueous-phase chemistry contributes significantly to the global atmospheric burden of secondary organic aerosol. In TM4-ECPL most oxalate is formed in-cloud and less than 5% is produced in aerosol water. About 62% of the oxalate is removed via wet deposition, 30% by in-cloud reaction with hydroxyl radical, 4% by in-cloud reaction with nitrate radical and 4% by dry deposition. The in-cloud global oxalate net chemical production is calculated to be about 21-37 Tgyr(-1) with almost 79% originating from biogenic hydrocarbons, mainly isoprene. This condensed phase net source of oxalate in conjunction with a global mean turnover time against deposition of about 5 days, maintain oxalate's global tropospheric burden of 0.2-0.3 Tg, i.e. 0.05-0.1 Tg-C that is about 5-9% of model-calculated water soluble organic carbon burden.","[Myriokefalitakis, S.; Mihalopoulos, N.; Kanakidou, M.] Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, Iraklion 71003, Greece; [Myriokefalitakis, S.; Nenes, A.] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Chem Engn & High Temp Chem Proc ICE HT, Patras 26504, Greece; [Tsigaridis, K.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Tsigaridis, K.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Sciare, J.] CNRS CEA, LSCE, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Nenes, A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nenes, A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Kawamura, K.] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan; [Segers, A.] TNO Built Environm & Geosci, Dept Air Qual & Climate, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Crete; Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences (ICE-HT); Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Hokkaido University; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research,"Kanakidou, M (corresponding author), Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, POB 2208, Iraklion 71003, Greece.",mariak@chemistry.uoc.gr,"Nenes, Athanasios/ABE-6478-2020; Tsigaridis, Kostas/K-8292-2012; Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/J-3701-2014; Kawamura, Kimitaka/B-3839-2011; Kanakidou, Maria/D-7882-2012; Mihalopoulos, Nikolaos/ABF-2255-2020; Mihalopoulos, Nikolaos/H-5327-2016","Nenes, Athanasios/0000-0003-3873-9970; Tsigaridis, Kostas/0000-0001-5328-819X; Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/0000-0002-1541-7680; Kawamura, Kimitaka/0000-0003-1190-3726; Kanakidou, Maria/0000-0002-1724-9692; Mihalopoulos, Nikolaos/0000-0002-1282-0896; Segers, Arjo/0000-0002-1319-0195; sciare, jean/0000-0002-9908-6718",EUCAARI (European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate Air Quality Interactions); PEGASOS (Pan-European Gas-AeroSOls-climate interaction Study); PENED [03ED373]; EU; Greek Ministry of Development - GSRT; French Polar Institute (IPEV),EUCAARI (European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate Air Quality Interactions); PEGASOS (Pan-European Gas-AeroSOls-climate interaction Study); PENED(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); EU(European Commission); Greek Ministry of Development - GSRT(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); French Polar Institute (IPEV),"This work was supported by the EUCAARI (European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate Air Quality Interactions), the PEGASOS (Pan-European Gas-AeroSOls-climate interaction Study) and its presentation has been facilitated by the ACCENT (Atmospheric Composition Change - The European Network of Excellence).

During the Upper Palaeolithic period the site contains evidence of human occupation through the Gravettian and Epigravettian periods, multiple human burials, changes in the pattern of human occupation, and faunal, isotopic and sedimentological evidence for local environmental change. In spite of this rich record, the chronological control is insufficient to resolve shifts in subsistence and mobility patterns at sufficiently high resolution to match the abrupt climate fluctuations at this time. To resolve this we present new radiocarbon and tephros-tratigraphic dates in combination with existing radiocarbon dates, and develop a Bayesian age model framework for the site. This improved chronology reveals that local environmental conditions reflect abrupt and long-term changes in climate, and that these also directly influence changing patterns of human occupation of the site. In particular, we show that the environmental record for the site, based on small mammal habitat preferences, is chronologically in phase with the main changes in climate and environment seen in key regional archives from Italy and Greenland. We also calculate the timing of the transitions between different cultural phases and their spans. We also show that the intensification in occupation of the site is chronologically coincident with a rapid rise in Mesic Woody taxa seen in key regional pollen records and is associated with the Late Epigravettian occupation of the site. This change in the record of Grotta del Romito is also closely associated stratigraphically with a new tephra (the ROM D30 tephra), which may act as a critical marker in environmental records of the region.

This paper also analyzes sources of publication, authorship, citations, distributions publications and other bibliometric indicators. The study focuses on a total of 1372 articles published from 2000 to 2020. These articles were collected through an automated process from the Scopus database and later analyzed using techniques such as bibliometric indicators analysis, VOSviewer, and Perish or Publish. The research identified 991 articles from varieties of published sources. The topic of immigrants and environmental degradation has been an emerging topic since 1981. Starting in 2000, most of the scholars actively producing an articles pertinent to this topic. Most of the articles were published in journals, and English is the primary language of research. United States is the leading country in contributing the publications. Meanwhile, the most significant fields in which the sources were produced were environmental science, agricultural and biological sciences, arts and humanities and earth and planetary sciences. However, some limitations has been found. It has been suggested for future research, to lengthen this work to other databases, as well as bibliometric analyses of immigration and environmental degradation in developed and developing countries by adding a new keyword such as energy consumption and climate change. This paper aims to assess recent trends in the expansion of academic literature on immigration and environmental degradation using the bibliometric analysis method.

Modern urbanization is predicated on complex, increasingly coupled infrastructure systems, and energy use continues to be largely met from fossil fuels. Until energy infrastructures evolve away from carbon-based fuels, GHG emissions are critically tied to the urbanization process. Further complicating the challenge of decoupling urban growth from GHG emissions are lock-in effects and interdependencies. This paper synthesizes state-of-the-art thinking for transportation, fuels, buildings, water, electricity, and waste systems and finds that GHG emissions assessments tend to view these systems as static and isolated from social and institutional systems. Despite significant understanding of methods and technologies for reducing infrastructure-related GHG emissions, physical, institutional, and cultural constraints continue to work against us, pointing to knowledge gaps that must be addressed. This paper identifies three challenge themes to improve our understanding of the role of infrastructure and technologies in urbanization processes and position these increasingly complex systems for low-carbon growth. The challenges emphasize how we can reimagine the role of infrastructure in the future and how people, institutions, and ecological systems interface with infrastructure.","[Chester, Mikhail V.; Allenby, Braden] Arizona State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Sustainable Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Sperling, Josh] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Stokes, Eleanor] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Kockelman, Kara] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kennedy, Christopher] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Baker, Lawrence A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Keirstead, James] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Hendrickson, Chris T.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Yale University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Toronto; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Imperial College London; Carnegie Mellon University,"Chester, MV (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Sustainable Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",mchester@asu.edu,"Kockelman, Kara/ABF-7223-2021","Stokes, Eleanor C./0000-0002-0204-8847",,,,,100,29,29,2,43,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2328-4277,,,EARTHS FUTURE,Earth Future,OCT,2014,10,,,,533,547,,10.1002/2014EF000253,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014EF000253,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,CN0WY,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000358136100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, such urban effects vary with the geographical and climatic conditions of the respective cities. This study is the first to quantitatively estimate the impact of past (1878), present (2012), and future (2050) urbanization on surface air temperatures and human thermal comfort in Sofia, the largest city of Bulgaria. We used the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate model, with a 1-km horizontal resolution for three cases: LU1878, LU2012, and LU2050. We first validated the results of the control simulation (case LU2012) against actual observations. The model satisfactorily reproduced the diurnal variation of the observed monthly mean surface air temperatures for July (2011-2013) with a mean bias of +/- 0.6 degrees C. We then estimated the potential impacts of past and future urbanization on surface temperature. Our results suggest that because of urbanization of Sofia, the surface air temperature at 0600 Local Standard Time (LST) has increased approximately 4.0 degrees C in the past (1878-2012) and approximately 0.4 degrees C in future (2012-2050). We also evaluated the impact of the urban thermal environment on human comfort levels. Considering the LU2050 case in the central part of Sofia, the temperature-humidity index during mid-afternoon (1400-1700 LST) is estimated to be 24-26, indicating that approximately 50% of the residents could feel perceptibly uncomfortable.","[Vitanova, Lidia Lazarova] Nikken Sekkei Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Vitanova, Lidia Lazarova; Kusaka, Hiroyuki; Quang-Van Doan] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Subasinghe, Shyamantha] Univ Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka",University of Tsukuba; University of Peradeniya,"Vitanova, LL (corresponding author), Nikken Sekkei Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.",vitanova_lidia@yahoo.com,"Subasinghe, Shyamantha/ABB-3167-2021","Subasinghe, Shyamantha/0000-0002-7531-8887","Multidisciplinary Cooperative Research Program in the Center for Computational Sciences; University of Tsukuba, Japan","Multidisciplinary Cooperative Research Program in the Center for Computational Sciences; University of Tsukuba, Japan","This research was supported by the Multidisciplinary Cooperative Research Program in the Center for Computational Sciences, the University of Tsukuba, Japan.",,44,0,0,5,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-4827,1469-8080,,METEOROL APPL,Meteorol.

This article seeks to understand and aggregate the different drivers of this phenomenon portrayed in the literature, as well the empirical evidence associated and the proposed solutions. For this purpose, compilation and systematization of the various scientific contributions up to date in this context have been elaborated and the driver's effective impact on the European scenario was evaluated, using a balanced panel for 28 countries in Europe over 1996-2018 and the generalized method of moments (GMM) econometric procedure. Proxies for all provocateurs identified in the state of the art were incorporated in this study: (i) environmental taxes, (ii) green support, (iii) uncertain property rights, (iv) emissions limit (cap), and (v) temporal lag. The dependent variables used are (1) the ratio between the annual production/extraction of oil and the consumption of primary energy and (2) the carbon dioxide (CO2) intensity. We have obtained evidences that the hiatus in the implementation of the European emission cap mechanism has generated a strong green paradox. Moreover, a robust reflection regarding the economic and environmental adequacy of green supports should be considered due to its questionable net benefits. Lastly, we offer some recommendations of public environmental policies that escape the paradoxical phenomenon, through the enunciation of the conditionalities of these provocateurs.","[Tavares, Angelo Rafael; Robaina, Margarita] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Robaina, Margarita] Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Pub, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Robaina, M (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Robaina, M (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Pub, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",mrobaina@ua.pt,,"Robaina, Margarita/0000-0002-7919-5888","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FCT -Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/04058/2020, UIDP/04058/2020]","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FCT -Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)","TThis work was financially supported by the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy (UIDB/04058/2020) + (UIDP/04058/2020), funded by national funds through FCT -Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia.",,57,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Further improvements are expected when such a microgrid is operated based on direct current (dc) instead of alternating current (ac) infrastructure for power distribution commonly in use today. Our study aims to systemically quantify the gap between environmental impacts of microgrids at building level using the case study of power distribution within office buildings. For this purpose, a scalable comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted based on a technical bottom-up analysis of dif-ferences between ac and dc microgrids. Particularly, our approach combines the micro-level assessment of required power electronic components with the macro-level requirements for daily operation derived from a generic grid model. The results indicate that the environmental impacts of employed power electronics are substantially reduced by operating a microgrid based on dc power distribution infrastructure. Our sensitivity analyses show that efficient dc microgrids particularly lead to savings in climate change impact emissions. In addition, our study shows that the state-of-the-art scaling rules of power electronics currently used in LCAs leads to inaccurate results. In contrast, the proposed methodology applies a more technical approach, which enables a detailed analysis of the environmental impacts of power electronic components at system level. Thus, it provides the foundation for an evaluation criterion for a comprehensive assessment of technological changes within the framework of energy policy objectives.","[Kockel, Christina; Nolting, Lars; Goldbeck, Rafael; Praktiknjo, Aaron] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [De Doncker, Rik W.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives, D-52066 Aachen, Germany; [Wulf, Christina] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Syst Anal & Technol Eva, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Kockel, Christina; Nolting, Lars; Goldbeck, Rafael; De Doncker, Rik W.; Praktiknjo, Aaron] JARA ENERGY, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Wulf, Christina] JARA ENERGY, D-52425 Julich, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Kockel, C; Praktiknjo, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",christina.kockel@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; apraktiknjo@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,"Praktiknjo, Aaron/AAX-4381-2020; Praktiknjo, Aaron/O-6105-2017; Wulf, Christina/AAV-9347-2021","Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Wulf, Christina/0000-0003-2698-0089; Kockel, Christina/0000-0003-0335-7593",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government [(DE-82)EXS-SF-OPSF560],Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government,"C.K., L.N., R.W.D.D. and A.P. received funding by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Ladnder (grant ID: (DE-82) EXS-SF-OPSF560) .",,55,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

In this paper, we propose MULTPAX, a multitask framework for extracting present and absent keyphrases using pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs. In particular, our framework contains three components: first, MULTPAX identifies present keyphrases from an input document. Then, MULTPAX links with external knowledge graphs to get more relevant phrases. Finally, MULTPAX ranks the extracted phrases based on their semantic relatedness to the input document and return top-k phrases as a final output. We conducted several experiments on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of MULTPAX against different state-of-the-art baselines. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, with a significance t-test p < 0.041.

In recent years, disturbance frequency and severity have been increasing at continental scale, a trend that is expected to continue under future anthropogenic climate change. Disturbance management is thus increasingly important for sustainable stewardship of forests, and requires tools to evaluate the effects of management alternatives and climatic changes on disturbance risk and ecosystem services. We here present a process-based model of wind disturbance impacts on forest ecosystems, integrated into the dynamic landscape simulation model iLand. The model operates at the level of individual trees and simulates wind disturbance events iteratively, i.e., dynamically accounting for changes in forest structure and newly created edges during the course of a storm. Both upwind gap size and local shelter from neighboring trees are considered in this regard, and critical wind speeds for uprooting and stem breakage are distinguished. The simulated disturbance size, pattern, and severity are thus emergent properties of the model. We evaluated the new simulation tool against satellite-derived data on the impact of the storm Gudrun (January 2005) on a 1391 ha forest landscape in south central Sweden. Both the overall damage percentage (observation: 21.7%, simulation: 21.4%) as well as the comparison of spatial damage patterns showed good correspondence between observations and predictions (prediction accuracy: 60.4%) if the full satellite-derived structural and spatial heterogeneity of the landscape was taken into account. Neglecting within-stand heterogeneity in forest conditions, i.e., the state-of-the-art in many stand-level risk models, resulted in a considerable underestimation of simulated damage, supporting the notion that tree-level complexity matters for assessing and modeling large-scale disturbances. A sensitivity analysis further showed that changes in wind speed and soil freezing could have potentially large impacts on disturbed area and patch size. The model presented here is available as open source. It can be used to study the effects of different silvicultural systems and future climates on wind risk, as well as to quantify the impacts of wind disturbance on ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. It thus contributes to improving our capacity to address changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of these technologies have been available for years while others have only recently emerged. Use of these technologies is critical to improve understanding of the processes that control abundances, distributions and composition of plankton, provide data necessary to constrain and improve ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and forecast changes in marine ecosystems in light of climate change. In this paper we begin by providing the motivation for plankton observations, quantification and diversity qualification on a global scale. We then expand on the state-of-the-art, detailing a variety of relevant and (mostly) mature technologies and measurements, including bulk measurements of plankton, pigment composition, uses of genomic, optical and acoustical methods as well as analysis using particle counters, flow cytometers and quantitative imaging devices. We follow by highlighting the requirements necessary for a plankton observing system, the approach to achieve it and associated challenges. We conclude with ranked action-item recommendations for the next 10 years to move toward our vision of a holistic ocean-wide plankton observing system. Particularly, we suggest to begin with a demonstration project on a GO-SHIP line and/or a long-term observation site and expand from there, ensuring that issues associated with methods, observation tools, data analysis, quality assessment and curation are addressed early in the implementation. Global coordination is key for the success of this vision and will bring new insights on processes associated with nutrient regeneration, ocean production, fisheries and carbon sequestration.","[Lombard, Fabien; Uitz, Julia; Stemmann, Lars; Picheral, Marc; Frisson, Jean-Olivier; Guidi, Lionel; Gorsky, Gaby; Ayata, Sakina Dorothee] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Lombard, Fabien] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Boss, Emmanuel; Karp-Boss, Lee] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Waite, Anya M.] Dalhousie Univ, Ocean Frontier Inst, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Vogt, Meike] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sosik, Heidi M.; Gallager, Scott] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Schulz, Jan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Oldenburg, Germany; [Romagnan, Jean-Baptiste] Ifremer Ctr Atlantique, Unite Ecol & Modeles Halieut EMH, Nantes, France; [Pearlman, Jay] IEEE, Port Angeles, WA USA; [Ohman, Mark D.; Jaffe, Jules S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA; [Niehoff, Barbara; Iversen, Morten H.] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Moeller, Klas M.] Helmholt Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Miloslavich, Patricia; Lara-Lpez, Ana; Bax, Nicholas] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Miloslavich, Patricia] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Estudios Ambientales, Caracas, Venezuela; [Kudela, Raphael] UC Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Lopes, Rubens M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Oceanog Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Kiko, Rainer; Hauss, Helena] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Iversen, Morten H.] Univ Bremen, MARUM, Bremen, Germany; [Iversen, Morten H.] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany; [Fennel, Katja] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Giering, Sarah L.

Such models are typically used to study the water component of coupled land and atmosphere models, in particular quantifying moisture recycling and the source-sink relations between evaporation and precipitation. There are several atmospheric moisture tracking methods in use. However, depending on the level of aggregation, the assumptions made and the level of detail, the performance of these methods may differ substantially. In this paper, we compare three methods. The RCM-tag method uses highly accurate 3-D water tracking (including phase transitions) directly within a regional climate model (online), while the other two methods (WAM and 3D-T) use a posteriori (offline) water vapour tracking. The original version of WAM is a single-layer model, while 3D-T is a multi-layer model, but both make use the well-mixed assumption for evaporation and precipitation. The a posteriori models are faster and more flexible, but less accurate than online moisture tracking with RCM-tag. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the a posteriori models, we tagged evaporated water from Lake Volta in West Africa and traced it to where it precipitates. It is found that the strong wind shear in West Africa is the main cause of errors in the a posteriori models. The number of vertical layers and the initial release height of tagged water in the model are found to have the most significant influences on the results. With this knowledge small improvements have been made to the a posteriori models. It appeared that expanding WAM to a 2-layer model, or a lower release height in 3D-T, led to significantly better results. Finally, we introduced a simple metric to assess wind shear globally and give recommendations about when to use which model. The best method, however, very much depends on the research question, the spatial extent under investigation, as well as the available computational power.","[van der Ent, R. J.; Savenije, H. H.

They have been recently linked to the hot and dry weather conditions that favour wildfires over Australia. However, the chance of a southern hemisphere event is unknown because it has only been observed once. Legitimate estimation of the frequency of SSW events requires a large sample of realistic model simulations. Here we show that the chance of an event is close to 4% per year, implying that an event will occur, on average, every 25 yr, using a state-of-the-art model that simulates SSWs accurately. It is thus not surprising that there was a near miss in the September prior to the Australian wildfire of 2019, given the 40 yr of comprehensive satellite records and just one observed Antarctic event. According to this new estimate, it would also not be surprising to see a second SSW event in the coming years in the southern hemisphere. Such a stratospheric warming event might bring further extreme surface weather conditions and natural hazards, as it may raise the risk of increased rainfall in the latitudinal band of 35-50 degrees S. Meanwhile, the associated hot and dry weather conditions over austral subtropical continents might increase the risk of wildfires over these regions.","[Wang, L.] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, L.] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, L.] Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, L.] Fudan Univ, Big Data Inst Carbon Emiss & Environm Pollut, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hardiman, S.

In this study, we proposed a general framework for blending multiple satellite precipitation data using the dynamic Bayesian model averaging (BMA) algorithm. The blended experiment was performed at a daily 0.25 degrees grid scale for 2007-2012 among Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42RT and 3B42V7, Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique (CMORPH), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR). First, the BMA weights were optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) method for each member on each day at 200 calibrated sites and then interpolated to the entire plateau using the ordinary kriging (OK) approach. Thus, the merging data were produced by weighted sums of the individuals over the plateau. The dynamic BMA approach showed better performance with a smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.77mm/day, higher correlation coefficient of 0.592, and closer Euclid value of 0.833, compared to the individuals at 15 validated sites. Moreover, BMA has proven to be more robust in terms of seasonality, topography, and other parameters than traditional ensemble methods including simple model averaging (SMA) and one-outlier removed (OOR). Error analysis between BMA and the state-of-the-art IMERG in the summer of 2014 further proved that the performance of BMA was superior with respect to multisatellite precipitation data merging. This study demonstrates that BMA provides a new solution for blending multiple satellite data in regions with limited gauges.","[Ma, Yingzhao; Hong, Yang; Yang, Yuan; Tang, Guoqiang; Long, Di; Li, Changmin; Han, Zhongying] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yingzhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yang] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Chen, Yang] Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Water Resources & Environm, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Yao, Yunjun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ronghua] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Tianjin Normal University; Beijing Normal University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research","Hong, Y (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Hong, Y (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Liu, RH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hongyang@tsinghua.edu.cn; liurh@iwhr.com,"Hong, Yang/D-5132-2009; Long, Di/N-8049-2013; Tang, Guoqiang/P-3802-2018","Hong, Yang/0000-0001-8720-242X; Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039; Tang, Guoqiang/0000-0002-0923-583X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0405802]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91437214, 41601065]; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science [OFSLRSS201711]; China National Flash Flood Disaster Prevention and Control Project [126301001000150068]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science; China National Flash Flood Disaster Prevention and Control Project,"The authors thank Xun Sun from Columbia University (currently East China Normal University), Lane Maguire from University of Oklahoma, Kun Yang from Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (currently Tsinghua University), and Chi Yang from Beijing Normal University for their constructive comments and helpful suggestions.

Less certain is how regional tropical rainfall patterns have changed in the late Holocene, under boundary conditions and on timescales which are most relevant to the tropics' response to a warming world. Several high-resolution southern hemisphere rainfall records are at odds with meridional movement of the mean Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone location as the major driver of Holocene tropical rainfall variability, with regional precipitation patterns resembling modern day El-Nino Southern Oscillation end members. To test emerging ideas on sub-millennial tropical rainfall variability, additional records from the southern hemisphere are required. We present a new speleothem delta O-18 record from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern Madagascar, which provides a quasi-annual record of monsoonal strength and precipitation amount for the last 1700 years. The majority of delta O-18 variability in the record is at the decadal scale, and shows little to no correlation with major climate indices or cyclical climate drivers. At lower frequencies, changes in mean speleothem delta O-18 show good correlation with other regional precipitation records both north and south of the equator. The regional coherency of tropical rainfall across the west Indian Ocean resembles expansion and contraction of the tropical rain belt and positive-Indian Ocean Dipole-like conditions at different timescales. The cause of this coherency could be related to symmetrical changes in continental sensible heating, or to a low frequency sea surface temperature climate mode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although LCA techniques of forest production have been already conducted since the early 1990s, consistent and comprehensive LCA studies are still lacking for the forestry sector. In order to support better comparability between LCA studies, we analyzed the problems and differences by conducting a descriptive and quantitative analysis of existing LCA studies of forest production with special focus on Global Warming Potential (GWP). We analyzed 22 different peer-reviewed studies, four original reports and two databases. Important issues were, among others, the goal of the studies, system boundaries, functional units, impact categories and involved processes. In addition, a quantitative analysis was purchased where the results of the GWP of the reviewed studies were analyzed. The studies showed large differences between methodical assumptions and their subsequent results. For the GWP, we found a range of 2.4-59.6 kg CO2-equiv.*m(-3) over bark (ob; median = 11.8; n = 41) from site preparation to forest road and 6.3-67.1 kg CO2-equiv.*m(-3) ob (median = 17.0; n = 36) from site preparation to plant gate or consumer. Results varied as a function of the included processes and decisive assumptions, e.g., regarding productivity rates or fuel consumption of machineries. Raw wood products are widely declared as carbon neutral, but the above-mentioned results show that absolute carbon neutrality is incorrect, although the GWP is low compared with the carbon storage of the raw wood product (range of C-emitted/C-stored in wood is 0.008-0.09 from forest to plant gate or consumer). Thereby, raw wood products can be described as low emission raw materials if long-term in situ carbon losses by changed forest management or negative direct or indirect land use change effects (LUC, iLUC) can be excluded. In order to realize improved comparisons between LCA studies in the forestry sector in the future, we propose some methodical approaches regarding the harmonization of system boundaries, functional units, considered processes, and allocation assumptions. These proposals could help to specify the description of the forest production outlined in existing Product Category Rules for Environmental Product Declarations (e.g., EN ISO 16485 2014 or EN ISO 15804 2012) following EN ISO 14025 (2011) and for carbon footprinting standards like the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050 (2011) or the European Environmental Footprinting Initiative.","[Klein, Daniel; Schulz, Christoph] Bavarian State Inst Forestry, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Wolf, Christian; Weber-Blaschke, Gabriele] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Wood Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Klein, D (corresponding author), Bavarian State Inst Forestry, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 1, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",daniel.klein@lwf.bayern.de,,"Klein, Daniel/0000-0002-3276-8837",,,,,72,68,70,3,88,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

Renewable energies can be considered substitutes for fossil fuels and may contribute to reducing the environmental degradation that the world is presently facing. With this research, we aimed to offer a broader view of the state-of-the-art in this field, particularly regarding coal and biomass. The main objective is to present a viable and sustainable solution for the coal power plants still in operation, using as a hypothetical example the Pego Power Plant, the last operating coal fueled power plant in Portugal. After the characterization of land use and energy production in Portugal, and more particularly in the Medio Tejo region, where the power plant is located, the availability of biomass was assessed and it was concluded that the volume of biomass needed to keep the Pego power plant working exclusively with biomass is much lower than the yearly growth volume of biomass in the region, which means that this transition would be viable in a sustainable way. This path is aligned with policies to fight climate change, since the use of biomass for energy is characterized by low levels of GHGs emissions when compared to coal. The risk of rural fires would be reduced, and the economic and social impact for this region would be positive.","[Casau, Margarida; Cancela, Diana C. M.; Matias, Joao C.

The influence of the climatic factors: temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, soil condition, protective measures, and construction disturbance were taken into account. Driven by daily and sub-daily climate data and using specific detailed management files, the process-based WEPS model was able to express the beginning, active, and ending phases of construction, as well as the degree of disturbance for the entire scope of a construction project. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang High-speed Railway was selected as a representative study because of the diversities of different climates, soil, and working schedule conditions that could be analyzed. Wind erosion from different working units included the building of roadbeds, bridges, plants, temporary houses, earth spoil and barrow pit areas, and vehicle transportation were calculated. The total wind erosion emissions, 7406 t, for the first construction area of section LXS-15 with a 14.877 km length was obtained for quantitative analysis. The method used is applicable for evaluating wind erosion from other complex surface disturbance projects.

The maintenance of Cor-Teng (R) sculptures,MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MECHANISM; RUST,"Since the mid sixties Cor-Ten (R) steel became one of the most famous materials for outdoor sculptures until today. This material was used by many artists because of its good weather resistance. Due to not always suitable ranges of application many significant problems in the field of conservation appeared. These were surveyed in a project of the study programme 'Object Conservation' at the State Academy of Art and Design Stuttgart with special focus on the material and its protective rust layers, the premises for its protection, different cases of significant damage and their causes, the potential of preventive conservation and practised interventive methods. Although it seems to be in some way a contradiction in itself to coat a weathering steel, this has often been done in hands-on conservation to overcome corrosion problems. Therefore different coating materials already in use for outdoor metal sculptures were tested on Cor-Ten coupons in the framework of the CONSIST project in the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum (DBM). Cor-Ten B samples were covered with different coating materials such as: microcrystalline waxes, waxes used in technical corrosion protection, an acrylic resin and a polyurethane resin. The sheets were then weathered for 2 months in a climate chamber with a relative high humidity (but also drying cycles) and a climate chamber with a periodic changing relative high rate Of SO2 gas and humidity using standard protocols developed at DBM in earlier projects. The effectiveness of the protective function of each coating materials is compared, consequences for practical applications discussed.","[Decker, P.] MWD Restaurierung, D-70184 Stuttgart, Germany; [Brueggerhoff, S.] Deutsches Bergbaumuseum, D-44791 Bochum, Germany; [Eggert, G.] Staalt Akad Bildenden Kunste, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany",,"Decker, P (corresponding author), MWD Restaurierung, Am Dobelbach 11, D-70184 Stuttgart, Germany.",decker@mwd-restaurierung.de,"Eggert, Gerhard/N-1129-2019","Eggert, Gerhard/0000-0003-2443-1094",,,,,18,9,9,3,15,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0947-5117,1521-4176,,MATER CORROS,Mater.

Forest management planning is facing increasing complexity due to a widening portfolio of forest goods and services, a societal demand for a rational, transparent decision process and rising uncertainties concerning future environmental conditions (e.g., climate change). Methodological responses to these challenges include an intensified use of ecosystem models to provide an enriched, quantitative information base for FM planning. Furthermore, multi-criteria methods are increasingly used to amalgamate information, preferences, expert judgments and value expressions, in support of the participatory and communicative dimensions of modern forestry. Although the potential of combining these two approaches has been demonstrated in a number of studies, methodological aspects in interfacing forest ecosystem models (FEM) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) are scarcely addressed explicitly. In this contribution we review the state of the art in FEM and MCDA in the context of FM planning and highlight some of the crucial issues when combining ecosystem and preference modeling. We discuss issues and requirements in selecting approaches suitable for supporting FM planning problems from the growing body of FEM and MCDA concepts. We furthermore identify two major challenges in a harmonized application of FEM-MCDA: (i) the design and implementation of an indicator-based analysis framework capturing ecological and social aspects and their interactions relevant for the decision process, and (ii) holistic information management that supports consistent use of different information sources, provides meta-information as well as information on uncertainties throughout the planning process.","[Wolfslehner, Bernhard; Seidl, Rupert] Univ Bodenkultur Wien, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Silviculture, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Seidl, Rupert] Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Oregon State University","Seidl, R (corresponding author), Univ Bodenkultur Wien, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Silviculture, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",rupert.seidl@boku.ac.at,"Seidl, Rupert/ABE-6078-2020; Seidl, Rupert/A-4858-2013","Seidl, Rupert/0000-0002-3338-3402; ","European Community [518128, 237085]; Osterreichische Bundesforste AG [ADAPT]; Austrian Federal Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management [LE.3.2.3/00009-IV/2/2006]","European Community(European Commission); Osterreichische Bundesforste AG; Austrian Federal Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management","B.

The presence of stripes implies correlations in the gravity field coefficients. Here we examine the spectral signature of these correlated errors, and present a method to remove them.

Because shorebirds initiate northward migration to Arctic nesting sites based on cues at distant wintering grounds, climate-driven changes in the phenology of Arctic invertebrates may lead to a mismatch between the nutritional demands of shorebirds and the invertebrate prey essential for egg formation and subsequent chick survival. To explore the environmental drivers affecting invertebrate availability, we modeled the biomass of invertebrates captured in modified Malaise-pitfall traps over three summers at eight Arctic Shorebird Demographics Network sites as a function of accumulated degree-days and other weather variables. To assess climate-driven changes in invertebrate phenology, we used data from the nearest long-term weather stations to hindcast invertebrate availability over 63 summers, 1950-2012. Our results confirmed the importance of both accumulated and daily temperatures as predictors of invertebrate availability while also showing that wind speed negatively affected invertebrate availability at the majority of sites. Additionally, our results suggest that seasonal prey availability for Arctic shorebirds is occurring earlier and that the potential for trophic mismatch is greatest at the northernmost sites, where hindcast invertebrate phenology advanced by approximately 1-2.5 days per decade. Phenological mismatch could have long-term population-level effects on shorebird species that are unable to adjust their breeding schedules to the increasingly earlier invertebrate phenologies.","[Shaftel, Rebecca] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Rinella, Daniel J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Anchorage, AK USA; [Kwon, Eunbi] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Seewiesen, Germany; [Brown, Stephen C.] Shorebird Recovery Program, Saxtons River, VT USA; [Gates, H.

The book is divided in two groups of chapters. The first group assembles three chapters which have in common to present thematic data concerning the main types of processes that have been at work in shaping today's landforms and landscapes of Turkey, and that have given each of the geomorphological regions of Turkey its specificity. Going back to Miocene is necessary for Turkey as the two main processes that led to today's landscapes have been active since the late Miocene: tectonism and climate. Late Miocene period acted as a turning point both in terms of tectonism, with the start of the neotectonic period, and in terms of climate which changed diversely during Pliocene and Pleistocene, with processes affecting diversely the tectonically deformed reliefs, as well as the erosion and preservation of landforms in the country. Three chapters expose this history with: its impacts on today's physical geography of Turkey (Chap. 2), the structural evolution and tectonic regions of Turkey (Chap. 3) and the geomorphological regions of Turkey (Chap. 4). The second group is composed of 31 chapters composed each with an example of well-known and less-known remarkable landscapes of Turkey, grouped into six themes. Each chapter presents the state of the art and knowledge about the formation of the landscapes and the evolution of the landforms composing them. The last Chap. 32 concerns the risks affecting the landscapes of Turkey today.","[Kuzucuoglu, Catherine] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CNRS, UMR 8591, Lab Phys Geog LGP, Meudon, France; [Kuzucuoglu, Catherine] Univ Paris 12 U Pec, CNRS, UMR 8591, Lab Phys Geog LGP, Meudon, France; [Ciner, Attila] Istanbul Tech Univ, Eurasia Inst Earth Sci, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kazanci, Nizamettin] Ankara Univ, Dept Geol Engn, TR-06830 Ankara, Turkey",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Istanbul Technical University; Ankara University,"Kuzucuoglu, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CNRS, UMR 8591, Lab Phys Geog LGP, Meudon, France.;Kuzucuoglu, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris 12 U Pec, CNRS, UMR 8591, Lab Phys Geog LGP, Meudon, France.",catherine.kuzucuoglu@lgp.cnrs.fr; cinert@itu.edu.tr; nkazanci@ankara.edu.tr,,,,,,,0,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2213-2090,2213-2104,978-3-030-03515-0; 978-3-030-03513-6,WOR GEOMORPHOL LANDS,,,2019,,,,,3,5,,10.1007/978-3-030-03515-0_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03515-0_1,10.1007/978-3-030-03515-0,,3,"Geography, Physical; Geology",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology,BQ9PF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000626366700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work firstly carried out a questionnaire survey in Guangzhou, China, to study on the local acceptance rate (TSV is lower than 1.5) during different SET* intervals. Secondly, a series of cases were simulated by coupled simulation method, which considering convection, radiation and conduction, offering high precision prediction results. At last, by adopting SET* as standard index, taking both of the questionnaire survey result and ASHRAE standard into consideration, the influence of piloti on residential block's outdoor thermal comfort was analyzed and discussed. The results showed that, due to the strict climate, for those area without shading measurement, only the whole space of 100% piloti ratio case meet the need of SET* limitation level (less than 40 degrees C), for other cases, part of the space is controlled with this level. For the space shaded by piloti, the area percentage that SET* is in the limitation range (less than 40 degrees C) of 60% piloti ratio case is about 62%, and for 80% and 100% piloti ratio cases, it is 100%. It is noticed that when piloti ratio is 40%, the thermal comfort of space shaded by piloti is very strict, which should be due to the low wind velocity. A 100 percent piloti ratio can highly improve the outdoor thermal comfort, and 100% area space meet the need of 30% acceptance rate (35 degrees C), and about 40% area meet the need of 65% acceptance rate (34 degrees C).

Production-living-ecological activities in the arid Central Asia region are heavily dependent on water resources mainly recharged from melt and alpine precipitation. Hence, reliable projections of changes in extreme precipitation under global warming are particularly important for the utilization and management of water resources. Based on the downscaled and bias-corrected state-of-art global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we investigate changes in extreme precipitation over the Tienshan Mountains, Central Asia (TMCA) under different levels of global warming (1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, 3.0 degrees C, and 4.0 degrees C). We specifically assess the robustness of changes and the benefits of limiting warming to 2.0 degrees C as opposed to 3.0 degrees C. Compared with the reference period (1976-2005), a robust change in extreme precipitation across the TMCA is expected for all warming levels. And the fraction of land faced a robust change also increases with warming levels. Furthermore, there would be a substantial rise in extreme impacts in the TMCA when shifting from increases of 2.0 degrees C to 3.0 degrees C. In a scenario involving a 1.0 degrees C rise (i.e., from 2.0 degrees C to 3.0 degrees C), nearly 85.70 % and 60.19 % of the land in the TMCA will be affected by a robust increase in annual total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT) and number of light rain days (RSmm), respectively. In the same scenario, areas affected by robust changes in duration indices (consecutive dry days [CDD] and consecutive wet days [CWD]) will likely be less than 11.59 %. Limiting warming to 2.0 degrees C instead of 3.0 degrees C can avoid a marked increased impacts of about 62.84 %similar to 153.77 % of the change in frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme precipitation.","[Zhang, Xueqi; Chen, Yaning; Fang, Gonghuan; Xia, Zhenhua; Duan, Weili; Li, Shuai] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xueqi; Chen, Yaning; Fang, Gonghuan; Duan, Weili; Li, Shuai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Qianqian] Yili Normal Univ, Coll Biol & Geog, Yining, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University; Yili Normal University","Chen, YN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",chenyn@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Founda- tion of China [42130512, 42071046]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences",National Natural Science Founda- tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,"The research is supported by the National Natural Science Founda- tion of China (42130512, 42071046) .

For the MESSy user community, this offers many new possibilities. The option to use the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) atmospheric dynamical cores, especially the state-of-the-art spectral element (SE) core, as an alternative to the ECHAM5 spectral transform dynamical core will provide scientific and computational advances for atmospheric chemistry and climate modelling with MESSy. The well-established finite volume core from CESM1(CAM) is also made available. This offers the possibility to compare three different atmospheric dynamical cores within MESSy. Additionally, the CESM1 land, river, sea ice, glaciers and ocean component models can be used in CESM1/MESSy simulations, allowing the use of MESSy as a comprehensive Earth system model (ESM). For CESM1/MESSy set-ups, the MESSy process and diagnostic submodels for atmospheric physics and chemistry are used together with one of the CESM1(CAM) dynamical cores; the generic (infrastructure) submodels support the atmospheric model component. The other CESM1 component models, as well as the coupling between them, use the original CESM1 infrastructure code and libraries; moreover, in future developments these can also be replaced by the MESSy framework. Here, we describe the structure and capabilities of CESM1/MESSy, document the code changes in CESM1 and MESSy, and introduce several simulations as example applications of the system. The Supplements provide further comparisons with the ECHAM5/MESSy atmospheric chemistry (EMAC) model and document the technical aspects of the connection in detail.","[Baumgaertner, A. J.

The model is calibrated and validated with real-life empirical data, and is capable of representing actual performance of the system with high reliability. The investigated system is a novel super-performance Dew Point Cooler (DPC) with a guideless and corrugated Heat and Mass Exchanger (HMX). The DPC is modelled as part of the whole building energy model through detailed description of system and building characteristics at source code level. The developed model has been simulated in all different climates that an Indirect Evaporative Cooling (IEC) system can be operated, namely: subtropical hot desert, humid continental, Mediterranean, and hot desert climates. The performance predictions has been tested against experiments and numerical model of the same system, and a detailed investigation of modelling approaches to efficiently and effectively model aforementioned systems has been provided. The calibrated and empirically validated whole building energy model predicted the key performance parameters of the dew point evaporative cooling system with mean error values limited to 4.1%. The highest COP values recorded by experiments and whole building energy simulations were 51.1 and 49, respectively. The whole building energy model proved to better predict the performance of dew point evaporative cooler, when compared to numerical models, by incorporating the building-side parameters into the model. This modelling work paves the way toward detailed investigation of the advanced cooling systems within building context to achieve optimised performance of the system in wide range of buildings and operating conditions.","[Badiei, A.; Akhlaghi, Y.

Findings like the Oetztal ice man have demonstrated that small ice bodies at summit locations of comparatively lower altitudes may also contain old ice if locally frozen to the underlying bedrock. In this case, constraining the maximum age of their lowermost ice part may help to identify past periods with minimum ice extent in the Alps. However, with recent warming and consequent glacier mass loss, these sites may not preserve their unique climate information for much longer. Here we utilized an existing ice cave at Chli Titlis (3030 m), central Switzerland, to perform a case study for investigating the maximum age of cold-based summit glaciers in the Alps. The cave offers direct access to the glacier stratigraphy without the logistical effort required in ice core drilling. In addition, a pioneering exploration had already demonstrated stagnant cold ice conditions at Chli Titlis, albeit more than 25 years ago. Our englacial temperature measurements and the analysis of the isotopic and physical properties of ice blocks sampled at three locations within the ice cave show that cold ice still exists fairly unchanged today. State-of-the-art microradiocarbon analysis constrains the maximum age of the ice at Chli Titlis to about 5000 years before present. By this means, the approach presented here will contribute to a future systematic investigation of cold-based summit glaciers, also in the Eastern Alps.","[Bohleber, Pascal; Fischer, Andrea] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Interdisciplinary Mt Res, Innsbruck, Austria; [Bohleber, Pascal; Hoffmann, Helene; Kerch, Johanna] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany; [Kerch, Johanna] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sold, Leo] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland","Austrian Academy of Sciences; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Fribourg","Bohleber, P (corresponding author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Interdisciplinary Mt Res, Innsbruck, Austria.;Bohleber, P (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany.",pascal.bohleber@iup.uni-heidelberg.de,"Bohleber, Pascal/AAM-8839-2020; Fischer, Andrea/A-9366-2012","Fischer, Andrea/0000-0003-1291-8524; Hoffmann, Helene/0000-0002-7527-5880; Kerch, Johanna/0000-0002-7200-6837","Bergbahnen Titlis-Engelberg; Dachstein Gletscherbahn Ramsau; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 29256-N36]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BO 4246/1-1, BO 4246/3-1]; Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Helmholtz Junior Research group [VH-NG-802]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg",Bergbahnen Titlis-Engelberg; Dachstein Gletscherbahn Ramsau; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Helmholtz Junior Research group; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg,"We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Bergbahnen Titlis-Engelberg, in particular the help of Christoph Bissig and Peter Reinle.

Presently, the basic users of EWS products are government, media, and the agricultural industry. The EWS forecasts are prepared using state-of-the-art equipment and models that were developed by NDMS staff or other researchers and scientists. These models include: (1) the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), (2) NDMS Prediction Schemes, and (3) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Prediction Schemes. We used the SPI model to study incidences of drought in Nigeria, and conducted two studies to evaluate the skill of the NDMS and SST Prediction Scheme models. The results indicate that the north has the highest incidence of drought years, in comparison to the south. The skill of both the NDMS and SST Prediction Schemes is low, but these models were found to be appropriate for planning purposes. Some of the limitations we identified as being responsible for the lower skill level of these models include data quality, station density, delivery systems, and identification of the predictable components of climate. As a result, we are proposing, as part of our future needs, the development of a robust modelling technique to identify and predict band-limited cyclic components of climate that will be based on a nonlinear model of the earth/ocean/atmosphere system.","Nigerian Meteorol Serv, Lagos, Nigeria",,"Akeh, LE (corresponding author), Nigerian Meteorol Serv, 9 Strachan St, Lagos, Nigeria.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORG,GENEVA,"SECRETARY-GENERAL, PO BOX 2300, CH-1211 2 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",,,,WORLD METEO,,,2000,1037,,,,137,148,,,,,,12,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BU82Y,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000177136400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a data assimilation framework, recent advances in the context of weak-constraint 4D-Var have shown that it is possible to estimate and correct for a large fraction of systematic model error which develops in the stratosphere over short forecast ranges. The recent explosion of interest in machine learning/deep learning technologies has been driven by their remarkable success in disparate application areas. This raises the question of whether model error estimation and correction in operational NWP and climate prediction can also benefit from these techniques. In this work, we aim to start to give an answer to this question. Specifically, we show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can reproduce the main results obtained with weak-constraint 4D-Var in the operational configuration of the IFS model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We show that the use of ANN models inside the weak-constraint 4D-Var framework has the potential to extend the applicability of the weak-constraint methodology for model error correction to the whole atmospheric column. Finally, we discuss the potential and limitations of the machine learning/deep learning technologies in the core NWP tasks. In particular, we reconsider the fundamental constraints of a purely data-driven approach to forecasting and provide a view on how to best integrate machine learning technologies within current data assimilation and forecasting methods.","[Bonavita, Massimo; Laloyaux, Patrick] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Bonavita, M (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England.",massimo.bonavita@ecmwf.int,,"Bonavita, Massimo/0000-0002-0392-284X",,,,,41,30,31,10,29,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,1942-2466,,J ADV MODEL EARTH SY,J.

Many deciduous fruit, flowers, and vegetables are native to Iran (Persia), and from there, they were distributed to the rest of the world through the Silk Road established by the Achaemenid, the Royal Pars Dynasty. Variations in climate and presence of numerous mountains, lakes, rivers, and natural springs have created a unique country capable of producing all types of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Apples and other deciduous fruits are commercially produced in mountain ranges of Alborz and Zagrous and in many central provinces of Iran. The Caspian Sea area in the north of Iran is one of the most unique regions in the world where mild Mediterranean climate meshed with the adjacent Alborz mountain ranges has created a home to numerous species of edible horticultural plants, ranging from tea to cherries and pomegranates. Pistachio, olive, citrus, banana, and date are produced in Kerman, Fars, and Khuzestan regions. However, the Iranian horticultural industry faces many challenges, including global and regional political issues. Although some attempt has been made to preserve invaluable germplasm, a large number of native fruits, vegetables, and flowers are becoming extinct. Postharvest transportation and storage of horticultural crops is one of the most important issues facing Iranian horticulture. The future of horticulture in Iran can potentially be bright, and horticultural products have the potential to replace the oil income after reserves disappear, particularly if peace prevails in the region.","[Fallahi, Esmaeil] Univ Idaho, Parma Res & Extens Ctr, 29603 U 1 Lane, Parma, ID 83660 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Fallahi, E (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Parma Res & Extens Ctr, 29603 U 1 Lane, Parma, ID 83660 USA.",efallahi@uidaho.edu,,,,,,,3,7,8,0,8,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,SEP,2017,9,,,,1145,1147,,10.21273/HORTSCI12080-17,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI12080-17,,,3,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FJ8MH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000413021400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the last decade, many studies were focused on characterization of chemical and physical properties as well as source apportionment of atmospheric aerosols, which have made substantial implications for aerosol-induced air pollution and climate mitigation. Instrumental measurement techniques provide one of the most direct and effective ways to determine aerosol physicochemical characterization and thereby to constrain aerosol modeling. The Aerodyne soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), a state-of-the-art instrument, combines the advantages of both high-resolution time-of-flight AMS (HR-ToF-AMS) and single particle soot photometer (SP2). It can measure high-resolution chemical composition, size distribution, and mixing state of both non-refractory and refractory aerosol particles. Specially, chemical-resolved coating materials of refractory black carbon-containing particles can be quantified by SP-AMS. Moreover, same as HR-ToF-AMS, highly time-resolved organic mass spectral data can be applied for further identification and quantification of organic aerosol sources with receptor models, such as positive matrix factorization (PMF). This review summarizes results and findings obtained by recent SP-AMS measurements in field observations and laboratory studies. These SP-AMS measurements mainly cover the topics of soot cluster ions, trace metals, chemical composition and sources of non-refractory bulk aerosols, mixing state, and light absorption properties of black carbon-containing particles. Finally, we propose some potential prospects for future studies by using the SP-AMS.","[Zhang, Yunjiang; Wang, Junfeng; Cui, Shijie; Ge, Xinlei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Dan Dan] Shanghai Acad Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Format & Prevent U, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Ge, XL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",caxinra@163.com,"Ge, Xinlei/F-5672-2010; Wang, Junfeng/Y-7794-2018","Ge, Xinlei/0000-0001-9531-6478; Wang, Junfeng/0000-0001-6215-1953",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0213802]; National Science Foundation of China [21777073],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFC0213802) and the National Science Foundation of China (21777073).,,89,6,6,23,90,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6592,,,CURR POLLUT REP,Curr.

In relation with climate change, more frequent floods, of higher intensity, can be expected due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The objective of this review paper is to address the many ways in which geosynthetics contribute to sustainable construction of dykes and thus to water systems management. This review paper, prepared by the four Technical Committees and the Sustainability Committee of the International Geosynthetics Society, briefly describes geosynthetics and their function, dykes and dyke failure modes, before presenting the main focus of the use of geosynthetics for the design and construction of durable dykes to ensure the protection of life and infrastructure. The optimization of dyke construction with geosynthetics to increase their resilience not only results in performance advantages, but also in economic advantages. The way geosynthetics can contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions for a sustainable river management is discussed. This is done not only by allowing more economic construction methods to be implemented, but also solutions with increased resilience to face the extreme stresses related to climate change, while at the same time bringing about a positive contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the construction process itself. Finally, it is shown that by following state of the art standards and design practice any possible risk associated with the use of geosynthetics in dykes can be mitigated.","[Shamrock, Jonathan] Tonkin & Taylor Ltd, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Kawalec, Jacek] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Rd, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland; [Touze, Nathalie] Univ Paris Saclay, SDAR, INRAE, F-78352 Jouy En Josas, France",Silesian University of Technology; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Touze, N (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, SDAR, INRAE, F-78352 Jouy En Josas, France.",pietro.rimoldi@gmail.com; jshamrock@tonkintaylor.co.nz; jacek.kawalec@polsl.pl; nathalie.touze@inrae.fr,"Kawalec, Jacek/AAG-5614-2020; Touze, Nathalie/K-9694-2015","Kawalec, Jacek/0000-0002-8492-9620; Touze, Nathalie/0000-0002-0696-0091",,,,,64,1,1,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,8,,,,,,4445,10.3390/su13084445,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13084445,,,31,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RU7ZP,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000645361900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper introduces the psychological construct of nature connectedness as a measurable target for improving the human-nature relationship, and therefore helping tackle the warming climate and loss of wildlife. The 'pathways to nature connectedness' (sensory contact, emotion, meaning, beauty and compassion) provide an important and flexible framework to help improve the human-nature relationship. Research evidence and practical examples are given from organisations using the pathways (e.g. National Trust, Wildlife Trusts, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust). This illustrates how the pathways provide a new methodological approach for improving human-nature relationships. A systems perspective is taken to consider wider application of the pathways framework. The societal relevance of the pathways approach is proposed, and the application of nature connectedness is considered across a range of leverage points relevant across multiple societal scales (from individuals to societies). Recommendations are given for specific pathways informed interventions to improve the human-nature relationship. These interventions focus on cultural programmes and urban design to increase sensory, meaningful and emotional engagement with nature. The interventions based on the pathways framework engage with leverage points around system goals, design, feedback and parameters across policy areas such as education, health, housing, arts, health and transport. Showing to read This shows that the pathways to nature connectedness have a large scale of societal relevance and the potential to provide solutions across a range of leverage points to foster closer human-nature relationships across society.","[Richardson, M.; Lumber, R.] Univ Derby, Human Sci Res Ctr, Derby, England; [Dobson, J.] Urban Pollinators Ltd, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Abson, D.

All field crops are affected by drought. Global warming and climate change are expected to exacerbate this phenomenon. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) ranks fourth among cereals after wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.). Drought is a significant issue in barley breeding programs. The purpose of this chapter is to review pertinent literature on general drought-tolerance mechanisms in important field crops and provide the latest state-of-the-art information on drought-coping mechanisms in barley, including molecular basis of crop response in moisture-limited environments. We highlight research insights, existing gaps, and future research directions regarding drought tolerance in barley. Known quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes, such as Dhn and DREB, and their use in marker-assisted selection for drought tolerance are summarized. Traits associated with improved performance (early vigor, plant height, spike waxiness, and thousand-grain weight) under low-moisture stress environments have been identified as useful criteria in breeding for drought-tolerant barley.

Latest innovations in genome-editing technology, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (CRISPR-Cpf1), and multiplexed accurate genome editing with short, trackable, integrated cellular barcodes (MAGESTIC), should be useful for plant breeders in modifying the barley genome, as needed, to develop drought-tolerant cultivars.","[Kebede, Amare] Haramaya Univ, Sch Plant Sci, Genet & Plant Breeding Program, Haramaya, Ethiopia; [Kang, Manjit S.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Throckmorton Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Bekele, Endashaw] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Microbial Cellular & Mol Biol, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Kansas State University; Addis Ababa University,"Kang, MS (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Throckmorton Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",manjit675264@gmail.com,"Birke, Amare Kebede/AAK-6166-2020","Birke, Amare Kebede/0000-0001-6570-2482",,,,,234,25,25,3,52,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"125 LONDON WALL, LONDON EC2Y 5AS, ENGLAND",0065-2113,2213-6789,978-0-12-817598-9,ADV AGRON,Adv.

In contrast to remote sensing technologies where measurements are made from large distances (e.g. satellite imagery, aerial photography, airborne radiometric surveys), ESNs focus on measurements that are made in close proximity to the target environmental phenomenon. Sensors can be used to collect a much larger number of measurements, which are quantitative and repeatable. They can also be deployed in locations that may otherwise be difficult to visit regularly. Sensors that are commonly used in the environmental sciences include ground-based multispectral vegetation sensors, soil moisture sensors, GPS tracking and bioacoustics for tracking movement in wild and domesticated animals. Sensors may also be coupled with wireless networks to more effectively capture, synthesise and transmit data to decision-makers. The climate and weather monitoring domains provide useful examples of how ESNs can provide real-time monitoring of environmental change (e.g. temperature, rainfall, sea-surface temperature) to many users. The objective of this review is to examine state-of-the-art use of ESNs for three environmental monitoring domains: (a) terrestrial vegetation, (b) animal movement and diversity, and (c) soil. Climate and aquatic monitoring sensor applications are so extensive that they are beyond the scope of this review. In each of the three application domains (vegetation, animals and soils) we review the technologies, the attributes that they sense and briefly examine the technical limitations. We conclude with a discussion of future directions. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Gibbons, P.

Yet, whether smart factories affect the environmental performance remains unknown. In this article, we examine the environmental performance of a smart refrigerator factory by comparing the environmental impacts of its product to a similar model that is produced in a traditional fashion. This article quantifies and verifies the theoretically predicted impacts of this smart factory on the individual processes. Though the overall differences in the two models are quite minor, we find that this smart factory can notably reduce the values of most impact categories associated with the parts and refrigerator production; the reduction in the value of climate change is 33%. Owing to higher material efficiency-raw material savings in this smart factory contributes to the greatest reductions in most categorized impacts-the contribution to the reduction of climate change is 39%. Yet, all categorized impacts of procurement and delivery are increased due to product personalization and direct delivery. The results of sensitivity analysis show that promoting product modularity, adopting clean energy such as wind power can further improve the environmental performance of the selected refrigerator. The introduction of auxiliary equipment and systems slightly increases the value of each category; yet their impacts are negligible compared to their benefits as facilitating production efficiency. Based on the quantitative results, recommendations are given to improve the environmental performance of smart factory, including optimizing current strategies and promoting horizontal and end-to-end integration.","[Zhang, Wujie; Gu, Fu] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Fluid Power & Mechatron Syst, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wujie; Gu, Fu] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gu, Fu] Zhejiang Univ, Natl Inst Innovat Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jianfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jianfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Gu, F (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Zheda Rd 38, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gufu@zju.edu.cn,,"Gu, Fu/0000-0003-3062-1935","Chinese Key Research Plan Project [2017YFB1400302]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71832013, 71671180, 71834006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018QNA4007]",Chinese Key Research Plan Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work is financially supported by Chinese Key Research Plan Project (no. 2017YFB1400302), National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 71832013, 71671180, and 71834006), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (no. 2018QNA4007).",,64,14,14,5,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

This technology could be significantly operated with renewable energy sources. The current study comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art atmo-spheric water harvesters and their desiccant materials. Firstly, a detailed survey on desiccant materials, silica gel, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), hydrogels, zeolite, hygroscopic salts and composite desiccant materials is illustrated. The review particularly focuses on the materials adsorption capability, kinetics, proper matching with climate conditions. Moreover, the most suitable adsorbents are thoroughly surveyed for a wide range of climate conditions, especially for water scarcity regions (i.e., arid zones) that are characterized by low relative pressures. Moreover, various designs of solar-powered atmospheric water harvesters are comparatively summarized, including fixed and portable installations. It can be concluded that MOF-801, MOF-808, MOF-841, HKUST-1, and CPO-27(Ni) have a superior potential for water harvesting in arid areas. Additionally, MIL-101(Cr) has superior water uptake and kinetic at high relative pressure (i.e., humid areas), and it is irrelevant for water harvesting at dry zones. It is found that the cost of the collected water from atmospheric water harvesting technology is about 0.062-0.86 $/kg of adsorbent. This work provides beneficial perspectives for selecting the most relevant desiccant materials beside the appropriate solar system for water harvesting applications.

This is because geomorphological processes are influenced by climate, and geomorphology in turn strongly controls land surface hydrology and ecosystems. This review assesses the current status of geomorphology in South Africa. Six subfields are identified, viz. fluvial geomorphology, glacial and periglacial geomorphology, rock weathering, arid and semi- arid geomorphology, coastal and estuarine geomorphology, and applied geomorphology. The status of each is critically assessed. Studies in the different subfields reveal progress not only at the site-scale, but that such studies are also commonly set within a wider regional to global context. Regional research is well connected to contemporary global debates. Two of these debates are of particular significance. Firstly, cosmogenic dating techniques can be used to evaluate the age of land surfaces. Geomorphological research in South Africa has begun to utilize this technique to this end. Secondly, geomorphological knowledge can be practically applied. This includes fluvial geomorphology ( managing the dynamics of river and wetland systems), rock weathering ( preservation of San art and monuments), and coastal and estuarine geomorphology ( understanding coastal responses to global sea-level rise) as well as broader environmental management issues. Geomorphology and geomorphological processes are critically important to issues impacting on South Africa in the twenty-first century. These include climate and environmental change, food and water security, and sustainable abiotic resource conservation and management. South African geomorphologists and their international collaborators can, and should, be at the heart of many of these contemporary debates.","[Holmes, Peter J.] Univ Free State, Dept Geog, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Grab, Stefan W.; Knight, Jasper] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of the Free State; University of Witwatersrand,"Holmes, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Geog, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",holmespj@ufs.ac.za,"Knight, Jasper/F-2288-2010","Knight, Jasper/0000-0003-2035-9056; Holmes, Peter/0000-0002-7828-5267",,,,,84,4,4,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0373-6245,2151-2418,,S AFR GEOGR J,S.

New Zealand enjoys an international reputation as being a clean and green country. Yet surface appearances can be deceptive. Image frequently trumps reality. The green label is largely an exercise in branding (the country is the latest recipient of the Fossil Award''), although energy is one of the areas where this might not hold. New Zealand's energy supply mix is impressive, the majority of it being drawn from renewable sources. However, global warming will severely impact upon our ability to generate adequate amounts of electrical power in a sustainable manner, and our centralised corporate-dominated supply system is poorly placed to deal with the challenges that lie ahead. These issues are compounded by various political problems such as ownership of resources and access to the grid. Numerous questions arise: can water be commodified or is it held in common? Does it properly belong to the indigenous people of this country? Why is there no feed-in tariff and why are smart meters not being installed? To explore the topic of renewable energy governance we examine various components of the national energy culture, energy policies and resources. We then look at the likely impacts of climate change, the current state of the deregulated electricity supply industry and why the business as usual'' model is set to prevail. This is illustrated by reference to two case studies-of the potential for distributed generation to contribute towards future electricity demands in Auckland and the proposed district energy system in Christchurch-in both cases we identify a worrying reluctance for resilience.","[Byrd, Hugh] Lincoln Univ, Fac Art Architecture & Design, Lincoln, England; [Matthewman, Steve] Univ Auckland, Fac Arts, Grafton, New Zealand",University of Lincoln; University of Auckland,"Byrd, H (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Fac Art Architecture & Design, Lincoln, England.",hbyrd@lincoln.ac.uk; s.matthewman@auckland.ac.nz,"Matthewman, Steve/K-9797-2019","Matthewman, Steven/0000-0002-7497-5877; Byrd, Hugh/0000-0002-4581-1523",,,,,52,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2195-1284,,978-1-4471-5595-9; 978-1-4471-5594-2,LECT N ENERG,,,2013,,,,,137,153,,10.1007/978-1-4471-5595-9_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-5595-9_8,10.1007/978-1-4471-5595-9,,17,Economics; Environmental Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BA8VF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000338776400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

There have been multiple state-of-the-art climate models that were included in Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), but the performance in estimating the ET of the models is still unclear. Thus, this study evaluated the global terrestrial ET of CMIP6 models. The performance of the models and CMIP6 ensemble mean was compared with the GLEAM v3.3a dataset, and the uncertainties of the ensemble were evaluated using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The results show that there was no perfect model that could perform optimally in all aspects of the comparison, and the performance of the CMIP6 ensemble was better than that of a single model. MIROC6, CESM2, and EC-Earth3 performed satisfactorily in some aspects, whereas the performance was poor in other aspects. GFDL-ESM4 exhibited a relatively poor performance. Most models and the CMIP6 ensemble overestimated ET, and the estimations of different models varied greatly, but the results of most models showed an increasing trend. The CMIP6 ensemble overestimated ET in most regions of the world and may have smoothened the variation in the model estimations. In high latitudes such as northern parts of North America and Eurasia, results of the CMIP6 ensemble and GLEAM were approximately the same. The uncertainty of the CMIP6 ensemble was generally low and the estimation reliability varied according to the geographical region.","[Wang, Zhizhen; Zhan, Chesheng; Ning, Like; Guo, Hai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhizhen; Guo, Hai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhan, CS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhancs@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Ning, Like/F-5434-2011","Ning, Like/0000-0002-5017-7467; Zhan, Chesheng/0000-0001-5014-1723",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701023],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2017YFA0603702]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41701023].,,56,17,18,9,79,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

TELIS will utilise state-of-the-art superconducting heterodyne technology and is designed to be a compact, lightweight instrument capable of providing broad spectral coverage, high spectral resolution and long flight duration (similar to24 hours duration during a single flight campaign). The combination of high sensitivity and extensive flight duration will allow evaluation of the diurnal variation of key atmospheric constituents such as OH, HO2, ClO, BrO together will longer lived constituents such as O-3, HCL and N2O. Furthermore, TELIS will share a common balloon platform to that of the MIPAS-B Fourier Transform Spectrometer, developed by the Institute of Meteorology and Climate research of the University of Karlsruhe, Germany. MIPAS-B will provide simultaneous and complementary spectral measurements over an extended spectral range. The combination of the TELIS and MIPAS instruments will provide atmospheric scientists with a very powerful observational tool. TELIS will serve as a testbed for new cryogenic heterodyne detection techniques, and as such it will act as a prelude to future spaceborne instruments planned by the European Space Agency (ESA).","SRON, Natl Inst Space Res, NL-3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Hoogeveen, R (corresponding author), SRON, Natl Inst Space Res, Sorbonnelaan 2, NL-3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Shitov, Sergey V/G-7843-2015; Вакс, Владимир/AAU-8042-2020; Goltsman, Grigory N/A-4189-2014; Koshelets, Valery P/A-6959-2012","Shitov, Sergey V/0000-0002-6496-5157; Koshelets, Valery P/0000-0002-1563-1257",,,,,9,1,1,0,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-5025-1,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2003,,,,,347,355,,10.1117/12.521354,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.521354,,,9,"Engineering, Aerospace; Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BY02A,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000187293600036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model-to-model agreement in projected temperature trends is good, and all CCMs predict continued, global mean cooling of the stratosphere over the next 5 decades, increasing from around 0.25 K/decade at 50 hPa to around 1 K/decade at 1 hPa under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario. In general, the simulated ozone evolution is mainly determined by decreases in halogen concentrations and continued cooling of the global stratosphere due to increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs). Column ozone is projected to increase as stratospheric halogen concentrations return to 1980s levels. Because of ozone increases in the middle and upper stratosphere due to GHG-induced cooling, total ozone averaged over midlatitudes, outside the polar regions, and globally, is projected to increase to 1980 values between 2035 and 2050 and before lowerstratospheric halogen amounts decrease to 1980 values. In the polar regions the CCMs simulate small temperature trends in the first and second half of the 21st century in midwinter. Differences in stratospheric inorganic chlorine (Cl-y) among the CCMs are key to diagnosing the intermodel differences in simulated ozone recovery, in particular in the Antarctic. It is found that there are substantial quantitative differences in the simulated Cly, with the October mean Antarctic Cly peak value varying from less than 2 ppb to over 3.5 ppb in the CCMs, and the date at which the Cly returns to 1980 values varying from before 2030 to after 2050. There is a similar variation in the timing of recovery of Antarctic springtime column ozone back to 1980 values. As most models underestimate peak Cly near 2000, ozone recovery in the Antarctic could occur even later, between 2060 and 2070. In the Arctic the column ozone increase in spring does not follow halogen decreases as closely as in the Antarctic, reaching 1980 values before Arctic halogen amounts decrease to 1980 values and before the Antarctic. None of the CCMs predict future large decreases in the Arctic column ozone. By 2100, total column ozone is projected to be substantially above 1980 values in all regions except in the tropics.","Deutsches Zent Luft & Raunfahrt, Inst Atmospher Phys, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Lauder, New Zealand; San Jose State Univ, Dept Meteorol, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; York Univ, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge, England; Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; Met Off Climate Res Div, Exeter, Devon, England; Univ Leeds, Inst Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD USA; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Fis, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Environm Canada, Atomospher Environm Serv, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; World Radiat Ctr, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci ETHZ, Phys Meteorol Observ, Davos, Switzerland; ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Victoria, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Meteorol Serv Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON, Canada",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Johns Hopkins University; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; California State University System; San Jose State University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; York University - Canada; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Cambridge; Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Leeds; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Science Systems and Applications Inc; Max Planck Society; University of L'Aquila; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); Meteorological Service of Canada; University of Victoria; University of Toronto,"Eyring, V (corresponding author), Deutsches Zent Luft & Raunfahrt, Inst Atmospher Phys, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",veronika.eyring@dlr.de,"Rozanov, Eugene/A-9857-2012; Eyring, Veronika/O-9999-2016; Gettelman, Andrew/AAY-2312-2021; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016; Pawson, Steven/I-1865-2014; Pitari, Giovanni/O-7458-2016; Manzini, Elisa/H-5760-2011; Waugh, Darryn W/K-3688-2016; Marsh, Daniel/A-8406-2008; Stolarski, Richard/B-8499-2013; Chipperfield, Martyn/H-6359-2013; Rozanov, Eugene/V-1881-2018; Newman, Paul/D-6208-2012; Akiyoshi, Hideharu/H-8170-2018","Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488; Eyring, Veronika/0000-0002-6887-4885; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Pawson, Steven/0000-0003-0200-717X; Pitari, Giovanni/0000-0001-7051-9578; Waugh, Darryn W/0000-0001-7692-2798; Marsh, Daniel/0000-0001-6699-494X; Stolarski, Richard/0000-0001-8722-4012; Chipperfield, Martyn/0000-0002-6803-4149; Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488; Newman, Paul/0000-0003-1139-2508; Mancini, Eva/0000-0001-7071-0292; Giorgetta, Marco/0000-0002-4278-1963; Akiyoshi, Hideharu/0000-0001-6463-9004; Dameris, Martin/0000-0001-6700-0628; Deushi, Makoto/0000-0002-0373-3918","Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009, NE/C003969/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,79,258,268,1,58,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

In the transition to a carbon-neutral society, steps must be defined towards achieving cleaner production and utilisation of NG and towards post-combustion carbon capture to create a completely closed carbon cycle. Methane produced using renewable energy sources is a sustainable substitute for NG and is crucial to accelerating the penetration of the current energy infrastructure by renewables. Supported by existing gas transportation networks, renewable methane (RM) is both an energy storage medium and an advanced fuel that can be used in areas that are considered difficult to electrify. The present article is a state-of-the-art review of RM and a range of clean technologies from production to end-use and carbon capture, which are necessary to minimise lifecycle carbon emissions. The techno-economics and challenges of replacing NG with RM are emphasised. The focal research points for a future RM economy with respect to systems design are highlighted, and the novel renewable-powered technologies that are required to promote net-zero emissions are summarised. Although employing RM is not economically feasible, trends towards carbon emission limitations, carbon taxes, and renewables subsidies will make RM cost-competitive with NG. In view of the state-of-the-art technologies, future research is expected to develop energy- and cost-effective production and utilisation solutions for enhancing the feasibility of RM.","[Qi, Meng; Moon, Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Liu, Yi] China Univ Petr East China, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [He, Tianbiao] China Univ Petr East China, Coll Pipeline & Civil Engn, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China; [Yin, Liang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Refrigerat & Cryogen, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Shu, Chi-Min] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Safety Hlth & Environm Engn, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan",Yonsei University; China University of Petroleum; China University of Petroleum; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Moon, I (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Seoul 03722, South Korea.;Shu, CM (corresponding author), Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Safety Hlth & Environm Engn, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan.",shucm@yuntech.edu.tw; ilmoon@yonsei.ac.kr,"He, Tianbiao/E-4348-2019","He, Tianbiao/0000-0002-5973-9964; Qi, Meng/0000-0002-7323-6773",BK 21 Program - Korean Ministry of Education; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFB4000905],"BK 21 Program - Korean Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Key Research and Development Program of China",This work was supported by the BK 21 Program funded by the Korean Ministry of Education and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFB4000905).,,371,2,2,24,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,1-Nov,2022,,,,,,,125130,10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125130,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125130,,,34,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,3K6FG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000834169900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these interpretations conflict as to the location of wetlands, magnitude of emissions, and the environmental controls on methane oxidation. The flux of other reactive trace gases to the atmosphere also controls apparent atmospheric methane concentrations because these compounds compete for the hydroxyl radical ( OH), which is the primary atmospheric sink for methane. In a series of linked biosphere-atmosphere chemistry-climate modeling experiments, we simulate the methane and biogenic volatile organic compound emissions from the terrestrial biosphere from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. Using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model, we simulate the atmospheric concentrations of methane, OH, and other reactive trace gas species. Over the past 21,000 years, methane emissions from wetlands increased slightly to the end of the Pleistocene but then decreased again, reaching levels at the preindustrial Holocene that were similar to the LGM. Global wetland area decreased by 14% from LGM to the preindustrial time. Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), however, nearly doubled over the same period of time. Atmospheric OH burdens and methane concentrations were affected by this major change in BVOC emissions, with methane lifetimes increasing by more than 2 years from LGM to the present. We simulate a change in methane concentration of similar to 385 ppb, accounting for 88% of the similar to 440 ppb increase in methane concentrations observed in ice cores. Thus glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric methane concentrations would have been modulated by BVOC emissions. In addition, the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations since the mid-Holocene is partly caused in our results by the increases in anthropogenic methane emissions over this period. While the interplay between BVOC and wetland methane emissions since the LGM cannot explain the entire record of ice core methane concentrations, consideration of BVOC source dynamics is central to understanding ice core methane. Rapid changes in atmospheric methane concentrations, also observed in ice cores, require further study.","Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; CENS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",University of Bern; University of Victoria; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Kaplan, JO (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",jed.kaplan@ips.unibe.ch; gerd.folberth@ec.gc.ca; didier.hauglustaine@cea.fr,"Hauglustaine, Didier/A-4154-2012; Kaplan, Jed O./P-1796-2015; Folberth, Gerd A./F-7376-2010","Hauglustaine, Didier/0000-0002-4826-5118; Kaplan, Jed O./0000-0001-9919-7613; Folberth, Gerd A./0000-0002-1075-440X",,,,,83,91,92,3,45,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,1944-9224,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

This paper examines three aspects of the book's environmentally inflected realism in more detail. In response to Adam Trexler's account of Anthropocene fiction, it begins by examining Lerner's expansive representation of global commodities and planetary memorials. Turning from objects to subjects, the paper subsequently enlists Roland Barthes's late work on reference to describe Lerner's attention to weird weather and its destabilising effects on our bodies and epiphanies. The analysis concludes with a discussion of the social infrastructure underlying the circulation of objects and subjects, highlighting the novel's emphasis on the community-building as well as resource-depleting dimensions of our petromodernity. Via these three steps, the paper demonstrates, first, the importance of a newly expansive mode of cultural memory, related to capitalism, weather and energy, and second, that not just science fiction but also modified forms of realism may play an important role in cultural responses to climate change.","[De Bruyn, Ben] Maastricht Univ, Dept Literature & Art, Fac Social Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"De Bruyn, B (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Dept Literature & Art, Fac Social Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands.",b.debruyn@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,35,12,12,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-236X,1470-1308,,TEXTUAL PRACT,Textual Pract.,,2017,5,,,,951,971,,10.1080/0950236X.2017.1323490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0950236X.2017.1323490,,,21,Literature,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Literature,EY2FP,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000403784300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focal point was highly urbanised historic areas. The research was conducted in Krakow, the second-largest city in Poland, the development of which has been inherently entwined with the local fluvial network. Material and methods Historical analyses helped demonstrate that the fluvial network of Krakow is an interesting albeit forgotten part of its heritage, often obscured by the traditional, rich cultural heritage of the city. Not only did the fluvial network play an essential role in the growth of the city, but it has also been part of the every-day life of its citizens and an increasingly important factor in improving the quality of life. Still, the flood risk it entails is aggravated by climate change. We analysed modem trends regarding the adaptation of cities to climate change and global NBS. We employed an in-depth map analysis to identify zones in the city where NBS has to be improved. The next step was to locate and characterise NBS components in the city with in situ studies. Results and conclusions The results suggest that the awareness of city administration and residents regarding preventing the negative effects of climate change has grown. Nevertheless, it is necessary to conduct integrated interdisciplinary activities in order to prepare Krakow for the changes to come and improve the quality of space and life while emphasising its heritage. The paper found justification for the integration and development of green and blue projects in Krakow.","[Olczak, Barbara] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Ornamental Plants & Garden Art, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Wilkosz-Mamcarczyk, Magdalena] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Land Management & Landscape Architecture, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Sosnova, Nadiya] Lviv Polytech Natl Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Lvov, Ukraine",Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv Polytech National University,"Olczak, B (corresponding author), Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Ornamental Plants & Garden Art, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",barbara.olczak@urk.edu.pl,"Olczak, Barbara/AEX-2401-2022","Olczak, Barbara/0000-0002-9070-9640",,,,,17,0,0,1,5,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU ROLNICZEGO HUGONA KOLLATAJA KRAKOWIE,KRAKOW,"AL 29 LISTOPADA 46, KRAKOW, 31425, POLAND",1644-0765,,,ACTA SCI POL-FORM C,Acta Sci.

For scientific cultivation of this species across China, we identified the key climatic factors and explored climatically suitable habitat in order to maximize survival of Chinese sea buckthorn using MaxEnt and GIS tools, based on 98 occurrence records from herbarium and publications and 13 climatic factors from Bioclim, Holdridge life zone and Kria' index variables. Our simulation showed that the MaxEnt model performance was significantly better than random, with an average test AUC value of 0.93 with 10-fold cross validation. A jackknife test and the regularized gain change, which were applied to the training algorithm, showed that precipitation of the driest month (PDM), annual precipitation (AP), coldness index (CI) and annual range of temperature (ART) were the most influential climatic factors in limiting the distribution of Chinese sea buckthorn, which explained 70.1% of the variation. The predicted map showed that the core of climatically suitable habitat was distributed from the southwest to northwest of Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, where the most influential climate variables were PDM of 1.0-7.0 mm, AP of 344.0-1089.0 mm, CI of -47.7-0.0 degrees C, and ART of 26.1-45.0 degrees C.

Due to large uncertainties in all of the geosciences data and in their modeling, multiple model interpretations are often possible. This leads to disagreements among the experts, which in the past has led to disagreement on the selection of a ground motion for design at a given site. This paper reports on a project, co-sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Electric Power Research Institute, that was undertaken to review the state-of-the-art and improve on the overall stability of the PSHA process, by providing methodological guidance or! how to perform a PSHA. The project reviewed past studies and examined ways to improve on the present state-of-the-art. In analyzing past PSHA studies, the most important conclusion is that differences in PSHA results are commonly due to process rather than technical differences. Thus, the project concentrated heavily on developing process recommendations, especially on the use of multiple experts, and this paper reports on those process recommendations. The problem of facilitating and integrating the judgments of a diverse group of experts is analyzed in detail. The authors believe that the concepts and process principles apply just as well to non-earthquake fields such as volcanic hazard, flood risk, nuclear-plant safety, and climate change.","Future Resources Associates Inc, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Pacific Gas & Elect Co, San Francisco, CA USA; Geomatrix, San Francisco, CA USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Stanford University,"Budnitz, RJ (corresponding author), Future Resources Associates Inc, 2039 Shattuck Ave,Suite 402, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",,"Boore, David/GWQ-6027-2022",,,,,,18,69,70,1,6,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0272-4332,,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,AUG,1998,4,,,,463,469,,10.1111/j.1539-6924.1998.tb00361.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.1998.tb00361.x,,,7,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",126GD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000076284000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a satellite-based characterization of snowfall in the Arctic using CloudSat observations, and compare it with various other climatologies. First, we examine the frequency and phase of precipitation as well as the snowfall rates from CloudSat over 2007-10. Frequency of solid precipitation is higher than 70% over the Arctic Ocean and 95% over Greenland, while mixed precipitation occurs mainly over North Atlantic (50%) and liquid precipitation over land south of 70 degrees N (40%). Intense mean snowfall rates are located over Greenland, the Barents Sea, and the Alaska range (>500 mm yr(-1)), and maxima are located over the southeast coast of Greenland (up to 2000 mm yr(-1)). Then we compare snowfall rates with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim, herein ERA-I) and Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR). Similar general geographical patterns are observed in all datasets, such as the high snowfall rates along the North Atlantic storm track. Yet, there are significant mean snowfall rate differences over the Arctic between 58 degrees and 82 degrees N between ERA-I (153 mm yr(-1)), ASR version 1 (206 mm yr(-1)), ASR version 2 (174 mm yr(-1)), and CloudSat (183 mm yr(-1)). Snowfall rates and differences are larger over Greenland. Phase attribution is likely to be a significant source of snowfall rate differences, especially regarding ERA-I underestimation.

Use of urban greenery has been proposed as a mechanism for micro climate regulation. In this study, the microclimatic effect of urban trees was investigated in the context of high-density cities in subtropical hot and humid climates. Measurements were conducted in urban areas with sky view factors (SVF) ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, and mean radiant temperatures were calculated. The measurements show that the effects of urban trees are related to SVF and that the impact of building morphology is more evident under cloudy conditions than under sunny conditions. In heavily built-up areas, the mean radiant temperature (T-mrt) was reduced to a comfortable level (33 degrees C) by roadside trees in the early afternoon. Simulation results indicate that roadside trees reduce the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) to 29 degrees C in urban areas with SVFs of 0.2 under cloudy conditions. The SVF-oriented planning method was tested using the existing building geometry of two high-density districts of Hong Kong, Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po, and site-specific design strategies for tree planting were developed. The study results show that a comfortable microclimate can be provided by roadside trees in heavily built-up urban environments in subtropical cities for nearly 70% of the summer. Design suggestions for refining the Green Master Plans of Hong Kong in future planning are provided. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates of radiative forcing due to ACI in Fifth Assessment Report range from -0.5 to -2.5 W m(-2). A portion of this uncertainty is related to the first indirect, or Twomey, effect whereby aerosols act as nuclei for cloud droplets to condense upon. At constant liquid water content this increases the number of cloud droplets (Nd) and thus increases the cloud albedo. In this study we use remote-sensing estimates of Nd within stratocumulus regions in combination with state-of-the-art aerosol reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) to diagnose how aerosols affect Nd. As in previous studies, Nd is related to sulfate mass through a power law relationship. The slope of the log-log relationship between Nd and SO4 in maritime stratocumulus is found to be 0.31, which is similar to the range of 0.2-0.8 from previous in situ studies and remote-sensing studies in the pristine Southern Ocean. Using preindustrial emissions models, the change in Nd between preindustrial and present day is estimated. Nd is inferred to have more than tripled in some regions. Cloud properties from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate the radiative forcing due to this change in Nd. The Twomey effect operating in isolation is estimated to create a radiative forcing of -0.97 +/- 0.23 W m(-2) relative to the preindustrial era.","[Mccoy, D. T.; Mohrmann, J. K. C.; Hartmann, D.

Additionally, the results showed that the subjects undergoing leeward wind direction revealed lower sensitivity to wind speed (WS), PET, and UTCI variations, and showed lower neutral and preferred temperatures/WS, and felt thermally acceptable in a wider gap. The results also disclosed that conducting the surveys neglecting the effects of WD may lead to a complete misunderstanding of the climate.

The aim was to determine the accuracy of combining BEMs and palaeoecological data to predict continental-scale changes in distribution, and the availability of fossil data to hindcast economically important species. Location Europe, 11 degrees W33 degrees E, 3372 degrees N. Methods Eight types of BEMs were implemented in this study, covering most state-of-the-art modelling techniques. Present and palaeoclimatic data were obtained from the atmosphereocean global circulation model ECHO-G. The last millennium was divided into three climatically distinct periods: the MWP (ad 9001300), the LIA (ad 16001850) and PRES (ad 19002000). Models were calibrated for each period and validated with climatic and pollen data from the remaining periods. Successfully validated models were projected onto a 1 degrees European grid. Results BEMs were successfully validated with independent data. The average area under the curve statistic showed strong model performance, indicating: (1) the strength of BEMs for modelling current and future distributions and, (2) the potential of fossil pollen records to undertake these approaches. European-scale 1 degrees- gridded maps of probability of occurrence largely agreed with observed 20th-century distributions for most taxa, allowing the construction of past modelled species distributions. Main conclusions Results suggest a high potential for BEMs to be used to model future species distributions, and highlight the importance of palaeoecological data to independently validate these models, taking into account the scales at which these data operate. Although valid, BEMs showed poorer performance with heavily managed species and/or those growing in heterogeneous terrain or with discontinuous distributions. The last millennium in Europe was characterized by an increase in woody crop species and a decline of forest species, suggesting increasing land use by humans.","[Macias-Fauria, Marc; Willis, Katherine J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Long Term Ecol Lab, Biodivers Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Willis, Katherine J.] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway",University of Oxford; University of Bergen,"Macias-Fauria, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Long Term Ecol Lab, Biodivers Inst, Tinbergen Bldg,S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",marc.maciasfauria@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Macias-Fauria, Marc/A-4591-2009","Macias-Fauria, Marc/0000-0002-8438-2223; Willis, Katherine/0000-0002-6763-2489",Marie Curie Research Fellowship [254206],Marie Curie Research Fellowship(European Commission),"M.M.-F. was funded by a Marie Curie Research Fellowship during the completion of this study (grant agreement number 254206, project 'ECOCHANGE: Creating conditions for persistence of biodiversity in the face of climate change').

Various reviews have extensively discussed the thermophysical properties of PCMs and their energy-saving potential in buildings. However, comprehensive reviews on the indoor thermal/personal comfort behavior of PCMs under different climates remain limited. Therefore, this study aims to present a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the impact of PCMs on indoor thermal comfort levels in buildings located in cities within different subclimate zones and their personal cooling effect when integrated with clothing (vest). In addition, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potentials and indoor air pollutant emission properties of PCM-enhanced buildings were also reviewed. Hundreds of published articles of PCMs in PubMed and Scopus databases, including a manual search approach, were utilized. The results from this state-of-the-art study have shown that incorporating PCMs in buildings satisfactorily reduced the indoor air temperature of most buildings located in hot climate (BSh, BWh) zones, but very limited studies have been performed in the cold (Dfc, BSk) environments. In general, there was an improvement in the thermal comfort levels of the PCM-enhanced buildings. However, these were mostly assessed using indices such as predicted mean vote, predicted percentage of dissatisfied, comfort index, and total discomfort change, without any comprehensive survey studies (eg, based on sensation votes) using human subjects. The majority of personal cooling studies of PCM-integrated vests/garments showed good improvement in thermal comfort, especially in terms of skin temperature and thermal sensation. However, very few studies have shown a considerable reduction in the GHG emissions of PCM-enhanced buildings, and the knowledge of the long-term carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction capabilities of PCMs is limited. The profiling of PCMs revealed the presence of volatile organic compounds. However, studies on indoor air pollutant emissions and the potential health effects of PCM-integrated buildings are still lacking. The study is crucial to motivating green building engineers, indoor environmental quality (IEQ) researchers, and epidemiologists to embark on potential future research. Innovative technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, uncertainty analysis, and optimization can be utilized to predict thermal comfort, IEQ, and GHG emissions in PCM-incorporated buildings.","[Amoatey, Patrick; Al-Jabri, Khalifa; Al-Saadi, Saleh] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 33, Muscat 123, Oman; [Amoatey, Patrick] Univ Queensland, Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Sultan Qaboos University; University of Queensland,"Al-Jabri, K (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 33, Muscat 123, Oman.",aljabri@squ.edu.om,"Al-Saadi, Saleh/N-6364-2016","Al-Saadi, Saleh/0000-0002-9095-6983",Sultan Qaboos University [CR/ENG/CAED/18/07],Sultan Qaboos University,"Sultan Qaboos University, Grant/Award Number: #CR/ENG/CAED/18/07",,201,0,0,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Herein, fabrication and testing of a freeze-resistant, multifunctional quasi-solid-state zinc-sulfur battery (ZnS) are reported. To this end, an electrostatic spray coating technique was used to deposit a thin layer of sulfur on the highly porous, unidirectional activated carbon nanofibers (A-CNFs) as a load-bearing cathode. This technique could fill micro-and mesopores, and microsized channels with sulfur, achieving an extensive sulfur loading of 60 wt %. Several drawbacks of structural energy storage devices (applicability under varied climate conditions, poor electro-chemical performance and mechanical properties) are addressed by initiating an antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte with a failure strain of over 200%. This electrolyte possesses ethylene glycol and an I2 additive as an antifreezing agent and redox mediator, respectively. The as-assembled ZnS battery offers a high energy density of 283 Wh/kg based on the CNF-S cathode (149 Wh/ kg based on the ZnS cell) and mechanical properties beyond state-of-the-art structural energy storage devices with a tensile strength of 377 MPa, Young's modulus of 16.7 GPa, and energy-to-failure of 4.5 MJ/m3. The electrochemomechanical properties of the ZnS battery were also investigated to elucidate the effects of electrochemical energy storage on mechanical properties and vice versa. Overall, the ZnS battery outperforms state-of-the-art structural energy storage devices in terms of energy storage and load-bearing capabilities.","[Amiri, Ahmad; Sellers, Ronald; Polycarpou, Andreas A.] Texas A&M Univ, J Mike Walker 66 Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Naraghi, Mohammad] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Aerosp Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Polycarpou, AA (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, J Mike Walker 66 Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",apolycarpou@tamu.edu,,"Naraghi, Mohammad/0000-0002-1841-7598",J.

Accurate and long-term forecasts of the PDO are therefore crucial for marine governance. This paper presents a novel seasonal gated recurrent unit (SGRU) model, based on deep learning, for forecasting the PDO at multiple time scales. The model first decomposes the complex and nonlinear PDO index time series into three separate components, each retaining a distinct pattern of PDO. Next, a three-pathway GRU model is constructed to model and forecast the PDO index. A test applying the SGRU model to the period from 1979 to 2020 demonstrates its superiority over eight state-of-the-art models in PDO forecasting. Additionally, the SGRU model can flexibly produce high-performance forecasts at multiple time scales. In view of that physical and dynamical models rely on clear evolutionary mechanisms, the SGRU model overcomes the complexities of these models. Plain Language Summary We apply deep learning methods, for the first time, to directly forecast the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index at both monthly and annual time scales. Using a data-driven seasonal gated recurrent unit (SGRU) model, we forecast the PDO index flexibly, without relying on information about the dynamics of the evolution of the PDO. In a comparative test using a data set for the years 1979-2020, the performance of the SGRU model is far superior to that of the state-of-art methods in consecutive forecasting for lead times of 6 months and 3 years.","[Qin, Mengjiao; Du, Zhenhong; Hu, Linshu; Fu, Zhiyi; Wu, Sensen; Zhang, Feng] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Qin, Mengjiao; Du, Zhenhong; Hu, Linshu; Fu, Zhiyi; Wu, Sensen; Zhang, Feng] Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Cao, Wenting] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Qin, Lianjie] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster Minist Edu, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qin, Lianjie] Minist Emergency Management Civil Affairs, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qin, Lianjie] Beijing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Du, ZH (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Du, ZH (corresponding author), Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",duzhenhong@zju.edu.cn,"Wu, Sensen/AAA-2929-2022","Wu, Sensen/0000-0001-9322-0149; Du, Zhenhong/0000-0001-9449-0415; Qin, Lianjie/0000-0002-3581-3752","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41922043, 41871287]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB0505000]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41922043, 41871287) and National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grants 2018YFB0505000.",,37,0,0,14,17,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

One of the most important solutions is sustainable energy technologies. The problem with the state of the art, however, is that production is energy-intensive and non-recyclable waste remains after the useful life. For monocrystalline photovoltaics, for example, there are recycling processes for glass and aluminum, but these must rather be described as downcycling. The semiconductor material is not recycled at all. Another promising technology for sustainable energy generation is dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Although efficiency and long-term stability still need to be improved, the technology has high potential to complement the state of the art. DSSCs have comparatively low production costs and can be manufactured without toxic components. In this work, we present the world' s first experiment to test the recycling potential of non-toxic glass-based DSSCs in a melting test. The glass constituents were analyzed by optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES), and the surface was examined by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). The glass was melted in a furnace and compared to a standard glass recycling process. The results show that the described DSSCs are suitable for glass recycling and thus can potentially circulate in a circular economy without a downcycling process. However, material properties such as chemical resistance, transparency or viscosity are not investigated in this work and need further research.","[Schoden, Fabian; Schnatmann, Anna Katharina; Davies, Emma; Storck, Jan Lukas; Knefelkamp, Doerthe; Schwenzfeier-Hellkamp, Eva] Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany; [Diederich, Dirk] Inst Glas & Rohstofftechnol GmbH, D-37079 Gottingen, Germany; [Blachowicz, Tomasz] Silesian Tech Univ, Ctr Sci & Educ, Inst Phys, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences; Silesian University of Technology,"Schoden, F (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany.",fabian.schoden@fh-bielefeld.de; arena_katharina.schnatmann@fh-bielefeld.de; emma.davies@fh-bielefeld.de; d.diederich@igrgmbh.de; lukas.storck@fh-bielefeld.de; doerthe.knefelkamp@fh-bielefeld.de; tomasz.blachowicz@polsl.pl; eva.schwenzfeier-hellkamp@fh-bielefeld.de,"Schoden, Fabian/AAN-7282-2020","Schoden, Fabian/0000-0002-2481-7141; BLACHOWICZ, Tomasz/0000-0002-6569-124X; Storck, Jan/0000-0002-6841-8791",State of NRW; University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld,State of NRW; University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld,This research was funded by the State of NRW in scope of the project CirQuality OWL.

Free-phase gas (FPG) accumulation and episodic release has recently been recognized as an important mechanism for biogenic gas flux from peatlands. It is likely that gas production and groundwater flow are interconnected in peatlands: groundwater flow influences gas production by regulating geochemical conditions and nutrient supply available for methanogenesis, while FPG influences groundwater flow through a reduction in peat permeability and by creating excess pore water pressures. Water samples collected from three well sites at Caribou Bog, Maine, show substantial dissolved CH4 (5-16 mg L-1) in peat waters below 2 m depth and an increase in concentrations with depth. This suggests production and storage of CH4 in deep peat that may be episodically released as FPG. Two min increment pressure transducer data reveal approximately 5 cm fluctuations in hydraulic head from both deep and shallow peat that are believed to be indicative of FPG release. FPG release persists up to 24 h during decreasing atmospheric pressure and a rising water table. Preferential flow is seen towards an area of relatively lower hydraulic head associated with the esker and pool system. Increased CH4 concentrations are also found at the depth of the esker crest, suggesting that the high permeability esker is acting as a conduit for groundwater flow, driving a downward transport of labile carbon, resulting in higher rates of CH4 production.","[Bon, C.

However, in many cases it is based either on hyperspectral imagery or on multitemporal coverage, both of which are difficult to scale up to large-scale deployment at high spatial resolution. In the present paper, we evaluate the possibility of crop classification based on single images from very high-resolution (VHR) satellite sensors. The main objective of this work is to expose performance difference between state-of-the-art parcel-based smoothing and purely data-driven conditional random field (CRF) smoothing, which is yet unknown. To fulfill this objective, we perform extensive tests with four different classification methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gaussian Mixtures, and Maximum Likelihood) to compute the pixel-wise data term; and we also test two different definitions of the pairwise smoothness term. We have performed a detailed evaluation on different multispectral VHR images (Ikonos, QuickBird, Kompsat-2). The main finding of this study is that pairwise CRF smoothing comes close to the state-of-the-art parcel-based method that requires parcel boundaries (average difference approximate to 2.5%). Our results indicate that a single multispectral (R, G, B, NIR) image is enough to reach satisfactory classification accuracy for six crop classes (corn, pasture, rice, sugar beet, wheat, and tomato) in Mediterranean climate. Overall, it appears that crop mapping using only one-shot VHR imagery taken at the right time may be a viable alternative, especially since high-resolution multitemporal or hyperspectral coverage as well as parcel boundaries are in practice often not available.","[Ozdarici-Ok, Asli; Ok, Ali Ozgun] Nevsehir HBV Univ, Dept Geodesy & Photogrammetry, TR-50300 Nevsehir, Turkey; [Schindler, Konrad] ETH, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Ozdarici-Ok, A (corresponding author), Nevsehir HBV Univ, Dept Geodesy & Photogrammetry, TR-50300 Nevsehir, Turkey.",aozdarici@gmail.com; ozguneo@gmail.com; schindler@geod.baug.ethz.ch,"OK, Asli OZDARICI/M-3050-2013; ok, ali özgün/H-7351-2013","ok, ali özgün/0000-0001-6538-9633; Pauldurai, Jona/0000-0002-7217-0872",OYP [BAP-08-11-DPT2002K120510];  [DAP-2008-07-02-07],OYP(Ministry of National Education - Turkey); ,"The Ikonos and QuickBird images are funded by OYP research project BAP-08-11-DPT2002K120510, and we thank Prof. Dr. Mustafa Turker for his contribution during the collection of reference data of the Ikonos and QuickBird images.

However, longstanding diffculties in predicting important quantities such as organic aerosol formation and oxidant lifetimes indicate that our understanding of atmospheric organic chemistry is fundamentally incomplete, probably due in part to the presence of organic species that are unmeasured using standard analytical techniques. Here we present measurements of a wide range of atmospheric organic compounds-including previously unmeasured species-taken concurrently at a single site (a ponderosa pine forest during summertime) by five state-of-the-art mass spectrometric instruments. The combined data set provides a comprehensive characterization of atmospheric organic carbon, covering a wide range in chemical properties (volatility, oxidation state, and molecular size), and exhibiting no obvious measurement gaps. This enables the first construction of a measurement-based local organic budget, highlighting the high emission, deposition, and oxidation fluxes in this environment. Moreover, previously unmeasured species, including semivolatile and intermediate-volatility organic species (S/IVOCs), account for one-third of the total organic carbon, and (within error) provide closure on both OH reactivity and potential secondary organic aerosol formation.","[Hunter, James F.; Carrasquillo, Anthony J.; Heald, Colette L.; Kroll, Jesse H.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hunter, James F.; Cross, Eben S.] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Day, Douglas A.; Palm, Brett B.; Yatavelli, Reddy L.

The key factor shaping the design is central Florida's hot humid climate and intense solar radiation. Flex house combines the wisdom of vernacular Florida houses with state of the art Zero Energy House technologies (ZEH.) A combined system of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal concentrating panels take advantage of the region's abundant insolation in providing clean renewable energy for the house. Conservation is achieved with state of the art mechanical systems and innovative liquid desiccant dehumidification technology along with highly efficient lighting and appliances. The hybrid nature of the Flex house allows for both an open and closed system to take advantage of the seasonal temperature variation. Central Florida buildings can conserve energy by allowing natural ventilation to take advantage of passive cooling in the mild months of the year and use a closed system to utilize mechanical cooling when temperatures are too high for passive cooling strategies. The building envelope works equally well throughout the year combining an optimum level of insulation, resistance to air infiltration, transparency for daylight, and flexibility that allows for opening and closing of the house. Flex House is designed with a strong connection between interior spaces and the outdoors with carefully placed fenestration and a movable wall system which enables the house to transform in response to the temperature variations throughout the year. The house also addresses the massive heat gain that occurs through the roof, which can generate temperatures in excess of 140 degrees. Flex House incorporates a parasol-like outer structure that shades the roof, walls and courtyard minimizing heat gain through the building envelope. To be implemented on a large scale, ZEH must be affordable for people earning a moderate income. Site built construction is time consuming and wasteful and results in higher costs. Building homes in a controlled environment can reduce material waste, and construction costs while increasing efficiency. Pre-fabricating Flex House minimizes preparation time, waste and safety concerns and maximizes economy, quality control, efficiency and safety during the construction process. This paper is an account of the design and construction of Flex House, a ZEH for central Florida's hot humid climate.","[Russell, Stanley; Weston, Mark; Goswami, Yogi; Doll, Matthew] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Russell, S (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-5468-6,,,,2012,,,,,213,224,,,,,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BFR72,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000321076700029,View Full Record in Web of Science

New Zealand's plantation forests are sufficiently uncomplicated to enable key issues to be identified. Areas of critical interest for carbon sequestration are shown to be average rotation length and the age-class distribution of the plantation resource, whereas the growth rate of trees (m(3)ha(-1)y(-1)) and the fate of wood products are demonstrated to be of lesser importance. The establishment on grassland, and replanting upon harvest, of 1 ha of Pinus radiata on New Zealand pastureland, using a regime typical of present-day practices will result in the sequestration of approximately 112 t of carbon in perpetuity This can be viewed as a one-off movement of carbon from the air to the land surface. Some of this benefit will be lost if fossil fuels are used to process the wood, and if the wood products decay anaerobically in landfills to release methane, but there may be benefits that result from the substitution of wood for less energy-intensive products. Forests are considerably more complex than stands (art area of trees that is relatively uniform in species composition, age and management regime), and it is essential to understand the age-class structure of a forest in order to quantify the carbon present and to predict future levels of sequestration or emissions. Forests that are currently sinks for carbon can become sources as the age-class composition changes. At a high rate of afforestation (100 kha y(-1)), carbon sequestration by New Zealand plantation forest sinks may exceed emissions from combustion of fossil fuels from A.D. 2008-2026. Assuming that there is an upper limit of plantable land of 5 Mha, there would be a rapid decrease in sequestration from about 2045. At the more modest rate of 60 kha y(-1) of afforestation, sequestration by forest sinks expands approximately in parallel to increased emissions until about 2018. After that, emissions rapidly overwhelm the capacity of sinks.",,,"Maclaren, JP (corresponding author), NEW ZEALAND FOREST RES INST LTD,POB 465,RANGIORA,NEW ZEALAND.",,,,,,,,0,10,12,0,6,C S I R O,EAST MELBOURNE,"PO BOX 89 (EAST ALBERT ST), EAST MELBOURNE 3002, AUSTRALIA",,,0-643-05688-2,,,,1996,,,,,417,436,,,,,,20,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BG79Y,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1996BG79Y00022,View Full Record in Web of Science

In arable environments, soil loss is primarily caused by short, intense rainstorms, typically characterized by high spatio-temporal variability. The complexity of erosive events challenges modeling efforts and explicit inclusion of extreme events in long-term risk assessment is missing. This study is intended to bridge this gap by quantifying the discrete and cumulative impacts of rainstorms on plot-scale soil erosion and providing storm-scale erosion risk analyses for a cropland region in northern Israel. Central to our analyses is the coupling of (1) a stochastic rainfall generator able to reproduce extremes down to 5-minute temporal resolutions; (2) a processes-based event-scale cropland erosion model (Dynamic WEPP, DWEPP); and, (3) a state-of-the-art frequency analysis method that explicitly accounts for rainstorms occurrence and properties. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which DWEPP runoff and soil loss are calibrated at the plot-scale on cropland (NSE is 0.82 and 0.79 for event runoff and sediment, respectively). We generated 300-year stochastic simulations of event runoff and sediment yield based on synthetic precipitation time series. Based on this data, themean annual soil erosion in the study site is 0.1 kgm(-2) [1.1 t ha(-1)]. Results of the risk analysis indicate that individual extreme rainstorms (>50 return period), characterized by high rainfall intensities (30-minute maximal intensity>similar to 60mmh(-1)) and high rainfall depth (>similar to 200 mm), can trigger soil losses even one order of magnitude higher than the annual mean. The erosion efficiency of these rainstorms is mainly controlled by the short-duration (<= 30 min) maximal intensities. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the impact of extreme events into soil conservation and management tools. We expect our methodology to be valuable for investigating future changes in soil erosion with changing climate. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

With the largest-ever assembly of volcanic ice core records and state-of-the-art climate model simulations of volcanic deposition, we now have a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of spatial variations on sulfate deposition and on estimates of atmospheric loading. We have combined 44 ice core records, 25 from the Arctic and 19 from Antarctica, and Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE simulations to study the spatial distribution of volcanic sulfate aerosols in the polar ice sheets. We extracted volcanic deposition signals by applying a high-pass loess filter to the time series and examining peaks that exceed twice the 31-year running median absolute deviation. Our results suggest that the distribution of volcanic sulfate aerosol follows the general precipitation pattern in both regions, indicating the important role precipitation has played in affecting the deposition pattern of volcanic aerosols. We found a similar distribution pattern for sulfate aerosols from the 1783 - 1784 Laki and 1815 Tambora eruptions, as well as for the total beta activity after the 1952 - 1954 low-latitude Northern Hemisphere and 1961 - 1962 high-latitude Northern Hemisphere atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. This confirms the previous assumption that the transport and deposition of nuclear bomb test debris resemble those of volcanic aerosols. We compare three techniques for estimating stratospheric aerosol loading from ice core data: radioactive deposition from nuclear bomb tests, Pinatubo sulfate deposition in eight Antarctic ice cores, and climate model simulations of volcanic sulfate transport and deposition following the 1783 Laki, 1815 Tambora, 1912 Katmai, and 1991 Pinatubo eruptions. By applying the above calibration factors to the 44 ice core records, we have estimated the stratospheric sulfate aerosol loadings for the largest volcanic eruptions during the last millennium. These loadings agree fairly well with estimates based on radiation, petrology, and model simulations. We also estimate the relative magnitude of sulfate deposition compared with the mean for Greenland and Antarctica for each ice core record, which provides a guideline to evaluate the stratospheric volcanic sulfate aerosol loading calculated from a single or a few ice core records.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Gao, CH (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",robock@envsci.rutgers.edu,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016; Georgiy, Stenchikov/J-8569-2013; Oman, Luke D/C-2778-2009; Gao, Chaochao/G-9154-2011; Stenchikov, Georgiy/AAA-4371-2022","Oman, Luke D/0000-0002-5487-2598; Stenchikov, Georgiy Lvovich/0000-0001-9033-4925; Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656",,,,,60,68,73,0,34,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Decreased inflows to the lake have resulted in 100 km(2) decrease in lake surface area and a total loss of fisheries due to salinization. The ecologic health of Walker Lake is of great concern as the lake is a stopover point on the Pacific route for migratory birds from within and outside the United States. Stakeholders, water institutions, and scientists have engaged in collaborative modeling and the development of a decision support system that is being used to develop and analyze management change options to restore the lake. Here we use an integrated management and hydrologic model that relies on state-of-the-art simulation capabilities to evaluate the benefits of using integrated hydrologic models as components of a decision support system. Nonlinear feedbacks among climate, surface-water and groundwater exchanges, and water use present challenges for simulating realistic outcomes associated with management change. Integrated management and hydrologic modeling provides a means of simulating benefits associated with management change in the Walker River basin where drastic changes in the hydrologic landscape have taken place over the last century. Through the collaborative modeling process, stakeholder support is increasing and possibly leading to management change options that result in reductions in Walker Lake salt concentrations, as simulated by the decision support system.

Light-shelves have been used for decades to enhance natural light in spaces, however, their static nature is limiting their overall performance potential. This paper explores the convergence of rapid prototyping, parametric design and environmental modelling software to create a dynamic and direct-reflection daylight redirection system that significantly enhances daylight availability. A Radiance-based simulation workflow to optimise and study the system is used and a 1:1 mock-up is developed. The mock-up is based on a horizontal-light shelf with an array of mirror tiles that can tilt in two axes based on sun position. The potential impact of such a system is then evaluated for a side lit office space in multiple climates in the northern hemisphere. Results show that daylight can be redirected deep into the building more effectively and therefore improve daylight availability for otherwise underlit floor plan regions. Projected savings for electric lighting range from 17% to 35% compared with a static redirection system.","[Dogan, T.; Stec, P.] Cornell Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, 129 Sibley Dome, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Dogan, T (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Planning, 129 Sibley Dome, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tkdogan@cornell.edu,,,,,,,30,10,10,4,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1477-1535,1477-0938,,LIGHTING RES TECHNOL,Lighting Res.

In line with that, EVs could play a vital role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, EVs face some challenges such as battery health degradation, battery management complexities, power electronics integration, and appropriate charging strategies. Therefore, further investigation is essential to select appropriate battery storage and management system, technologies, algorithms, controllers, and optimization schemes. Although numerous studies have been carried out on EV technology, the state-of-the-art technology, progress, limitations, and their impacts on achieving SDGs have not yet been examined. Hence, this review paper comprehensively and critically describes the various technological advancements of EVs, focusing on key aspects such as storage technology, battery management system, power electronics technology, charging strategies, methods, algorithms, and optimizations. Moreover, numerous open issues, challenges, and concerns are discussed to identify the existing research gaps. Furthermore, this paper develops the relationship between EVs benefits and SDGs concerning social, economic, and environmental impacts. The analysis reveals that EVs have a substantial influence on various goals of sustainable development, such as affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, industry, economic growth, and climate actions. Lastly, this review delivers fruitful and effective suggestions for future enhancement of EV technology that would be beneficial to the EV engineers and industrialists to develop efficient battery storage, charging approaches, converters, controllers, and optimizations toward targeting SDGs.","[Lipu, Molla Shahadat Hossain; Miah, Md Sazal; Rahman, Tuhibur; Maruf, Md Hasan] Green Univ Bangladesh, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh; [Al Mamun, Abdullah] Northern Univ Bangladesh, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka 1205, Bangladesh; [Ansari, Shaheer] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Elect Elect & Syst Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Miah, Md Sazal] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Engn & Technol, Khlong Nueng 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Hasan, Kamrul] Univ Teknol MARA, Coll Engn, Sch Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Meraj, Sheikh T.] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Abdolrasol, Maher G.

The wind power industry uses those products extensively for wind resource assessment, while several climate services for energy rely on them as well. Nowadays various datasets coexist, which complicates the selection of the most suitable source for each purpose. In an effort to identify the products that best represent the wind speed features at turbine hub heights, five state-of-the-art global reanalyses have been analysed: ERA5, ERA-Interim, the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55), the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA2), and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis 1 (R1). A multi-reanalysis ensemble approach is used to explore the main differences amongst these datasets in terms of surface wind characteristics. Then, the quality of the surface and near-surface winds is evaluated with a set of 77 instrumented tall towers. Results reveal that important discrepancies exist in terms of boreal winter seasonal means, interannual variability (IAV), and decadal linear trends. The differences in the computation of these parameters, which are mainly concentrated inland, reach up to the order of magnitude of the parameters themselves. Comparison with in situ observations shows that the ERA5 surface winds offer the best agreement, correlating and reproducing the observed variability better than a multi-reanalysis mean in 35.1% of the tall tower sites on a daily time-scale. However, none of the reanalyses stands out from the others when comparing seasonal mean winds. Regarding the IAV, near-surface winds from ERA5 offer the values closest to the observed IAV.","[Ramon, Jaume; Lledo, Llorenc; Torralba, Veronica; Soret, Albert; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] BSC, C Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona, Spain",ICREA,"Ramon, J (corresponding author), BSC, C Jordi Girona 29, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jaume.ramon@bsc.es,"TORRALBA, VERONICA/HGT-8398-2022; Lledó, Llorenç/AAC-2866-2020; Torralba, Verónica/ABE-9121-2021","TORRALBA, VERONICA/0000-0002-8941-1548; Lledó, Llorenç/0000-0002-8628-6876; Torralba, Verónica/0000-0002-8941-1548; Ramon, Jaume/0000-0003-2818-5206","European Commission [690462, 776787]; MICINN [BES-2017-082216]; National Science Foundation; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors acknowledge funding support from Integrated Approach for the development across Europe of user oriented climate indicators for GFCS high priority sectors: agriculture, disaster risk reduction, energy, health, water and tourism (INDECIS) cofounded by the H2020 ERA-net ERA4CS (GA 690462), the S2S4E (GA 776787) project funded by the Horizon 2020 framework of the European Commission, and the MICINN grant BES-2017-082216 (Ayudas para contratos predoctorales).

In this regard, ten cities have been selected as a sample fromSamanid era of Islamic civilization (Jowzjan, Chouchanian, Katl or Katlan, Karazm, Gorjestan, Sistan, Bast and Gazneh, Kerman, Samarkand and Bukhara). Due to the structure of the project, reviewed works and sources are classified in five titles: Introducing cities, respectively, started from Climate and City and terminated to City and Culture. Due to the case study that includes Samanid era, thepaper's subjects are trying to identifyTransoxania and introducing cities' characteristics in this period. The main body of the paper includes identifying and examining five topics from introducing and analyzing cities. These features are as follows: 1. Geographical and climate features of cities 2. Kings' qualification and a brief description of their behavioral characteristics 3. Introducing counties and townships of cities 4. Economic characteristics of cities 5. Cultural features Among the cities which studied in this paper, the first three featuresare used for presenting considered cities which authors choose that these cities have the largest and most complete introduction to cities as Samarkand and Bukhara and have discussed economic and cultural characteristics of these cities. The paper's question and the assumption of regularity introduced in the cities of ancient texts were answered in the main body of the article and classified information has been analyzed. Also, the introduction of large cities has special and complete rule in away that the point of introducing the integrity of cities has not diminished. Study's achievements demonstrated the following findings: a. In all of the cases presented by historians; Issues such as climate and city, regional divisions, and describing princess' circumstances has been discussed. b. The content ofhistorical and geographical contexts in Iran'sclassical era has high-capacity for variety of description. c.

Despite much evidence of catastrophic declines, few Australian species are listed as threatened under national legislation. We aim to help redress this by identifying the Australian freshwater fishes that are in the most immediate risk of extinction. For 22 freshwater fishes (identified as highly threatened by experts), we used structured expert elicitation to estimate the probability of extinction in the next similar to 20 years, and to identify key threats and priority management needs. All but one of the 22 species are small (<150 mm total length), 12 have been formally described only in the last decade, with seven awaiting description. Over 90% of these species were assessed to have a >50% probability of extinction in the next similar to 20 years. Collectively, the biggest factor contributing to the likelihood of extinction of the freshwater fishes considered is that they occur in small (distributions <= 44 km(2)), geographically isolated populations, and are threatened by a mix of processes (particularly alien fishes and climate change). Nineteen of these species are unlisted on national legislation, so legislative drivers for recovery actions are largely absent. Research has provided strong direction on how to manage similar to 35% of known threats to the species considered, and, of these, similar to 36% of threats have some management underway (although virtually none are at the stage where intervention is no longer required). Increased resourcing, management intervention and social attitudinal change is urgently needed to avert the impending extinction of Australia's most imperilled freshwater fishes.","[Lintermans, Mark; Unmack, Peter J.] Univ Canberra, Ctr Appl Water Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Lintermans, Mark; Ebner, Brendan C.; Freeman, Rob; Hammer, Michael P.; Morgan, David L.; Raadik, Tarmo A.] Australian Soc Fish Biol, Threatened Fishes Comm, ASN Events, Suite 9-397 Smith St, Fitzroy, Vic 3065, Australia; [Geyle, Hayley M.; Woinarski, John C.

For this purpose 132 profiles of backscatter lidar observations at 532 nm were used. The selected profiles were collected during 1993 - 1998 period. The radiative transfer code was adapted to the local conditions at Camaguey, Cuba, using water vapor and temperature profiles as well as locally measured surface albedo from the site. Runs were conducted both under the presence of cirrus clouds and in clear sky conditions. The calculated shortwave broadband cloud radiative forcing values have negative sign and vary according to the different optical depths of cirrus. A close correlation between the negative cirrus radiative forcing and optical depth (anticorrelation) was found at the top of the atmosphere and surface when broadband solar irradiances calculations are analyzed. This close correlation was found also in different intervals of wavelength in the solar spectrum (near infrared, visible, and ultraviolet). The major effect of cirrus clouds on the solar radiation is in the near infrared wavelengths. Limitations of the current lidar dataset are discussed.","[Barja, Boris; Carlos Antuna, Juan] INSMET, Camaguey Meteorol Ctr, Camaguey Lidar Stn, Havana, Cuba",,"Barja, B (corresponding author), INSMET, Camaguey Meteorol Ctr, Camaguey Lidar Stn, Havana, Cuba.",bbarja@cmw.insmet.cu,"Barja, Boris/F-5354-2012; Antuña-Marrero, Juan Carlos/C-3933-2012","Barja, Boris/0000-0002-8600-0815; Antuña-Marrero, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7037-015X",Cuban Program of Climate Change and Environment [01303177],Cuban Program of Climate Change and Environment,This work is supported by the Cuban Program of Climate Change and Environment under grant No. 01303177.,,19,2,3,0,0,SOC ESPANOLA OPTICA,MADRID,"SERRANO, 121, MADRID, 28006, SPAIN",0030-3917,2171-8814,,OPT PURA APL,Opt.

In the analysis, a two-step control strategy is considered to modify the R-value of DIMs based on the temperature difference between internal and external wall surfaces. Using a simulation environment capable of modeling DIMs, a comparative analysis is carried out to evaluate the impact of DIMs on the heating and cooling energy end-uses for single-zone residential buildings in three US climates. Several design and operating conditions are considered to assess the performance of DIMs and their potential energy use savings. The results indicated that variable thermal resistance envelope materials (RSI-0.5/RSI-2.5) have the potential to reduce annual cooling energy use in residential buildings on average by 15% and up to 39% for all three US climates and annual heating energy use by 10% on average for mild US climates depending on the window sizes and internal heat gains.

Unfortunately, owing to the diversity of networks, none of them could be accounted as a universal approach that works well in a wide variety of networks. Hence, in this paper, from a percolation perspective, we connect the immunization and robustness problem with an evolutionary algorithm, i.e., a framework of an evolutionary algorithm for investigation of influential nodes in complex networks, in which we have developed procedures of selection, mutation, and initialization of population as well as maintaining the diversity of population. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we conduct intensive experiments on a large number of networks and compare it to several state-of-the-art strategies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has significant advantages over others, especially on empirical networks in most of which our method has over 10 advantages of both optimal immunization threshold and average giant fraction, even against the most excellent existing strategies. Additionally, our discussion reveals that there might be better solutions with various initial methods.","[Liu, Yang; Kurths, Jurgen] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Dept Complex Sci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Liu, Yang] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Comp Sci, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Wang, Xi] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kurths, Jurgen] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Kurths, Jurgen] Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, Saratov 410012, Russia",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Humboldt University of Berlin; Saratov State University,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Dept Complex Sci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",yangliuyh@gmail.com,,"Wang, Xi/0000-0002-5218-2761",High Performance Computer System at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research through the European Regional Development Fund; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; China Scholarship Council Scholarship; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (DFG/FAPESP) [IRTG 1740/TRP 2015/50122-0]; Land Brandenburg,High Performance Computer System at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research through the European Regional Development Fund; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); China Scholarship Council Scholarship(China Scholarship Council); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (DFG/FAPESP); Land Brandenburg,"This work was supported in part by the High Performance Computer System at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research through the European Regional Development Fund, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Land Brandenburg, in part by the China Scholarship Council Scholarship, and in part by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (DFG/FAPESP) under Grant IRTG 1740/TRP 2015/50122-0.",,63,15,16,0,23,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1089-778X,1941-0026,,IEEE T EVOLUT COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

A physical modelling approach using SnowModel, a state-of-the-art snow-evolution modelling system that includes four submodels (MicroMet, EnBal, SnowPack, and SnowTran-3D), was used to quantify the 1995-2007 GrIS surface mass-balance (SMB), including freshwater flux. Meteorological observations from 26 meteorological stations located on the GrIS (Greenland Climate Network; GC-Net stations) and in coastal Greenland (Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) WMO-stations) were used as model inputs. The GrIS minimum surface melt extent of 29% occurred in 1996, while the greatest extent of 51% was present in 2007. The 2007 melt extent was 20% greater than the average for 1995-2006. The year 2007 had the highest GrIS surface runoff (523 km(3) y(-1)) and the lowest SMB (-3 km(3) y(-1)); the only year with a negative GrIS SMB. Runoff in 2007 was approximately 35% greater than average for 1995-2006. From 1995 through 2007 overall, precipitation decreased while ablation increased, leading to all increased average SMB loss of 127 km3. The modelled GrIS SMB was merged with previous estimates of GrIS subglacial runoff (from geothermal melt) and GrIS calving to quantify GrIS freshwater flux to the ocean, indicating an average negative mass-balance of 265 (83) km(3) y(-1). This study further suggests an average GrIS freshwater flux of approximately 786 km(3) y(-1) to the ocean, of which 45% occurs from iceberg calving and geothermal bottom melting. The average annual GrIS freshwater flux equals 2.1 +/- 0.2 mm w.eq. y(-1) in eustatic sea level rise, indicating a Cumulative flux of 28 mm w.eq. from 1995 through 2007. The average GrIS net loss contributes to a net sea level rise of 0.7 +/- 0.2 mm w.eq. y(-1), and a cumulative net increase of 10 mm w.eq.

However, less research has been centered on exploring energy fluxes (net radiation; sensible, latent and soil heat) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over the Neotropical Andean biome of the paramo. The present study assesses the implementation and parameterization of a state-of-art Land-Surface Model (LSM) for simulation of these fluxes over two representative paramo catchments of southern Ecuador. We evaluated the outputs of the LSM Community Land Model (CLM ver. 4.0) with (i) ground-level flux observations from the first (and highest) Eddy Covariance (EC) tower of the Northern Andean paramos; (ii) spatial ETa estimates from the energy balance-based model METRIC (based on Landsat imagery); and (iii) derived ETa from the closure of the water balance (WB). CLM's energy predictions revealed a significant underestimation on net radiation, which impacts the sensible and soil heat fluxes (underestimation), and delivers a slight overestimation on latent heat flux. Modeled CLM ETa showed acceptable goodness-of-fit (Pearson R = 0.82) comparable to ETa from METRIC (R = 0.83). Contrarily, a poor performance of ETa WB was observed (R = 0.46). These findings provide solid evidence on the CLM's accuracy for the ETa modeling, and give insights in the selection of other ETa methods. The study contributes to a better understanding of ecosystem functioning in terms of water loss through evaporative processes, and might help in the development of future LSMs' implementations focused on climate / land use change scenarios for the paramo.

Because the TwInvis passive radar system uses broadcasting transmitters as illuminators of aircraft, the availability of a state of the art broadcast transmitter, developed by Rohde und Schwarz will be assessed, too. Most passive radar systems are capable of processing a multiple number of illuminators. To take this into account, the consequences of a transmitter's outage will be described and illustrated at the end of this paper.","[Erhart, Christian; Doser, Dirk] HENSOLDT Sensors GmbH, Ulm, Germany; [Janner, Thomas] Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co KG, Munich, Germany",Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co KG,"Erhart, C (corresponding author), HENSOLDT Sensors GmbH, Ulm, Germany.",christian.erhart@hensoldt.net; dirk.doser@hensoldt.net; thomas.janner@rohde-schwarz.com,,,German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action [20V1908A],German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action,This work was funded by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action within the Luftfahrtfoschungsprogram Passiv II (funding code 20V1908A).,,5,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2167-8022,,978-3-9820397-2-5,GER MICROW CONF,,,2022,,,,,128,131,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Telecommunications,BT5WQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000839058200033,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the estimation of precipitation patterns derived solely from rain gauges is subject to large uncertainties. We present the Random Forest based MErging Procedure (RF-MEP), which combines information from ground-based measurements, state-of-the-art precipitation products, and topography-related features to improve the representation of the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation, especially in data-scarce regions. RF-MEP is applied over Chile for 2000-2016, using daily measurements from 258 rain gauges for model training and 111 stations for validation. Two merged datasets were computed: RF-MEP3P (based on PERSIANN-CDR, ERA-Interim, and CHIRPSv2) and RF-MEP5P (which additionally includes CMORPHv1 and TRMM 3B42v7). The performances of the two merged products and those used in their computation were compared against MSWEPv2.2, which is a state-of-the-art global merged product. A validation using ground-based measurements was applied at different temporal scales using both continuous and categorical indices of performance. RF-MEP3P and RF-MEP5P outperformed all the precipitation datasets used in their computation, the products derived using other merging techniques, and generally outperformed MSWEPv2.2. The merged P products showed improvements in the linear correlation, bias, and variability of precipitation at different temporal scales, as well as in the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the critical success index for different precipitation intensities. RF-MEP performed well even when the training dataset was reduced to 10% of the available rain gauges. Our results suggest that RF-MEP could be successfully applied to any other region and to correct other climatological variables, assuming that ground-based data are available.","[Baez-Villanueva, Oscar M.; McNamara, Ian; Ribbe, Lars; Nauditt, Alexandra] TH Koln, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Cologne, Germany; [Baez-Villanueva, Oscar M.; Nguyen Xuan Thinh] TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany; [Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio] Univ la Frontera, Dept Civil Engn, Temuco, Chile; [Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Santiago, Chile; [Beck, Hylke E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Birkel, Christian] Univ Costa Rica, Geog Dept, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Birkel, Christian] Univ Aberdeen, Northern Rivers Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Verbist, Koen] UNESCO Int Hydrol Programme, Paris, France; [Giraldo-Osorio, Juan Diego] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia",Dortmund University of Technology; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de Chile; Princeton University; Universidad Costa Rica; University of Aberdeen; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Baez-Villanueva, OM (corresponding author), TH Koln, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Cologne, Germany.;Baez-Villanueva, OM (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany.",obaezvil@th-koeln.de; mauricio.zambrano@ufrontera.cl; hylke.beck@gmail.com; ian.mcnamara@th-koeln.de; lars.ribbe@th-koeln.de; alexandra.nauditt@th-koeln.de; christian.birkel@ucr.ac.cr; k.verbist@unesco.org; j.giraldoo@javeriana.edu.co; nguyen.thinh@tu-dortmund.de,"Baez-Villanueva, Oscar Manuel/ABG-1929-2020; Giraldo-Osorio, Juan Diego/F-8969-2016; Beck, Hylke/ABD-9012-2020; Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio/C-7855-2012","Giraldo-Osorio, Juan Diego/0000-0001-6205-3341; Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio/0000-0002-9536-643X; Ribbe, Lars/0000-0003-3052-1782; Verbist, Koen/0000-0002-9110-0263; Nauditt, Alexandra/0000-0002-9780-5280",Centers for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD); Conicyt-Fondecyt [11150861]; Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2) [Conicyt-FONDAP 15110009]; RSE editorial team,Centers for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD); Conicyt-Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2); RSE editorial team,"The authors thank the Centers for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) Ph.D. program for their financial support to the main author.

A large portion of the world wine production is located in regions suffering - or expected to suffer - from desertification. Whilst grapevine is relatively tolerant to water deficit, extended drought events accompanied by increased temperature can lead to decreased yield, alteration of fruit metabolism and quality. On the other hand, mild environmental stresses are known to increase the synthesis of metabolites (e.g., anthocyanins, stilbenes) in the berries' skin, which can ameliorate fruit quality. In recent years semiarid regions, including the Negev plateau in Israel, are acquiring a significant place in the local wine industry. Moreover, introduction of grapevines in borderline regions between Mediterranean and semiarid climates can provide a model system to investigate current and future scenarios of grape cultivation. Results from these studies can be used to optimize cropping strategies in drought-prone environments, particularly techniques for suboptimal irrigation and the development and testing of drought-tolerant cultivars. In view of the future environmental challenges, this review aims to summarize the current knowledge on physiological and molecular responses of grapevine to multiple stresses associated with water deficit. State-of-the-art irrigation management is also discussed. The need for multidisciplinary integrated studies is suggested as a key-step in elucidating the complex interaction of vine and water deficit.","[Hochberg, U.; Degu, A.; Rachmilevitch, S.; Fait, A.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Cramer, G.

Validation of the chemical reanalysis against global ozonesondes shows good agreement throughout the free troposphere and lower stratosphere for both seasonal and year-to-year variations, with an annual mean bias of less than 0.9 ppb in the middle and upper troposphere at the tropics and midlatitudes. The reanalysis provides comprehensive spatiotemporal evaluation of chemistry-model performance that compliments direct ozonesonde comparisons, which are shown to suffer from significant sampling bias. The reanalysis reveals that the ACCMIP ensemble mean overestimates ozone in the northern extratropics by 6-11 ppb while underestimating by up to 18 ppb in the southern tropics over the Atlantic in the lower troposphere. Most models underestimate the spatial variability of the annual mean lower tropospheric concentrations in the extratropics of both hemispheres by up to 70 %. The ensemble mean also overestimates the seasonal amplitude by 25-70% in the northern extratropics and overestimates the inter-hemispheric gradient by about 30% in the lower and middle troposphere. A part of the discrepancies can be attributed to the 5-year reanalysis data for the decadal model simulations. However, these differences are less evident with the current sonde network. To estimate ozonesonde sampling biases, we computed model bias separately for global coverage and the ozonesonde network. The ozonesonde sampling bias in the evaluated model bias for the seasonal mean concentration relative to global coverage is 40-50% over the western Pacific and east Indian Ocean and reaches 110% over the equatorial Americas and up to 80% for the global tropics. In contrast, the ozonesonde sampling bias is typically smaller than 30% for the Arctic regions in the lower and middle troposphere. These systematic biases have implications for ozone radiative forcing and the response of chemistry to climate that can be further quantified as the satellite observational record extends to multiple decades.","[Miyazaki, Kazuyuki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Research & Dev Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Miyazaki, Kazuyuki; Bowman, Kevin] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Miyazaki, K (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Research & Dev Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",kmiyazaki@jamstec.go.jp,"Bowman, Kevin/L-8786-2019; Miyazaki, Kazuyuki/AAL-1785-2021","Bowman, Kevin/0000-0002-8659-1117; Miyazaki, Kazuyuki/0000-0002-1466-4655","JSPS [15K05296, 26220101, 26287117]; Coordination Funds for Promoting AeroSpace Utilization by MEXT, JAPAN; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26287117, 15H02129, 15K05296] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Coordination Funds for Promoting AeroSpace Utilization by MEXT, JAPAN; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We acknowledge the use of data products from the NASA AURA and EOS Terra satellite missions.

Based on a cross-case analysis of five firms across industries in Thailand, the empirical evidence draws on semistructured interviews with various stakeholders, field visits, and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources. This paper proposes that GHRM bundles successfully implemented by firms in response to the institutional and cultural contexts include the following: green recruitment and selection in terms of green employer branding; green training in terms of awareness enhancement, on-the-job training, job shadowing, coaching, mentoring, and workplace climate building; green pay and rewards in terms of financial and nonfinancial rewards; and green employee relations in terms of a paternalistic leadership style and workplace climate. Specifically, firms develop green employer branding and implement the practices of awareness enhancement, on-the-job training, job shadowing, coaching, mentoring, and workplace climate building in response to deficiencies in the national education and skill formation system in terms of skill shortages. Additionally, firms offer both financial and nonfinancial rewards and create a paternalistic leadership style and workplace climate in response to a cultural context that favors in-group collectivism, conflict avoidance, and passivity among workers within the workplace.","[Napathorn, Chaturong] Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Napathorn, C (corresponding author), Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",cn48@cornell.edu,,"Napathorn, Chaturong/0000-0001-6433-645X",,,,,86,1,1,9,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

In this study, barriers to GBMs are identified by conducting a qualitative study. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected UK construction sector experts from academia and industry and the results were obtained by applying thematic analysis. Five major categories of barriers emerged: government constraints; financial constraints; sector constraints; company constraints; and lack of demand. To understand the collective impact of these barriers, the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) method was used. The ISM-based model showed that government constraints are driving the rest of the barriers followed by financial and construction sector constraints equally then the by company constraints. Surprisingly, lack of demand appeared to have the least significance in hindering GBM transformation compared to the rest of the barriers. The results, present a clear picture of the green construction market relevant to multinational enterprises (MNEs) intending to enter the UK. MNEs are therefore influenced by the government on strategic planning and capability building for GBMs. Effective engagement with the government will generate institutional advantages resulting in legitimacy and trust for MNEs in the UK markets.

Multivariate analysis of variance was carried out on 41 morphological traits. Discriminant analysis and principal component analysis were conducted then. It is found that between sexes, only one antennal segment and mesotibia have differences, between CSA-CFA zones interocular distance, pronotum, elytra, antenna, profemur, protibia, mesofemur, metatarsus, and industry-forest zones interocular distance, elytra, antenna, and femurs of foreleg, midleg and hindleg are showed differences. Discriminant analysis supported that original classifications are correct and principal component analysis showed relations between significant traits. The results indicated that despite R. inquisitor does not have sexual dimorphism in size of most traits, response to environmental stimuli by static allometry.

The conversion of CO2 to methanol is a rather complicated multistep process which is usually performed catalytically in gas phase. However, the aqueous phase conversion of CO2 is also feasible in certain conditions. Thus, a catalyzed-like water enhanced mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has been designed and studied by using the highly accurate W1U composite method. The initial reactant mixture was CO2 + 6H center dot + 8H(2)O + H3O+, where the hydrogen atoms are added one-by-one to mimic the catalytic effect of a metal surface. The presence of water and H3O+ further enhance the reaction by lowering the reaction barriers. By computing the thermodynamic properties of the reaction mechanism, it was found that the highest relative energy barrier in the most preferred pathway is 212.67 kJ/mol. By taking this into account, the energy efficiency of the pathway has been calculated and it was found to be equal to 92.5%. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

It uses the diurnal amplitude of the net surface radiation, the sensitivity of the turbulent fluxes to the surface temperature and the soil thermal inertia. Its performance is evaluated globally with numerical simulations using the atmospheric and the land surface modules of a state-of-the-art climate model. The only regions where the thermal inertia has a limited impact are the moist regions. In dry areas, together with the stability of the boundary layer it plays a major role. It also has a significant impact at high and midlatitudes especially in winter when the turbulent fluxes are weak. In semiarid regions, the soil moisture exhibits a high day-to-day variability strongly correlated to the evaporation and the day-to-day variability of the surface temperature is generally explained by the soil moisture via its control on the evaporation. However, the soil moisture via its control on the thermal inertia reduces the impact of the day-time evaporative cooling by reducing the nocturnal cooling. This newly identified moisture-related negative feedback can reduce the variability of the surface temperature in semiarid regions by up to a factor of 2. The model also provides a simple framework to understand the role of the thermal properties in the frequent cold bias identified in stratified stable atmospheric situations in the northern midlatitudes.","[Cheruy, F.; Dufresne, J.

The HEDGE-BIOMASS project addresses the promotion of a new perennial linear landscape element: bioenergy buffers. Bioenergy buffer strips (BBS) are narrow arable field margins and buffer strips along waterways converted to warm-season grasses and short-rotation woody crops for bioenergy applications. Within the HEDGE-BIOMASS project, an extensive review of scientific literature has been performed to identify the state of the art knowledge on perennial biomass crops with particular reference to their capacity to supply ecological services and to define the most suitable biomass supply chain management design. Implementing new bioenergy buffers could significantly enhance the pollination service and natural enemy control in arable crops by neighbouring presence of beneficial organisms on bioenergy buffer. A positive interaction between crop management and species richness was found in bioenergy crops for a long list of taxa. With regards to miscanthus and switchgrass, the deep-rooting system proved to be the main factor for improving water/nutrient use efficiency. Herbaceous BBS can promote positive alterations of C cycling pathways in terms of increased belowground carbon (C) allocation and belowground fine root biomass. Short-rotation woody crops in BBS, instead, increase the litter C and nitrogen (N) input to soil and start to act as net C sink few years after establishment. Several positive experiences have been reported in literature on removal efficiency of non-point source agricultural pollutants coming from adjacent agricultural fields. A 5-10 m wide herbaceous BBS can efficiently mitigate sediment, N and total phosphorus (P) runoff. However, if BBS are placed on flatland regions with slow runoff flow the risk of P delivery from buffers can be increased due to dissolved P remobilization from standing aboveground litter mediated by microbial processes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no data regarding denitrification processes in shallow groundwaters under BBS. Moreover, soil N-2/N2O emission dynamics and annual N2O budget in BBS remain uncertain. Nevertheless, it has been reported that BBS can significantly reduce nitrate leaching compared with surrounding row-cropping systems from the second growing season. Regarding biomass yield achieved on BBS it emerged that no data are available for switchgrass and miscanthus while extensive literature is available for woody crops. We can assume that biomass yields of herbaceous buffers are similar to those reported for large scale cultivations because efficient mechanisms of nutrients up-take, trapping, filtration and infiltration occur usually in BBS. Warm-season grasses presented on average the highest values of greenhouse gas savings, particularly when biomass is used for electricity production by gasification. The width of the bioenergy buffer strip is a fundamental element to design effective systems. Unfortunately, from the logistic point of view, biomass harvesting and collection is limited by the linear arrangement of biomass crops along arable field margins. As a consequence of this restricted operating space, the intra-and extra-farm fragmentation of logisticoperations seems to be the main critical step of BBS management compared to the traditional large-scale bioenergy cultivation scenario. Within the framework of HEDGE-BIOMASS project a comprehensive assessment of ecological services provided by bioenergy buffers is being carried out. Furthermore, a multicriteria spatial analysis combining GIS, Life Cycle Assessment and SWAT model, will be performed to at landscape level propose new bioenergy production scenarios along field margins. This research will develop an energy production strategy that offer an opportunity to rethink how and where bioenergy feedstocks can be sustainably produced and to optimize the trade-offs between the delivery of multiple ecological services and farmer incomes within limited land resources.","[Ferrarini, Andrea; Serra, Paolo; Almagro, Maria; Amaducci, Stefano] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Agron Genet & Field Crops, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Trevisan, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Agr & Environm Chem, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Amaducci, S (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Agron Genet & Field Crops, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",stefano.amaducci@unicatt.it,"Almagro, María/A-9722-2016","Almagro, María/0000-0003-2585-9893",,,,,142,4,4,1,38,ETA-FLORENCE,FLORENCE,"PIAZZA SAVONAROLA 10, I-50132 FLORENCE, ITALY",,,,,,,2014,,,,,257,273,,,,,,17,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BC2LG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000351053500048,View Full Record in Web of Science

The investigation was conducted within a certain range of land use intensity using a state-of-the-art Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ DGVM). CNOP-I represents a class of deforestation and can be considered a type of land use with respect to the initial perturbation. When deforestation denoted by the CNOP-I has the same intensity for all three plants, the variation in plant amount of the boreal needleleaved evergreen in northern China is greater than the variation in plant amount of both the temperate broadleaved evergreen and temperate broadleaved summergreen in southern China. As deforestation intensity increases, the plant amount variation in the three woody plant functional types carbon changes, in a nonlinear fashion. The impact of land use on plant functional types is minor because the interaction between climate condition and land use is not considered in the LPJ model. Finally, the different impacts of deforestation on net primary production of the three plant functional types were analyzed by modeling gross primary production and autotrophic respiration. Our results suggest that the CNOP-I approach is a useful tool for exploring the nonlinear and different responses of terrestrial ecosystems to land use.","[Sun Guodong; Mu Mu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Mu Mu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Wave, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS","Sun, GD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",sungd@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Sun, Guodong/AAK-3355-2020",,"State Key Development Program for Basic Research [2012CB955202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40905050, 40830955]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [KZCX3-SW-230]",State Key Development Program for Basic Research(State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"Funding was provided from the State Key Development Program for Basic Research (Grant No. 2012CB955202), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40905050 and 40830955) and the KZCX3-SW-230 of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).",,44,0,1,1,42,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

Even with the state-of-the art training, many practitioners do not deliver the intervention, or do so at a reduced capacity. The purpose of this paper is to examine system-contextual implementation factors that predict timely initiation of use of an EBPI (i.e. within the first six months following training). A secondary purpose is to document additional impacts of training. Design/methodology/approach - Repeated measures were used to collect predictors and the dependent variable. The relationship between participant characteristics and use of the Triple P program was estimated using exact logistic regression. Findings - The results from 37 practitioners across three communities indicated approximately 54 percent delivered the intervention with at least one family within the first six months following training. Practitioner self-efficacy immediately following training and general attitudes toward evidence-based practices were the most significant predictors of timely use of the model. The vast majority of practitioners, regardless of implementation status, generalized learning from the training to other aspects of their work. Originality/value - Prospective examination of the predictive value of implementation factors helps to refine targeted approaches to support implementation.","[Kerns, Suzanne E.

O-3 is detrimental to plant productivity, and it has a significant impact on crop yield. Currently, the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model includes a representation of global crops (JULES-crop) but does not have crop-specific O-3 damage parameters and applies default C3 grass O-3 parameters for soybean that underestimate O-3 damage. Physiological parameters for O-3 damage in soybean in JULES-crop were calibrated against leaf gas-exchange measurements from the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE) with O-3 experiment in Illinois, USA. Other plant parameters were calibrated using an extensive array of soybean observations such as crop height and leaf carbon and meteorological data from FLUXNET sites near Mead, Nebraska, USA. The yield, aboveground carbon, and leaf area index (LAI) of soybean from the SoyFACE experiment were used to evaluate the newly calibrated parameters. The result shows good performance for yield, with the modelled yield being within the spread of the SoyFACE observations. Although JULES-crop is able to reproduce observed LAI seasonality, its magnitude is underestimated. The newly calibrated version of JULES will be applied regionally and globally in future JULES simulations.

The precipitation product synthesizes both state-of-the-art multisatellite precipitation algorithms and the latest, densest gauge observations to provide high-quality precipitation information at a very fine temporal and spatial resolution (0.1 degrees/hourly) that encompasses all of China. The geographical and seasonal variations in precipitation are systematically documented over seven subregions, each corresponding to a unique climate regime. PA, PF, and PI have large seasonal and geographical variations across China. It is found that 1) although heavy precipitation events (>10 mm/h) represent only 0.8% of total precipitation occurrence over China, they contribute 12.1% of the total precipitation volume. Light precipitation events (<1 mm/h) dominate the precipitation occurrence (74.3%) and contribute 23.1% of the total precipitation volume; 2) over the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau (TP), the landlocked Xinjiang (XJ) province, and northwestern China (NW), light precipitation events (<1 mm/h) occur very frequently (74.7%, 82.1%, and 64.1% of all precipitation events) and contribute 29.8%, 35.5%, and 27.4% of the total precipitation volume. This initial continental-scale study provides new insights on precipitation characteristics that can benefit meteorological and hydrological modeling and applications, especially in areas with sparse rain-gauge coverage.","[Chen, Sheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sheng; Hu, Baoqing] Guangxi Teachers Educ Univ, Key Lab Beibu Gulf Environm Evolut & Resources Ut, Minist Educ, Nanning 530001, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sheng; Hong, Yang] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Chen, Sheng; Hong, Yang] Univ Oklahoma, Adv Radar Res Ctr, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Tian, Yudong] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Tian, Yudong] NASA, Hydrol Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Behrangi, Ali] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Hu, Junjun] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Comp Sci, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Zhang, Zengxin] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Joint Innovat Ctr Modern Forestry Studies, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Stepanian, Phillip M.] Natl Weather Ctr, Adv Radar Res Ctr, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Stepanian, Phillip M.] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Meteorol, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Zhang, Xinhua] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Nanning Normal University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Nanjing Forestry University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Sichuan University,"Hong, Y (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Hong, Y (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Adv Radar Res Ctr, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Zhang, XH (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.",chenshengbj@gmail.com; yanghong@ou.edu; xhzhang@scu.edu.cn,"Hong, Yang/D-5132-2009; Behrangi, Ali/V-8927-2019","Hong, Yang/0000-0001-8720-242X; Behrangi, Ali/0000-0001-7594-8793","Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (HyDROS) Laboratory at The University of Oklahoma; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41361022, 41171020]; Guangxi Science and Technology Development Project [2014DD29090]; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University [SKHL1310, SKHL1501]; State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science [2011B079]; Key laboratory of watershed Geographic Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences [WSGS2015005]","Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (HyDROS) Laboratory at The University of Oklahoma; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Science and Technology Development Project; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University(Sichuan University); State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science; Key laboratory of watershed Geographic Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported in part by the Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (HyDROS) Laboratory at The University of Oklahoma, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41361022 and No. 41171020), Guangxi Science and Technology Development Project (No. 2014DD29090), the Open Fund from State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University (No. SKHL1310 and No. SKHL1501), the Open Research Fund Program of State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science (No. 2011B079), Key laboratory of watershed Geographic Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. WSGS2015005).

The open-source solar long-wave environmental irradiance geometry (SOLWEIG) model is one of the state-of-the-art models frequently used for urban (micro-)climatic studies. Here, we present updated calculation schemes for SOLWEIG allowing the improved prediction of surface temperatures (wall and ground). We illustrate that parameterizations based on measurements of global radiation on a south-facing vertical plane obtain better results compared to those based on solar elevation. Due to the limited number of ground surface temperature parameterizations in SOLWEIG, we implement the two-layer force-restore method for calculating ground temperature for various soil conditions. To characterize changes in urban canyon air temperature (T-can), we couple the calculation method as used in the Town Energy Balance (TEB) model. Comparison of model results and observations (obtained during field campaigns) indicates a good agreement between modeled and measured T-can, with an explained variance of R-2 =0.99. Finally, we implement an energy balance model for vertically mounted PV modules to contrast different urban surface properties. Specifically, we consider (i) an environment comprising dark asphalt and a glass facade and (ii) an environment comprising bright concrete and a PV facade. The model results show a substantially decreased T-can (by up to - 1.65 degrees C) for the latter case, indicating the potential of partially reducing/mitigating urban heat island effects.","[Oswald, Sandro M.; Trimmel, Heidelinde; Weihs, Philipp; Mursch-Radlgruber, Erich] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol, Vienna, Austria; [Revesz, Michael; Zamini, Shokufeh; Schneider, Astrid] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Peyerl, Martin; Krispel, Stefan] Smart Minerals GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Rieder, Harald E.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Rieder, Harald E.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Phys, IGAM, Graz, Austria; [Lindberg, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Graz; University of Graz; University of Gothenburg","Oswald, SM (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol, Vienna, Austria.",sandro.oswald@boku.ac.at,"Oswald, Sandro M./AAH-3635-2019; Rieder, Harald/Y-8951-2019; Philipp, Weihs/AAF-9027-2019","Oswald, Sandro M./0000-0001-9491-7175; Rieder, Harald/0000-0003-2705-0801; Philipp, Weihs/0000-0001-7452-0330; Lindberg, Fredrik/0000-0002-9648-4542; Trimmel, Heidelinde/0000-0001-7191-975X",Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) - Klimaund Energiefonds,Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) - Klimaund Energiefonds,This work was supported by the project Optimizing reflecting materials and photovoltaics in urban areas regarding the radiation balance and bioclimatic funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and the project  Influence of urban expansions on the urban heat island in Viennafunded by the Klimaund Energiefonds.,,36,1,1,7,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

The adoption of alternative strategies, such as integrated pest management, has been slow, even though benefits are potentially high, more so if the full costs of the external effects of the technologies are taken into account. In order to estimate true societal benefits of different strategies, we compare their external costs and economic performance under external cost taxation, using a state-of-the-art partial equilibrium model of the Indian agricultural sector. RESULTSPesticide externalities lower social welfare in the Indian cotton sector by $US 400-2200 million, depending on the technologies employed. A full internalisation reduces producer revenues by $US 100 ha(-1) if only Bt cotton is used, and by $US 30 ha(-1) if IPM is another option. Consumers do not start to lose surplus until 20-70% are internalised, and losses are smaller if all technologies are available. CONCLUSIONExternal pesticide costs can be internalised partially without substantially affecting consumer surplus while still increasing social welfare, but producers need to have access to and the knowledge to employ all available cotton production technologies to minimise losses.

The building envelope can highly influence the energy consumption in buildings. In this regard, innovative technologies such as thermal energy storage (TES) can help to boost the energy efficiency and to reduce the CO2 emissions in this sector. The use of phase change materials (PCM), due to its high heat capacity, has been the centre of attention of many researchers. A considerable number of papers have been published on the application of PCM as passive system in building envelopes. Researches have shown that choosing the PCM melting temperature in different climate conditions is a key factor to improve the energy performance in buildings. In the present paper, a simulation-based optimization methodology will be presented by coupling EnergyPlus and GenOpt with an innovative enthalpy-temperature (h-T) function to define the optimum PCM peak melting temperature to enhance the cooling, heating, and the annual total heating and cooling energy performance of a residential building in various climate conditions based on Koppen-Geiger classification. Results show that in a cooling dominant climate the best PCM melting temperature to reduce the annual energy consumption is close to the maximum of 26 degrees C (melting range of 24-28 degrees C), whereas in heating dominant climates PCM with lower melting temperature of 20 degrees C (melting range of 18-22 degrees C) yields higher annual energy benefits. Moreover, it was found that the proper selection of PCM melting temperature in each climate zone can lead to notable energy savings for cooling energy consumption, heating energy consumption, and total annual energy consumption.

North Mountainous India (NMI), Northwest India (NWI), North Central India (NCI), Northeast India (NEI), West Peninsular India (WPI), East Peninsular India (EPI) and South Peninsular India (SPI) have been assessed using different conventional performance metrics namely spatial correlation (R), index of agreement (d-index), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Ratio of RMSE to the standard deviation of the observations (RSR) and mean bias (MB). The results based on these indices revealed that majority of the models are unable to reproduce finer-scaled spatial patterns over most of the zones. Thereafter, four bias correction methods i.e. Scaling, Standardized Reconstruction, Empirical Quantile Mapping and Gamma Quantile Mapping have been applied on GCM simulations to enhance the skills of the GCM projections. It has been found that scaling method compared to other three methods shown its better skill in capturing mean spatial patterns. Multi-model ensemble (MME) comprising 25 numbers of better performing bias corrected (Scaled) GCMs, have been considered for developing future rainfall patterns over seven zones. Models' spread from ensemble mean (uncertainty) has been found to be larger in RCP 8.5 than RCP4.5 ensemble. In general, future rainfall projections from RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 revealed an increasing rainfall over seven zones during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The maximum increase has been found over southwestern part of NWI (12-30%), northwestern part of WPI (3-30%), southeastern part of NEI (5-18%) and northern and eastern part of SPI (6-24%). However, the contiguous region comprising by the southeastern part of NCI and northeastern part of EPI, may experience slight decreasing rainfall (about 3%) during 2020s whereas the western part of NMI may also receive around 3% reduction in rainfall during both 2050s and 2080s.","[Akhter, Javed; Deb, Argha] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Phys, Kolkata 700032, India; [Das, Lalu] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Meteorol & Phys, Mohanpur 741252, WB, India",Jadavpur University; Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University,"Das, L (corresponding author), Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Meteorol & Phys, Mohanpur 741252, WB, India.",daslalu@yahoo.co.in,"Akhter, Javed/AAL-9686-2021","Akhter, Javed/0000-0001-9076-508X","Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India through INSPIRE fellowship [IF 150304]; Department of Agricultural Meteorology and Physics, BCKV","Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India through INSPIRE fellowship; Department of Agricultural Meteorology and Physics, BCKV","We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table 1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

An ensemble of sensitivity experiments is examined. Climatologies of wind stress, turbulent heat flux, and evaporation for the period 1982-2014 are computed using SST and surface meteorological state variables from ERA-Interim. Each experiment differs from the defined control experiment in only one aspect of the parameterization of the bulk formulas. The wind stress is most sensitive to the closure used to relate the neutral drag coefficient to the wind speed in the bulk algorithm, which mainly involves the value of the Charnock parameter. The disagreement between the state-of-the-art algorithms examined is typically on the order of 10%. The largest uncertainties in turbulent heat flux and evaporation are also related to the choice of the algorithm (typically 15%) but also emerge in experiments examining approximations related to the surface temperature and saturation humidity. Thus, approximations for the skin temperature and the saltrelated reduction of saturation humidity have a substantial impact on the heat flux and evaporation (typically 10%). Approximations such as the use of a fixed air density, sea level pressure, or simplified formula for the saturation humidity lead to errors no larger than 4% when tested individually. The impacts of these approximations combine linearly when implemented together, yielding errors up to 20% over mid-and subpolar latitudes.","[Brodeau, Laurent; Woods, Cian] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Barnier, Bernard] UGA, CNRS, UMR 5183, LGGE, Grenoble, France; [Gulev, Sergey K.] Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Gulev, Sergey K.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow, Russia",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Brodeau, L (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",brodeau@gmail.com,"Barnier, Bernard/F-2400-2016; Gulev, Sergey/A-4994-2014","Barnier, Bernard/0000-0002-7539-2542; Brodeau, Laurent/0000-0001-8745-7510",Bolin Centre for Climate Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Russian Science Foundation [14-17-00697]; Russian Science Foundation [17-17-00029] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Bolin Centre for Climate Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),This study has been made possible by support of the Bolin Centre for Climate Research.

We recommend that teams working in sustainability transitions research should ideally have internal design capacity or, they regularly engage with outsourced design capacity throughout the project. Since it is not possible to directly engage all stakeholders in transition projects, the research teams should reflect on the extent of participation and the implications of this extent on the politics of the project on an ongoing and transparent way.

This megalomania is revelatory of the intense climate of emulation between Municipalities then possessing the perfect mastery of stonework, the urban elites anxious to demonstrate their faith carved in stone, as well as their prosperity, and the political and legal freedoms recently acquired or augmented, often against the ecclesiastical authorities and, in particular, the Episcopal establishment, sometimes with the support of the political power, and particularly the Imperial authority. Without questioning the most eminent references, Episcopal architecture of cathedrals, or the monuments symbolic of Imperial power, beginning with the Palatine chapel of Aachen, the urban patricians promptly placed their own mark onto the ongoing constructions. Not content to sponsor the towers with overdeveloped spires, they could even occasionally significantly instill characteristics of civil architecture in these church constructions. It is thus that can be read the spire of the cathedral of Strasbourg, whose graduated silhouette, among other elements, offers a spectacular echo of the habitual forms of the graded gables of the urban housing that the municipality had multiplied in public buildings ever since the beginning of the 14(th) century.","[Sandron, Dany] Univ Paris 04, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Sandron, Dany] Inst Natl Hist Art, CNRS, UMR 8150, Ctr Andre Chastel, F-75002 Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Sandron, D (corresponding author), Univ Paris 04, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,EDITIONS C N R S,PARIS,"20/22 RUE ST.

However, much of this pattern is absent in multi-model ensemble mean forecasts, characterized by very weak circulation anomalies in the mid and high latitudes. This study focuses on the absence of the EAP pattern in the extratropics, using state-of-the-art coupled seasonal forecast systems. The results indicate that the extratropical circulation is much less predictable, and lies in the large spread among different ensemble members, implying a large contribution from atmospheric internal variability. However, the tropical-mid-latitude teleconnections are also relatively weaker in models than observations, which also contributes to the failure of prediction of the extratropical circulation. Further results indicate that the extratropical EAP pattern varies closely with the anomalous surface temperatures in eastern Russia, which also show low predictability. This unpredictable circulation-surface temperature connection associated with the EAP pattern can also modulate the East Asian rainband.","[Lin, Xiaozhen; Lu, Riyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaozhen; Lu, Riyu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Li, Chaofan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Scaife, Adam A.] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter","Li, CF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",lichaofan@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Li, Chaofan/D-2735-2017","Li, Chaofan/0000-0001-5157-5427","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41320104007, 41775083, U1502233]; UK-China Research & Inno-vation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK-China Research & Inno-vation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41320104007, 41775083 and U1502233).

The analysis of a playful museum space with a focus on the responses of the audience members emphasises how this type of environment brings play and playfulness to the foreground while engaging with a topic that can be abstract, perplexing and formidable to comprehend and digest in its magnitude. The conception of play and manifestations of playfulness are analysed through the qualitative data from an on-site audience research conducted at the High Arctic installation at the National Maritime Museum, London. Interactive and immersive practices shift our attention to play with the somatic sense (Paterson, M. 2007. The senses of touch. Oxford & New York: Berg), movements and sensations. The multi-sensory and spatial elements blur the boundaries and challenge the perception of play and playfulness for adult audiences. How can these mediated spaces expand or reinforce our understanding of play? Play is a rich metaphor that uncovers a network of relationships that is often overlooked. The paper discusses how these spatial, embodied practices and modes of engagement extend and provoke our conceptions of play when considering the immediate, yet distant threat of climate change.","[Ntalla, Irida] Middlesex Univ, Fac Arts & Creat Ind, London, England",Middlesex University,"Ntalla, I (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ, Fac Arts & Creat Ind, London, England.",i.ntalla@mdx.ac.uk,,,,,,,125,0,0,5,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5784,1473-5776,,CULT THEORY CRIT,Cult.

The significance of palaeo-ice sheets is further underlined by the broad range of disciplines concerned with reconstructing their behaviour, many of which have undergone a rapid expansion since the 1980s. In particular, there has been a major increase in the size and qualitative diversity of empirical data used to reconstruct and date ice sheets, and major improvements in our ability to simulate their dynamics in numerical ice sheet models. These developments have made it increasingly necessary to forge interdisciplinary links between sub-disciplines and to link numerical modelling with observations and dating of proxy records. The aim of this paper is to evaluate recent developments in the methods used to reconstruct ice sheets and outline some key challenges that remain, with an emphasis on how future work might integrate terrestrial and marine evidence together with numerical modelling. Our focus is on pan-ice sheet reconstructions of the last deglaciation, but regional case studies are used to illustrate methodological achievements, challenges and opportunities. Whilst various disciplines have made important progress in our understanding of ice-sheet dynamics, it is clear that data-model integration remains under-used, and that uncertainties remain poorly quantified in both empirically-based and numerical ice-Sheet reconstructions. The representation of past climate will continue to be the largest source of uncertainty for numerical modelling. As such, palaeo-observations are critical to constrain and validate modelling. State-of-the-art numerical models will continue to improve both in model resolution and in the breadth of inclusion of relevant processes, thereby enabling more accurate and more direct comparison with the increasing range of palaeo-observations. Thus, the capability is developing to use all relevant palaeo-records to more strongly constrain deglacial (and to a lesser extent pre-LGM) ice sheet evolution. In working towards that goal, the accurate representation of uncertainties is required for both constraint data and model outputs. Close cooperation between modelling and data-gathering communities is essential to ensure this capability is realised and continues to progress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Distinction in the geomorphological pattern of valleys and associated climate allowed the formation of various plant communities. While the microclimates formed within valleys assure the survival of some different plant species apart from the general vegetation cover, they also cause different physiological development of some plants. Generally, valleys in Cyprus have positive impacts on vegetation. Primarily due to their characteristics to form lower areas, they have mainly a positive impact through their holding humid weather and allow humid winds towards the interior. Valleys also have a major role in the protection of former natural vegetation of Cyprus. Nowadays, with the impact of global warming, the island with higher temperatures as well as aridification, encounters with the changes in climate and natural vegetation and even some plant species disappear. The valleys of Cyprus may become a place to survive and live for such plants while they may cause significant development and growth in size of some plants. Cedars (Cedrus libani brevifolia) in Cedar valley, Troodos, hazelnuts (Corryllus avellana) in Bitsilya valley, gray elms (Ulmus canescens,) Oriental alder (Alnus orientalis)in Diarizos and Stavros and oriental planes (Platanus orientalis) in Karkot stream and Kamara stream have survived due to the microclimatic conditions of valleys. Therefore, the valleys located both in Troodos and north foothills of the Kyrenia Mountains shed light to the times with more humidity and are the evidence for the future significance of the impacts of valleys on diversification through their vegetation geography.","[Ilseven, Serkan] Near East Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Bastas, Mert] Near East Univ, Fac Educ, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey",Near East University; Near East University,"Ilseven, S (corresponding author), Near East Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey.",silseven66@hotmail.com; mert.bastas@neu.edu.tr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,UNIV FEDERAL MATO GROSSO,BARRA DO GARCAS,"CAMPUS UNIV ARAGUAIA, INST CIENCIAS HUMANA SOCIAIS, AVE GOVERNADOR JAMIE CAMPOS, NO 6 390, BARRA DO GARCAS, CEP78600-000, BRAZIL",1809-094X,2236-9716,,REV GEOARAGUAIA,Rev.

The building roofs are the main sources of undesirable heat for buildings, especially in warm climates. This paper discusses the use and application of white roofing material in emerging economies. The use of white roofing material is a suggestion because of its cooling, evaporative and efficiency characteristics compared to traditional black roofing materials. Many research studies have shown that the darker roofing surfaces that are prevalent in many urban areas actually can increase temperature by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius to the environment surrounding these urban areas. Additionally, improved temperature control and heat reflection also work to reduce the energy requirements for the interior spaces of the structures that have white roofing surfaces. The white or lighter colored roofs tend to reflect a part of the solar radiation that strikes the roof's surface. Consequently, one might believe that white roofing material would be commonplace and especially so within emerging economies. Yet, this is hardly the case at all. This paper examines the issue of white roofing materials in emerging economies from a dual perspective. The dual perspective includes the technical details of white roofing material and its impact on lowering the interior temperature of the affected structures, which consequently reduces hours of indoor thermal discomfort and use of air conditioners in indoor spaces. The other element in this study, however, involves the marketing aspect of white roofing material. This includes its adoption, acceptance and cost-benefit in emerging economies.","[Al Fayad, Fadye] Jubail Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm, Royal Commiss Jubail, Al Jubail 35716, Saudi Arabia; [Maref, Wahid] Univ Quebec, Construct Engn Dept, Ecole Technol Super ETS, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Awad, Mohamed M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Power Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Mansoura 35516, Egypt",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"Al Fayad, F (corresponding author), Jubail Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm, Royal Commiss Jubail, Al Jubail 35716, Saudi Arabia.",Fayadf@ucj.edu.sa; Wahid.Maref@etsmtl.ca; m_m_awad@mans.edu.eg,,"AWAD, M.

Measurements of delta C-13 in tooth enamel of 136 faunal specimens from the archaeological site of Boomplaas Cave, South Africa, show significant shifts in proportions of C-3 and C-4 vegetation from the earliest deposits, probably dating to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, to the late Holocene. Vegetation communities during the Last Glacial Maximum were strongly C-3-dominated, indicating an eastward expansion of the winter rainfall zone at this time. This is consistent with climate models postulating northwards shift and/or intensification of the circumpolar westerly frontal systems during glacials. Winter rainfall and lower temperatures, both of which favour C-3 grasses, were clearly more important than lower pCO(2) (which favours C-4 grasses) in determining the nature of the vegetation. The intervals 40-36 and 17-14k cal a BP supported substantial quantities of C-4 grasses, indicating a greater proportion of summer rainfall at these times. These two intervals correspond with warmer climates as reflected in Antarctic ice cores. delta C-13 of an as yet unnamed caprine indicate that these animals were primarily C-3 grazers.

Monitoring the variability of ecological indicators, such as phytoplankton, in relation to regional environmental conditions, is the foundation for such a goal. We provide a detailed description of the phytoplankton seasonal cycle of surface waters surrounding NEOM using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) observations, based on a regionally-tuned product of the European Space Agency's Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative, at 1 km resolution, from 1997 to 2018. The analysis is also supported with in situ cruise datasets and outputs of a state-of-the-art high-resolution hydrodynamic model. The open waters of NEOM follow the oligotrophic character of the Northern Red Sea (NRS), with a peak during late winter and a minimum during late summer. Coral reef-bound regions, such as Sindala and Sharma, are characterised by higher Chl-a concentrations that peak during late summer. Most of the open waters around NEOM are influenced by the general cyclonic circulation of the NRS and local circulation features, while shallow reef-bound regions are more isolated. Our analysis provides the first description of the phytoplankton seasonality and the oceanographic conditions in NEOM, which may support the development of a regional marine conservation strategy.","[Papagiannopoulos, Nikolaos; Krokos, Georgios; Gittings, John A.; Hoteit, Ibrahim] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Earth Sci & Engn ErSE, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Raitsos, Dionysios E.] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Athens 15772, Greece; [Brewin, Robert J.

The number of flood trend studies is rapidly rising. When changes are detected, many studies link the identified change to the underlying causes, i.e. they attribute the changes in flood behaviour to certain drivers of change. We propose a hypothesis testing framework for trend attribution which consists of essential ingredients for a sound attribution: evidence of consistency, evidence of inconsistency, and provision of confidence statement. Further, we evaluate the current state-of-the-art of flood trend attribution. We assess how selected recent studies approach the attribution problem, and to which extent their attribution statements seem defendable. In our opinion, the current state of flood trend attribution is poor. Attribution statements are mostly based on qualitative reasoning or even speculation. Typically, the focus of flood trend studies is the detection of change, i.e. the statistical analysis of time series, and attribution is regarded as an appendix: (1) flood time series are analysed by means of trend tests, (2) if a significant change is detected, a hypothesis on the cause of change is given, and (3) explanations or published studies are sought which support the hypothesis. We believe that we need a change in perspective and more scientific rigour: detection should be seen as an integral part of the more challenging attribution problem, and detection and attribution should be placed in a sound hypothesis testing framework.","[Merz, B.; Vorogushyn, S.; Uhlemann, S.; Delgado, J.; Hundecha, Y.] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Merz, B (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",bmerz@gfz-potsdam.de,"Vorogushyn, Sergiy/B-9743-2014; Delgado, José Miguel/G-4975-2013","Vorogushyn, Sergiy/0000-0003-4639-7982; Delgado, José Miguel/0000-0002-1672-6004",,,,,46,130,130,2,37,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Reductions of energy demand have an important role to play in a sustainable energy transition. Here we explore the extent to which the emergence of low energy consuming practices, encompassing new behaviors and the adoption of more efficient technologies, could contribute to lowering energy demand and thereby to reducing CO2 emissions. To this end, we design three detailed energy consumption profiles which could be adopted by individuals in current and future wealthy regions. To what extent does the setting of air conditioners to higher temperatures or the widespread use of efficient showerheads reduce the aggregate energy demand? We investigate the potential of new practices at the global level for 2050 and 2100. The adoption of new, energy saving practices could reduce global energy demand from buildings by up to 47% in 2050 and 61% in 2100 compared to a scenario following current trends. This strong reduction is primarily accounted for by changes in hot water usage, insulation of buildings and consumer choices in air conditioners and heat pumps. New behaviors and efficient technologies could make a significant long-term contribution to reducing buildings' energy demand, and thus facilitate the achieval of stringent climate change mitigation targets while limiting the adverse sustainability impacts from the energy supply system.","[Levesque, Antoine; Pietzcker, Robert C.; Luderer, Gunnar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Leibniz Assoc, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Levesque, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Leibniz Assoc, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",levesque@pik-potsdam.de,"Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012; Luderer, Gunnar/ABF-2346-2020","Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Pietzcker, Robert/0000-0002-9403-6711",European Union [730403],European Union(European Commission),This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 730403 (INNOPATHS).,,68,28,28,6,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

Today, both ozone concentrations and N inputs exceeding thresholds for ecological effects are widespread and threaten the structure and function of sensitive natural and semi-natural plant communities even in remote regions. Even further increases are projected by regional and global air pollution models in several hot-spot regions. Both N input and ozone have been found separately to affect plant communities. Elevated ozone causes visible injury on leaves in sensitive species and impairs photosynthesis and transpiration, reduces leaf life span, and affects reproduction, biomass allocation and growth. In grassland communities, experimental exposure to elevated ozone consistently causes shifts in species dominance, with the effect developing more slowly in less productive, old systems, than in productive newly sown systems. There is also evidence that ozone causes slow shifts in the genetic structure of specific plant populations. As an essential nutrient, excess N causes a displacement of species characteristic of nutrient-poor conditions by a few fast growing and highly competitive species, and affects productivity and changes the quality of the forage. Where both pollutants occur together, their effects may interact, but little is known about the resulting change in ecological risks for grassland ecosystems covering large areas in many regions of the world and providing important goods and services to society. This review summarizes some of the trends observed in the exposure to these pollutants, their potential effects on semi-natural grassland ecosystems such as changes in species, productivity, water budgets and carbon storage, and it highlights the need foe ecological criteria as targets for air pollution abatement strategies with the goal to preserve biodiversity, and to maintain the functioning of grasslands on larger scales. Finally, pollutant risks may be altered by future changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 through direct effects on vegetation or indirectly through altered nutrient cycling, or through effects on the flux of ozone from the atmosphere to the site of action. This may lead to either higher or lower risks depending on region, system characteristics, and on additional human interference.","Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Res Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Fuhrer, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Res Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,53,2,2,1,23,SCIENCE PRESS BEIJING,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100707, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-03-020403-5,,,,2007,,,,,3,13,,,,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Soil Science; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture; Water Resources,BHD32,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000252307300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In terrestrial systems, restoration has emerged as a useful approach to mitigate these changes, and is increasingly recognised as a tool to fortify ecosystems against future disturbances. In marine systems, restoration is also gaining traction as a management tool, but it is still comparatively scant and underdeveloped relative to terrestrial environments. Key coastal habitats, such as seaweed forests and seagrass meadows are showing widespread patterns of decline around the world. As these important ecosystems increasingly become the target of emerging marine restoration campaigns, it is important not only to address current environmental degradation issues, but also to focus on the future. Given the rate at which marine and other environments are changing, and given predicted increases in the frequency and magnitude of multiple stressors, we argue for an urgent need for subtidal marine macrophyte restoration efforts that explicitly incorporate future-proofing in their goals. Here we highlight emerging scientific techniques that can help achieve this, and discuss changes to managerial, political and public frameworks that are needed to support scientific innovation and restoration applications at scale.","[Wood, G.; Marzinelli, E.

To address the ever-increasing demands for real-time monitoring and sufficiently handle the growing volumes of raw data, the cloud/fog computing paradigm is deemed a highly promising solution. This paper presents a WSN-based IoT system that seamlessly integrates all aforementioned technologies, having at its core the cloud/fog hybrid network architecture. The system was intensively validated using a demo prototype in the Ionian University facilities, focusing on response time, an important metric of future smart applications. Further, the developed prototype is able to autonomously adjust its sensing behavior based on the criticality of the prevailing environmental conditions, regarding one of the most notable climate hazards, wildfires. Extensive experimentation verified its efficiency and reported on its alertness and highly conforming characteristics considering the use-case scenario of Corfu Island's 2019 fire risk severity. In all presented cases, it is shown that through fog leveraging it is feasible to contrive significant delay reduction, with high precision and throughput, whilst controlling the energy consumption levels. Finally, a user-driven web interface is highlighted to accompany the system; it is capable of augmenting the data curation and visualization, and offering real-time wildfire risk forecasting based on Chandler's burning index scoring.","[Tsipis, Athanasios; Papamichail, Asterios; Angelis, Ioannis; Koufoudakis, George; Oikonomou, Konstantinos] Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, Corfu 49100, Greece; [Tsoumanis, Georgios] Univ Ioannina, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Arta 45110, Greece",Ionian University; University of Ioannina,"Tsipis, A (corresponding author), Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, Corfu 49100, Greece.",atsipis@ionio.gr; aspapa@ionio.gr; iangelis@ionio.gr; gkoufoud@ionio.gr; gtsoum@uoi.gr; okon@ionio.gr,"Tsipis, Athanasios/AAJ-4517-2021; Koufoudakis, George/AIB-7969-2022; Oikonomou, Konstantinos/AAI-6188-2020","Tsipis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5069-3376; Koufoudakis, George/0000-0003-4214-5729; Oikonomou, Konstantinos/0000-0001-7279-9710; Papamichail, Asterios/0000-0002-5729-4017; Angelis, Ioannis/0000-0002-7161-7599; Tsoumanis, Georgios/0000-0001-9010-3422",project A Pilot Wireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves - European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020 [MIS 5007309],project A Pilot Wireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves - European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020,"Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by project A Pilot Wireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves, (MIS 5007309) which is partially funded by European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020.",,133,7,7,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUL,2020,14,,,,,,3693,10.3390/en13143693,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13143693,,,35,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,MS3LW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000554183100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, data are combined from remote sensing imagery and a land surface model including state-of-the-art urban parameterization-the Town Energy Balance scheme. To (i) isolate effects of urban growth on near-surface temperature independent of atmospheric circulations and (ii) be able to run the model over a very long period without any computational cost restrictions, the land surface model is run in a stand-alone mode coupled to downscaled 40-yr ECMWF reanalysis data. BCR was considered a lumped urban volume and the rate of urbanization was assessed by estimating the percentage of impervious surfaces from Landsat images acquired for various years. Model simulations show that (i) the annual mean urban bias (AMUB) on minimum temperature is rising at a higher rate (almost 3 times more) than on maximum temperature, with a linear trend of 0.14 degrees and 0.05 degrees C (10 yr)(-1), respectively, (ii) the 40-yr AMUB on mean temperature is estimated to be 0.62 degrees C, (iii) 45% of the overall warming trend is attributed to intensifying urban heat island effects rather than to changes in local-regional climate, and (iv) during summertime, a stronger dependence between the increase of urban bias on minimum temperature and the change in percentage of impervious surfaces is found.","[Hamdi, R.; Deckmyn, A.; Termonia, P.; Demaree, G.

Marginal grabens have been the center of agricultural development around the world. This paper examines the opportunities and challenges related to natural resources in rural development and highlights the knowledge gaps and priorities for the research and development of marginal grabens with specific reference to Ethiopia's Rift Valley marginal grabens, which have sufficient land banks to accommodate irrigated agriculture. Repeated transect walks, focus group discussions and interviews carried out in Northern Ethiopia, have been employed to address these research questions, while content analyses and descriptive statistics have been used to analyze the data. This paper shows that marginal grabens are rich in blue and green waters due to their topographical and geological characteristics, and are fertile plains suitable for irrigated agriculture. However, marginal grabens can reach closing and closed basin status in arid and semi-arid environments. Salinization, waterlogging, incisions and sedimentation also threaten the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the grabens. Thus, appropriate river basin governance, integrated land management, and wise water allocation is needed to optimize land and water resources during rural development in the (semi)closed marginal grabens of northern Ethiopia and elsewhere in the world with similar geographical settings.

The knowledge of mangrove conditions is essential to know the statuses of mangroves. Recently, satellite imagery has been widely used to generate mangrove and degradation mapping. Sentinel-2 is a volume of free satellite image data that has a temporal resolution of 5 days. When Hurricane Irma hit the southwest Florida coastal zone in 2017, it caused mangrove degradation. The relationship of satellite images between pre and post-hurricane events can provide a deeper understanding of the degraded mangrove areas that were affected by Hurricane Irma. This study proposed an MDPrePost-Net that considers images before and after hurricanes to classify non-mangrove, intact/healthy mangroves, and degraded mangroves classes affected by Hurricane Irma in southwest Florida using Sentinel-2 data. MDPrePost-Net is an end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) that consists of two main sub-models. The first sub-model is a pre-post deep feature extractor used to extract the spatial-spectral-temporal relationship between the pre, post, and mangrove conditions after the hurricane from the satellite images and the second sub-model is an FCN classifier as the classification part from extracted spatial-spectral-temporal deep features. Experimental results show that the accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) score by the proposed MDPrePost-Net for degraded mangrove are 98.25% and 96.82%, respectively. Based on the experimental results, MDPrePost-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art FCN models (e.g., U-Net, LinkNet, FPN, and FC-DenseNet) in terms of accuracy metrics. In addition, this study found that 26.64% (41,008.66 Ha) of the mangrove area was degraded due to Hurricane Irma along the southwest Florida coastal zone and the other 73.36% (112,924.70 Ha) mangrove area remained intact.","[Jamaluddin, Ilham; Chen, Ying-Nong] Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Thaipisutikul, Tipajin] Mahidol Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, 999 Phuttamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Chen, Ying-Nong] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Chuang, Chi-Hung] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Appl Informat, 160 Linwei Rd, Yilan 262307, Taiwan; [Hu, Chih-Lin] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Commun Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan",National Central University; Mahidol University; National Central University; National Central University,"Chen, YN (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;Chen, YN (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.",ilhamjamaluddin09@gmail.com; tipajin.tha@mahidol.ac.th; yingnong1218@csrsr.ncu.edu.tw; chchuang@mail.fgu.edu.tw; chihlin.hu@gmail.com,,"Jamaluddin, Ilham/0000-0001-6928-4951; , YingNong/0000-0002-5448-9900; Thaipisutikul, Tipajin/0000-0002-2538-1108",Ministry of Science and Technology,"Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",FundingThe work was funded by supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology under grant no.

Coccolithophores are the most prominent members of this group, being well adapted to low-nutrients environments (e.g., subtropical gyres). Despite urgent concerns, their response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (pCO(2)) and ocean acidification is still poorly understood, and short-term experiments may not extrapolate into longer-term climatic adaptation. Current atmospheric pCO(2) (similar to 390 ppmv) is unprecedented since at least 3 million years ago (Ma), and levels projected for the next century were last seen more than 34 Ma. Hence, a deep-time perspective is needed to understand the long-term effects of high pCO(2) on the biosphere. Here we combine a comprehensive fossil data set on coccolithophore cell size with a novel measure of ecological prominence: Summed Common Species Occurrence Rate (SCOR). The SCOR is decoupled from species richness, and captures changes in the extent to which coccolithophores were common and widespread, based on global occurrences in deep-sea sediments. The size and SCOR records are compared to state-of-the-art data on climatic and environmental changes from 50 to 5 Ma. We advance beyond simple correlations and trends to quantify the relative strength and directionality of information transfer among these records. Coccolithophores were globally more common and widespread, larger, and more heavily calcified in the pre-34 Ma greenhouse world, and declined along with pCO(2) during the Oligocene (34-23 Ma). Our results suggest that atmospheric pCO(2) has exerted an important long-term control on coccolithophores, directly through its availability for photosynthesis or indirectly via weathering supply of resources for growth and calcification.","[Hannisdal, Bjarte] Univ Bergen, Ctr Geobiol, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Henderiks, Jorijntje] Uppsala Univ, Palaeobiol Programme, Dept Earth Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Henderiks, Jorijntje; Liow, Lee Hsiang] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Bergen; Uppsala University; University of Oslo,"Hannisdal, B (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Ctr Geobiol, Dept Earth Sci, Allegaten 41, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",bjarte.hannisdal@geo.uib.no,"Henderiks, Jorijntje/ABB-1080-2020; Liow, Lee Hsiang/E-3481-2010","Henderiks, Jorijntje/0000-0001-9486-6275; Liow, Lee Hsiang/0000-0002-3732-6069",US National Science Foundation; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation [KAW 2009.0287]; Norwegian Resesarch Council [197823/V40],US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); Norwegian Resesarch Council,"This research used samples provided by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP).

Despite the fact that structural measures such as flood walls and embankments play a vital role in disaster mitigation, it is observed that there is a gap in the development of effective, sustainable, and state of the art structural measures in Sri Lanka. This paper, in this context, aims to assess the nature of existing structural measures in the country in order to highlight what improvements are needed, and the costs and benefits of the necessary improvements. This is achieved through a comprehensive literature review followed by the analysis of twelve semi-structured interviews conducted with experts in the subject of structural measures for disaster mitigation. The findings reveal that Sri Lanka has sufficient types of structural measures in relation to floods, landslides, and coastline erosion compared to other developing countries. However, age and outdated technology are critical issues that hinder the expected performance of the measures. Moreover, it is observed that sufficient structural measures for mitigating the risk of drought related disasters are not in place in Sri Lanka compared to measures for other hydrometeorological hazards. The key benefits of improving structural measures in the country are identified as land development, economic growth, and increased stability of cities, and the main costs and challenges are high initial capital cost, high maintenance and repair cost, and the negligible residual value of structural measures. The findings of this study will lead to gaining a comprehensive understanding of gaps and weaknesses in structural measures in Sri Lanka and will influence policymakers and other respective practitioners in disaster mitigation to effectively enhance the existing portfolio of such measures.","[Ginige, Kanchana] Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mendis, Kalindu; Thayaparan, Menaha] Univ Moratuwa, Fac Architecture, Dept Bldg Econ, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka",Northumbria University; University Moratuwa,"Ginige, K (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",kanchana.ginige@northumbria.ac.uk; mendisapkd.20@uom.lk; mthayaparan@uom.lk,,"Mendis, A.P.K.D./0000-0002-4090-4923",,,,,103,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-0617,,,PROG DISASTER SCI,Prog.

Lead Free Solder joint,DEFORMATION; BEHAVIOR,"Electronic parts in military, automotive, avionics and space applications may be subjected to sustained operation at high temperature in addition to high strain-rate loads. Parts may be stored in non-climate-controlled enclosures prior to deployment. Earlier studies on undoped SAC alloys have shown that the material properties evolve after prolonged period of storage at even modest temperatures. In order to mitigate the aging effects, a number of alloy formulation have been proposed. Data of the mechanical properties of lead-free solder alloys which is used for interconnection in the electronic packaging at high strain rates and at high storage temperature is very essential for design optimization of electronic package sustainability at extreme temperature environment because the SAC solders have shown to have degradation in mechanical properties at prolonged exposure to storage temperature. Industries have come up with a solution to reduce the degradation using dopants in SAC solder. In this study, a doped SAC solder called SAC-R (Ecolloy) has been subjected to high strain rate testing after keeping them in storage at temperature of 50 degrees C for 1 - 8months. Samples with no aging and aged samples for up to 8-months have been subjected to uniaxial tensile tests to measure the mechanical properties of SAC-R for High and Low operating temperature ranging from -65 degrees C to 200 degrees C. The material data has been used to compute the constants for the Anand Visco-Plasticity model. The ability of the model to represent the material constitutive behavior has been quantified by comparing the model predictions of the uniaxial tensile test with the experimental data","[Lall, Pradeep; Saha, Mrinmoy; Suhling, Jeff] Auburn Univ, NSF CAVE3 Elect Res Ctr, Dept Mech Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Blecker, Ken] Us Army Combat Capabil Dev Command Armament Ctr, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; National Science Foundation (NSF),"Lall, P (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, NSF CAVE3 Elect Res Ctr, Dept Mech Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",lall@auburn.edu,"Saha, Mrinmoy/AGM-4024-2022",,SERC ART-001 titled - Characterization of Emerging Technologies in Military Environments from Combat Capabilities Development Command - Armament Center,SERC ART-001 titled - Characterization of Emerging Technologies in Military Environments from Combat Capabilities Development Command - Armament Center,"SERC ART-001 titled - Characterization of Emerging Technologies in Military Environments from Combat Capabilities Development Command - Armament Center, supported the project.

The North Atlantic region experienced abrupt high-amplitude cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas stadial. However, due to chronological uncertainties in the available terrestrial records it is unclear whether terrestrial ecosystem response to this event was instantaneous and spatially synchronous, or whether regional or time-transgressive lags existed. Here we use new palynological results from a robustly dated lake sediment sequence retrieved from lake Hamelsee (north Germany) to show that vegetation change started at 12,820 cal. yr BP, concurrent with the onset of changes in local climate. A comparison of the Hamelsee results to a compilation of precisely dated palynological records shows instant and, within decadal-scale dating uncertainty, synchronous response of the terrestrial plant community to Late-Glacial climate change across northwest Europe. The results indicate that the environmental impact of climate cooling was more severe than previously thought and illustrates the sensitivity of natural terrestrial ecosystems to external forcing.","[Engels, Stefan; Peters, Tom; ter Schure, Anneke T.

Failure to account for their influence may help to explain why state-of-the-art fire models do not simulate the length and timing of the fire season or interannual variability in burnt area well. We investigated the impact of accounting for different timescales of fuel production and accumulation on burnt area using a suite of random forest regression models that included the immediate impact of climate, vegetation, and human influences in a given month and tested the impact of various combinations of antecedent conditions in four productivity-related vegetation indices and in antecedent moisture conditions. Analyses were conducted for the period from 2010 to 2015 inclusive. Inclusion of antecedent vegetation conditions representing fuel build-up led to an improvement of the global, climatological out-of-sample R-2 from 0.579 to 0.701, but the inclusion of antecedent vegetation conditions on timescales >= 1 year had no impact on simulated burnt area. Current moisture levels were the dominant influence on fuel drying. Additionally, antecedent moisture levels were important for fuel build-up. The models also enabled the visualisation of interactions between variables, such as the importance of antecedent productivity coupled with instantaneous drying. The length of the period which needs to be considered varies across biomes; fuel-limited regions are sensitive to antecedent conditions that determine fuel build-up over longer time periods (similar to 4 months), while moisture-limited regions are more sensitive to current conditions that regulate fuel drying.","[Kuhn-Regnier, Alexander; Voulgarakis, Apostolos; Prentice, I.

In the present study, the remote influence of the tropical atmospheric circulation is evaluated in ensembles of global boreal summer simulations in which the Arpege-Climat atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM) is nudged towards 6-h reanalyses. The nudging is applied either in the whole tropical band or in a regional summer monsoon domain. Sensitivity tests to the experimental design are first conducted using prescribed climatological SST. They show that the tropical relaxation does not improve the zonal mean extratropical climatology but does lead to a significantly improved representation of the mid-latitude stationary waves in both hemispheres. Low-pass filtering of the relaxation fields has no major effect on the model response, suggesting that high-frequency tropical variability is not responsible for extratropical biases. Dividing the nudging strength by a factor 10 only decreases the magnitude of the response. Model errors in each monsoon domain contribute to deficiencies in the model's mid-latitude climatology, although an exaggerated large-scale subsidence in the central equatorial Pacific appears as the main source of errors for the representation of stationary waves in the Arpege-Climat model. Case studies are then conducted using either climatological or observed SST. The focus is first on summer 2003 characterized by a strong and persistent anticyclonic anomaly over western Europe. This pattern is more realistic in nudging experiments than in simulations only driven by observed SST, especially when the nudging domain is centred over Central America. Other case studies also show a significant tropical forcing of the summer mid-latitude stationary waves and suggest a weak influence of prescribed observed SST in the northern extratropics. Results therefore indicate that improving the tropical divergent circulation and its response to tropical SST anomalies remains a key issue for increasing the skill of extratropical seasonal predictions, not only in the winter hemisphere but also in the boreal summer hemisphere where the prediction of heatwave and drought likelihood is expected to become an important challenge with increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.","[Douville, Herve] CNRM GMGEC VDR, F-31057 Toulouse 01, France; [Douville, Herve; Bielli, S.; Deque, M.; Tyteca, S.; Voldoire, A.] Meteo France CNRM GAME, F-31057 Toulouse 01, France; [Cassou, C.] CNRS Cerfacs, F-31057 Toulouse 01, France; [Hall, N.

Both aquaplanet and Held-Suarez experiments are performed using the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A) hydrostatic dynamical core implemented within the National Science Foundation Department of Energy (NSF-DOE) Community Atmosphere Model (CAM-MPAS-A). In the real world, midlatitude eddy activity is organized by orography, land sea contrasts, and sea surface temperature anomalies. In these zonally symmetric idealized settings, transients should have an equal probability of occurring at any longitude. However, the use of a variable-resolution mesh with a circular high-resolution region centered at 30 degrees N results in a maximum in eddy kinetic energy on the eastern side and downstream of this high-resolution region in both aquaplanet and Held Suarez CAM-MPAS-A simulations. The presence of a geographically confined maximum in both simulations suggests this response is mainly attributable to CAM-MPAS-A's ability to resolve eddies via the model dynamics as resolution increases. However, in the aquaplanet simulation, a secondary maximum in eddy kinetic energy is present, which is probably linked to the resolution dependencies of the CAM physics. These mesh responses must be considered when interpreting real-world variable-resolution CAM-MPAS-A simulations, particularly in climate change experiments.","[Rauscher, Sara A.; Ringler, Todd D.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Fluid Dynam & Solid Mech Grp, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Rauscher, SA (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, 219 Pearson Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",rauscher@udel.edu,,,DOE [07SCPF152],DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank three anonymous reviewers for their comments that greatly helped to improve the quality of this manuscript.

Simulations of the cloud phase partitioning between liquid and ice hydrometeors in state-of-the-art global climate models are still associated with large biases. In this study, the phase partitioning in terms of liquid mass phase ratio (MPRliq, defined as the ratio of liquid mass to total condensed water mass) simulated from the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) is evaluated against the observational data from A-Train satellite remote sensors. Modeled MPRliq is significantly lower than observations on the global scale, especially in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Southern Ocean and the Antarctic). Sensitivity tests with CAM5 are conducted to investigate the distinct contributions of heterogeneous ice nucleation, shallow cumulus detrainment, and large-scale environment (e.g., winds, temperature, and water vapor) to the low MPRliq biases. Our results show that an aerosol-aware ice nucleation parameterization increases the MPRliq especially at temperatures colder than -20 degrees C and significantly improves the model agreements with observations in the Polar regions in summer. The decrease of threshold temperature over which all detrained cloud water is liquid from 268 to 253K enhances the MPRliq and improves the MPRliq mostly over the Southern Ocean. By constraining water vapor in CAM5 toward reanalysis, modeled low biases in many geographical regions are largely reduced through a significant decrease of cloud ice mass mixing ratio.","[Wang, Yong] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong; Zhang, Damao; Liu, Xiaohong; Wang, Zhien] Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Zhang, Damao] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA",Tsinghua University; University of Wyoming; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory,"Liu, XH (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",xliu6@uwyo.edu,"Wang, Zhien/AAN-2341-2020; Liu, Xiaohong/E-9304-2011; Wang, Zhien/AAB-1528-2021; Wang, Zhien/F-4857-2011; Zhang, Damao/A-2900-2016","Liu, Xiaohong/0000-0002-3994-5955; Wang, Zhien/0000-0003-3871-3834; Zhang, Damao/0000-0002-3518-292X; Wang, Yong/0000-0002-5831-9466",U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research Program [DE-SC0014239]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41605074]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602103],U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"The authors acknowledge the support of the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric System Research Program (grant DE-SC0014239).

This study focuses on a mixed unattached loose-lying red algal community of Furcellaria lumbricalis in close association with Coccotylus truncatus that is found in the West Estonian Archipelago Sea, NE Baltic Sea. In Estonian coastal waters, the wild harvest of F. lumbricalis started in 1960s and it has since been used as raw material for furcellaran production. The aim of this study was to determine how ocean acidification may impact the balance of these two red algal species in the community. Mechanistic assessment of the carbon physiology of F. lumbricalis and C. truncatus was used to predict productivity and competitive interactions between these species in a high-CO2 world. Carbon use strategies in macroalgae were determined by analysing the natural abundances of carbon isotopes (delta C-13), pH drift experiments and photosynthesis vs. dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) curves. Photosynthesis of F. lumbricalis (operating with a CO2 concentrating mechanism or CCM) performed worse along the broader range of DIC concentrations compared to C. truncatus (non-CCM), especially those characterized under future climate conditions. Therefore, changing seawater carbon chemistry through ocean acidification has the potential to influence the balance of F. lumbricalis and C. truncatus in the community and the efficiency of the wild harvest of this community and the quality of product provided.","[Pajusalu, Liina; Albert, Gerli; Kotta, Jonne; Liversage, Kiran; Paalme, Tiina; Peterson, Anneliis; Pollumae, Arno; Torn, Kaire; Martin, Georg] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Fachon, Evangeline] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Hepburn, Christopher D.; Pritchard, Daniel W.] Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Pritchard, Daniel W.] Te Runanga Ngai Tahu, Te Ao Turoa, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Otago,"Pajusalu, L (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",liina.pajusalu@ut.ee,"Pajusalu, Liina/AFU-8014-2022; Kotta, Jonne/B-5542-2009","Kotta, Jonne/0000-0002-4970-6755; , Liina/0000-0003-4495-9072; Torn, Kaire/0000-0002-7490-5238","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration though BONUS MARES project, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185)","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration though BONUS MARES project, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185)","This study was carried out during the training workshop 'Diversity of carbon use strategies in a different macrophyte communities in the NE Baltic Sea', held in the Koiguste field station of the Estonian Marine Institute, University of Tartu on Saaremaa Island in July 2018.

At the same time, the construction industry accounts for 40 percent of the energy consumption and 30 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world, mainly caused during the operation of buildings [1]. Therefore, energy efficient construction is a significant contribution to climate protection, but at the same time leads to cost savings for the operator of the building. Environmental challenges together with the trend to further urbanization are leading to an increasing demand for sustainable buildings today. The EcoCommercial Building Program of Bayer MaterialScience is designed to offer state-of-the-art solutions for sustainable, environmentally beneficial and economical construction through an innovative forward-marketing concept involving a broad expert network along the value chain of the construction industry. It addresses professional construction investors and decision makers and provides access to an expert network as a comprehensive contact hub for construction decision makers, with the emphasis on design, consulting, services and products. Vital to the success is a comprehensive planning and realization approach with integrated design-material solutions. Bayer itself leveraged this network by realizing its own buildings far beyond existing standards. Recently, a low-emission administrative building near Brussels, Belgium, and a zero-emission kindergarten close to Cologne, Germany, have started operation. The additional energy-relevant investments account for approximately 10 to 15 percent of the total investment and will have amortized in significantly less than ten years. Assuming a service life of 30 years or more, the implemented sustainability measures contribute to a competitive advantage for more than two thirds of a building's life time.","[Braig, Thomas; Utsch, Ruediger] Bayer Mat Sci AG, EcoCommercial Bldg Program EMEA, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany",Bayer AG,"Braig, T (corresponding author), Bayer Mat Sci AG, EcoCommercial Bldg Program EMEA, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany.",thomas.braig@bayerbms.com; ruediger.utsch@bayerbms.com; oliver.bruns@baysystems.cz,,,,,,,3,1,1,1,12,CZECH TECHNICAL UNIV PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"ZIKOVA 4, PRAGUE 6 166 35, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-247-3624-2,,,,2010,,,,,243,246,,,,,,4,"Construction & Building Technology; Ecology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BTY08,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000288408300052,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data sets compared reflect two different sampling strategies and three different grid interpolation methods. In order to separate the influence of sampling and interpolation uncertainties, one of the data sets (produced by the Met Office) has been recreated using the sampling strategy of stations used in the European (E-OBS) data set. The results confirm and build upon previous studies showing that relying on a relatively sparse but homogeneous network of stations limits the ability of the resulting data set to reliably estimate extreme rainfall at the daily timescale. It is shown that gridding methods that additionally make use of reference climatological data can avoid systematic bias in both the average and extreme events even when using a relatively sparse network of observations.

Such an anomalous window is a group of contiguous spatial objects indicating the occurrence of unusual phenomenon in terms of multiple variables. The paper presents a novel Robust non-parametric Multivariate Scan Statistic (RMSS). In contrast to the existing work, the authors' approach is designed to deal with anomalous window discovery in multivariate data. They propose their multivariate scan statistic that employs the robust Mahalanobis distance which enables taking into account multiple behavioral attributes at the same time and their correlations for the discovery of significant anomalous windows. The proposed multivariate scan statistic is non-parametric such that it does not rely on any prior assumption about the data distribution. It is robust such that it can handle data with large amount of outliers, up to 50% of the overall data size. It is also affine equivariant such that affine transformation such as stretch or rotation of the data would not affect the results. The authors evaluate their approach with (a) real-world multivariate climate data for discovering natural disasters and climate changes, (b) real-world multivariate traffic accident data for identifying accident hubs, which are route segments with underlying accident-prone issues, and (c) synthetic data of both continuous and discrete multivariate distribution for identifying clusters of known outliers under different outlier percentage in data. They compare their results to state of the art multivariate scan statistic method (Kulldorff et al., 2007). The evaluation shows the detection power of the authors' method, and the significant improvement over the existing methods.","[Shi, Lei; Janeja, Vandana P.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Informat Syst, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Shi, L (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Informat Syst, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA.",,,"Janeja, Vandana/0000-0003-0130-6135",,,,,24,0,0,0,1,IGI PUBL,HERSHEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",1548-3924,,,INT J DATA WAREHOUS,Int.

This can be extremely important, as the background concentration is the level below which concentrations cannot be reduced by local efforts alone. In discussing background ozone, it is important to be clear what is meant by the term. Slightly different interpretations of the exact understanding of what constitutes background widen the uncertainty in reported values. Nevertheless, the central tendency to reported background ozone concentrations may be estimated as 25 to 40 ppb for measurements made worldwide. The large majority of recently reported work indicates that these background concentrations are increasing at a rate ranging up to about 0.3 to 0.5 ppb per year. Ozone lifted to levels above the boundary layer can be transported very long (intercontinental) distances. As a result, Asia, North America, and Europe can all contribute to each other's background ozone concentrations. In this context, the rapid industrial growth in Asia and the expected accompanying increased precursor emissions, could prove to be significant.","[Reid, N.] Smeraldo Environm, Toronto, ON M4J 2X2, Canada; [Yap, D.; Bloxam, R.] Ontario Minist Environm, Toronto, ON M9P 3V6, Canada",,"Reid, N (corresponding author), Smeraldo Environm, 46 4 Oaks Gate, Toronto, ON M4J 2X2, Canada.",nwreid@sympatico.ca,,,,,,,40,26,26,5,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1873-9318,1873-9326,,AIR QUAL ATMOS HLTH,Air Qual.

Within this context, this manuscript evaluates the effect of incorporating PCM-wallboards in low-rise air-conditioned residential heavyweight buildings in Kuwait. Using an EnergyPlus single-zone model, a parametric study is performed considering several window-to-wall ratios (WWRs), different solar orientations and some PCM-wallboards configurations. The main study goals are to: (i) explore the validity of a single PCM-wallboard solution that can be universally applied throughout residential buildings in Kuwait; (ii) evaluate the impact of PCMwallboard on the reduction of both cooling demand and peak-loads; (iii) provide some guidelines for incorporating PCM-wallboards in Kuwait. Following an extensive parametric study, a 4 cm thick PCM-wallboard with a melting-peak temperature of 24 A degrees C yielded the lowest annual cooling demand across a variety of room orientations and WWRs assuming cooling setpoint of 24 A degrees C.

Cirrus cloud microphysical properties are difficult to measure and model because they are inhomogeneous in nature and their ice crystal size distribution and habit are not well characterized. Accurate retrievals of cloud properties are crucial for improving the representation of cloud-scale processes in large-scale models and for accurately predicting the Earth's future climate. A number of passive and active remote sensing retrieval algorithms exist for estimating the microphysical properties of upper-tropospheric clouds. We believe significant progress has been made in the evolution of these retrieval algorithms in the last decade; however, there is room for improvement. Members of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Cloud Properties Working Group are involved in an intercomparison of optical depth (tau) and ice water path in ice clouds retrieved using ground-based instruments. The goals of this intercomparison are to evaluate the accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms, quantify the uncertainties, and make recommendations for their improvement. Currently, there are significant discrepancies among the algorithms for ice clouds with very small optical depths (tau < 0.3) and those with 1 < tau < 5. The good news is that for thin clouds (0.3 < tau < 1), the algorithms tend to converge. In this first stage of the intercomparison, we present results from a representative case study, compare the retrieved cloud properties with aircraft and satellite measurements, and perform a radiative closure experiment to begin gauging the accuracy of these retrieval algorithms.","Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; Atmospher & Environm Res Inc, Lexington, MA USA; Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA; Desert Res Inst, Reno, NV USA; Univ Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Atmospheric & Environmental Research; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Wyoming,"Comstock, JM (corresponding author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, POB 999,MSIN K9-24, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",jennifer.comstock@pnl.gov,"Minnis, Patrick/G-1902-2010; McFarlane, Sally/C-3944-2008; Shupe, Matthew/F-8754-2011; Wang, Zhien/AAB-1528-2021; Turner, David D/E-5180-2016; Wang, Zhien/F-4857-2011; Matrosov, Sergey Y/O-2648-2017; Wang, Zhien/AAN-2341-2020","Minnis, Patrick/0000-0002-4733-6148; Shupe, Matthew/0000-0002-0973-9982; Turner, David D/0000-0003-1097-897X; Wang, Zhien/0000-0003-3871-3834; Matrosov, Sergey Y/0000-0003-4816-1375; Comstock, Jennifer/0000-0002-4183-7355",,,,,73,63,64,0,18,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Verified by radiosonde, including GPS/MET observations into the analysis makes an overall improvement to the analysis variables of temperature, winds, and water vapor. However, the variational model with the ray-tracing method is quite expensive for numerical weather prediction and climate research. For example, about 4 000 CPS/MET refraction angles need to be assimilated to produce an ideal global analysis. Just one iteration of minimization will take more than 24 hours CPU time on the NCEP's Cray C90 computer. Although efforts have been taken to reduce the computational cost, it is still prohibitive for operational data assimilation. In this paper, a parallel version of the three-dimensional variational data assimilation model of GPS/MET occultation measurement suitable for massive parallel processors architectures is developed. The divide-and-conquer strategy is used to achieve parallelism and is implemented by message passing. The authors present the principles for the code's design and examine the performance on the state-of-the-art parallel computers in China. The results show that this parallel model scales favorably as the number of processors is increased. With the Memory-IO technique implemented by the author, the wall clock time per iteration used for assimilating 1420 refraction angles is reduced from 45 s to 12 s using 1420 processors. This suggests that the new parallelized code has the potential to be useful in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate studies.","Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Ctr Computat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Pure & Appl Math, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zhang, X (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Ctr Computat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Pure & Appl Math, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",zhangx@math.pku.edu.cn,"Wang, Bin/D-9724-2012; Wang, Bin/P-9121-2014","Wang, Bin/0000-0002-3133-7197; Wang, Bin/0000-0001-7374-3786",,,,,19,9,11,0,1,SCIENCE CHINA PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

Hydrological models (either lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models or physically based distributed models) can be used to simulate streamflows and update catchment conditions (e.g. soil moisture status) using rainfall records and other catchment data. However, in order to use any hydrological model for skillful seasonal forecasting, rainfall forecast at relevant spatial and/or temporal scales is required. Together with downscaling, general circulation models are probably the only tools for making such seasonal predictions. The Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA) is a state-of-the-art seasonal climate forecast system developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Based on the preliminary assessment on the performance of existing statistical downscaling methods used in Australia, this paper is devoted to develop an analogue downscaling method by modifying the Euclidian distance in the selection of similar weather pattern. Such a modification consists of multivariate Box-Cox transformation and then standardization to make the resulted POAMA and observed climate pattern more similar. For the predictors used in Timbal and Fernadez (CAWCR Technical Report No. 004, 2008), we also considered whether the POAMA precipitation provides useful information in the analogue method. Using the high quality station data in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia, we found that the modified analogue method has potential to improve the seasonal precipitation forecast using POAMA outputs. Finally, we found that in the analogue method, the precipitation from POAMA should not be used in the calculation of similarity. The findings would then help to improve the seasonal forecast of streamflows in Australia.","[Shao, Quanxi; Li, Ming] CSIRO Math Informat & Stat, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Shao, QX (corresponding author), CSIRO Math Informat & Stat, Private Bag 5, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia.",Quanxi.shao@csiro.au,"Li, Ming/A-7655-2010; Shao, Quanxi/A-2028-2009","Shao, Quanxi/0000-0002-9768-137X",Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA),Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA),"This research is supported by the Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA) between the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) Water Division and the CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship Program.

Field studies are usually combined with conceptual and mathematical models as the most effective way to understand and predict natural regeneration. In the case of the boreal forest, several important issues arise in the design of regeneration models and are reviewed here. The most important concerns the trade-off between complexity and portability. Complex models may mimic natural systems more closely than do simpler models, but this realism comes at a cost in terms of the volume of data necessary for their calibration. A second issue is that most regeneration models have been scaled to problems at the tree and stand level, but recent interest in landscape-level issues requires models applicable to this higher spatial scale. Finally, the conceptual framework underlying most regeneration models may need to be revisited in light of recent efforts to depict vegetation dynamics under changing climatic regimes. It is unlikely that any single modeling approach will prove adequate for modeling natural regeneration under all conditions, and we provided guidelines as to how to create effective regeneration models.","[Blanco, Juan A.; Welham, Clive; Kimmins, J.

Given the profound impacts associated with flood disasters, it is crucial to evaluate the capability of state-of-the-art weather models in predicting these hydrometeorological events. This study utilizes an object-based approach to evaluate short range (<12 h) hourly forecast precipitation from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) versus observations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Stage IV precipitation analysis. For both datasets, a binary precipitation field is delineated using thresholds that span trace to extreme precipitation rates. Next, spatial metrics of area, perimeter, solidity, elongation, and fragmentation, as well as centroid positions for the forecast and observed fields are calculated. A Mann-Whitney U-test reveals biases (using a confidence level of 90%) related to the spatial attributes and locations of model forecast precipitation. Results indicate that traditional pixel-based precipitation verification metrics are limited in their ability to quantify and characterize model skill. In contrast, an object-based methodology offers encouraging results in that the HRRR can skillfully predict the extreme precipitation rates that are anticipated with anthropogenic climate change. Yet, there is still room for improvement, since model forecasts of extreme convective rainfall tend to be slightly too numerous and fragmented compared with observations. Lastly, results are sensitive to the HRRR model's representation of synoptic-scale and mesoscale processes. Therefore, detailed surface analyses and an ingredients-based approach should remain central to the process of forecasting excessive rainfall.","[Zick, Stephanie E.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Geog, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Zick, SE (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Geog, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",sezick@vt.edu,"Zick, Stephanie/B-1841-2013","Zick, Stephanie/0000-0002-8575-6100",,,,,61,1,1,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,FEB,2020,2,,,,,,136,10.3390/atmos11020136,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11020136,,,25,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KT8CF,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000519238800094,View Full Record in Web of Science

Literature focuses on PV fault diagnosis using dedicated on-site sensors or high-frequency current and voltage measurements. Although these existing techniques are accurate, they are not economical for widespread adoption, leaving many PV systems unmonitored. In contrast, we introduce a machine learning based technique that relies on satellite weather data and low-frequency inverter measurements for accurate fault diagnosis of PV systems. This allows one to adopt machine learning based fault diagnosis even for PV systems without on-site sensors. The proposed approach relies on a recurrent neural network to identify six relevant types of faults, based on the past 24 h of measurements, as opposed to only taking into account the most recent measurement. Additionally, whereas state-of-the-art methods are limited to identifying the fault type, our model also estimates the output power reduction stemming from the fault, i.e., the fault severity. Comprehensive experiments on a simulated PV system demonstrate that this approach is sensitive to faults with a severity as small as 5%, reaching an accuracy of 96.9% +/- 1.3% using exact weather data and 86.4% +/- 2.1% using satellite weather data. Finally, we show that the model generalizes well to climates other than the climate of its training data and that the model is also able to detect unknown faults, i.e., faults that were not represented in the training data.","[Van Gompel, Jonas; Spina, Domenico; Develder, Chris] Univ Ghent, IDLab, Dept Informat Technol, IMEC, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; IMEC,"Van Gompel, J (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, IDLab, Dept Informat Technol, IMEC, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",Jonas.VanGompel@UGent.be,"Develder, Chris/S-6359-2019; Spina, Domenico/T-3431-2019","Develder, Chris/0000-0003-2707-4176; Spina, Domenico/0000-0003-2379-5259; Van Gompel, Jonas/0000-0002-4253-5842","DAPPER project - Flux50 and Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Belgium [HBC.2020.2144]","DAPPER project - Flux50 and Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Belgium","This work was supported by the DAPPER project, which is financed by Flux50 and Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Belgium (project number HBC.2020.2144).

The main focuses of the analyses are the power generation mix in 2030, and particularly electricity supply shares of nuclear power. The options proposed by the government assume drastic energy efficiency improvements, increase in renewable energy, and deep CO2 emission reductions. Considerable energy savings are assumed by the government even in the baseline scenario, and these are inconsistent with historical growth trends for GDP and power demand. We modify the energy savings baseline scenario for consistency with the historical trends and historical electricity savings after the nuclear power accident. In order to provide a wider array of options, particularly those with fewer negative impacts on GDP, this paper proposes alternative options under a revised baseline. In the alternative options, we assume lower shares of renewable energy in electricity supply and lower carbon price. The economic impacts for the alternative options are much smaller than those assumed by the government. The economic analyses provided in this paper will help future policy making for energy and environment in Japan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach This study mainly adopted a quantitative research methodology through a comprehensive simulation study on a selected prototype building. The energy plus simulation tool in DesignBuilder was used to predict the average monthly and annual thermal comfort of a typical residential building in the study area. Also, a cost analysis of the final optimization interventions was conducted to estimate the construction cost savings. Findings The comparative analysis of simulation results for the base-case and optimized models indicates potential advantages in replacing conventional building envelope materials with indigenous materials. The base-case simulation results showed that the annual operative temperature is more than the adaptive thermal comfort set points in tropical climates, by 8.26%. This often leads to interventions using mechanical cooling systems, thus triggering overconsumption of energy and increase in CO2 emissions. The building envelope materials for floor, walls and roof were replaced with low U-values indigenous materials until considerable results in terms of thermal comfort and overall building construction cost were achieved. The final simulation results showed that using indigenous materials for the ground floor, external walls and roof could substantially reduce the annual operative temperature by 8%, thereby increasing the predicted three months of thermal comfort in the base-case to nine months annually. Likewise, there was a 32.31%, 35.78% and 41.81% reduction in the annual CO2 emissions, cooling loads and construction costs, respectively. Originality/value The knowledge of indigenous materials as an alternative to conventional materials for sustainable buildings is not new. However, most of the available research is focused on achieving affordable housing. There is a dearth of research showing the extent that these indigenous materials can be used to improve indoor thermal comfort in developing countries with tropical climates such as Nigeria.","[Jegede, Olumide Ebenezer; Taki, Ahmad] De Montfort Univ, Fac Art Design & Humanities, Leicester Sch Architecture, Leicester, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Jegede, OE (corresponding author), De Montfort Univ, Fac Art Design & Humanities, Leicester Sch Architecture, Leicester, Leics, England.",jegedeolu@gmail.com,,"Taki, Ahmad/0000-0001-7618-8706",,,,,52,2,2,3,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-4708,,,INT J BUILD PATHOL,Int.

In this article, a lightweight deep-learning-based framework is proposed to detect cloud in remote sensing imagery. First, a multiple features fusion strategy is designed to extract learnable manual features and convolution features from visible and near-infrared bands. Then, a lightweight fully convolutional neural network (ClouDet) with a microarchitecture named dilated separable convolutional module is used to extract the multiscale contextual information and gradually recovers segmentation results with the same size as input image, which is more effective for large-scale cloud detection with larger receptive field, less parameters, and lower compute complexity. Third, context pooling is designed to amend the possible misjudgments. Visual and quantitative comparison experiments are conducted on several public cloud detection datasets, which indicates that our proposed method can accurately detect clouds under different conditions, which is more effective and accurate than the compared state-of-the-art methods.","[Guo, Hongwei; Bai, Hongyang] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China; [Qin, Weiwei] Xian Res Inst High Tech, Xian 710025, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Bai, HY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.",njustghw@njust.edu.cn; hongyang@njust.edu.cn; qww_1982@163.com,,"Guo, Hongwei/0000-0002-9766-6241; bai, hongyang/0000-0002-9978-8250",National Natural Science Foundation of China [U2031138],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U2031138.,,47,2,2,7,28,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

A variety of quantum systems, such as atom interferometry and on-chip-Bose-Einstein condensates have thus far been investigated to this aim. Here, we propose a new method which involves using a quantum optomechanical system for measurements of gravitational acceleration. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate the fundamental sensitivity for gravitational accelerometry of a cavity optomechanical system with a trilinear radiation pressure light-matter interaction. The phase of the optical output encodes the gravitational acceleration g and is the only component which needs to be measured. We prove analytically that homodyne detection is the optimal readout method and we predict an ideal fundamental sensitivity of Delta g = 10(-15) ms(-2) for state-of-the-art parameters of optomechanical systems, showing that they could, in principle, surpass the best atomic interferometers even for low optical intensities. Further, we show that the scheme is strikingly robust to the initial thermal state of the oscillator.","[Qvarfort, Sofia; Serafini, Alessio; Barker, P.

Our findings are that it is quite possible to open up more traditional or narrow mindsets of engineering and management to more broad and multi-scientific approaches, relevant in our complex world. An entrepreneurial mindset has close links to innovation and is characterized by relentless pursuit of opportunities, thinking different, intuitive and executive, is risk-taking and eliminates pre-existing routines. It focuses more on technology and business creation than on state-of-the art technology and business administration.

Solar-driven strategies have the potential to convert CO2 and solar energy to fuels and chemicals. In this forward-looking perspective, a framework is outlined to achieve a net-zero emissionblueprint by sorting out the raw sources, potential products, feasible pathways, and practical implementation through photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, and photoelectrochemical catalysis techniques. We comprehensively inspect and compare the state-of-art works in this framework, including solardriven C-1 fuel production from CO2, as well as direct and stepwise C-2+ fuel production involving solar-driven C-1 conversion. This analysis aspires to provide the most feasible pathway forward and finds that converting CO2 with renewable H-2 into C-1 can currently obtain the best solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency and that stepwise C2+ fuel production can target products with high selectivity. Future visions on scientific, technological, and economic issues are put forward to determine what should be the focus in the following decades.","[Lin, Huiwen; Zhang, Huabin] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, KAUST Catalysis Ctr KCC, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Lin, Huiwen; Luo, Shunqin; Ye, Jinhua] Natl Inst Mat Sci NIMS, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton WPI MANA, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Luo, Shunqin; Ye, Jinhua] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Chem Sci & Engn, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600814, Japan",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; National Institute for Materials Science; Hokkaido University,"Zhang, HB (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, KAUST Catalysis Ctr KCC, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.;Ye, JH (corresponding author), Natl Inst Mat Sci NIMS, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton WPI MANA, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan.;Ye, JH (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Chem Sci & Engn, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600814, Japan.",huabin.zhang@kaust.edu.sa; jinhua.ye@nims.go.jp,,"zhang, huabin/0000-0003-1601-2471; Luo, Shunqin/0000-0002-1162-0200","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative) on Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA), MEXT (Japan); Photo-exci-tonix Project in Hokkaido University; JSPS KAKENHI [JP18H02065]","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative) on Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA), MEXT (Japan)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Photo-exci-tonix Project in Hokkaido University; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work received financial support from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) , World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative) on Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA) , MEXT (Japan) , Photo-exci-tonix Project in Hokkaido University, and JSPS KAKENHI (JP18H02065) .",,105,22,21,107,186,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",2542-4351,,,JOULE,Joule,16-Feb,2022,2,,,,294,314,,10.1016/j.joule.2022.01.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.01.001,,,21,"Chemistry, Physical; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science,ZG2YS,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000760126900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mining is the practice of extracting resources for utilitarian purposes. Today, the international business of mining is a heavily mechanized industry that exploits the use of large diesel and electric equipment. These machines must operate in harsh, dynamic, and uncertain environments such as, for example, in the high arctic, in extreme desert climates, and in deep underground tunnel networks where it can be very hot and humid. Applications of robotics in mining are broad and include robotic dozing, excavation, and haulage, robotic mapping and surveying, as well as robotic drilling and explosives handling. This chapter describes how many of these applications involve unique technical challenges for field roboticists. However, there are compelling reasons to advance the discipline of mining robotics, which include not only a desire on the part of miners to improve productivity, safety, and lower costs, but also out of a need to meet product demands by accessing orebodies situated in increasingly challenging conditions.","[Marshall, Joshua A.] Queens Univ, Robert M Buchan Dept Min, 25 Union St, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Bonchis, Adrian] CSIRO, Dept Autonomous Syst, 1 Technol Court, Pullenvale, Qld 4069, Australia; [Nebot, Eduardo] Univ Sydney, Dept Aerosp Mech & Mechatron Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Scheding, Steven] Univ Sydney, Rio Tinto Ctr Mine Automat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Queens University - Canada; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Sydney; Rio Tinto; University of Sydney,"Marshall, JA (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Robert M Buchan Dept Min, 25 Union St, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",joshua.marshall@queensu.ca; adrian.bonchis@csiro.au; eduardo.nebot@sydney.edu.au; steven.scheding@sydney.edu.au,"Marshall, Joshua A/C-6401-2013","Marshall, Joshua A/0000-0002-7736-7981; nebot, Eduardo/0000-0002-3914-3741",,,,,132,18,18,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-319-32552-1; 978-3-319-32550-7,,,,2016,,,,,1549,1576,,,,10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1,,28,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Robotics,BG4HU,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000388837200071,View Full Record in Web of Science

A wave prediction system based on the two state-of-the-art spectral models, WAM and SWAN, was used to evaluate the wave conditions. In order to design better model configurations, validation tests with this system are performed. Special attention is paid to the whitecapping process which is considered the weak link in deep water wave modelling. The spatial distributions of the wave energy were analysed in three different computational domains for both high and average wave conditions. Four case studies were considered for the wave energy assessments. The first corresponds to a common energetic peak, whereas the other three to different patterns of average energetic conditions. In this way some areas with greater potential from the energetic point of view have been identified. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Rusu, Eugen; Soares, C.

Natural gas hydrate estimates worldwide range from 10,000 to 40,000 trillion cubic meters (TCM). Efforts are underway to exploit this resource. These methane hydrates in the earth's crust also have the potential to be a significant factor in global climate change. Moreover, gas hydrates offer opportunities for the development of innovative technologies (separation of CO2 from CO2/N-2 and CO2/H-2 mixtures, CO2 sequestration, natural gas transportation and storage and H-2 storage).

Intermodel spread can arise from differences in the representation of transport by the diabatic (overturning) circulation versus comparatively faster adiabatic mixing by breaking waves, or through numerical errors, primarily diffusion. This study investigates the impact of these processes on transport using an idealized tracer, the age of air. Transport is assessed in two state-of-the-art dynamical cores based on fundamentally different numerical formulations: finite-volume and spectral element. Integrating the models in free-running and nudged tropical wind configurations reveals the crucial impact of tropical dynamics on stratospheric transport. Using age-budget theory, vertical and horizontal gradients of age allow comparison of the roles of the diabatic circulation, adiabaticmixing, and the numerical diffusive flux. Their respective contribution is quantified by connecting the full 3D model to the tropical leaky pipe framework of Neu and Plumb. Transport by the two cores varies significantly in the free-running integrations, with the age in themiddle stratosphere differing by about 2 years primarily due to differences in adiabatic mixing. Whenwinds in the tropics are constrained, the difference in age drops to about 0.5 years; in this configuration, more than half the difference is due to the representation of the diabatic circulation. Numerical diffusion is very sensitive to the resolution of the core, but does not play a significant role in differences between the cores when they are run at comparable resolution. It is concluded that fundamental differences rooted in dynamical core formulation can account for a substantial fraction of transport bias between climate models.","[Gupta, Aman; Gerber, Edwin P.] Courant Inst Math Sci, Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Gupta, Aman] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst Munich, Munich, Germany; [Plumb, R.

By embedding a lidar simulator within CAM5, the idiosyncrasies of spaceborne lidar cloud detection and phase assignment are replicated. As a result, this study makes scale-aware and definition-aware comparisons between model-simulated and observed cloud amount and cloud phase. In the global mean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud and excessive ice cloud when compared to CALIPSO observations. Over the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud in all seasons. Having important implications for projections of future sea level rise, a liquid cloud deficit contributes to a cold bias of 2-3 degrees C for summer daily maximum near-surface air temperatures at Summit, Greenland. Over themidlatitude stormtracks, CAM5 has excessive ice cloud and insufficient liquid cloud. Storm track cloud phase biases in CAM5 maximize over the Southern Ocean, which also has larger-than-observed seasonal variations in cloud phase. Physical parameter modifications reduce the Southern Ocean cloud phase and shortwave radiation biases in CAM5 and illustrate the power of the CALIPSO observations as an observational constraint. The results also highlight the importance of using a regime-based, as opposed to a geographic-based, model evaluation approach. More generally, the results demonstrate the importance and value of simulator-enabled comparisons of cloud phase in models used for future climate projection.","[Kay, Jennifer E.; Miller, Nathaniel B.; Morrison, Ariel; Yettella, Vineel] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kay, Jennifer E.; Miller, Nathaniel B.; Morrison, Ariel; Yettella, Vineel] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bourdages, Line] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chepfer, Helene] Univ Paris 06, LMD IPSL, Paris, France; [Eaton, Brian] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; McGill University; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kay, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Kay, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Jennifer.E.Kay@colorado.edu,"Morrison, Ariel/R-9902-2019; Yettella, Vineel/P-5520-2016; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Kay, Jennifer/C-6042-2012","Morrison, Ariel/0000-0003-4565-7738; Yettella, Vineel/0000-0002-9425-9130; Kay, Jennifer/0000-0002-3625-5377",NASA [12-CCST10-0095]; National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [1314156] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The authors wish to thank the Yellowstone CESM CSL for computing the resources and the scientists and software engineers that build the CESM.

In particular, the flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, including international emissions trading under Art 17, must be enhanced if they are to remain meaningful elements of this regime. The European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the first and largest multinational ETS to date. In analysing the successes and failures of and potential improvements to the EU ETS, this article argues that an improved EU scheme should be adapted to suit a global setting and adopted at Copenhagen to improve the current international emissions trading scheme. Due to the growing number of domestic ETSs, a bottom-up emissions trading scheme should be considered as an alternative to a UNFCCC international emissions trading scheme. A study of the implications of linking the EU ETS to Australia's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will prove that bottom-up schemes are a viable means of exploiting this significant emission reduction instrument.","[Haywood, Caroline] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Haywood, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,0,LAWBOOK CO LTD,PYRMONT,"LEVEL 6, 19 HARRIS ST, PYRMONT, NSW 2009, AUSTRALIA",0813-300X,,,ENVIRON PLAN LAW J,Environ.

A system-level thermodynamic model of several AWH pathways is presented to elucidate the important energy flows in these processes as a means of reducing the energy required to produce a unit of water. Model results show that freshwater may be produced from humid air via processes driven solely with solar electricity in an arid climate with an energy input between 116 kWh(e)/m(3) and 1021 kWh(e)/m(3), depending on atmospheric conditions and processing configuration. We describe a novel, desiccant-based AWH approach in which the latent heat of vaporization is internally recovered resulting in a significant reduction in energy requirements relative to the state of the art. Finally, a parametric model of a desiccant-based AWH system is used to estimate the minimum levelized cost of water (LCOW) via solar-driven AWH at 6.5 $/m(3) when both latent and sensible energy are recovered internally.","[Siegel, Nathan P.; Conser, Ben] Bucknell Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 1 Dent Dr, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Siegel, NP (corresponding author), Bucknell Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 1 Dent Dr, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",nps004@bucknell.edu; bsc011@bucknell.edu,,,Bucknell University Office of Graduate Studies,Bucknell University Office of Graduate Studies,This work was sponsored in part by the Bucknell University Office of Graduate Studies.,,52,4,4,2,20,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0195-0738,1528-8994,,J ENERG RESOUR-ASME,J.

This policy, sometimes called the Pacific Solution, has created challenges for local Pacific populations and has placed these two Pacific Islands in the center of a geopolitical humanitarian crisis. The rhetoric surrounding the role of Nauru and Manus often positions their contemporary dilemmas within a framework of continued imperialist or neocolonial challenges to their sovereignty by their Australian neighbor. But it also does much more. The essays in this dialogue section interrogate the Pacific Solution and surrounding discourses by exploring the critical circumstances enveloping the two islands, as well as the movement of refugees in the Pacific more generally. This draws attention both to international conflict and to climate change and the resulting environmental calamities in the Pacific region. Other contributions interrogate refugee policy through ethnographic studies of the encounters between refugees and host populations, revealing the pressure felt by local Pacific populations and the responses available to them under the current circumstances. Some of these responses exceed scholarship and demand narrative art (Kaiku; Sparks-Ngenge), while others involve political dynamics that are entangled in responses to climate change (Bino) or in colonial histories (Dalsgaard and Otto; Kanngieser), as well as their logics and legal articulations (Keenan). The responses reveal issues of inclusion/exclusion denoting different sorts of insiders but also perspectives that require attention to intimacies and lived experience (Salyer; West).","[Salyer, J.

This paper describes state-of-the-art techniques for enhancing and maximising the spatial detail available from satellite images, and demonstrates their applications to the densely urbanised environment of Hong Kong. An Emissivity Modulation technique for spatial enhancement of thermal satellite images permits modelling of urban microclimate in combination with other urban structural parameters at local scale. For air quality monitoring, a Minimum Reflectance Technique (MRT) has been developed for MODIS 500 m images.

Due in part to its high water surface to land area ratio, over one-third of the Lake Superior basin water budget is derived from precipitation falling directly on the lake surface. For most of the Great Lakes (including Lake Superior), historical precipitation estimates extend back to the early 1880s, and are based primarily on land-based gauge measurements. While alternatives to gauge-based estimates have been explored, there is no clear history of applying regional climate models (RCMs) to improve historical over-lake precipitation estimates. To address this gap in regional research, and to advance the state-of-the-art in Great Lakes regional hydrological modeling, we compare 21 years of output (1980-2000) from an RCM to conventional gauge-based precipitation estimates for the same time period over the Lake Superior basin. We find that the RCM, unlike the gauge-based method, simulates realistic variations in over-lake atmospheric stability, which propagate into basin-wide precipitation estimates with a relatively low over-lake to over-land precipitation ratio in warm months (roughly 0.7 to 0.8 in June, July, and August) and a relatively high over-lake to over-land precipitation ratio in cold months (roughly 1.3 to 1.4 in December and January), compared to gauge-based estimates. Our findings underscore a need to potentially update historical gauge-based precipitation estimates for large lake systems, including Lake Superior, and that RCMs appear to provide a robust and defensible basis for making those updates.

On the contrary, classroom interactions that are threatening to adolescents' identities send messages of devaluation and can negatively impact feelings of belonging and academic achievement, particularly for youth of color (Sherman et al., 2013). In efforts to help explicate the interrelations between racial-identity linked risks and threats and psychological safety in classroom learning contexts, this exploratory case study examined two 9th grade English Language Arts teachers' negotiation of attunement, authenticity, and power sharing during race talk. Our in-depth analysis of these classrooms suggested the following teacher moves may be particularly important for psychological safety during race talk: teacher moves that (a) support or inhibit power sharing, (b) indicate high or low levels of teacher attunement, and (c) demonstrate or mask the teacher's authenticity. These results have implications for understanding the co-construction of psychological safety in classrooms during identity-salient and racialized interactions.","[Williams, Jasmine D.; Woodson, Ashley N.; Wallace, Tanner LeBaron] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Williams, JD (corresponding author), 230 S Bouquet St,5928 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jasmine.williams@pitt.edu,"Williams, Jasmine/GRS-1657-2022",,,,,,59,20,20,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7609,1542-7617,,RES HUM DEV,Res.

This study develops a new method to quantify the benefits of urban heat mitigation technologies on human heat balance and population mortality. The Heat Health Impact (HHI) method is based on the state-ofthe-art, multi-parameter model, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI).A proof-of-concept exercise applied the HHI method to Sydney, Australia (population = 5.7 million). All available weather stations (10) were selected for full spatial coverage of the Sydney region (12,367 km2), and average hourly UTCI was calculated from meteorological observations spanning the entire year 2017. In the baseline analysis, average daily UTCI values were calculated for each of the 10 observation sites, and then spatially interpolated across the entire Sydney region for Feb 9, 2017, a representative heatwave day for Sydney. Three different greening intervention scenarios were investigated, and daily average change in UTCI (Delta UTCI) was calculated under each by comparison with the baseline scenario; this Delta UTCI was named Urban Cooling Effect (UCE). We implemented a health impact assessment methodology to estimate the change in attributable mortality due to each greening scenario for the Sydney GMR population for the representative heatwave day. Urban greening infrastructure scenarios reduced daily average UTCI between -0.2 and -1.7 degrees C on the heatwave day, with the health impact assessment indicating heat attributable deaths reducing up to 11.7 per day across the Sydney GMR compared to the baseline scenario. Our results highlight the health benefits of greening infrastructure to cool urban environments.","[Sadeghi, Mahsan; Santamouris, Mattheos] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Sadeghi, Mahsan; Hanigan, Ivan; Jalaludin, Bin; Morgan, Geoffrey G.] Ctr Air Pollut Energy & Hlth Res, Sydney, NSW 2037, Australia; [Sadeghi, Mahsan; de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Chaston, Timothy; Hanigan, Ivan; Morgan, Geoffrey G.] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Jalaludin, Bin] Univ New South Wales, Sch Populat Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Morgan, Geoffrey G.] Univ Sydney, Univ Ctr Rural Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Sadeghi, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",msad5726@uni.sydney.edu.au,,"de Dear, Richard/0000-0002-3414-290X; Sadeghi, Mahsan/0000-0002-3155-7376","New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE), Human Health and Social Impacts Node of the NSW Adaptation Research Hub - National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC); Centre for Research Excellence -Centre for Air quality, energy and health Research","New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE), Human Health and Social Impacts Node of the NSW Adaptation Research Hub - National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC); Centre for Research Excellence -Centre for Air quality, energy and health Research","The project was funded by New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE), Human Health and Social Impacts Node of the NSW Adaptation Research Hub.

Gaofen-1 satellite mission, developed by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) for the civilian high-definition Earth observation satellite program, provides near-real-time observations for geographical mapping, environment surveying, and climate change monitoring. Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation are a crucial element to enable automatic near-real-time processing of Gaofen-1 images, and therefore, their performances must be accurately validated. In this paper, a robust multiscale segmentation method based on deep learning is proposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cloud and cloud shadow segmentation from Gaofen-1 images. The proposed method first implements feature map based on the spectral-spatial features from residual convolutional layers and the cloud/cloud shadow footprints extraction based on a novel loss function to generate the final footprints. The experimental results using Gaofen-1 images demonstrate the more reasonable accuracy and efficient computational cost achievement of the proposed method compared to the cloud and cloud shadow segmentation performance of two existing state-of-the-art methods.","[Khoshboresh-Masouleh, Mehdi; Shah-Hosseini, Reza] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Shah-Hosseini, R (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran, Iran.",m.khoshboresh@ut.ac.ir; rshahosseini@ut.ac.ir,"Khoshboresh-Masouleh, Mehdi/ABC-5371-2020; Shahhoseini, Reza/D-2475-2018","Khoshboresh-Masouleh, Mehdi/0000-0002-9565-3615; Shahhoseini, Reza/0000-0002-7552-5392",,,,,57,7,7,2,31,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-5265,1687-5273,,COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC,Comput.

Governments are putting strategic plans in motion to decrease primary energy use, take carbon out of fuels and facilitate modal shifts. Taking a prominent place in these strategic plans is hydrogen as a future energy carrier. A number of manufacturers are now leasing demonstration vehicles to consumers using hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines (H2ICEs) as well as fuel cell vehicles. Developing countries in particular are pushing for H2ICEs (powering two- and three-wheelers as well as passenger cars and buses) to decrease local pollution at an affordable cost. This article offers a comprehensive overview of H2ICEs. Topics that are discussed include fundamentals of the combustion of hydrogen, details on the different mixture formation strategies and their emissions characteristics, measures to convert existing vehicles, dedicated hydrogen engine features, a state of the art on increasing power output and efficiency while controlling emissions and modeling.

A comparison between AERONET CIMEL and GAW PFR at a high altitude calibration site, Mauna Loa, shows an excellent agreement with 0.001 bias for 500 nm AOD. AODs obtained from direct Sun-pointing instruments are within 0.01 bias, though these results are similar to or slightly larger than those given in previous short-term intensive studies. These results suggest that well-maintained networks of direct Sun-pointing instruments developed by different companies/institutions can provide quality-assured AOD data across the globe to the aerosol-climate research community. The poorer agreement between a hemispherical field-of-view (FOV) MFRSR and the finite FOV Sun-pointing instrument is found to be due to uncertainty in the angular characterization of the MFRSR optics.","[Kim, Sang-Woo; Yoon, Soon-Chang] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea; [Kim, Sang-Woo] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Dutton, Ellsworth G.] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Global Monitoring Div, Boulder, CO USA; [Kim, Jiyoung] Korea Meteorol Adm, Natl Inst Meteorol Res, Seoul, South Korea; [Wehrli, Christoph] Phys Meteorol Observ Davos, World Radiat Ctr, Davos, Switzerland; [Holben, Brent N.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Kim, SW (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea.",yoon@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,29,30,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0278-6826,1521-7388,,AEROSOL SCI TECH,Aerosol Sci.

Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is an appealing way to solve this problem. However, the state-of-the-art AWH technologies have poor water harvesting performance in arid climates owing to the low water sorption capacity of common sorbents under low humidity conditions. We report a high-performance composite sorbent for efficient water harvesting from arid air by confining hygroscopic salt in a metal-organic framework matrix (LiCl@MIL-101(Cr)). The composite sorbent shows 0.77 g g(-1) water sorption capacity at 1.2 kPa vapor pressure (30 % relative humidity at 30 degrees C) by integrating the multi-step sorption processes of salt chemisorption, deliquescence, and solution absorption. A highly efficient AWH prototype is demonstrated with LiCl@MIL-101(Cr) that can enable the harvesting of 0.45-0.7 kg water per kilogram of material under laboratory and outdoor ambient conditions powered by natural sunlight without optical concentration and additional energy input.","[Xu, Jiaxing; Li, Tingxian; Chao, Jingwei; Wu, Si; Yan, Taisen; Li, Wenchen; Cao, Biye; Wang, Ruzhu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Res Ctr Solar Power & Refrigerat, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Li, TX; Wang, RZ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Res Ctr Solar Power & Refrigerat, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",litx@sjtu.edu.cn; rzwang@sjtu.edu.cn,"Wang, Ruzhu/A-6727-2012","Wang, Ruzhu/0000-0003-3586-5728; Xu, Jiaxing/0000-0002-8913-9783; Li, Tingxian/0000-0003-4618-8144; Wu, Si/0000-0002-8548-431X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51876117]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFE0100300]; Innovative Research Group Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51521004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Innovative Research Group Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the contract No.51876117 and the National Key R&D Program of China under the contract No.2018YFE0100300.

Current climate deterioration leads to increase of flooding frequency and severity and thus poses a higher risk of bridge scour failure than before. Recent studies have explored extensively the vibration-based scour monitoring technique by analyzing the structural modal properties before and after damage. However, the state-of-art of this area lacks a systematic approach with sufficient robustness and credibility for practical decision making. This paper attempts to develop a data-driven methodology for bridge scour monitoring using support vector machines This study extracts features from the bridge dynamic responses based on a generic sensitivity study on the bridge's modal properties and selects the features that are significantly contributive to bridge scour detection. Results indicate that the proposed data-driven method can quantify the bridge scour damage with satisfactory accuracy for most cases. This paper provides an alternative methodology for bridge scour evaluation using the machine learning method. It has the potential to be practically applied for bridge safety assessment in case that scour happens.","[Zhang, Zhiming; Sun, Chao] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3255 Patrick F Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Li, Changbin] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Comp Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Sun, Mingxuan] Louisiana State Univ, Div Comp Sci & Engn, 3325 Patrick F Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Sun, C (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3255 Patrick F Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",csun@lsu.edu,"Sun, Chao/AAM-6071-2020; Zhang, Zhiming/AAI-7662-2020; Sun, Chao/D-9917-2014","Sun, Chao/0000-0003-3909-0325; Zhang, Zhiming/0000-0002-7678-605X",Louisiana State University [127150013]; Industrial Ties Research Subprogram of Louisiana State Board of Regents [AWD-001515],Louisiana State University; Industrial Ties Research Subprogram of Louisiana State Board of Regents,This work is supported by Louisiana State University Start-up Fund [grant number is 127150013] and Industrial Ties Research Subprogram of Louisiana State Board of Regents (Project number is AWD-001515).

Geoethics focuses on how scientists (natural and social), arts and humanities scholars working in tandem can become more aware of their ethical responsibilities to guide society on matters related to public safety in the face of natural hazards, sustainable use of resources, climate change, and protection of the environment. Furthermore, some case studies in the Mediterranean basin, where the transformations imposed by human action and society on the Earth's environment are evident, will be analyzed in relation to Disaster Risk Reduction practices: social perception and communication, community resilience, participative approaches, using CIGIS and neogeographic technologies. These case studies constitute some examples of geographies and cartographies of the Anthropocene.

Although this choice offers opportunities for daylighting and view contact with the outside, it can lead to overheating and glare problems if climate is not taken into account in the design. This paper presents a workflow for retrofitting that can be applied to different office facades with large window-to-wall ratios. The workflow consists of analysing the space from the point of view of the functions of its facade and then applying a retrofitting strategy based on state-of-the-art building simulations and automated shading control. The proposed workflow is illustrated by a case study at an office in Malaga (Spain), in which the originally installed, manually-controlled interior vertical blinds are replaced with automatically controlled interior roller blinds with a metallized reflecting surface facing towards the glazing unit. A full optical characterization of the roller blinds is presented. A simulation-based control strategy is applied to the motorized roller blinds in order to maximize view contact with the outside and daylighting while controlling glare and overheating.","[Bueno, Bruno; Katsifaraki, Angelina; Wilson, Helen Rose] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst ISE, Freiburg, Germany; [Manuel Cejudo-Lopez, Jose] Univ Malaga, Malaga, Spain",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Universidad de Malaga,"Bueno, B (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst ISE, Freiburg, Germany.",bruno.bueno@ise.fraunhofer.de,,,Andalucia TECH Program; German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy [03ET1432A],Andalucia TECH Program; German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy,The present study was partially funded by the Andalucia TECH Program.

To detect such changes, several promising correlation change tests exist, but they may suffer from severe loss of power when there is actually more than one change point underlying the data. To deal with this drawback, we propose a permutation based significance test for Kernel Change Point (KCP) detection on the running correlations. Given a requested number of change points K, KCP divides the time series into K + 1 phases by minimizing the within-phase variance. The new permutation test looks at how the average within-phase variance decreases when K increases and compares this to the results for permuted data. The results of an extensive simulation study and applications to several real data sets show that, depending on the setting, the new test performs either at par or better than the state-of-the art significance tests for detecting the presence of correlation changes, implying that its use can be generally recommended.","[Cabrieto, Jedelyn; Tuerlinckx, Francis; Kuppens, Peter; Ceulemans, Eva] KU Leuven Univ Leuven, Res Grp Quantitat Psychol & Individual Difference, Leuven, Belgium; [Hunyadi, Borbala] KU Leuven Univ Leuven, STADIUS Ctr Dynam Syst Signal Proc & Data Analyt, Dept Elect Engn ESAT, Leuven, Belgium; [Hunyadi, Borbala] IMEC, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; IMEC,"Cabrieto, J (corresponding author), KU Leuven Univ Leuven, Res Grp Quantitat Psychol & Individual Difference, Leuven, Belgium.",Jed.Cabrieto@kuleuven.be,"kuppens, peter/DHG-5268-2022; Ceulemans, Eva/AAQ-6617-2020","tuerlinckx, francis/0000-0002-1775-7654; Ceulemans, Eva/0000-0002-7611-4683; kuppens, peter/0000-0002-2363-2356",Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO) [G.0582.14]; Belgian Federal Science Policy [IAP/P7/06]; Research Council of KU Leuven [GOA/15/003]; iMinds Medical Information Technologies [ICON HBC.3016.0167]; European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC Advanced Grant: BIOTENSORS [339804]; Hercules Foundation; Flemish Government department EWI,Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Belgian Federal Science Policy(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Research Council of KU Leuven(KU Leuven); iMinds Medical Information Technologies; European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC Advanced Grant: BIOTENSORS; Hercules Foundation; Flemish Government department EWI,"The research leading to the results reported in this paper was sponsored in part by a research grant from the Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO, Project No. G.0582.14 awarded to Eva Ceulemans, Peter Kuppens and Francis Tuerlinckx), by the Belgian Federal Science Policy within the framework of the Interuniversity Attraction Poles program (IAP/P7/06), and by the Research Council of KU Leuven (GOA/15/003)) and by iMinds Medical Information Technologies (ICON HBC.3016.0167, 'SeizeIT').

In this study, a quantitative assessment of the skill of state-of-the-art global weather prediction systems in polar regions is given using data from the THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) for the period 2006/2007-2012/2013. Forecast skill in the Arctic is comparable to that found in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. However, relative differences in the quality between different forecasting systems appear to be amplified in the Arctic. Furthermore, analysis uncertainty in the Arctic is more of an issue than it is in the midlatitudes, especially when it comes to near-surface parameters over snow- and ice-covered surfaces. Using NOAA's reforecast dataset, it is shown that the changes in forecast skill during the 7-year period considered here can largely be explained by flow-dependent error growth, especially for the more skilful forecasting systems. Finally, a direct comparison between the Arctic and Antarctic suggests that predictions of mid-topospheric flow in the former region are more skilful.","[Jung, Thomas] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Matsueda, Mio] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Matsueda, Mio] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Tsukuba; University of Oxford","Jung, T (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",Thomas.Jung@awi.de,"Jung, Thomas/J-5239-2012","Jung, Thomas/0000-0002-2651-1293; Matsueda, Mio/0000-0001-8913-1303",,,,,19,35,36,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

The awareness that attention must be paid not only to the present, but also and above all to the future of the society in which we live has increased attention to social and environmental issues, such as climate change and the digital revolution. This transformation has also impacted the public sector: in particular, the scientific attention in the university sector has led to the birth of the concept of University Social Responsibility (USR), which suggests that universities sustainably re-transform their work.

GF is a prominent source of air pollution, with significant global and local impacts. Its emissions contribute to climate change and air pollution, and its practice is a waste of a valuable energy source. A key barrier in evaluating the status of this phenomenon is the incomplete and inconsistent availability (or lack) of public information. In the last few decades, satellite-based methodologies have shown considerable potential for bridging this gap. They have been employed for 1) detecting flaring sites, globally or regionally; 2) characterizing them; 3) computing the volumes of gas they flare; and 4) assessing air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Long-term archives of multispectral satellite imagery, dating to the 1990s, also provide the ability to follow the spatiotemporal evolution of GF. This work, which collects literature papers through July 2019 starting with background information on satellites' capabilities to observe gas flares, describes satellite-based methododologies used to derive independent, reliable data on GF.","[Faruolo, Mariapia] CNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, Potenza, Italy; [Caseiro, Alexandre] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Lacava, Teodosio] CNR, IMAA, Rome, Italy; [Kaiser, Johannes W.] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR),"Faruolo, M (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, Potenza, Italy.",mariapia.faruolo@imaa.cnr.it; alexandre.caseiro@iass-potsdam.de; teodosio.lacava@imaa.cnr.it; johannes.kaiser@dwd.de,,"Kaiser, Johannes/0000-0003-3696-9123; Faruolo, Mariapia/0000-0001-5291-8241",,,,,171,6,6,7,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2473-2397,2168-6831,,IEEE GEOSC REM SEN M,IEEE Geosci.

Although the preparation of bioluminescent cell-free extracts allowed one to characterize the enzymatic requirements, the molecular mechanism underlying luminescence is still largely unknown and is based on the experimental putative assumption that a high-energy intermediate should be formed by reaction with O-2 and formation of an endoperoxide. Here, we aim at determining, through state-of-the-art multiconfigurational quantum chemistry, the full mechanistic landscape leading from the endoperoxide to the emitting species, envisaging different possible pathways and proposing their viability. Especially, thermal CO2 detachment followed by excited-state peroxide opening (thermal-chemiluminescence) can compete with a parallel pathway, i.e., first excited-state endoperoxide opening, followed by CO2 detachment on the same excited-state (excited state-chemiluminescence). Clear differences in the energy supplies, as well as the possibility to directly populate the emitting species from the intersection seam between ground and excited states, land credence to a kinetically efficient thermal-chemiluminescent pathway, establishing for the first time a detailed description of fungal bioluminescence.","[Garcia-Iriepa, Cristina; Navizet, Isabelle] Univ Paris Est, Lab Modelisat & Simulat Multi Echelle MSME UMR 82, CNRS, UPEC,UPEM, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France; [Garcia-Iriepa, Cristina; Marazzi, Marco] Univ Alcala, Dept Quim Analit Quim Fis & Ingn Quim, Ctra Madrid Barcelona Km 33600, E-28871 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Iriepa, Cristina; Marazzi, Marco] Univ Alcala, Chem Res Inst Andres M del Rio IQAR, E-28871 Madrid, Spain; [Navizet, Isabelle] Univ Paris Est Creteil, MSME, Univ Gustave Eiffel, CNRS UMR 8208, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Alcala; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Garcia-Iriepa, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris Est, Lab Modelisat & Simulat Multi Echelle MSME UMR 82, CNRS, UPEC,UPEM, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France.;Garcia-Iriepa, C (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Dept Quim Analit Quim Fis & Ingn Quim, Ctra Madrid Barcelona Km 33600, E-28871 Madrid, Spain.;Garcia-Iriepa, C (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Chem Res Inst Andres M del Rio IQAR, E-28871 Madrid, Spain.",cristina.garciai@uah.es,"Marazzi, Marco/E-2776-2012; Garcia Iriepa, Cristina/N-9684-2018","Marazzi, Marco/0000-0001-7158-7994; Garcia Iriepa, Cristina/0000-0002-7577-8242",Fundacion Ramon Areces; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR BIOLUM project [ANR-16-CE29-0013],Fundacion Ramon Areces; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR BIOLUM project(French National Research Agency (ANR)),C.

This task is difficult as these functions should yield positive definite covariance matrices. In recent years, we have seen a flourishing of methods and theories on constructing spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions satisfying the positive definiteness requirement. A subset of those techniques produced spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions possessing the additional feature of nonstationarity. Here we provide a review of the state-of-the-art methods and technical progress regarding model construction. In addition, we introduce a rich class of multivariate spatio-temporal asymmetric nonstationary models stemming from the Lagrangian framework. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed models on a bivariate reanalysis climate model output dataset previously analyzed using purely spatial models. Furthermore, we carry out a cross-validation study to examine the advantages of using spatio-temporal models over purely spatial models.

Today there are several technologies that can be applied for this goal and especially there is a growing interest in all the processes dedicated to manage CO2 emissions. CO2 can be captured, stored or reused as carbon source to produce chemicals and fuels through catalytic technologies. This study reviews the use of ceria based catalysts in some important CO2 valorization processes such as the methanation reaction and methane dry-reforming. We analyzed the state of the art with the aim of highlighting the distinctive role of ceria in these reactions. The presence of cerium based oxides generally allows to obtain a strong metal-support interaction with beneficial effects on the dispersion of active metal phases, on the selectivity and durability of the catalysts. Moreover, it introduces different functionalities such as redox and acid-base centers offering versatility of approaches in designing and engineering more powerful formulations for the catalytic valorization of CO2 to fuels.","[Boaro, Marta; Colussi, Sara; Trovarelli, Alessandro] Univ Udine, Dipartimento Politecn, Udine, Italy",University of Udine,"Boaro, M (corresponding author), Univ Udine, Dipartimento Politecn, Udine, Italy.",marta.boaro@uniud.it,"Colussi, Sara/U-1344-2019; Trovarelli, Alessandro/M-4325-2015","Colussi, Sara/0000-0001-5316-1746; Trovarelli, Alessandro/0000-0002-1396-4031",,,,,173,66,66,17,116,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-2646,,,FRONT CHEM,Front.

The system operates at F/1.8, providing the high throughput for low-reflectivity (<1%) water surfaces, while avoiding saturation over bright snow or clouds. The SWIS design utilizes heritage from previously demonstrated instruments on airborne platforms while advancing the state of the art in compact sensors of this kind in terms of size and spectral coverage. Compared with airborne campaigns, the CubeSat platform allows for more frequent and regular sampling, while maintaining intermediate to high resolution relative to heritage global sensors. Through frequent repeat observations from space at a moderate spatial resolution, SWIS can address key science questions concerning aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem changes, cryosphere warming and melt behavior, cloud and atmospheric science, and potential impacts of climate change and human activities on the environment.

This is especially true in temperate winter climates, where snowfall and low sun elevation rapidly change the appearance of the scene. While there have been proposed techniques to perform localization across extreme appearance changes, they are not suitable for many navigation algorithms such as autonomous path following, which requires constant, accurate, metric localization during the robot traverse. Furthermore, recent methods that mitigate the effects of lighting change for vision algorithms do not perform well in the contrast-limited environments associated with winter. In this paper, we highlight the successes and failures of two state-of-the-art path-following algorithms in this challenging environment.

From the taxonomic identification of charcoal, the objectives are to highlight the practices of hunter-gatherers related to the collection of wood and the environment in which they evolved for nearly 5000 years.

To reduce the degradation, it is imperative to know the degradation and failure phenomena. This review article has been prepared to present an overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge on the reliability of PV modules. Whilst the most common technology today is mono- and multi-crystalline silicon, this article aims to give a generic summary which is relevant for a wider range of photovoltaic technologies including cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide and emerging low-cost high-efficiency technologies. The review consists of three parts: firstly, a brief contextual summary about reliability metrics and how reliability is measured. Secondly, a summary of the main stress factors and how they influence module degradation. Finally, a detailed review of degradation and failure modes, which has been partitioned by the individual component within a PV module.

The cases of HafenCity Hamburg and Waterfront Toronto discussed in this paper demonstrate successful approaches to achieving social and environmental sustainability at the waterfronts, highlighting the importance of ensuring mixed uses, public access, sustainable design and construction of buildings and infrastructure including climate change adaptations. Integrated and incremental planning of waterfronts in conjunction with citywide planning alongside careful consideration for greening, urban ecology, biodiversity, and aquatic ecosystems is also critical.

A system level thermodynamic model of several AWH pathways is presented to elucidate the important energy flows in these processes as a means to reducing the energy required to produce a unit of water. Model results show that fresh water may be produced from humid air via processes driven solely with solar electricity in an arid climate with an energy input between 158 kWh(e)/m(3) and 1021 kWh(e)/m(3), depending on atmospheric conditions and processing configuration. We describe a novel, desiccant-based AWH approach in which the latent heat of vaporization is internally recovered resulting in a significant reduction in energy requirements relative to the state of the art. Finally, a parametric model of a desiccant-based AWH system is used to estimate the minimum levelized cost of water (LCOW) via solar-driven AWH at 6.5 $/m(3) when both latent and sensible energy are recovered internally.","[Siegel, Nathan P.; Conser, Ben] Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Siegel, NP (corresponding author), Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",nps004@bucknell.edu,,,Bucknell University Office of Graduate Studies,Bucknell University Office of Graduate Studies,This work was sponsored in part by the Bucknell University Office of Graduate Studies.,,32,0,0,0,1,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-8363-1,,,,2020,,,,,,,V001T10A002,,,,,9,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BQ9KY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000625377800044,View Full Record in Web of Science

According to this, existing plants have been required to cut emissions; moreover, there has been a greater emphasis on adopting efficient systems in order to reduce the energy losses. Among high efficiency technologies, fuel cells appear to be the most promising for their high efficiency and their very low environmental impact. This paper first reviews the state-of-the-art of fuel cells systems, then simulates the operation of a hybrid fuel cells plant in a typical hospital analysing how it could optimize the hospitals energetic requirements. Hospitals and sanitary structures are normally characterized by considerable energy demands not often suitable with resolute energy retrofit strategies. Both the considerable primary energy savings and the pollutant emissions reduction, achieved upgrading conventional systems to a fuel cell hybrid plant, have the potential to prompt national boards to support their business development, as long as they achieve a consolidated market penetration.

However, most current atmospheric and coupled models have difficulty in capturing the climatological mean state of the EASM. The present study investigated the possible improvement of EASM simulation via coupling the Stochastic Multicloud Model (SMCM) to the state-of-the-art ECHAM6.3 atmosphere model. Evaluated by the pattern correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error, the modified ECHAM6.3, i.e., with SMCM coupling, showed better performance in simulating the EASM in terms of the precipitation pattern and intensity, the pattern of the western North Pacific subtropical high, the monsoon onset, and its seasonal evolution. Analyses also revealed that the modified ECHAM6.3 outperformed the default ECHAM6.3 in terms of large-scale circulation and vertically integrated moisture transport. Finally, it was that the intensified land-sea thermal contrast in both the meridional and zonal directions, as well as the stronger meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere and enhanced diabatic heating over the Tibetan Plateau, which are associated with the stochastic cloud, were the main reasons for the better performance of the modified ECHAM6.3 in simulating the EASM.","[Ma, Libin; Zhu, Zhiwei; Li, Juan; Cao, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Ningliu Rd 219,Meteorol Bldg, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Zhu, ZW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Ningliu Rd 219,Meteorol Bldg, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zwz@nuist.edu.cn,"Zhu, Zhiwei/N-2679-2016","Zhu, Zhiwei/0000-0002-4885-1299","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505905]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41605035, 41805048]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2018r026, 2018r064]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program of CAST [2018QNRC001]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20161604]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program of CAST; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province),"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC1505905), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41605035 and Grant No. 41805048), and the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST (No. 2018r026; 2018r064).

Further, we perform a comprehensive sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the VIC model using a robust and state-of-the-art approach. The VIC model simulations utilize the recently developed variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS) technique that requires in this application more than 6,000 model simulations for a 30-year (1981-2010) study period. The method seeks parameter sensitivity, identifies influential parameters, and showcases streamflow sensitivity to parameter uncertainty at seasonal and annual timescales. Results suggest that the Ensemble VIC simulations match observed streamflow closest, whereas global reanalysis products yield high flows (0.5-3.0 mm day(-1)) against observations and an overestimation (10-60%) in seasonal and annual water balance terms. VIC parameters exhibit seasonal importance in VARS, and the choice of input data and performance metrics substantially affect sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty propagation due to input forcing selection in each water balance term (i.e., total runoff, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration) is examined separately to show both time and space dimensionality in available forcing data at seasonal and annual timescales. Reliable input forcing, the most influential model parameters, and the uncertainty envelope in streamflow prediction are presented for the VIC model. These results, along with some specific recommendations, are expected to assist the broader VIC modelling community and other users of VARS and land surface schemes, to enhance their modelling applications.","[Lilhare, Rajtantra] Univ Northern British Columbia, Nat Resources & Environm Studies Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Pokorny, Scott; Dery, Stephen J.; Stadnyk, Tricia A.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Civil Engn, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Dery, Stephen J.; Stadnyk, Tricia A.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Stadnyk, Tricia A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Koenig, Kristina A.] Manitoba Hydro, Water Resources Engn Dept, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Northern British Columbia; University of Manitoba; University of Northern British Columbia; University of Calgary,"Lilhare, R (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Nat Resources & Environm Studies Program, Prince George, BC, Canada.",lilhare@unbc.ca,"Lilhare, Rajtantra/H-8669-2019; Stadnyk, Tricia/ABC-8061-2021","Lilhare, Rajtantra/0000-0002-6913-6024; Stadnyk, Tricia/0000-0002-2145-4963; Pokorny, Scott/0000-0001-6665-5622",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [NSERC CRD 44425 RC15-3100]; Manitoba Hydro,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Manitoba Hydro,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: NSERC CRD 44425 RC15-3100; Manitoba Hydro",,92,11,12,3,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

However, it is difficult to accurately extrapolate the plausible meteorological field in certain regions based on in situ measurements alone, especially in areas with complex topography like the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Gridded products, remote sensing, and data assimilation technique overcome this problem but they have their own weaknesses, such as low resolution, huge computation, and time-consuming. Here we applied the state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GAN) in image inpainting to construct the surface temperature over the TP combined with high-resolution China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) air temperature product and in situ observations. In this study, the surface air temperature at 2 m dataset with grids of 0.1 degrees over the TP from 1979 to 2020 based on GAN-based model have been generated, which can capture the spatial patterns and trends of surface air temperature over the TP. Moreover, the GAN-based daily temperature has higher correlation coefficients (0.99) and lower root-mean-square errors (1.06 degrees C) than CMFD (0.98, 1.43 degrees C) and reanalysis products when compared with in situ observations. Finally, the temperature fields over the TP from 2019 to 2020 is constructed, whereas CMFD is only available from 1979 to 2018. The results reflect the advantages of GAN on big-data computation and fully utilizing effective information over the TP, and GAN-based temperature dataset can be used to detect climate change over the region. This study demonstrated the potential and applicability of artificial intelligence for developing and extending practicable high-resolution meteorological dataset over regions with sparse stations and rugged topography.","[Yang, Ye; You, Qinglong; Jin, Zheng; Zuo, Zhiyan; Zhang, Yuqing] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Room 5002-1,Environm Sci Bldg, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ye; You, Qinglong; Jin, Zheng; Zuo, Zhiyan; Zhang, Yuqing] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Room 5002-1,Environm Sci Bldg, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [You, Qinglong] Zhuhai Fudan Innovat Res Inst, Innovat Ctr Ocean & Atmosphere Syst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [You, Qinglong] Shanghai Frontiers Sci Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Inter, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"You, QL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Room 5002-1,Environm Sci Bldg, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;You, QL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Room 5002-1,Environm Sci Bldg, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.",yeyang20@fudan.edu.cn; qlyou@fudan.edu.cn,,"You, Qinglong/0000-0002-5329-9697; Zhang, Yuqing/0000-0002-5669-5134","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971072, 41771069]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41971072 and 41771069).,,54,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Current state-of-the-art mechanistic effect models, such as toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models, often do not explicitly consider temperature as a modulating factor. This study implemented the effect of temperature in a widely used modeling framework, the General Unified Threshold model for Survival (GUTS). We tested the model using data from toxicokinetic and toxicity experiments with Gammarus pulex exposed to the insecticides imidacloprid and flupyradifurone. The experiments revealed increased TK rates with increasing temperature and increased toxicity under chronic exposures. Using the widely used Arrhenius equation, we could include the temperature influence into the modeling. By further testing of different model approaches, differences in the temperature scaling of TK and TD model parameters could be identified, urging further investigations of the underlying mechanisms. Finally, our results show that predictions of TK-TD models improve if we include the toxicity modulating effect of temperature explicitly.","[Mangold-Doering, Annika; Huang, Anna; Van Nes, Egbert H.; Van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Focks, Andreas] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Math, Syst Sci Grp, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Environm Res, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University Osnabruck; Wageningen University & Research,"Mangold-Doering, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",annika.mangold-doering@wur.nl,,"Mangold-Doring, Annika/0000-0002-6701-308X; van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347",European Union [201808320432]; China Scholarship Council;  [813124],European Union(European Commission); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); ,The authors would like to thank Tjalling Jager for his technical support with BYOM software.

Such changes can remarkably influence the frameworks that rely upon highlights of the picture for object recognition, tracking, object detection, segmentation etc. Accordingly, there is a requirement for quick and precise detection [1]-[3] and evacuation of rain streaks or the marks of snow. Here, we build up a strategy for diagnosis and dismissal of rain components. Rain components have a higher intensity compare to the non-rain component of the image. This property has been utilized to recognize the rain components in a picture. To decrease the false alarm cases, we use the attributes of raindrops, (for example, major and minor axis) and recognize the identified rain and nonrain component. Correction of the color is utilized to reestablish shading of rain-component with the color of the background. We exhibit that our proposed technique performs well for rain-component identification with more prominent precision compare to other state-of-the-art methods.","[Kumar, Sumit] Indian Inst Informat Technol Una, Una, India; [Gupta, Akshita] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Jha, Rajib Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Patna, Patna, Bihar, India",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Patna; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System),"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Informat Technol Una, Una, India.",sumitphd13@gmail.com; gupta417@purdue.edu; jharajib@gmail.com,"Kumar, Sumit/HHS-8959-2022",,"Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India (Digital India Corporation) [U72900MH2001NPL133410]","Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India (Digital India Corporation)","We thank the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India (Digital India Corporation (Grant No.U72900MH2001NPL133410)) for granting fund to this prestigious project in the Signal & Image Processing Laboratory at Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India.",,24,1,1,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2159-3442,,978-1-7281-1895-6,TENCON IEEE REGION,,,2019,,,,,2700,2704,,,,,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BO8NC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000528677800499,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using masculine genres such as gangster films and martial art films as his departure points, the acclaimed Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai has re-created male characters, such as the lovelorn policemen in Chungking Express (1994), an assassin who is set up and killed by his female partner in Fallen Angels (1995), and a kungfu master whose life is helpless and miserable during wartime in The Grandmasters (2013). Wong's male protagonists are far from heroic, and even seen as feminized and infantilized. These crises-ridden men on one hand reflect Hong Kong's political predicament brought about by its problematic postcolonial situation, and on the other hand show Hong Kong's ambivalent culture with its resistance to the fixed national identity. These alternative male characters created by Wong are used actively to articulate Hong Kong identities with the culture of ambivalence in the postcolonial situation. Until recent years, these texts still respond to the changing political climate and the ongoing anxiety in Hong Kong.","[Lei, Chin-pang] Univ Macau, Dept Commun, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Lei, CP (corresponding author), Univ Macau, Dept Commun, Macau, Peoples R China.",,"LEI, Chin-Pang/GRX-6493-2022","LEI, Chin-Pang/0000-0002-2252-1187",,,,,24,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-801X,1469-929X,,INTERVENTIONS-UK,Interventions,,2019,3,,,,407,422,,10.1080/1369801X.2018.1558092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369801X.2018.1558092,,,16,Cultural Studies; History,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Cultural Studies; History,HQ6JU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000462521500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, PV modules deployed in tropical regions face a different set of environmental conditions than PV modules deployed in temperate regions where the majority of today's PV markets exist. The tropical climate poses several unique challenges for PV modules. High year-round humidity is the greatest threat to PV module durability, while high ambient temperatures and highly diffuse light conditions can negatively affect PV module output power. Given this situation, SERIS is undertaking a research project to develop Singapore modules which are specifically tailored to perform better and last longer in tropical climates. This paper presents an overview of the scope of the project, as well as first key findings and results. The first phase of the project involved a detailed study of the state of the art in today's PV module technologies. Ten different module technologies were chosen for evaluation, representing today's most commonly used PV technologies. These commercial modules were subjected to standard accelerated aging tests, as well as tightened accelerated aging tests to identify strengths and weaknesses of the various technologies. Outdoor performance monitoring of each module type is also on-going. The results obtained during the first phase of the project are being used to guide the development of Singapore modules. First prototype Singapore modules have been fabricated, and a 10 kW(p) testbedding system has been installed in Singapore. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To better characterize the role of moisture in influencing mechanisms of SOC storage during pedogenesis, we compare soils from two different chronosequence sites: the Santa Cruz and Mattole River marine terraces that together form a soil age-by-climate gradient (i.e., climo-chronosequence). Our results demonstrate how variation in the effective soil moisture may drive soil development along divergent pedogenic trajectories, resulting in variations in the form and depth distribution of secondary weathering products. In particular, the residual metals Fe and Al are directly related to the type of secondary minerals that accumulate during weathering, and these variations are coupled to differences in the storage and long-term preservation of SOC both within and between soils. Over time, these differences in soil development may lead to 'pedogenic thresholds' that further differentiate soil characteristics and influence SOC dynamics. In this case, the pedogenic threshold takes the form of clay-rich argillic horizons that once formed, inhibit aqueous transport, decouple shallow and deep soil environments, and potentially limit SOC inputs and increase microbial recycling in deep soils. Our data suggest argillic horizon development is favorable in the drier Santa Cruz soils, where kaolinite is the dominant secondary weathering product. In contrast, greater available moisture in soils of the Mattole chronosequence drive a different weathering trajectory characterized by the accumulation of more amorphous secondary minerals. As a result, the Mattole soils and do not exhibit argillic horizon development but are instead characterized by greater accumulation of SOC across all depths sampled. Overall, our results illustrate how the interaction of climate (i.e., moisture) and time may shape the trajectory of soil development and the dynamics of SOC storage and preservation.","[Lawrence, Corey R.] US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Schulz, Marjorie S.; Harden, Jennifer W.] US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Masiello, Caroline A.] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Chadwick, Oliver A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Harden, Jennifer W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Rice University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Stanford University,"Lawrence, CR (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USA.",clawrence@usgs.gov,,"Lawrence, Corey/0000-0001-6143-7781",Climate and Landuse Research and Development program of U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Science Mission Area,Climate and Landuse Research and Development program of U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Science Mission Area,"All data generated for this study are archived at the U.S. Geological Survey ScienceBase clearinghouse(Lawrence and Schulz, 2021).

Temperature and wind velocity sensors were placed both inside and outside the building for ten consecutive summer days, in order to verify the simulation results. The results show a satisfactory prediction of the indoor conditions. Subsequently, a scenario, in which ecological building materials, openings, and sun shades were replaced with conventional ones, was simulated.

Low current conversion efficiency and high cost, however, are some of the disadvantages. Use of TEPG is therefore justified to hightech applications associated with aerospace, military operation, tel-communication and navigation, instrumentation of unmanned vehicles monitored from remote locations. Moreover, TEPG does not contribute to the depletion of natural resource and pollution of the environment such as climate warming that has been a concern in recent times.

Innovative approach to work and resilience in continuously changing situations is required from all future professionals. 21st century skills, such as complex problem solving, critical thinking, curiosity and imagination are needed in order to adapt to the new demands of working life. In Higher Education Institutions for Societal Engagement (HEISE) project it is seen, that challenges that used to be local are now global. During HEISE a new pedagogical model was developed, where students and stakeholders from the surrounding society identified and solved different societal challenges in joint challenge solving projects. Creativity and arts-based methods were used to tackle these challenges in joint teams in order to find new perspectives and fresh ideas. HEISE project was funded by Erasmus+ Strategic Partnerships for Higher Education. This paper describes and analyses the social services bachelor students' reflections on how they experienced creativity during the challenge solving project. Our data consists of students' (N=37) learning diaries and insights on creativity and arts collected during the spring term 2019. Our results agree with earlier research, that creativity can be an enormous resource and asset in the demands of constantly changing working life.

In recent years, the steel industries have established technology road maps which identify future technological challenges and new market requirements. They also define the technologies that must be developed to meet future business needs. Only through modern plant technology can a company position itself competitively in the international marketplace. However, this does not necessarily require the erection of a brand new greenfield production facility.

Major advances include the identification of different invasion stages and invasiveness dimensions (geographic range, habitat specificity, local abundance) and the identification of appropriate comparators while accounting for propagule pressure and year of introduction. Developments in phylogenetic and functional trait research bear great promise for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Global patterns are emerging with propagule pressure, disturbance, increased resource availability, and climate matching as major invasion drivers, but species characteristics also play a role. Biotic interactions with resident communities shape invasion outcomes, with major roles for species diversity, enemies, novel weapons, and mutualists. Mounting evidence has been found for rapid evolution of invasive aliens and evolutionary responses of natives, but a mechanistic understanding requires tighter integration of molecular and phenotypic approaches.

A renewable-derived approach to carbon-neutral synthetic fuels is therefore needed to offset the negative impacts of this trend, which include climate change. In this communication we report the use of nonstoichiometric perovskite oxides in two-step, solar-thermochemical water or carbon dioxide splitting cycles. We find that LaAlO3 doped with Mn and Sr will efficiently split both gases. Moreover the H-2 yields are 9x greater, and the CO yields 6x greater, than those produced by the current state-of-the-art material, ceria, when reduced at 1350 degrees C and re-oxidized at 1000 degrees C. The temperature at which O-2 begins to evolve from the perovskite is fully 300 degrees C below that of ceria. The materials are also very robust, maintaining their redox activity over at least 80 CO2 splitting cycles. This discovery has profound implications for the development of concentrated solar fuel technologies.","[McDaniel, Anthony H.; Miller, Elizabeth C.; Arifin, Darwin; Chueh, William C.] Sandia Natl Labs, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Miller, Elizabeth C.; Ambrosini, Andrea; Coker, Eric N.] Sandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA; [O'Hayre, Ryan; Tong, Jianhua] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Sandia National Laboratories; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Sandia National Laboratories; Colorado School of Mines,"McDaniel, AH (corresponding author), Sandia Natl Labs, Livermore, CA 94551 USA.",amcdani@sandia.gov; jhtongm@gmail.com,"Coker, Eric N/K-4049-2018; Tong, Jianhua/C-8324-2016; O'Hayre, Ryan/Q-7496-2019","Coker, Eric N/0000-0002-9382-9373; Tong, Jianhua/0000-0002-0684-1658; O'Hayre, Ryan/0000-0003-3762-3052; McDaniel, Anthony/0000-0002-8692-2481; Miller, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8315-9361",DOE NNSA [DE-FC52-08NA28752]; Sandia National Laboratories Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering; National Science Foundation MRSEC program [DMR-0820518]; DOE Fuel Cell Technologies Office as part of the Production technology development area; Laboratory Directed Research and Development at Sandia National Laboratories; United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration [DE-AC04-94AL85000],DOE NNSA(National Nuclear Security AdministrationUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)); Sandia National Laboratories Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering; National Science Foundation MRSEC program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE Fuel Cell Technologies Office as part of the Production technology development area; Laboratory Directed Research and Development at Sandia National Laboratories; United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration(National Nuclear Security Administration),"E.C.M. was supported by a DOE NNSA Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship, grant number DE-FC52-08NA28752.

Also the area irrigated by this solar surface pump is calculated under Sahara climate conditions for four crops, namely wheat, potatoes, tomatoes and sunflowers. These were selected to meet with food standards of the sites. Two application sites were chosen to test the developed model. The first is Bechar station and the second is Tamanrasset station. In both, the recorded solar radiation data were used. The results, which are illustrated by tables and curves, are analysed.

The COVID-19 pandemic, structural racism, the climate crisis, and a severe economic downturn have all converged. These crises have wreaked havoc on minoritized communities in particular. This moment requires imagination to write a different future - to not return to the status quo. Imagination becomes crucial for fathoming a different world. Musicking - the different ways of making music that include listening, performing, creating, and beyond - may allow us to engage in such imagining. Musicking offers a vehicle for dreaming and provides a vision for the future. In this paper, I explore movements in education that inform this political moment including critical reconstructionism, abolitionism, and critical pedagogy from the perspectives of people who theorise these movements. Subsequently I consider the role the arts might play in imagining. I engage in particular the work of Bettina Love and Maxine Greene. Ultimately, I examine potential ways that different facets of musicking, including listening, performing, and creating may enable children and youth to engage in what I call the dual roles of imagination.","[Hess, Juliet] Michigan State Univ, Coll Mus, Mus Practice Bldg,345 W Circle Dr,Room 214, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Hess, J (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Coll Mus, Mus Practice Bldg,345 W Circle Dr,Room 214, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jlhess@msu.edu,"Hess, Juliet/O-8330-2018","Hess, Juliet/0000-0003-3007-330X",,,,,87,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-3808,1469-9893,,MUSIC EDUC RES,Music Educ.

In the present study, three vertical ventilation concepts were investigated experimentally in the GCC. With the aim to study different climate conditions, a jacket heating/ cooling was used to simulate winter and summer conditions. To simulate the heat release and the obstruction of passengers as well as to measure the thermal comfort four thermal manikins were placed in the GCC. To determine the relevant heat fluxes a plethora of temperature sensors was located at significant positions in the GCC. Furthermore, the surface temperatures were measured by means of an infrared camera.

The European Commission empower the importance of achieving the objective of the recast Directive on energy performance of buildings (EPBD) that new buildings built from 2021 onwards will have to be nearly zero-energy buildings. The general belief is that the energy performance optimization of buildings requires an integrated design approach and cross-disciplinary teamwork to optimize the building's energy use and quality of indoor environment while satisfying the occupants' needs. In this context, there is a substantial need for professionals such as architects and engineers specifically trained and educated in integrated design approach and trained to work in cross-disciplinary teams. To be able to push forward the development, it is essential that educational institutions foster professionals with such knowledge, skills and competences. An initiative toward this direction is the EU-project of IDES-EDU: Master and Post-Graduate education and training in multi-disciplinary teams. The paper describes the necessity of more integrated and cross-disciplinary approaches to building design through state-of-the-art of the building sector and educational initiatives in the participating countries in the project, and through theory of design processes. The paper also communicates the results of newly developed cross-disciplinary education established by fifteen different educational institutions in Europe.

With the majority of global urbanization occurring along the periphery of urban areas in developing countries, investigation of green building practices designed specifically for peri-urban regions is critical for a low-emitting future society. This study assesses a state-of-the-art residence designed for a middle-class family of four residing in the peri-urban region of Bangkok, Thailand. The residence employs both demand-side management strategies and low-emitting energy supply technology to achieve energy-positive status. To elucidate the influence that key design decisions have on the life cycle sustainability of the home, several variants of the residence are modeled. A process-based life cycle assessment consistent with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14044: 2006 standard and following ReCiPe Midpoint life cycle impact assessment methodology is used to quantify the life cycle impacts per square meter of conditioned residence floor area for climate change (582 kilograms [kg] carbon dioxide equivalent), terrestrial acidification (4.01 kg sulfur dioxide equivalent), freshwater eutrophication (30.4 grams phosphorous equivalent), fossil depletion (362 kg iron equivalent), and metal depletion (186 kg oil equivalent) impacts. We model multiple scenarios in which varying proportions of Bangkok's peri-urban detached housing demand are fulfilled by the energy-positive residence variants. Under the best-case replacement scenario (i.e., 100% replacement of future peri-urban detached housing), significant reductions are achieved across the life cycle climate change (80%), terrestrial acidification (82%), and fossil depletion (81%) impact categories for the steel-framed, energy-positive residence.","[Bukoski, Jacob J.] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Joint Grad Sch Energy & Environm JGSEE, Life Cycle Sustainabil Assessment Lab LCSAL, Bangkok, Thailand; [Bukoski, Jacob J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chaiwiwatworakul, Pipat] JGSEE, Bldg Energy Sci & Technol Lab, Bangkok, Thailand; [Gheewala, Shabbir H.] JGSEE, LCSAL, Bangkok, Thailand",King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok; King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Gheewala, SH (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Joint Grad Sch Energy & Environm, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",shabbir_g@jgsee.kmutt.ac.th,"Gheewala, Shabbir H./AAG-5732-2020","Gheewala, Shabbir H./0000-0002-4300-1551; Chaiwiwatworakul, Pipat/0000-0003-0565-5922; Bukoski, Jacob/0000-0002-2334-5023","Solar Decathlon, Europe-King Mongkut's University of Technology at Thonburi (KMUTT) organization; School of Architecture and Design at KMUTT; U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program","Solar Decathlon, Europe-King Mongkut's University of Technology at Thonburi (KMUTT) organization; School of Architecture and Design at KMUTT; U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Solar Decathlon, Europe-King Mongkut's University of Technology at Thonburi (KMUTT) organization, the School of Architecture and Design at KMUTT, and the U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program during the development of this study.

Among various CO2 sorbents, lithium-based ceramics in nonsilicates have been identified as promising candidates and have gained worldwide interest for CO2 capture. With the rapid progress in these ceramic sorbents, a timely review is urgently required. Thus, in this work we review the current state-of-the-art research studies in the literature on lithium-based ceramics in nonsilicates for CO2 capture. Recent advances in these lithium ceramics have been summarized in detail and discussed, including Li2CuO2, Li5AlO4, LiFeO2/Li5FeO4, Li6CoO4, Li4TiO4/Li2TiO3, LiYO2, Li6WO6/Li4WO5, Li6ZnO4, LiBO2/Li3BO3, Li7BiO6, Li5GaO4, Li5SbO5, and Li6MnO4. The potential future development recommendations are also discussed. We hope that this work will benefit researchers from both academic and industrial communities and help pave the way for major breakthroughs in both fundamental research and industrial applications in this field.","[Hu, Yingchao; Fu, Ruicheng; Yao, Dingding; Yan, Shuiping] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Engn, 1 Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenqiang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, State Key Lab Coal Combust, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Yao, DD; Yan, SP (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Engn, 1 Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",dingdingyao@mail.hzau.edu.cn; yanshp@gmail.hzau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51906263]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2020JJ5730]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [11042110025]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The authors sincerely appreciate the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51906263), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (2020JJ5730), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (11042110025).",,117,2,2,25,63,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7488,2050-7496,,J MATER CHEM A,J.

Drone flight tests are different from traditional large aircraft aerial measurements. Drones are not affected by climate much and does not cause any casualty with good safety, low-altitude operation, obtaining high-precision images. They have wider building coverage. Using drones increases the multi-faceted texture image of buildings with enhaced scale up to 1:1000. The images from drones avoids cloud cover with low cost, easy operation and maintenance. Mapping is very important in geography, architecture and other fields, especially in urban planning.

Regulatory agencies face a new landscape: the combination of industry-paid user fees and appropriations, and a general pro-business climate coupled with dramatic advances in medical technology, shortage in skilled experts trained in the latest state-of-the-art science, and necessary legal and administrative changes. This paper seeks explanations for the complex structure of medical device regulation by focusing on the meaning of the life cycle concept, opportunities for patient voices, and the scope of, and potential for conflicts of interest of, industry, physicians, scientific advisors and regulatory authorities. The paper concludes that the initial international differences between medical device frameworks tend to be mitigated by voluntary global harmonization, but that actual, effective integration into the national regulatory framework significantly depends on each nation's and the EU's embedded norms, rules and procedures, and politics.","[Altenstetter, Christa] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Altenstetter, Christa] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Altenstetter, C (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, 365 5th Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",caltenstetter@aol.com,,,,,,,115,12,13,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1351-1610,1469-8412,,INNOVATION-ABINGDON,Innovation-Eur.

However, these experiences are often implicit in our everyday lives, and rarely formulated explicitly. Coming off Fossil Fuels is a project that visualises and collects personal experiences of fossil fuel dependencies. Experiences can include memories, current attachments and future dreams connected to fossil fuels. This article is a methodological account of collecting fossil fuel experiences through two modes of visual recollection: (1) an autobiographical video piece visualising the author's own dependencies on fossil fuels and (2) gallery visitors' fossil fuel experiences. The article utilises a participatory arts-based approach in which gallery visitors were able to react to the video in recorded responses. The video was presented as part of the 2022 LOOK Climate Lab thinking space in Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool, where video responses were collected. The article also discusses possibilities for developing a method of visual recollection by considering temporal and spatial dimensions of fossil fuel dependency.","[Uusitalo, Niina] Tampere Univ, Res Ctr Comet, Tampere, Finland; [Uusitalo, Niina] Tampere Univ, Visual Studies Lab, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University; Tampere University,"Uusitalo, N (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Res Ctr Comet, Tampere, Finland.;Uusitalo, N (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Visual Studies Lab, Tampere, Finland.",,,"Uusitalo, Niina/0000-0002-0758-1157",Kone Foundation [201800869]; Academy of Finland [320263],Kone Foundation; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),This work was supported by Kone Foundation [grant number 201800869] and Academy of Finland [grant number 320263].,,29,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1472-586X,1472-5878,,VISUAL STUD,Vis.

The current trends of cross arms implement pultruded glass fibre-reinforced polymer composites without any additional configurations. However, extreme tropical climate and dynamic wind loads can cause a high risk of sudden failure due to creep, followed by laminate crack propagation, which can induce structural failure. Glass fibre-reinforced polymer composites are more resilient in corrosion resistance, strength, extreme conditions, and life serviceability according to previous literature. The composite can also function as a good insulator in lightning impulse strength of composite cross arms. It is suggested that the current cross arm design has to adopt core structure as reinforcement to the structure by using filament winding process for long-term structures. Hence, the composite structure can withstand extreme environmental conditions via the filament winding process. Thus, this manuscript is expected to deliver a state-of-art review on the manufacturing process, perspectives, and potential of filament-wounded composite as cross arms in transmission towers.","[Asyraf, M.

In the past, the incandescent lamps have been used for supplementary lighting (SL) at higher latitudes to increase greenhouse production during the dark season. Light-emitting diodes (LED) have been replacing gas discharge and incandescent lamps, and their development is expanding SL applications in different agricultural scenarios (e.g., urban farming, middle latitudes). In fact, recent research on LED applications in Mediterranean greenhouses have produced encouraging results. Since middle latitudes have a higher daily light integral (DLI) than higher latitudes in the dark season and climate conditions influence the installed power load of greenhouses, LED installation and management in Mediterranean greenhouses should be different and less expensive in terms of investment and energy consumption. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to outline the state of the art in LED applications and development, with a focus on latitude-related requirements.

The predominant mechanism of coastal erosion in these areas has been identified through several observational studies as thermomechanical erosion-a joint removal of sediment through the melting of interstitial ice (thermal energy) and abrasion from incoming waves (mechanical energy). However, further developments are needed looking how common design parameters in coastal engineering (such as wave height, period, sediment size, etc.) contribute to the process. This paper presents the current state of the art with the objective of establishing the necessary research background to develop a process-based approach to predicting permafrost erosion. To that end, an overarching framework is presented that includes all major, erosion-relevant processes, while delineating means to accomplish permafrost modelling in experimental studies. Preliminary modelling of generations zero and one models, within this novel framework, was also performed to allow for early conclusions as to how well permafrost erosion can currently be modelled without more sophisticated setups.","[Korte, Sophia; Gieschen, Rebekka; Goseberg, Nils] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Leichtweiss Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Stolle, Jacob] INRS, Ctr Eau Terre Environm, Quebec City, PQ G1P 4S5, Canada; [Goseberg, Nils] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Coastal Res Ctr, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; [Goseberg, Nils] Leibniz Univ Hannover, D-30419 Hannover, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); Braunschweig University of Technology; Leibniz University Hannover,"Korte, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Leichtweiss Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",s.korte@tu-braunschweig.de; r.gieschen@tu-braunschweig.de; jacob.stolle@ete.inrs.ca; n.goseberg@tu-braunschweig.de,"Goseberg, Nils/H-4251-2019; Stolle, Jacob/AAZ-1824-2020","Goseberg, Nils/0000-0002-1550-3001; Stolle, Jacob/0000-0003-0902-9339; Kahl, Rebekka/0000-0002-6850-2416",German Research Foundation; Open Access Publication Funds of the Technische Universitat Braunschweig,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publication Funds of the Technische Universitat Braunschweig,This research received no external funding.

In our framework, graph-based modeling is formulated as a graph system identification problem, where the goal is to learn a weighted graph (a graph Laplacian matrix) and a graph-based filter (a function of graph Laplacian matrices). In order to solve the proposed problem, an algorithm is developed to jointly identify a graph and a graph-based filter (GBF) from multiple signal/data observations. Our algorithm is valid under the assumption that GBFs are one-to-one functions. The proposed approach can be applied to learn diffusion (heat) kernels, which are popular in various fields for modeling diffusion processes. In addition, for specific choices of graph-based filters, the proposed problem reduces to a graph Laplacian estimation problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We also implement our framework on a real climate dataset for modeling of temperature signals.","[Egilmez, Hilmi E.; Pavez, Eduardo; Ortega, Antonio] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Egilmez, HE (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",hegilmez@usc.edu; pavezcar@usc.edu; antonio.ortega@sipi.usc.edu,"Pavez, Eduardo/R-8622-2019","Pavez, Eduardo/0000-0001-8985-2872",National Science Foundation [CCF-1410009],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCF-1410009.,,45,22,22,3,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2373-776X,,,IEEE T SIGNAL INF PR,IEEE Trans.

It has fascinated chemists, material scientists, archaeologists and art historians for decades because it is resistant to the effect of acids, alkalis, and other reagents, and its rich color has persisted for centuries in the harsh tropical climate of southern Mesoamerica. One of its components, palygorskite, is part of modern Maya indigenous knowledge, and ethnohistoric and archaeological data suggest that its modern sources were probably utilized in Prehispanic times. Yet no direct evidence verifies that palygorskite was actually mined from these sources to make Maya Blue. Here we characterize these sources compositionally, and compare our analyses to those of Maya Blue from Chichen Itza and Palenque. We demonstrate that the palygorskite in most of these samples came from modern mines, providing the first direct evidence for the use of these sources for making Maya Blue. These findings reveal that modern Maya indigenous knowledge about palygorskite, its mining, and its source locations, is at least seven centuries old. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The extraction of the dye components from the plant materials was performed with boiling water without addition of chemicals or solvents. Based upon a rigorous selection of possible plant sources, a selection of natural dyestuffs applicable in a one-bath dyeing step was established. A broad variation in shade and color depth can be achieved by applying mixtures of natural dyestuffs in various combinations of iron- and alum-mordants. More than 60% of tested dyeings achieved acceptable fastness properties. On the basis of the developed natural dyestuff-based dyeing procedures, a comparison was made between the effluents from processes based upon them and those based upon the current `state-of-the-art' techniques utilizing synthetic dyes. The comparison revealed that a lowering of the chemical load released with waste water can be expected by shifting to the plant-based dyes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, WRR products are associated with uncertainty that needs to be quantified to improve usability of such products in water resources applications. In this study, we evaluate estimates of water cycle components from 18 state-of-the-art WRR datasets derived from different land surface/hydrological models, meteorological forcing, and precipitation datasets. The evaluation was conducted at three spatial scales in the upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia. Precipitation, streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET), and terrestrial water storage (TWS) were evaluated against in situ daily precipitation and streamflow measurements, remote sensing-derived ET, and the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) product, respectively. Our results highlight the current strengths and limitations of the available WRR datasets in analyzing the hydrological cycle and dynamics of the study basins, showing an overall underestimation of ET and TWS and overestimation of streamflow. While calibration improves streamflow simulation, it results in a relatively poorer performance in terms of ET. Additionally, we show that the differences in the schemes used in the various land surface models resulted in significant differences in the estimation of the water cycle components from the respective WRR products, while we noted small differences among the products related to precipitation forcing. We did not identify a single product that consistently outperformed others; however, we found that there are specific WRR products that provided accurate representation of a single component of the water cycle (e.g., only runoff) in the area.","[Koukoula, Marika; Nikolopoulos, Efthymios I.; Dokou, Zoi; Anagnostou, Emmanouil N.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Nikolopoulos, Efthymios I.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Civil Engn, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Dokou, Zoi] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Civil Engn, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",University of Connecticut; Florida Institute of Technology; California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Anagnostou, EN (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",manos@uconn.edu,"Nikolopoulos, Efthymios/B-1717-2013","Nikolopoulos, Efthymios/0000-0002-5206-1249; Dokou, Zoi/0000-0003-0879-3423",National Science Foundation [1545874],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant 1545874.

The mismatch between fluctuating solar energy resources and stochastic space heating load shall be solved to realize the transition from fossil energy to solar energy for space heating. In the spatial aspect, the discrepancy of solar energy resources in different regions is considerable and the heating load is also varying with the climate type, population density, and so on. In the temporal aspect, the seasonal and diurnal solar energy resource usually has an opposite trend to the actual space heating demand. The spatial and temporal mismatch between solar energy and heating load cause inefficient solar energy utilization and prejudice the decarbonization goal.

During rain-on-snow (ROS) events, the structure and properties of the different snow and ice layers dictate the quantity and timing of water flowing out of the snowpack, increasing the risk of flooding and ice jams. With ongoing climate change, a better understanding of the processes and internal properties influencing snowpack outflows is needed to predict the hydrological consequences of winter melting episodes and increases in the frequency of ROS events. This study develops a multi-method approach to monitor the key snowpack properties in a non-mountainous environment in a repeated and non-destructive way. Snowpack evolution during the winter of 2020-2021 was evaluated using a drone-based, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) coupled with photogrammetry surveys conducted at the Ste-Marthe experimental watershed in Quebec, Canada. Drone-based surveys were performed over a 200 m 2 area with a flat and a sloped section. In addition, time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements were used to follow water flow through the snowpack and identify drivers of the changes in snow-pack conditions, as observed in the drone-based surveys. The experimental watershed is equipped with state-of-the-art automatic weather stations that, together with weekly snow pit measurements over the ablation period, served as a reference for the multi-method monitoring approach. Drone surveys conducted on a weekly basis were used to generate georeferenced snow depth, density, snow water equivalent and bulk liquid water content maps. Despite some limitations, the results show that the combination of drone-based GPR, photogrammetric surveys and TDR is very promising for assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of the key hydrological characteristics of the snowpack. For instance, the tested method allowed for measuring marked differences in snow pack behaviour between the first and second weeks of the ablation period. A ROS event that occurred during the first week did not generate significant changes in snow pack density, liquid water content and water equivalent, while another one that happened in the second week of ablation generated changes in all three variables. After the second week of ablation, differences in density, liquid water content (LWC) and snow water equivalent (SWE) between the flat and the sloped sections of the study area were detected by the drone-based GPR measurements. Comparison between different events was made possible by the contact-free nature of the drone-based measurements.","[Valence, Eole; Baraer, Michel; Monty, Chloe] Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change HC3, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Valence, Eole; Baraer, Michel; Rosa, Eric; Barbecot, Florent] Geotop, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada; [Rosa, Eric] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Grp Rech Eau Souterraine, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Barbecot, Florent] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Terre & Atmosphere, Montreal, PQ H2L 2C4, Canada",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec; University Quebec Abitibi-Temiscamingue; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Valence, E (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change HC3, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;Valence, E (corresponding author), Geotop, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada.",eole.valence.1@ens.etsmtl.ca,"Baraer, Michel/J-9351-2012","Baraer, Michel/0000-0003-4138-3354",Geochemistry and Geodynamics Research Centre (Geotop) Quebec; Water Research Centre of Quebec (CentrEau); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [CRSNG RGPIN-2020-05612],Geochemistry and Geodynamics Research Centre (Geotop) Quebec; Water Research Centre of Quebec (CentrEau); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This research has been supported by the Geochemistry and Geodynamics Research Centre (Geotop) Quebec, The Water Research Centre of Quebec (CentrEau), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant no.

A safer and competent subterranean transport solution is yet proposed in the context of sustainable developments. In light of this, geotechnical analysis as a fundamental subject for developing and maintaining safe and sustainable use of underground space has huge potential to be undertaken more intuitively considering the advancements in information management and visualisation. The PhD work examines the state-of-the-art applications, limitations and future opportunities of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and other computational techniques in the digitisation of tunnelling and underground construction.

However, new water vapor-selective membranes present a unique opportunity to greatly reduce the power requirements for moisture removal by avoiding phase change and have thus been ranked as a top alternative to traditional HVAC systems. To date, however, all such systems have relied on the assumption of constant temperature, even terming the technology isothermal dehumidification. This work proposes a membrane-based air cooling and dehumidification approach, referred to as the Active Membrane Energy Exchanger (AMX), which is the first to provide simultaneous, yet decoupled, air cooling and dehumidification. The suggested AMX configuration uses two vapor-selective membrane modules with a water vapor compressor in between them, using the second membrane module to reject vapor into the exhaust stream. Cooling and heating coils in each membrane module channel move heat between the air streams using a vapor compression cycle. A detailed steady-state, thermodynamic model is presented for the AMX integrated within a 100% outdoor air conditioning system. The AMX's limiting parameters and design considerations like compressor efficiency are systematically analyzed for a broad range of outdoor air conditions and compared against standard and state-of-the-art dedicated outdoor air systems. This new high efficiency approach is found to outperform all other standard and state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.2-4.7 times the COP over conventional dedicated outdoor air treatment. Lastly, a building simulation case study predicted cooling energy savings as high as 66% in hospital buildings with 100% outdoor systems in hot, humid climates.","[Fix, Andrew J.; Braun, James E.; Warsinger, David M.] Purdue Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 585 Purdue Mall, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Warsinger, DM (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 585 Purdue Mall, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",dwarsing@purdue.edu,,"Fix, Andrew/0000-0001-5688-7411",Center for High Performance Buildings at Purdue University [CHPB-50-2020],Center for High Performance Buildings at Purdue University,"This research is supported by the Center for High Performance Buildings at Purdue University (project number CHPB502020) .

Today, it is well known for its good environmental properties of recyclability and low embodied energy along the production process. Earthen walls regulate the interior temperature of the buildings, providing comfortable temperatures with a very low carbon footprint. As a result of those advantages, earthen building techniques have been revived and used for contemporary architecture. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art about the thermal behaviour of earthen building, including all the monitoring and simulation analysis of real earthen constructions up to now. The paper presents the different earthen techniques known nowadays, analysing the most important thermal parameters and the thermal comfort achieved with each technique. Regardless the wide differences among the analyzed cases, the authors conclude that earth building is a suitable solution in hot and arid climates, since it preserves the indoor temperature within the thermal comfort limits most part of the time without any active system.","[Carrobe, Ariadna; Rincon, Lidia; Martorell, Ingrid] Univ Lleida, Sustainable Energy Machinery & Bldg SEMB Res Grp, INSPIRES Res Ctr, Lleida 25001, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"Martorell, I (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, Sustainable Energy Machinery & Bldg SEMB Res Grp, INSPIRES Res Ctr, Lleida 25001, Spain.",ariadna.carrobe@udl.cat; lidia.rincon@udl.cat; ingrid.martorell@udl.cat,,,Catalan Government [2017 SGR 659],Catalan Government,The work was partially funded by the Catalan Government under grant agreement (2017 SGR 659).,,81,2,2,3,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2021,8,,,,,,2080,10.3390/en14082080,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14082080,,,47,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,RT1CA,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000644203100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Certain passenger routes and ship dimensions are more vulnerable than others to rough weather and the current climate changes require adaptation of design and navigation warning strategies. The main aim of the paper is to describe a method to derive a probabilistic representation of the comfort of passengers and crew on a selected route. AIS data is used to identify and characterise the chosen route. The seakeeping properties of the principal ships are evaluated employing a strip theory code. Detailed wave hindcast data is then employed to build state-of-the-art wave scatter diagrams along the route which allow the calculation of the ship responses for each sea state and the associated probability. The Motion Sickness Incidence is finally used as a comparative measure of the overall on-board comfort experienced on a variety of passenger vessels.","[Carchen, Alessandro; Gaggero, Tomaso; Villa, Diego] Univ Genoa, Dept Telecommun Elect & Elect Engn & Naval Archit, Genoa, Italy; [Besio, Giovanni; Mazzino, Alessandro] Univ Genoa, Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Genoa, Italy; [Carchen, Alessandro] Direz Nav Lago Como, Engn Dept, I-22100 Como, IT, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Gaggero, T (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Telecommun Elect & Elect Engn & Naval Archit, Genoa, Italy.",tomaso.gaggero@unige.it,,,collaborative project SICOMAR plus Interreg Italy-France 'Maritime' [D36C17000120006]; Italian Coast Guard,collaborative project SICOMAR plus Interreg Italy-France 'Maritime'; Italian Coast Guard,This study was carried out under the collaborative project SICOMAR plus Interreg Italy-France 'Maritime' - Project Code D36C17000120006.

It uses the concept of Exquisite Corpses, a technique devised by the Surrealists, an avant-garde art group of the early 20th century, to suggest a practice of transmitting knowledge across periods of fracture. It argues that this process characterises the way that some aspects of social anthropology's canon continue to be transmitted and remain influential, despite having been superseded by time, fashion and changes in social and academic attitudes. A wide range of scholarship is highlighted. Topics focused on include time, relations, borders, bureaucracy, ethics, and the challenges faced by academics in general and anthropologists in particular. These challenges are driven by the emergence of an authoritarian spirit across a number of fields in Europe and beyond, continuing austerity following on from the economic crisis, and the consolidation of an audit culture that drives the university in an ever more neoliberal direction.

Meanwhile, spatial data has become ubiquitous, e.g., GPS data, with increasingly sheer sizes in recent years. The applications of big spatial data span a wide spectrum of interests including tracking infectious disease, climate change simulation, drug addiction, among others. Consequently, major research efforts are exerted to support efficient analysis and intelligence inside these applications by either providing spatial extensions to existing machine learning solutions or building new solutions from scratch. In this 90-minutes tutorial, we comprehensively review the state-of-the-art work in the intersection of machine learning and big spatial data. We cover existing research efforts and challenges in three major areas of machine learning, namely, data analysis, deep learning and statistical inference, as well as two advanced spatial machine learning tasks, namely, spatial features extraction and spatial sampling. We also highlight open problems and challenges for future research in this area.","[Sabek, Ibrahim] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Mokbel, Mohamed F.] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Comp Res Inst, Doha, Qatar; [Mokbel, Mohamed F.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Qatar Computing Research Institute; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Mokbel, MF (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Comp Res Inst, Doha, Qatar.",sabek@cs.umn.edu; mmokbel@hbku.edu.qa,"Mokbel, Mohamed/AAX-6146-2021",,"National Science Foundation, USA [IIS-1525953, CNS-1512877]","National Science Foundation, USA(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation, USA, under Grants IIS-1525953 and CNS-1512877.",,56,4,4,4,10,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",2150-8097,,,PROC VLDB ENDOW,Proc.

Long-term variability of the terrestrial carbon cycle is not yet well constrained and the resulting climate-biosphere feedbacks are highly uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive overview of hydrometeorological and ecosystem variability from hourly to decadal timescales integrating multiple in situ and remote-sensing datasets characterizing extra-tropical forest sites. We find that ecosystem variability at all sites is confined within a hydrometeorological envelope across sites and timescales. Furthermore, ecosystem variability demonstrates long-term persistence, highlighting ecological memory and slow ecosystem recovery rates after disturbances. However, simulation results with state-of-the-art process-based models do not reflect this long-term persistent behaviour in ecosystem functioning. Accordingly, we develop a cross-time-scale stochastic framework that captures hydrometeorological and ecosystem variability. Our analysis offers a perspective for terrestrial ecosystem modelling and paves the way for new model-data integration opportunities in Earth system sciences.","[Pappas, Christoforos] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B8, Canada; [Pappas, Christoforos] Univ Montreal, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B8, Canada; [Mahecha, Miguel D.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Mahecha, Miguel D.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Frank, David C.; Babst, Flurin] Swiss Fed Res Inst, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Frank, David C.] Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Babst, Flurin] Polish Acad Sci, W Szafer Inst Bot, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland; [Koutsoyiannis, Demetris] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Athens 15780, Greece","Universite de Montreal; Laval University; Universite de Montreal; Max Planck Society; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Arizona; Polish Academy of Sciences; W.

The cyclone lasted for nearly 6 days and subsided with a land fall at Gujarat coast, west coast of India. In this study, cyclonic wind fields are generated using a well-established relationship suggested by Jelesnianski and Taylor (1973). The associated water level variations due to storm surge and surge generated currents are simulated using POM (Princeton Ocean Model). The outputs are one-way coupled with the wave model SWAN for simulating wave parameters off Gujarat, north-east basin of Arabian Sea. An extensive literature review is carried out on the progress and methodology adopted for storm wave modelling and analysis.

The high temporal and spatial resolutions of the data reveal the detailed structure of tropopause properties such as pressure (p(t)), temperature (T-t), and sharpness (N-t(2)) and their relationships to upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric processes. The overall results are generally in good agreement with previous studies. The climatology of all three tropopause properties shows largely homogeneous structure in the zonal direction: noticeable asymmetries are found only in the tropics and the Northern Hemisphere extratropics during boreal winter owing to localized tropospheric processes. This contrasts with the seasonal cycles of tropopause properties which are significantly influenced by stratospheric processes such as the Brewer-Dobson circulation, the polar vortex, and the radiative processes near the tropopause. On intraseasonal time scales, p(t) and T-t exhibit significant variability over the Asian summer monsoon and the subtropics where double tropopauses frequently occur. In contrast, N-t(2) shows maximum variability in the tropics where p(t) and T-t have minimum variability, possibly a consequence of vertically propagating waves. The tropopause properties derived from COSMIC observations are further applied to evaluate tropopause data directly available from the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis (NNR). Although the NNR tropopause data have been widely used in climate studies, they are found to have significant and systematic biases, especially in the subtropics. This suggests that the NNR tropopause data should be treated with great caution in any quantitative studies.","[Son, Seok-Woo] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Tandon, Neil F.; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",McGill University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Son, SW (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",seok-woo.son@mcgill.ca,"Son, Seok-Woo/A-8797-2013; Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011",,KMA RD program [RACS 2010-2017]; National Science Foundation; NCAR,KMA RD program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NCAR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank Bill Randel, Andrew Gettelman, Ron Miller, and Adam Sobel for helpful discussions.

Recent publications show that urban planning decision support is increasingly using artificial intelligence through machine learning methods to address these challenges. 172 papers were published in 2020 compared to 8 before 2010 with a forecast of at least 200 papers in 2021. Despite the explosive number of scientific publications on applications artificial intelligence for urban planning decision support, few studies have made a systematic assessment of the state of the art to inform future research. This would help focus on the approaches used, the planning problems most commonly addressed, the data used and even the study areas. We found that the top 5 most addressed urban planning issues include: land use/cover, urban growth, urban buildings, urban mobility and urban environment. Furthermore, a large amount of data was used from sensors and simple or ensemble machine learning methods were more used in this case. Deep learning methods are more used for land use/cover, buildings and climate issues which are mostly based on satellite image data. On the other hand, China and the United States are the most studied territories while Africa is almost not. A high intensity of collaboration between researchers affiliated with Chinese, American and English institutions was observed. Thus, urban planning researchers should benefit from this synthesis work by understanding the general idea of the application of machine learning methods in urban planning, its trends, issues, current challenges and future research directions.","[Tekouabou, Stephane Cedric Koumetio; Diop, El Bachir; Azmi, Rida; Chenal, Jerome] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Ctr Urban Syst CUS, Hay Moulay Rachid 43150, Ben Guerir, Morocco; [Chenal, Jerome] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Urban & Reg Planning Community CEAT, Lausanne, Switzerland",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Tekouabou, SCK (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Ctr Urban Syst CUS, Hay Moulay Rachid 43150, Ben Guerir, Morocco.",ctekouaboukoumetio@gmail.com,,"KOUMETIO TEKOUABOU, Stephane Cedric/0000-0003-3627-5746",,,,,88,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1134-3060,1886-1784,,ARCH COMPUT METHOD E,Arch.

Using information from diverse sources, this paper explores the current state of the art on aquatic ecosystems of Bangladesh, their management, key problems, and introduces a new ecohydrology-based management approach for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in the country. Integration of both physical measures and policy actions are indispensable for greater ecosystem service provision from country's aquatic ecosystems. A cross-disciplinary action plan and appropriate strategies to bring policies into action is also essential for the sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in the country.

For architects and engineers, there are several simulation tools available which comply with the European Standard EN 15026 and/or the North-American moisture control standard ANSI/ASHRAE 160. Numerous investigations have shown that hygrothermal simulation models are clearly superior to steady-state dew-point calculations in predicting the climate dependent moisture behaviour of construction assemblies. However, compared to real life, there remains a major deficit: most models assume a perfectly assembled and installed building component without any cracks or gaps that may cause unintended moisture entry. This draw-back has been recognized and new approaches have been developed to allow for imperfections by introducing source terms in the models, e.g. accounting for the effects of rainwater penetration. The magnitude of these moisture sources is still a matter of discussion because they should represent best practice situations and not poor workmanship. This paper gives an example of a simplified approach to consider rainwater leakage in one-dimensional hygrothermal building component simulation.","[Kuenzel, Hartwig M.; Zirkelbach, Daniel] Fraunhofer IBP, D-83626 Valley, Germany",,"Kunzel, HM (corresponding author), Fraunhofer IBP, Fraunhofer Str 10, D-83626 Valley, Germany.",Hartwig.Kuenzel@ibp.fraunhofer.de,,,,,,,16,17,17,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1940-1493,,,J BUILD PERFORM SIMU,J.

However, current sustainability ranking systems do not provide specific consumption thresholds according to the different buildings' function or characteristic and the comparison among universities lacks of precise criteria. Thus, this paper proposes different energy clusters enabling a meaningful comparison among campuses within the international rankings. Energy profiles of two university campuses-Politecnico di Torino (Italy) and Hokkaido University (Japan)-similar for climate, surface, and population have been collected for 4 years as a relevant case study. Five different clusters of homogeneous consumption have been identified: cluster 1 (around 1 GJ/m(2)/year) includes the Art departments, cluster 2 (2 GJ/m(2)/year) includes the Science faculties, cluster 3 (3 GJ/m(2)/year) includes the hospital and the medicine departments, cluster 4 includes the Data Centre (9 GJ/m(2)/year), and cluster 5 includes special research facilities with consumption over 10 GJ/m(2)/year. Findings show how comparisons between different buildings should also take into account the electrification rate (dependence on electricity) and the leveling rate (variation of consumption during a year), which variations are directly related to the main building function (e.g., hospitals/data centers have high values, while arts or humanities departments have low values for both rates). The proposed energy cluster approach and the introduction of proper weights for energy performances based on the proposed clusters can significantly enhance the accountability and comparability of different campuses' energy profiles, contributing to a better evaluation of universities' energy performances.","[Sonetti, G.] Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning, Turin, Italy; [Sonetti, G.] Univ Torino, Turin, Italy; [Sonetti, G.] NOVA Univ Lisbon, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Cottafava, D.] Univ Torino, Dept Cultures Polit & Soc, Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Turin; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Turin,"Sonetti, G (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning, Turin, Italy.;Sonetti, G (corresponding author), Univ Torino, Turin, Italy.",g.sonetti@campus.fct.unl.pt; dario.cottafava@unito.it,"Cottafava, Dario/L-3913-2018","Cottafava, Dario/0000-0002-5391-096X",,,,,35,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1570-646X,1570-6478,,ENERG EFFIC,Energy Effic.,APR,2022,4,,,,,,19,10.1007/s12053-022-10024-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12053-022-10024-1,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0E5LX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,12/21/22,WOS:000776724000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Artificial light can be dispensed away in institutional buildings such as offices, banks, schools etc. having only daytime occupancy by proper architectural design of fenestrations The design of a day lighting spacd is both an art and a science. The biggest challenge facing the lighting designer is to admit only as much light as necessary and distribute it evenly throughout the space without introducing glare or heat. In hot/warm climates, it has become common practice in windows spaces to specify blinds and glazing with high shading coefficients to control glare and minimize heat gain. However, this practice reduces the effectiveness of lighting systems that dim automatically. Improved systems are needed to capture natural daylight and distribute it uniformly throughout a space while controlling heat gain and glare. One such system is the light shelf. Light shelves shade the space from direct sunlight and reflect this sunlight onto the ceiling for a deeper and more uniform distribution. Reflective blinds offer good control of glare and solar protection. Innovative day lighting systems are designed to redirect sunlight or sky light to areas where it is needed with excessive luminance and glare. These systems use optical devices that initiate reflections, refractions, and/or use total internal reflection of sunlight and sky light. Advanced day lighting systems can be designed to actively track the sun or passively control the direct sunlight and sky light. In this paper, we review the state of the art of several advanced day lighting systems which are designed to maximize the energy-saving potential of day lighting, while improving comfort and visual performance at an affordable cost.","[Rayaz, S.; Rubab, S.] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Fac Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Srinagar,"Rayaz, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Fac Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",sheikhrayazphy@gmail.com; drseeminrubab@gmail.com,"Rubab, Seemin/ABA-8141-2020","Rubab, seemin/0000-0002-0593-4449",,,,,7,5,5,0,9,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,DURNTEN-ZURICH,"KREUZSTRASSE 10, 8635 DURNTEN-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",0255-5476,,,MATER SCI FORUM,,,2013,,,,,79,84,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.760.79,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.760.79,,,6,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Environmental; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BGI63,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000323137800013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition to simplified network management, we propose to link specific application-layer information to the SDN layer in order to trigger automated network reconfiguration. This paper analyses a scenario in which the association between field sensors and field controllers in an electricity distribution grid changes with the feeder configuration chosen by the grid operator. When a data source in the grid (e.g. voltage sensor) is electrically connected to a different substation, also the sensor values are required to be communicated to the new substation controller. The state of the art approach is to solve the issue on application layer - either by changing destination addresses at the sensor units, triggering node discovery at the controller or changing logical bindings between source and destination. In this work, we study a solution where association is changed in the SDN itself. This simplifies application level deployment of the application and reduces the complexity of the application. Further we discuss the advantages and challenges that are introduced to the Smart Grid domain with the SDN-level implementation.","[Gawron-Deutsch, Tobias; Kintzler, Florian] Siemens AG Austria, Corp Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Kupzog, Friederich] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Ctr Energy, Vienna, Austria; [von Tuellenburg, Ferdinand] Salzburg Res Forsch Gesell mbH, Salzburg, Austria; [Pache, Ulrich] Salzburg Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Secure Energy Informat, Salzburg, Austria",Siemens AG; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Gawron-Deutsch, T (corresponding author), Siemens AG Austria, Corp Technol, Vienna, Austria.",tobias.gawron-deutsch@siemens.com; florian.kintzler@siemens.com; friederich.kupzog@ait.ac.at; ferdinand.tuellenburg@salzburgresearch.at; ulrich.pache@fh-salzburg.ac.at,,,"Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLIEN) [858873, 9096736]",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLIEN),"The presented work is conducted in the research project VirtueGrid, which is funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLIEN, ref. 858873) within the program e!MISSION (eCall 9096736).",,25,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-6451-3,,,,2018,,,,,277,282,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BL8DO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000456099600047,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their key optical properties have been improved by developing novel materials, fabrication methods, and designs. The optical properties can be further improved by developing multi-stimuli-responsive smart window systems. Recently, some smart windows have been integrated with energy storage, solar energy harvesting, self-cleaning, and air-purifying functions. The energy consumed by buildings and houses accounts for a considerable portion of the total energy consumed by a country as well as the world; therefore, these state-of-the-art smart windows will greatly contribute to saving energy. Moreover, some multi-functional smart windows can help in addressing environmental challenges.

It includes non-Gaussian response effects for a given input spectrum as well as long-term variations in the parameters of this input spectrum. Moment influence coefficients are introduced to give response moments for arbitrarily scaled input spectra. Rates of extremes and fatigue damage are then estimated analytically from a non-Gaussian (Hermite) random process model. The method is applied to study the pitch and heave ''springing'' motions of a tension leg platform (TLP) under random wave loads. State-of-the-art nonlinear diffraction results are used to model the second-order loads on the TLP. These forces are then applied to a coupled six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) linear structural model of the TLP. Statistics of tether tensions, platform motions, and accelerations are estimated. These results are weighted over probabilistic models of the long-term wave climate to estimate reliability against extreme and fatigue limit states.","SAGA PETR AS,N-1301 SANDVIKA,NORWAY",,"WINTERSTEIN, SR (corresponding author), STANFORD UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,STANFORD,CA 94305, USA.",,,,,,,,21,25,28,0,2,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398",0733-9399,,,J ENG MECH-ASCE,J.

It triggered a profound shift in environmental awareness and the potential for human unity-inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the necessity of a Great Transition. While ambitious integrative efforts have never been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with advancing global urbanization in the digital age-for personal, environmental, economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting the inspiration of Earthrise, we welcome diverse perspectives from across all dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new normative values. Building on academic rigor, we seek to place greater value on imagination, kindness and mutualism as we address our greatest challenges, for the health of people, places and planet.","[Prescott, Susan L.] NOVA Inst Hlth People Pl & Planet, 1407 Fleet St, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA;

In practice reverse osmosis is never applied directly on fresh water sources, predominantly because of the occurrence of membrane fouling. Strategies to control membrane fouling in reverse osmosis without expensive and extensive pre-treatment include low flux operation, increase cross-flow velocities and improved (periodic) hydraulic cleaning. The objective of this research is to technically and economically compare minimal pre-treated reverse osmosis to state-of-the art ultrafiltration pre-treated reverse osmosis in surface water treatment to obtain high quality water. A parallel reverse osmosis system with six parallel 2540 type spiral wound membrane elements has been systematically operated during several months with only screens pre-treatment before reverse osmosis. A minimal pre-treated reverse osmosis system using only screens on surface water did not result in stable reverse osmosis operation, however, the ultrafiltration pre-treated reverse osmosis system also failed in the longer run. Lowering the membrane flux from 25 L/m(2).h to 10 L/m(2).h in minimal pre-treated RO resulted in an approximately 10-fold decrease of the membrane fouling rate, while not influencing the pressure drop increase. Periodical air water cleaning in minimal pre-treated RO resulted in an approximately 4-fold reduction of the spacer clogging rate, while not affecting the membrane fouling rate. The total cost of a minimal pre-treated low flux (10 L/m(2).h) operated RO was significantly lower (0.46 (sic)/m(3)) compared to state-of-the-art UF pre-treated RO at normal flux (25 L/m(2).h) (1.21 (sic)/m(3)). The cost difference in financial space provides an opportunity to develop minimal pre-treated RO systems with improved control of membrane fouling and spacer clogging.","[Cornelissen, E.

Experimental data were collected using a unique soil tank apparatus interfaced with a small climate controlled wind tunnel. The experimental apparatus was instrumented with a suite of state of the art sensor technologies for the continuous and autonomous collection of soil moisture, soil thermal properties, soil and air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. This experimental apparatus can be used to generate data under well controlled boundary conditions, allowing for better control and gathering of accurate data at scales of interest not feasible in the field. Induced airflow at several distinct wind speeds over the soil surface resulted in unique behavior of heat and mass transfer during the different evaporative stages.","[Smits, Kathleen; Eagen, Victoria; Trautz, Andrew] Colorado Sch Mines, Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Colorado School of Mines,"Smits, K (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",ksmits@mymail.mines.edu,"Smits, Kathleen/AAX-3033-2020; Smits, Kathleen M/F-8465-2014","Smits, Kathleen/0000-0002-8319-0940; ",U.

Based on physical/chemical definitions of simulation fields or multiresolution demand, however, many scientific applications need to compress the data with a pointwise relative error bound (i.e., the smaller the data value, the smaller the compression error to tolerate). To this end, we propose two optimized lossy compression strategies under a state-of-the-art three-staged compression framework (prediction + quantization + entropy-encoding). The first strategy (called block-based strategy) splits the data set into many small blocks and computes an absolute error bound for each block, so it is particularly suitable for the data with relatively high consecutiveness in space. The second strategy (called multi-threshold-based strategy) splits the whole value range into multiple groups with exponentially increasing thresholds and performs the compression in each group separately, which is particularly suitable for the data with a relatively large value range and spiky value changes. We implement the two strategies rigorously and evaluate them comprehensively by using two scientific applications which both require lossy compression with point-wise relative error bound. Experiments show that the two strategies exhibit the best compression qualities on different types of data sets respectively. The compression ratio of our lossy compressor is higher than that of other state-of-the-art compressors by 17.2-618 percent on the climate simulation data and 30-210 percent on the N-body simulation data, with the same relative error bound and without degradation of the overall visualization effect of the entire data.","[Di, Sheng; Cappello, Franck] Argonne Natl Lab, Math & Comp Sci MCS Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Tao, Dingwen] Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Liang, Xin] Univ Calif Riverside, Comp Sci Dept, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Di, S (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, Math & Comp Sci MCS Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",sdi1@anl.gov; dingwen.tao@ieee.org; xlian007@ucr.edu; cappello@mcs.anl.gov,"Tao, Dingwen/U-2888-2019","Tao, Dingwen/0000-0001-5422-4497","Exascale Computing Project (ECP) [17-SC-20-SC]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; USNational Science Foundation [1619253]","Exascale Computing Project (ECP); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); USNational Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported by the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), Project Number: 17-SC-20-SC, a collaborative effort of two DOE organizations - the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration, responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem, including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering and early testbed platforms, to support the nation's exascale computing imperative.

We present an integrated observational analysis based on long-term in situ multispecies eddy flux measurements, allowing for quantifying near-real-time changes of urban surface emissions for key air quality and climate tracers. During the first European SARS-CoV-2 wave we find that the emission reduction of classic air pollutants decoupled from CO2 and was significantly larger. These differences can only be rationalized by the different nature of urban combustion sources and point towards a systematic bias of extrapolated urban NOx emissions in state-of-the-art emission models. The analysis suggests that European policies, shifting residential, public, and commercial energy demand towards cleaner combustion, have helped to improve air quality more than expected and that the urban NOx flux remains to be dominated (e.g., > 90 %) by traffic.","[Lamprecht, Christian; Graus, Martin; Striednig, Marcus; Stichaner, Michael; Karl, Thomas] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Karl, T (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, Innsbruck, Austria.",thomas.karl@uibk.ac.at,"Graus, Martin G/E-7546-2010; Lamprecht, Christian/S-2300-2019; Karl, Thomas/D-1891-2009","Graus, Martin G/0000-0002-2025-9242; Karl, Thomas/0000-0003-2869-9426",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30600],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, grant no.

In particular, this article analyzes the state-of-the-art with regard to both the current role of coal generation and the performance of the main legal and regulatory tools as implemented in Italy thus far to ensure the closure of all coal power plants by 2025 as announced in the Italian National Climate and Energy Plan. Based on existing data and scenarios on both electricity production and demand trends, this article unfolds the marginal role played by coal-fired generation in the Italian energy mix. In addition, this paper aims to highlight the outstanding technical uncertainties and regulatory hurdles in the way towards de-carbonization of energy generation in Italy. This paper argues that several remarkable improvements are needed in order to avoid over-generation (especially through natural gas), to upscale the penetration of renewable energy sources, and develop the necessary infrastructures to adequately deliver on the full phasing-out of coal within the expected timeframes.","[Fermeglia, Matteo] Hasselt Univ, Fac Law, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium; [Bevilacqua, Paolo] Univ Trieste, Dept Architecture & Engn, Via Alfonso Valerio 6-A, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Cafaro, Claudia; Ceci, Paolo; Fardelli, Antonio] Natl Res Council CNR Italy, Inst Atmospher Pollut Res IIA, Via Salaria Km 29300 Postal Box 10, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy",Hasselt University; University of Trieste; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Sull'inquinamento Atmosferico (IIA-CNR),"Fermeglia, M (corresponding author), Hasselt Univ, Fac Law, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium.",matteo.fermeglia@uhasselt.be; paolo.bevilacqua@dia.units.it; cafaro@iia.cnr.it; ceci@iia.cnr.it; fardelli@iia.cnr.it,"CECI, PAOLO/AAW-7548-2020","CECI, PAOLO/0000-0003-2078-0887; FERMEGLIA, MATTEO/0000-0003-3469-3485; BEVILACQUA, PAOLO/0000-0002-8775-2824",,,,,46,7,7,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2020,21,,,,,,5605,10.3390/en13215605,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13215605,,,22,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,OQ8PE,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000589037300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For example, fruit in cold chain logistics networks is very sensitive to mould and tends to perish. This can cause huge losses during transport, because the state-of-the-art reefer containers are able to control the temperature but not in relation to the fruit condition. The 'intelligent container' is able to precisely monitor the condition of fruit, as well as track its geographical position. Thus, the transport losses can be reduced due to better climate control and enhanced distribution strategies. This paper focuses on the development of a new scheduling method for distribution by applying principles of quality-driven customer order decoupling corridors (qCODC). Such corridors allow the dynamic change of allocations of container to customer order assignments. These corridors increase the flexibility of the decision-making process. Therefore, a simulation model will be developed and used in order to evaluate the potential of the new scheduling method based on the concept of the 'intelligent container' and qCODC.","[Luetjen, Michael; Dittmer, Patrick; Veigt, Marius] Univ Bremen, BIBA, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Lutjen, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, BIBA, Bremen, Germany.",ltj@biba.uni-bremen.de,,"Lutjen, Michael/0000-0001-9166-5646",German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology,German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology within the joint research project The intelligent container''.

The FREE project (2016-2018) is a natural follow-up to the aqua DEB project (2007-2011, http://www.ifremer.fr/aquadeb/). AquaDEB was formed after the 2001 edition of the DEB course, resulted in 3 special issues, and initialized the very first international DEB symposium in 2009, Brest. Scientists involved in these earlier initiatives coalesced over time into nodes of an international network of expertise, known as the DEBnet. The network continuously develops and applies DEB theory for practical applications in fisheries, aquaculture, eco-toxicity, pharmacology, medicine, biotechnology, sewage water purification, sustainable development, and economics. The focus of the FREE project (http://deb.akvaplan.com/free.html) is on synergizing these areas of expertise with the aim to develop a scientific basis for ecosystem-based management approaches for biomes of system earth (oceans, forests, deserts etc.). We therefore acknowledge the generous support of the Norwegian science council (NFR 255295, 268237) with respect to this new phase of international DEB research and training activities; thereby providing the means for inter-disciplinary cross-fertilization of applied and fundamental research.

Recently, due to the negative impacts that traditional and unsustainable practices of companies have caused the Planet (e.g. climate change, sanitary crisis), national and international research urgently calls for the assessment of sustainable practices in firms. However, progress seems slow due to a poor understanding of the necessary changes that companies must make in their specific reality. Competitiveness has remained as firms' primary strategy to endure. Some have associated sustainability with an increment of costs, sometimes with a negative impact on its competitiveness. Sometimes generating oppositions from stakeholder and institutions regulations, it is important to explore how these behaviors and dynamics of this relationship between sustainability and competitiveness affect the pursued transition to sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature, which is a scientific tool, is used in this research. It allows reliably and accurately analyzing and constructing conclusions from a broad database. The search was leaked over the 10 years, from 2010 to 2019. As a basis, 182 scientific articles were identified and revised based on methodology selection criteria and 51 articles were revised in detail. Findings This paper identifies critical variables analyzed in the selected articles, sustainability strategies for competitiveness, strategies for sustainability, organizational aspects for sustainability and competitiveness, measurement of sustainability, models, moderating factors for sustainability and new future research directions.

However, more interestingly the reaction of the stations to the North Atlantic Oscillation and the degree of the significance of the correlations become weaker as we move in a west-east direction. The factors of continentality-oceanity have also obvious effects on the correlation values. This effect is more clearly seen between the temperature values and the atmospheric oscillations. The North Atlantic Oscillation is particularly effective on the temperatures from the stations located in areas where continental climate prevails. On the other hand, this effect is either too weak or gives an insignificant correlation in the stations located in areas where maritime climate prevails. There isn't a significant correlation between the temperature values from the stations that are in lower longitudes and the North Atlantic Oscillation. When we take the negative years into account separately from a statistical standpoint, we see that there is a more significant correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation and the temperature values than that of the positive years. Generally there is a negative correlation between the minimum temperature values of the stations and the index value in those years in which the North Atlantic Oscillation index values are negative. In other words, as the index values of the North Atlantic Oscillation decrease, the minimum temperatures in Turkey increase. The reason for this can be said to be the westerly winds carry a great amount of humid and warm air masses to the Mediterranean basin and make the climate there milder. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Previously, arid phases when dune activity occurred have been inferred from gaps in chronologies derived from information that attests to former humid periods. To redress this, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was applied to sediment samples taken from a range of aeolian landforms in the SW Kalahari. Four periods of dune building are identified in the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Holocene aeolian activity at 6 ka and 1-2 ka led to the construction of localised dune forms, in contrast to late Pleistocene times when the extensive field of linear dunes that dominates the region was emplaced. Late-Holocene aridity was however sufficient to allow rapid emplacement of the lunette dune at Witpan. The record of aeolian activity is evaluated in the context of humid chronologies and an ocean-atmosphere model of Holocene climate change, with good agreement obtained. It is concluded that the application of optical dating to a range of aeolian landforms has the potential to establish the style as well as timing of dune-building. It is also demonstrated that the climate during dune-building periods must have differed significantly from the prevailing semi-arid climate with drought periods of today, which may have been the predominant climate regime through much of the Holocene.","UNIV OXFORD,SCH GEOG,OXFORD OX1 3TB,ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD,ARCHAEOL & HIST ART RES LAB,OXFORD OX1 3TB,ENGLAND; UNIV LUTON,DEPT ENVIRONM SCI,LUTON LU1 3SE,BEDS,ENGLAND",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Bedfordshire,"Thomas, DSG (corresponding author), UNIV SHEFFIELD,DEPT GEOG,SHEFFIELD CTR INT DRYLAND RES,SHEFFIELD S10 2TN,S YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,,"Thomas, David/0000-0001-6867-5504",,,,,52,58,64,0,9,"ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC",LONDON,"338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 3BH",0959-6836,,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,SEP,1997,3,,,,273,281,,10.1177/095968369700700303,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968369700700303,,,9,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,YB599,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1997YB59900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through direct along-orbit analysis of instantaneous inter-satellite measurements, we demonstrate the higher sensitivity of LRI (than K-band microwave ranging [KBR]) to anomalies associated with the Earth static gravity field at high spatial resolutions of 100-200 km. We found that LRI captures gravitational signals as small as 0.1 nm/s(2)at 490 km altitude, improved by 1 order of magnitude from KBR. This allows LRI to uniquely detect un-/mis-modeled short-wavelength gravitational perturbations. We employed all LRI data in 2019 to validate various state-of-the-art global static gravity field models and show that LRI measurements, even over 1 month, can distinguish subtle differences among the models computed from similar to 15 years of GRACE KBR and similar to 4 years of Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) gradiometry data. Ultra-precise LRI measurements will be yet another critical data set for future gravity field model development.","[Ghobadi-Far, Khosro; Han, Shin-Chan] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [McCullough, Christopher M.; Wiese, David N.; Yuan, Dah-Ning; Landerer, Felix W.; Watkins, Michael M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Sauber, Jeanne] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Geodesy & Geophys Lab, Greenbelt, MD USA",University of Newcastle; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Ghobadi-Far, K (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",khosro.ghobadifar@uon.edu.au,"Landerer, Felix W/ABG-2849-2021","Landerer, Felix W/0000-0003-2678-095X; Wiese, David/0000-0001-7035-0514; McCullough, Christopher/0000-0001-7424-8349; Han, Shin-Chan/0000-0003-1810-1670; Ghobadi-Far, Khosro/0000-0001-8146-252X",University of Newcastle; NASA's GRACE Follow-On science team project; NASA [GRACERFO19-0010],University of Newcastle; NASA's GRACE Follow-On science team project; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was funded by The University of Newcastle and NASA's GRACE Follow-On science team project.

For homogeneous forest stands with a closed canopy, the overall uncertainty in annual mean soil loads can be as low as 10-15% if state-of-the-art measurement and analytical techniques are used in combination with a sufficiently large number of replicate samplers. The uncertainly in atmospheric deposition estimates, however, is estimated much larger, i.e. up to 30% for sulphur and 40% for nitrogen and base cations. This is mainly attributed to (i) uncertainties associated with the estimation of canopy exchange, and (ii) dry deposition to the forest floor and understorey vegetation which is usually not addressed in throughfall studies.

A literature review of crossover recommended measures, policies instruments and allocated funds in Spain",ENERGY AND BUILDINGS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Energy retrofit; Residential building renovation; Energy efficiency retrofitting strategies; Energy efficiency; Spain residential retrofitting; Spain subsidies for building renovation; State-of-the-art,STOCK; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL,"The building sector is responsible for more than 40% of final energy consumption in Europe; conse-quently, retrofitting existing buildings can significantly contribute to mitigate greenhouse emissions. Nevertheless, although the European Union has introduced relevant policy instruments, up to now the annual retrofit rates are considerably low with an average of 0.2% at European level. Understanding the past would support the success of the new strategies, such as the recent ones launched through the New Green Deal, which reinforces the importance of renovating existing buildings stock, as the main aim of the renovation wave. As a starting point for assessing the main challenges to allocate the Recovery funds, this paper provides a review of Spain's relevant literature to clearly define the characterization of the existing building stock, which actions have been typically considered under the scope of retrofits, and which strategies have been implemented until now, considering both, private and public initiatives and public financial schemes. The present work has a strong focus on energy-related strategies, although other interrelated actions are mentioned, such as accessibility measures and interior refurbishment of dwellings. Differences and sim-ilarities within these approaches are presented through the analysis of 27 relevant references of retrofit-ting actions and 52 references of financial mechanisms. As in Spain 93% of multifamily buildings were constructed prior to the national transposition of the first Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD), and therefore are in need of deep energy renovations, the retrofitting of multifamily buildings topic has been widely addressed, even though often in a disjointed manner. The study suggests that although historically there have been several recommended strategies, few are conceived as integral actions, only 15% of the intervention packages refer passive and active energy-related measures and renewable energy incorporation. Furthermore, considering the antiquity of the building stock and the advantage of addressing the topic through clusters, only 63% of the resources directly refer these actions to specific clusters among the six distinctive periods, although in most cases focusing their recommendations on buildings constructed before 1980 where the worst energy performance buildings are concentrated. Concerning public financial and funding instruments, the research illustrates that there has been a sub-stantial increment of programs over the last years promoting energy-related measures, renewable energy and other complementary aspects such as accessibility and interior renovations, mainly for older clusters. Nevertheless, the funds constitute only 8% of the necessary declared investments, which along with the dispersion between the different procedures and the complexity of the processes, have significantly reduced the global impact of these actions without generating robust and oriented market dynamics. Despite the several resources found, both financial instruments and guidelines tend to describe in more detail strategies related to heating demand and consumption and not delve into other relevant actions for warmer climates, fact associated both to the dynamics coming from other countries, and to a vision of the past in which people do not consume refrigeration. This clear focus on heating loads rather than cooling could present limitations for warmer regions in the near climate-change future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Iralde, N.

First, convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained using sea-surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) maps of the Indian Ocean from 1854 to 1989, and the properly trained CNN models were then validated with the period from 1991 to 2019. The results indicate that the deep learning approach is capable of forecasting the IOD at lead times up to 7 months. The forecast skills of CNN are superior to those of the dynamic models in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). The CNN outperforms the NMME with lower sensitivity to predictability barriers and fewer systematic errors. Moreover, the gradient heat map analysis demonstrates that the triggering precursors selected by CNN models for IOD events are novel and physically sensible. These results suggest the CNN to be a new and effective tool for both IOD prediction and comprehension. Plain Language Summary The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a prominent climate variability observed in the tropical Indian Ocean, and affects the climate in many parts of the world via atmospheric teleconnection. Due to the substantial impacts of the IOD, extensive research has been conducted on its dynamic prediction using state-of-the-art coupled climate models. However, the prediction of the IOD with dynamic models at lead times exceeding 3 months remains a challenge. Here, we propose a statistical method based on deep learning techniques to forecast the IOD, which is capable to provide skillful prediction at lead times up to 7 months. The convolutional neural network (CNN) models are less obstructed by the boreal winter and summer predictability barrier as well. The oceanic precursors for IOD development, being freely identified by CNN models, are physically reasonable. The results indicate these triggering precursors are mainly distributed in the negative sea-surface temperature anomaly of the Southern Indian Ocean at long lead times. Key Points Statistical method based on deep learning techniques to forecast the Indian Ocean Dipole Convolutional neural network (CNN) can provide skillful prediction at lead times up to 7 months Triggering precursors selected by CNN are mainly distributed in the southern Indian Ocean","[Liu, Jun] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun; Chen, Dake] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Youmin; Wu, Yanling; Wang, Qiang] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Youmin] Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Tang, Youmin; Wu, Yanling; Chen, Dake] Southern Lab Ocean Sci & Engn, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanling; Wang, Qiang] Hohai Univ, Key Lab Marine Hazards Forecasting, Minist Nat Resources, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Tang] Zhejiang Univ, Res Ctr Coastal & Urban Geotech Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Hohai University; University of Northern British Columbia; Hohai University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Zhejiang University,"Tang, YM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Tang, YM (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn, Prince George, BC, Canada.;Tang, YM (corresponding author), Southern Lab Ocean Sci & Engn, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",ytang@unbc.ca,,"Chen, Dake/0000-0002-8193-7158","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41690124, 41690120, 41530961]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank the NOAA for providing the data sets of the NMME and the ERSSTv5.

A mission would meet geomorphologists' requirements observing changing features such as landslides, earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, and glaciers.","[Donnellan, Andrea; Green, Joseph J.; De Jong, Eric M.; Knight, Russell; Bills, Bruce] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Arrowsmith, Ramon] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Donnellan, A (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",Andrea.Donnellan@jpl.nasa.gov; Joseph.J.Green@jpl.nasa.gov; Eric.M.DeJong@jpl.nasa.gov; Russell.L.Knight@jpl.nasa.gov; Bruce.Bills@jpl.nasa.gov; Ramon.Arrowsmith@asu.edu,"Donnellan, Andrea/AAB-4367-2020","Donnellan, Andrea/0000-0001-6843-8373",,,,,7,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1095-323X,,978-1-4673-1811-2,AEROSP CONF PROC,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,9,"Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BFJ62,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000320123902025,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, for movable cultural heritage, art exhibition and transport may result in deterioration and damage. While non-invasive and non-contact methods are useful in order to monitor the continuous changes in the artwork, very few are able to measure the relatively rapid and microscopic surface movement in paintings. Research is presented on the monitoring of changes in the surface movement of paintings on a wooden support or panel provoked by induced and natural fluctuations in relative humidity using Digital Holographic Speckle Pattern Interferometry. This technique was used in order to obtain a complete surface analysis of model panel painting samples with typical presence of inhomogeneities within the structure.

The management of locally produced energy, which can be implemented by a microgrid capable of either being linked to the main grid or operating independently, is equally crucial. Additionally, it seems that electricity storage is the only practical way to manage energy effectively within a microgrid. Energy storage is hence one of the main technological parameters upon which future energy management has to be based. Especially during crisis periods (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the ongoing energy crisis), storage is a valuable tool to optimize energy management, particularly from renewables, in order to successfully cover demand fluctuation, hence achieving resilience, while at the same time reducing overall energy costs. The purpose of the paper is to analyze and present, in brief, the state-of-the-art of the energy storage systems that are available on the market and discuss the upcoming technological improvements of the storage systems and, in particular, of batteries. The analysis will focus on the storage systems that can be used within a stand-alone community such as a microgrid, but not limited to it. In the analysis, short- and long-term storage options are discussed, as well as varying storage capacities of the different technologies. The analysis is based on contemporary optimization tools and methods used for standalone communities. Understanding the state-of-the-art of energy storage technology is crucial in order to achieve optimum solutions and will form the base for any further research.","[Symeonidou, Maria; Papadopoulos, Agis M.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Proc Equipment Design Lab, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Papadopoulos, AM (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Proc Equipment Design Lab, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",agis@auth.gr,,,,,,,208,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2022,22,,,,,,8631,10.3390/en15228631,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15228631,,,28,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,6K0OO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000887213200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This question, of both past and present importance, is encapsulated by the major socioeconomic crisis that affected the Mediterranean 3200 yr ago. The demise of the core civilizations of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age (Dark Ages) is still controversial because it raises the question of climate-change impacts on ancient societies. Although evidence for this climate shift has gradually gained currency, recent attempts to quantify its magnitude remain equivocal. Here we focus on the northern Levant (coastal Syria) where the economic, political, and cultural changes were particularly acute. We quantify past climate changes and find that mean annual temperatures attained anomalies of - 2.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C to - 4.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C compared to present-day conditions. Rainfall regimes displayed an important shift in seasonality, with a 40% decrease in winter precipitation. A 300 yr period of dry and cool climate started similar to 3200 yr ago and was coeval with deep social changes in the eastern Mediterranean. These Little Ice Age-type conditions affected harvests, leading to severe food shortages that probably aggravated the sociopolitical tensions. This crisis highlights the fragility of societies, both past and present, to major climate-change episodes and their broader consequences.","[Kaniewski, David; Otto, Thierry; Luce, Frederic; Van Campo, Elise] Univ Toulouse, EcoLab, CNRS, INP,UPS, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Marriner, Nick] Univ Franche Comte, Lab Chrono Environm UMR6249, Maison Sci Homme & Environm Claude Nicolas Ledoux, USR 3124,CNRS,UFR ST, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Cheddadi, Rachid] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS IRD UM2, ISEM, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Morhange, Christophe] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, INRA,Coll France,CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France; [Bretschneider, Joachim] Univ Ghent, Fac Art & Philosophy, Dept Archaeol Ancient Near East, Sint Pietersnieuwstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Jans, Greta] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Letteren, Near Eastern Studies, Blijde Lnkomststr 21, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; PSL Research University Paris; College de France; Ghent University; KU Leuven,"Kaniewski, D (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, EcoLab, CNRS, INP,UPS, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.",david.kaniewski@univ-tlse3.fr,"Cheddadi, Rachid/GXM-6391-2022; Kaniewski, David/AAT-2607-2021; Marriner, Nick/AAA-3004-2019","Kaniewski, David/0000-0001-6569-3184; Marriner, Nick/0000-0002-7916-6059; Otto, Thierry/0000-0003-2854-6454","Institut Universitaire de France (CLIMSORIENT program); University of Ghent (Department of Archaeology); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [G010218N]; Excellence Initiative of Aix-Marseille University-A*MIDEX, a French Investissements d'Avenir project;  [ANR-11-LABX-0061]","Institut Universitaire de France (CLIMSORIENT program); University of Ghent (Department of Archaeology); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Excellence Initiative of Aix-Marseille University-A*MIDEX, a French Investissements d'Avenir project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ","Support was provided by the Institut Universitaire de France (CLIMSORIENT program), the University of Ghent (Department of Archaeology), and the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO, G010218N).

An understanding of both the magnitude and drivers of current CO2 and CH4 fluxes are a prerequisite for making robust projections of future changes. In this study, we use observations from the recent Airborne Carbon Measurements (ACME-V) aircraft campaign to estimate the magnitude and environmental predictors CO2 and CH4 fluxes in Alaska. ACME-V consisted of 38 flights across the North Slope between late May and mid-September 2015, making it the most detailed airborne survey of northern Alaska to date. These data, combined with a geostatistical inverse model, provide a unique lens into fluxes across the region. Using this approach, we estimate a large CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the North Slope of Alaska in early summer that is counterbalanced by CO2 uptake in late summer; this balance between early season respiration and late-summer photosynthesis drives the total summer CO2 flux across northern Alaska during the study period. We further compare our results to process-based flux estimates (the Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project, MsTMIP and the Wetland and Wetland CH4 Inter-comparison of Models Project, WETCHIMP) and several recent studies of the same spatial domain. We observe a similarity in CO2 flux totals between MsTMIP suite of models and our study (June 2015-0.86 - 0.57 vs 0.96, July 2015 MsTMIP 1.01 - 0.00 vs 0.14 and August 2915 MsTMIP 0.73 - 0.29 vs -0.50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), MsTMIP and our study, respectively, averaged across the North Slope). However, we find significantly higher CH4 fluxes from the North Slope than any of the WETCHIMP models. Specifically, we estimate total CH4 fluxes from the North Slope of Alaska of +0.64 +/- 0.13 Tg (95% confidence), during June through August 2015 while the WETCHIMP model estimates range from 0.004 to 0.1 Tg, depending upon the model. Furthermore, the contribution of the North Slope tundra to the overall Alaskan CH4 fluxes during the entire period was similar to 27%, compared to 3% in state-of-the-art process-based models.","[Tadic, Jovan M.; Biraud, Sebastien C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miller, Scot] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Yadav, Vineet] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Tadic, JM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jtadic@lbl.gov,"Tadic, Jovan/ABA-8954-2021","Tadic, Jovan/0000-0003-4655-5063",Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy as part of the At-mospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; ARM Aerial Facility (AAF); Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) Program,Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy as part of the At-mospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program; ARM Aerial Facility (AAF); Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) Program,"We thank John Henderson of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. for providing PWRF and STILT simulations for the ACME flights.

J,"Mcmanus, L",,,,"Mcmanus, Laurie",,,"Prostitutes,Trauma, and (Auto-)Biographical Narratives: Revisiting Brahms at the Fin de Siecle",NINETEENTH CENTURY MUSIC,,,English,Article,,,,,,Brahms; psychology; historiography; sexuality; Vienna,,"Unlike Wagner, Mahler, or Schoenberg, Johannes Brahms is often absent from discussions of Viennese fin-de-siecle psychological theories and their intersections with musical culture. The privileged context depicting an aging Brahms resistant to new trends in politics and the arts discourages the notion that he would have known and been influenced by any such developments in the developing field of psychology or psychological arts. As a case study exploring Brahms's potential engagement in these areas, this article reexamines the contested legend of Brahms playing piano in dive bars as an adolescent, not to determine its veracity, but in part to reveal how this motif functions in two different narrative models of Brahms biographies to about 1933. In the first model, the composer emerges spotless from the trials of a low-income childhood; in the second, however, he remains scarred by the unhealthy sexual climate of the bars. I argue that cultural-intellectual contexts in fin-de-siecle Vienna influenced Brahms's attempts to shape his biographical narratives and that both models could have originated with Brahms himself. From Paolo Mantegazza's sexology treatises to Hermann Bahr's scandalous plays, the Viennese reading public was confronted with both scientific and literary material that conflated psychology, sexuality, and personal identity, while other artists such as Max Klinger sought to explore the unconscious motivations behind behaviors. In this context, we may reevaluate anecdotal evidence in which Brahms accords his adult problems to a traumatic childhood experience of playing piano in dangerous establishments: it suggests that Brahms could have taken part in fin-de-siecle trends of self-analysis and psychologized autobiography.","[Mcmanus, Laurie] Shenandoah Conservatory, Mus Literature, Winchester, VA 22601 USA",,"Mcmanus, L (corresponding author), Shenandoah Conservatory, Mus Literature, Winchester, VA 22601 USA.",,,,,,,,143,0,0,0,1,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",0148-2076,,,NINETEEN CENT MUSIC,Ninet.

In terms of global emissions, isoprene is the most important BVOC. Droughts bring about changes in the surface emission of biogenic hydrocarbons mainly because plants suffer water stress. Past studies report that the current parameterization in the state-of-the-art Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) v2.1, which is a function of the soil water content and the permanent wilting point, fails at representing the strong reduction in isoprene emissions observed in field measurements conducted during a severe drought. Since the current algorithm was originally developed based on potted plants, in this study, we update the parameterization in the light of recent ecosystem-scale measurements of isoprene conducted during natural droughts in the central U.S. at the Missouri Ozarks AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site. The updated parameterization results in stronger reductions in isoprene emissions. Evaluation using satellite formaldehyde (HCHO), a proxy for BVOC emissions, and a chemical-transport model, shows that the adjusted parameterization provides a better agreement between the modelled and observed HCHO temporal variability at local and regional scales in 2011-2012, even if it worsens the model agreement in a global, long-term evaluation. We discuss the limitations of the current parameterization, a function of highly uncertain soil properties such as porosity.","[Opacka, Beata; Muller, Jean-Francois; Stavrakou, Trissevgeni; De Smedt, Isabelle] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron BISA, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Miralles, Diego G.; Koppa, Akash; Pagan, Brianna Rita] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Hydroclimate Extremes Lab H CEL, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Pagan, Brianna Rita] SpacesenseAI, Remote Sensing, Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau 62, F-75001 Paris, France; [Potosnak, Mark J.] DePaul Univ, Environm Sci & Studies, 1110 W Belden Ave, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Seco, Roger] Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, CSIC, Carrer Jordi Girona 18-26, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Guenther, Alex B.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 3216 Croul Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Ghent University; DePaul University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo Pascual Vila (CID-CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA); University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Opacka, B (corresponding author), Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron BISA, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.",beata.opacka@aeronomie.be; jfm@aeronomie.be; jenny@aeronomy.be; diego.miralles@ugent.be; akash.koppa@ugent.be; brianna.pagan@ugent.be; mark.potosnak@depaul.edu; email@rogerseco.cat; isabelle.desmedt@aeronomie.be; alex.guenther@uci.edu,"Seco, Roger/F-7124-2011; Miralles, Diego G/K-8857-2013; Koppa, Akash/O-2122-2019","Seco, Roger/0000-0002-2078-9956; Miralles, Diego G/0000-0001-6186-5751; Koppa, Akash/0000-0001-5671-0878; de smedt, isabelle/0000-0002-3541-7725; Pagan, Brianna R./0000-0001-8028-0310","Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) [SR/00/373, B2/202/P1/EQUATOR]; NASA ACMAP [80NSSC19K0986]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCIN/AEI) [RYC2020-029216-I, CEX2018-000794-S]; European Social Fund (ESF) through ESF Investing in your future",Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); NASA ACMAP(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCIN/AEI); European Social Fund (ESF) through ESF Investing in your future(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This research was supported by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) through the STEREO III project ALBERI (Assessing Links between Biogenic Emissions and Remotely sensed photosynthesis Indicators, contract no.

Inclusion of two different spatial scales is useful, because the results from a small spatial scale (e.g. forest stand level) can help interpret the findings on a large spatial scale. Our review suggests that historic forest harvesting or land cover change has caused significant water yield increase due to reduction of forest canopy interception and evapotranspiration caused by removal of forest vegetation on both spatial scales. The impact magnitude caused by forest harvesting indicates that the hydrological effects of forest or land cover changes can be as important as those caused by climate change, while the opposite impact directions suggest their offsetting effects on water yield in the Minjiang River watershed. In addition, different types of forests have different magnitudes of evapotranspiration (ET), with the lowest in old-growth natural coniferous forests (Abies faxoniana Rehd. et Wils.) and the highest in coniferous plantations (e.g. Picea asperata Mast.) among major forest types in the study watershed. This suggests that selection of different types of forests can have an important role in ET and consequently water yield. Our synthesis indicates that future reforestation and climate change would likely produce the hydrological effects in the same direction and thus place double the pressure on water resource as both key drivers may lead to water yield reduction. The findings can support designing management strategies for protection of watershed ecological functions in the context of future land cover and climate changes.","[Wei, X.] Univ British Columbia, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Cui, X.; Liu, S.] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","University of British Columbia; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF","Wei, X (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",adam.wei@ubc.ca,,"Wei, Xiaohua (Adam)/0000-0003-2711-5636","Ministry of Finance [200804001, 201104006]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2002CB111500, 2011CB403205, 2012BAD22B01]; China's National Natural Science Foundation [30590383]; Chinese Academy of Forestry Foundation [CAFYBB2008007]","Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); China's National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Forestry Foundation","This review research was jointly funded by the Ministry of Finance (200804001 and 201104006), the Ministry of Science and Technology (2002CB111500; 2011CB403205, 2012BAD22B01), China's National Natural Science Foundation (No. 30590383) and Chinese Academy of Forestry Foundation (CAFYBB2008007).",,72,42,43,7,100,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

In this paper, we report on the spread and transportation of different wood-boring beetles with wooden pallets, wooden transport boxes used for art transportation, and also the rising problem of differentLyctusspecies (powder post beetles) in new wood used in museums. Not only the nativeLyctus linearisbut also the introducedL. brunneus,L. cavicollis,andL. africanuscan be found in transport boxes (nine cases in Germany between 2003 and 2015), infestations of new picture frames (three cases in Austria between 2010 and 2015), and new wood sold to carpenters in museum and conservation studios (used for new stretcher and picture frames, two cases in Austria). In some cases (two in Germany) a newly-laid parquet floor was infested by powder post beetles. The house longhorn beetle (H. bajulus), the furniture beetle (A. punctatum), and the AnobiidOligomerus ptilinoideswere all found infesting wooden pallets inside museum stores (five cases in Austria). New wooden pallets and transport boxes are treated once with heat after production, but our examples show that infestation and transportation of wood pests are still possible and are a new challenge for integrated pest management (IPM) in the future. We examine and discuss the materials used to transport art and possible measures to combat and prevent pests (plastic pallets or the use of other wood types). In addition, the biology and life-history of powderpost beetles is described.","[Biebl, Stephan] Ingn Holzschutz, Benediktbeuern, Germany; [Querner, Pascal] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Integrated Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Querner, Pascal] Univ Appl Arts Vienna, Inst Conservat, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Querner, P (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Integrated Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.;Querner, P (corresponding author), Univ Appl Arts Vienna, Inst Conservat, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",pascal.querner@boku.ac.at,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

Several models have recently been proposed with methodologies that are related to hidden Markov models (HMMs). In this paper, we formally employ HMMs, with Gaussian distributions, to generate CSI time-series. The authors propose two different methodologies. The first is a completely data-driven approach, where an HMM with Gaussian observation distributions is proposed. In the second, the means of these Gaussian observation distributions were predefined based on the fraction of time of bright sunshine from the site. Finally, the authors also propose a novel method to improve the autocorrelation function (ACF) of HMMs in general. The two methods were tested on two datasets representing two different climate regions. The performance of the two methodologies varied between the two datasets and among the compared performance metrics. Moreover, both the proposed methods underperformed in reproducing the ACF as compared to state-of-the-art models. However, the method proposed to improve the ACF was able to reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) of the ACF by up to 19%. In summary, the proposed models were able to achieve a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test score as low as 0.042 and MAE of the ACF as low as 0.012. These results are comparable with the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the proposed models were fast to train. HMMs are shown to be viable CSI generative models. The code for the model and the simulations performed in this paper can be found in the GitHub repository: HMM-CSI-generativeModel.","[Shepero, Mahmoud; Munkhammar, Joakim; Widen, Joakim] Uppsala Univ, Dept Engn Sci, POB 534, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Shepero, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Engn Sci, POB 534, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden.",mahmoud.shepero@angstrom.uu.se; joakim.munkhammar@angstrom.uu.se; joakim.widen@angstrom.uu.se,"Shepero, Mahmoud/J-8063-2017","Shepero, Mahmoud/0000-0001-6292-0695",SamspEL 2016-2020 in the project Development and evaluation of forecasting models for solar power and electricity use over space and time - Swedish Energy Agency,SamspEL 2016-2020 in the project Development and evaluation of forecasting models for solar power and electricity use over space and time - Swedish Energy Agency,"This work was financially supported by SamspEL 2016-2020 in the project Development and evaluation of forecasting models for solar power and electricity use over space and time, financed primarily by the Swedish Energy Agency.

AIRS/AMSU had two primary objectives. The first objective was to provide real-time data products available for use by the operational Numerical Weather Prediction Centers in a data assimilation mode to improve the skill of their subsequent forecasts. The second objective was to provide accurate unbiased sounding products with good spatial coverage that are used to generate stable multi-year climate data sets to study the earth's interannual variability, climate processes, and possibly long-term trends. AIRS/AMSU data for all time periods are now being processed using the state of the art AIRS Science Team Version-6 retrieval methodology. The Suomi-NPP mission was launched in October 2011 as part of a sequence of Low Earth Orbiting satellite missions under the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). NPP carries CrIS and ATMS, which are advanced infra-red and microwave atmospheric sounders that were designed as follow-ons to the AIRS and AMSU instruments. The main objective of this work is to assess whether CrIS/ATMS will be an adequate replacement for AIRS/AMSU from the perspective of the generation of accurate and consistent long term climate data records, or if improved instruments should be developed for future flight. It is critical for CrIS/ATMS to be processed using an algorithm similar to, or at least comparable to, AIRS Version-6 before such an assessment can be made. We have been conducting research to optimize products derived from CrIS/ATMS observations using a scientific approach analogous to the AIRS Version-6 retrieval algorithm. Our latest research uses Version-5.70 of the CrIS/ATMS retrieval algorithm, which is otherwise analogous to AIRS Version-6, but does not yet contain the benefit of use of a Neural-Net first guess start-up system which significantly improved results of AIRS Version-6. Version-5.70 CrIS/ATMS temperature profile and surface skin temperature retrievals are of very good quality, and are better than AIRS Version-5 retrievals, but are still significantly poorer than those of AIRS Version-6. CrIS/ATMS retrievals should improve when a Neural-Net start-up system is ready for use. We also examined CrIS/ATMS retrievals generated by NOAA using their NUCAPS retrieval algorithm, which is based on earlier versions of the AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms. We show that the NUCAPS algorithm as currently configured is not well suited for climate monitoring purposes.","[Susskind, Joel] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Kouvaris, Louis; Iredell, Lena] NASA, SAIC, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),"Susskind, J (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-9716-1,PROC SPIE,,,2013,,,,,,,88660W,10.1117/12.2023375,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2023375,,,14,Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Optics,BHU75,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000326700700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

These schemes rely exclusively on wave dissipation, by GW breaking or near critical layers, as a mechanism leading to forcing of the mean flow. In a transient GWP, without the steady-state assumption, nondissipative wave-mean-flow interactions are enabled as an additional mechanism. Idealized studies have shown that this is potentially important, and therefore the transient GWP Multiscale Gravity Wave Model (MS-GWaM) has been implemented into a state-of-the-art weather and climate model. In this implementation, MS-GWaM leads to a zonal-mean circulation that agrees well with observations and increases GW momentum-flux intermittency as compared with steady-state GWPs, bringing it into better agreement with superpressure balloon observations. Transient effects taken into account by MS-GWaM are shown to make a difference even on monthly time scales: in comparison with steady-state GWPs momentum fluxes in the lower stratosphere are increased and the amount of missing drag at Southern Hemispheric high latitudes is decreased to a modest but nonnegligible extent. An analysis of the contribution of different wavelengths to the GW signal in MS-GWaM suggests that small-scale GWs play an important role down to horizontal and vertical wavelengths of 50 km (or even smaller) and 200 m, respectively.","[Boeloeni, Gergely; Kim, Young-Ha; Achatz, Ulrich] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Inst Atmosphare & Umwelt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Boeloeni, Gergely; Borchert, Sebastian] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Boloni, G (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Inst Atmosphare & Umwelt, Frankfurt, Germany.;Boloni, G (corresponding author), Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany.",gergely.boeloeni@dwd.de; achatz@iau.uni-frankfurt.de,"Kim, Young-Ha/Q-4542-2017; Bölöni, Gergely/AAX-4364-2021","Kim, Young-Ha/0000-0003-4014-073X; ","German Research Foundation (DFG) through the research unit Multiscale Dynamics of Gravity Waves (MS-GWaves); German Research Foundation (DFG) [AC 71/8-2, AC 71/9-2, AC 71/10-2, AC 71/11-2, AC 71/12-2, BO 5071/2-2, BO 5071/1-2, ZA 268/10-2]; Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) - Scientific Steering Committee (WLA) [bb1097]",German Research Foundation (DFG) through the research unit Multiscale Dynamics of Gravity Waves (MS-GWaves)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) - Scientific Steering Committee (WLA),"The authors thank the German Research Foundation (DFG) for partial support through the research unit Multiscale Dynamics of Gravity Waves (MS-GWaves) and through Grants AC 71/8-2, AC 71/9-2, AC 71/10-2, AC 71/11-2, AC 71/12-2, BO 5071/2-2, BO 5071/1-2, and ZA 268/10-2.

Here we use long-term (1982-2010) precipitation (P) and runoff (Q) measurements to infer runoff coefficient (Q/P) and evapotranspiration (E) trends across 18 unimpaired tropical rainforest catchments. We complement that analysis by using satellite observations coupled with ecosystem process modeling (using both top-down and bottom-up perspectives) to examine trends in carbon uptake and relate that to the observed changes in Q/P and E. Our results show there have been only minor changes in the satellite-observed canopy leaf area over 1982-2010, suggesting that eCO(2) has not increased vegetation leaf area in tropical rainforests and therefore any plant response to eCO(2) occurs at the leaf level. Meanwhile, observed Q/P and E also remained relatively constant in the 18 catchments, implying an unchanged hydrological partitioning and thus approximately conserved transpiration under eCO(2). For the same period, using a top-down model based on gas exchange theory, we predict increases in plant assimilation (A) and light use efficiency (epsilon) at the leaf level under eCO(2) , the magnitude of which is essentially that of eCO(2) (i. e., similar to 12% over 1982-2010). Simulations from 10 state-of-the-art bottom-up ecosystem models over the same catchments also show that the direct effect of eCO(2) is to mostly increase A and e with little impact on E. Our findings add to the current limited pool of knowledge regarding the long-term eCO(2) impacts in tropical rainforests.","[Yang, Yuting; Donohue, Randall J.; McVicar, Tim R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Donohue, Randall J.; McVicar, Tim R.; Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Sys, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Beck, Hylke E.] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ispra, Italy",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; Australian National University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Yang, YT (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Yuting.yang@csiro.au,"Donohue, Randall/A-8446-2011; McVicar, Tim R/D-8614-2011; Yang, Yuting/C-8527-2014; Beck, Hylke/ABD-9012-2020; yang, yuting/Y-7885-2018","McVicar, Tim R/0000-0002-0877-8285; Yang, Yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; yang, yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929",CSIRO OCE postdoctoral Fellowship program; Australian Research Council [CE11E0098],CSIRO OCE postdoctoral Fellowship program; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Y.Y. acknowledges the support of CSIRO OCE postdoctoral Fellowship program.

Clim. Change 10 647-53, Liu 2020 Nat. Commun. 11); however, it is unclear how much it would slow the increasing trend of atmospheric CO2 concentration, the main driver of climate change, and whether this impact can be observed considering the large biosphere and weather variabilities. We used a state-of-the-art atmospheric transport model to simulate CO2, and the model was driven by a new daily fossil fuel emissions dataset and hourly biospheric fluxes from a carbon cycle model forced with observed climate variability. Our results show a 0.21 ppm decrease in the atmospheric column CO2 anomaly in the Northern Hemisphere latitude band 0-45 degrees N in March 2020, and an average of 0.14 ppm for the period of February-April 2020, which is the largest decrease in the last 10 years. A similar decrease was observed by the carbon observing satellite GOSAT (Yokota et al 2009 Sola 5 160-3). Using model sensitivity experiments, we further found that the COVID and weather variability are the major contributors to this CO2 drawdown, and the biosphere showed a small positive anomaly. Measurements at marine boundary layer stations, such as Hawaii, exhibit 1-2 ppm anomalies, mostly due to weather and the biosphere. At the city scale, the on-road CO2 enhancement measured in Beijing shows a reduction by 20-30 ppm, which is consistent with the drastically reduced traffic during the COVID lockdown. A stepwise drop of 20 ppm during the city-wide lockdown was observed in the city of Chengdu. The ability of our current carbon monitoring systems in detecting the small and short-lasting COVID signals at different policy relevant scales (country and city) against the background of fossil fuel CO2 accumulated over the last two centuries is encouraging. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unintended experiment. Its impact suggests that to keep atmospheric CO2 at a climate-safe level will require sustained effort of similar magnitude and improved accuracy, as well as expanded spatiotemporal coverage of our monitoring systems.","[Zeng, Ning; Oda, Tomohiro; Dickerson, Russell] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zeng, Ning; Dickerson, Russell] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zeng, Ning; Han, Pengfei; Liu, Zhiqiang; Liu, Di; Cai, Qixiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geophys Fluid, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Oda, Tomohiro] Univ Space Res Assoc, Earth Space Inst, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Oda, Tomohiro] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Martin, Cory] RedLine Performance Solut LLC, Rockville, MD USA; [Martin, Cory] NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, Rockville, MD USA; [Liu, Zhu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yao, Bo; Sun, Wanqi] China Meteorol Adm, Meteorol Observat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pucai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Lab Middle Atmosphere & Global Environm Observat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Maksyutov, Shamil] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Han, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Carbon Neutral Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Tsinghua University; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zeng, N; Oda, T (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Zeng, N (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Zeng, N (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geophys Fluid, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Oda, T (corresponding author), Univ Space Res Assoc, Earth Space Inst, Columbia, MD 21046 USA.;Oda, T (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",zeng@umd.edu; toda@usra.edu,"Dickerson, Russell/ABB-1512-2020; Liu, Zhu/A-4634-2013","Dickerson, Russell/0000-0003-0206-3083; Liu, Zhu/0000-0002-8968-7050; Liu, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-2982-8381; Wang, Pucai/0000-0003-2229-6941; Oda, Tomohiro/0000-0002-8328-3020",MOST [2017YFB0504000]; NOAA [NA18OAR4310266]; NIST [70NANB14H333],MOST; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NIST(National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA),"We are grateful to the providers of the following datasets, made available in a timely fashion: the GOSAT satellite data by JAXA and NIES, the GLOBALVIEWplus ObsPack data via Andy Jacobson, Kirk Thoning and Pieter Tans, the NASA GISS temperature data and NOAA CPC PREL/OPI data.

This surface reflectance anisotropy has implications for UV/V is satellite retrievals of albedo, clouds, and trace gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). These retrievals routinely assume the surface to reflect light isotropically. Here we show that cloud fractions retrieved from GOME-2A and OMI with the FRESCO and OMCFDO2 algorithms have an east-west bias of 10 % to 50 %, which are highest over vegetation and forested areas, and that this bias originates from the assumption of isotropic surface reflection. To interpret the across-track bias with the DAK radiative transfer model, we implement the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from the Ross-Li semi-empirical model. Testing our implementation against state-of-the-art RTMs LIDORT and SCIATRAN, we find that simulated TOA reflectance generally agrees to within 1 %. We replace the assumption of isotropic surface reflection in the equations used to retrieve cloud fractions over forested scenes with scattering kernels and corresponding BRDF parameters from a daily high-resolution database derived from 16 years' worth of MODIS measurements. By doing this, the east-west bias in the simulated cloud fractions largely vanishes. We conclude that across-track biases in cloud fractions can be explained by cloud algorithms that do not adequately account for the effects of surface reflectance anisotropy. The implications for NO2 air mass factor (AMF) calculations are substantial. Under moderately polluted NO2 and backward-scattering conditions, clear-sky AMFs are up to 20 % higher and cloud radiance fractions up to 40% lower if surface anisotropic reflection is accounted for. The combined effect of these changes is that NO2 total AMFs increase by up to 30 % for backward-scattering geometries (and decrease by up to 35 % for forward-scattering geometries), which is stronger than the effect of either contribution alone. In an unpolluted troposphere, surface BRDF effects on cloud fraction counteract (and largely cancel) the effect on the clear-sky AMF. Our results emphasise that surface reflectance anisotropy needs to be taken into account in a coherent manner for more realistic and accurate retrievals of clouds and NO2 from UV/V is satellite sensors. These improvements will be beneficial for current sensors, in particular for the recently launched TROPOMI instrument with a high spatial resolution.","[Lorente, Alba; Boersma, K.

This technique can apply equally effectively to bare as well as modified BiVO4 by Mo-doping, heterojunction formation with WO3, and an oxygen evolution co-catalyst. Relative to FA, HMA forms BiVO4 films of smaller feature sizes, higher porosity, and increased three dimensional roughness, which decrease the diffusion distance of holes to the surface and thereby increase mainly the bulk charge separation efficiency (eta(bulk)) of the photoanodes. Thus, the HMA-treated BiVO4/WO3 film achieves the state-of-the art eta(bulk) of similar to 90% for water oxidation. Combination of a photoanode of NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4/WO3 (HMA, 6 min) with a 2p c-Si solar cell allows a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of similar to 5.0% in unbiased overall water splitting, which is also comparable to the state-of-the-art for a similar material combination.","[Kim, Jin Hyun] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Jo, Yim Hyun] Korea Inst Energy Res, Adv Ctr Energy, Ulsan 689798, South Korea; [Kim, Ju Hun; Lee, Jae Sung] Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Ulsan 689798, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER); Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Lee, JS (corresponding author), Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Ulsan 689798, South Korea.",jlee1234@unist.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jin Hyun/0000-0001-9969-5196","Brain Korea Plus Program of Ministry of Education, Korean Center for Artificial Photosynthesis [NRF-2011-C1AAA0001-2011-0030278]; Climate Change Response project [2015M1A2A2074663]; Basic Science Grant - MSIP [NRF-2015R1A2A1A10054346]; MOTIE of the Republic of Korea [10050509]","Brain Korea Plus Program of Ministry of Education, Korean Center for Artificial Photosynthesis(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Climate Change Response project; Basic Science Grant - MSIP; MOTIE of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Brain Korea Plus Program of Ministry of Education, Korean Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (NRF-2011-C1AAA0001-2011-0030278), the Climate Change Response project (2015M1A2A2074663), and the Basic Science Grant (NRF-2015R1A2A1A10054346) funded by MSIP and Project No. 10050509 funded by MOTIE of the Republic of Korea.",,54,31,31,5,116,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2040-3364,2040-3372,,NANOSCALE,Nanoscale,,2016,40,,,,17623,17631,,10.1039/c6nr05445e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6nr05445e,,,9,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,EA0AA,27714102,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000386244400029,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigate the sources of the enhanced winter precipitation, by applying a moisture tracking model on the results of idealized orbital extreme experiments with a state-of-the-art climate model. Precession and obliquity enhance precipitation in fall and winter. Our study shows that the source of enhanced precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea differs during the winter half-year. In fall, the majority of the precession-induced precipitation increase originates from the Mediterranean itself. However, in late winter, the increase can be attributed to enhanced moisture advection from the Atlantic. This agrees with changes in evaporation and air-sea temperature differences over the Mediterranean. The obliquity-induced precipitation increase shows much less differences, with an equal contribution of local and Atlantic sources. The mechanism behind the Atlantic source of moisture, particularly important in late winter for precession-induced precipitation changes, is related to a weakened Azores High and slightly higher surface pressure over North Africa. The resulting anomalous circulation patterns generate enhanced Atlantic moisture transport toward the Mediterranean. These mechanisms coincide with weaker storm track activity over the North Atlantic, opposite to previous studies that often attribute enhanced Mediterranean winter precipitation to a southward shift and intensification of the Atlantic storm track. We thus provide an alternative mechanism for Atlantic sources of orbitally paced Mediterranean precipitation changes.","[Bosmans, J. H. C.; van der Ent, R. J.; Hilgen, F.

It can accomplish this, however, only if sufficient space for erecting wind turbines (WTs) is made available. In Europe we currently observe the trend that administrative landscape protection counteracts the desired development. Especially in Germany, the country that leads the world thus far in terms of installed capacity for wind power, the planning authorities are moving toward limiting locally available sites by designating so-called priority and suitability areas. These areas give the erection of WTs priority over other types of land uses but prohibit the erection of WTs outside these areas. The scale and the placement of these areas will be of great significance in future for securing wind energy supply at the regional level and thus for accomplishing national goals in climate policy. According to the regulations in the law revising the legal status of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG, 2009), payment for wind power feed-in to the grid is granted only if, with regard to energy production, the WT to be erected yields at least 60% of a pre-defined standard performance level. With this regulation, the EEG wishes to prevent erecting WTs at locations inefficient for energy production. At the same time, however, higher standards are placed on the allocation of VE areas (priority and suitability areas) as a result. This poses the question: Does regional planning conform to such standards? With the example of the planning region West Saxony, we will evaluate the role the designation of VE areas plays in achieving Germany's wind energy ambitions. The case study reveals that the strategic search of VE areas by the regional planning authorities, involving local stakeholders and the public, hampers investment in state-of-the-art WTs as fostered by the EEG (2009). This leads us to the general conclusion that, even with a participatory design of strategic planning and a determined governmental policy, deployment of the wind resource is not a fast-selling item that in future may contribute decisively toward achieving the ambitious goals in energy and climate policy.

The current Directive 2008/50 is the consequence of the normative evolution from the first partial Directives on specific polluting substances of the 1980s and to its most immediate antecedent, which was Directive 96/62 on evaluation and management of the quality of the air. The protection of human health is the true leitmotiv and primary objective of the European regulations on air quality and the reason for the quantitative criteria set forth therein. The non-compliance by the States of the same has been systematic and continued as reflected, only in part, the Court Judgments, being premonitory of the tragic situation of pandemic and loss of life in which all the States are, but especially those of the main world economies to which they never thought this situation would come to them, and with a reflective state model that, for three decades, has not anticipated or prepared for crises that have been happening since 2000 and that it has forced citizens to live with risk and socialize it in the face of the progressive emptying of resources. For this reason, the need for a paradigm shift in the State model towards a social and democratic State (art. 1.1 CE) whose preventive function is the prevailing one, based and built on the true rights of people who are really enforceable to the public powers with the full guarantee of individual effective judicial protection in all its length and effectiveness. Despite the low compliance with environmental regulations, two very recent Judgments of the Court against France and Germany on Directive 2008/50 on air quality open a path of hope for citizens in the firmness demonstrated by the Court in demanding responsibilities to the States and the adoption of measures as soon as possible through the novel application of well-known principles such as that of efficacy, proportionality, strict liability, etc .... that establish the prevalence of health protection and air quality on other foundational principles of the European Union until now untouchable and before the still surprising allegations of defense of structural deficiencies by the first European economic powers for not having applied environmental regulations.","[Fernandez-Espinar Lopez, Luis Carlos] Univ Politecn Madrid, Derecho Adm, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Lopez, LCFE (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Derecho Adm, Madrid, Spain.",lc.fernandez-espinar@upm.es,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,4,CENTRO INT ESTUDIOS DERECHO AMBIENTAL-CIEDA-CIEMAT,SORIA,"PLAZA BERNARDO ROBLES, 9, SORIA, 42002, SPAIN",1989-5666,,,ACTUAL JURID AMBIENT,Actual.

The utilisation of non-wood biomass fuels, e.g. Miscanthus, grass and agriculture residues such as straw, com cobs or sunflower husks would be a possible alternative, but due to ash-related problems (slagging, deposit formation, corrosion and enhanced particulate matter emissions) these fuels cannot be used in conventional biomass heating systems designed for wood fuels so far. Within a nationally funded Austrian research project a new, fuel flexible and low-emission combustion technology in the power range from 300 to 1,000 kWth for ash-rich fuels with low ash melting temperatures (non-wood biomass fuels) has been developed. The application of optimised fuel additivation in combination with combustion related primary measures (appropriate air staging and bed cooling) form the basis to overcome ash- related problems. Test run results show that this technological approach provides significantly enhanced fuel flexibility at reduced emissions, compared to present state-of-the-art systems for small- to medium-scale applications without cost intensive secondary measures. With the technological additional fuel assortments (non-wood biomass fuels) may be utilised in an economically competitive way, which enlarges the available biomass fuel potential and increases the flexibility for the user.","[Mandl, Christoph; Obernberger, Ingwald] Bios Bioenergiesyst GmbH, Hedwig Katschinka Str 4, A-8020 Graz, Austria; [Knautz, Holger] Polytech Luft Feuerungstech GmbH, Hainfelderstr 69, A-2564 Weissenbach, Austria",,"Mandl, C (corresponding author), Bios Bioenergiesyst GmbH, Hedwig Katschinka Str 4, A-8020 Graz, Austria.",mandl@bios-bioenergy.at; obernberger@bios-bioenergy.at; h.knautz@polytechnik.at,,,Austrian climate and energy fund,Austrian climate and energy fund,"We gratefully acknowledge the Austrian climate and energy fund, for funding the project FlexiFuel-Tec under its program Energieforschungsprogramm - 1st call",,9,0,0,0,0,ETA-FLORENCE RENEWABLE ENERGIES,FLORENCE,"VIA A  GIACOMINI 28, FLORENCE, 50132, ITALY",,,,,,,2018,,,,,418,427,,,,,,10,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels,BP1RY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000540663800077,View Full Record in Web of Science

A promising way to addressing such items is by implementing water quality models (WQMs). Although, publications are increasing considerably in numbers, perhaps, we identified a shortage of bibliometric reviews based on the analysis of bibliographic data. To address this gap, descriptive statistics and bibliometric analyses using VOSviewer based on Scopus dataset is adopted to summarizes state of the art on the WQMing applications within the Atlantic region. First, a categorisation of the existent literature, founded on number of bibliometric data are critically analyzed based on a review of 1952 publications (2548 individual modelling applications) published between 1981 and 2021. Citations, co-authorship, and co-occurrence of words are exploited. Next, emerging trends such as the model types, modeled water body, modeled areas are spotted in the analysis. The meta-analysis reveals that applications of semi-empirical modeling frame-works (SWAT, 22.4%) dominate those of models for addressing water quality issues. Most of modelling applications have addressed watershed system (72.15%). Northwest and Northeast Atlantic have received the greatest attention, mostly the United States of America (41.64%). Additionally, a qualitative discussion is provided comparing the model dimensions, system, conceptualization, strengths, applications, and limitations. Finally, we provided the main impediments and suggested recommendations for enhancing WQMing science, infrastructure, and practices. These include the improvement in data availability, bridging gaps between experimentalists, modelers and stakeholders.","[Rhomad, Hanane; Khalil, Karima; Elkalay, Khalid] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Sch Technol, Lab Appl Sci Environm & Sustainable Dev, Route Agadir,BP 383, Essaouira, Morocco",Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech,"Rhomad, H (corresponding author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, Sch Technol, Lab Appl Sci Environm & Sustainable Dev, Route Agadir,BP 383, Essaouira, Morocco.",hanane.rhomad@gmail.com,,,CNRST (project PPR) [308/2017],CNRST (project PPR),"This work was financially supported by the CNRST (project PPR, Prog 308/2017).",,200,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Research on historical wooden structures and artefacts thereby provides knowledge of people's daily lives and the society in which they lived. Dendrochronology is a well-established dating method of wood that can also provide valuable knowledge about climate dynamics, environmental changes, silviculture, and cultural transformations. However, dendrochronology comes with some limitations that end users in cultural heritage sciences must be aware of, otherwise their surveys may not be ultimately performed. We have drawn attention to studies in which dendrochronological results have been misinterpreted, over-interpreted, or not fully utilized. On the other hand, a rigorous dendrochronological survey may not respond to the request of information in practice. To bridge this rigour-relevance gap, this article has considered and reviewed both the dendrochronology's science-perspective and the practitioner's and end user's call for context appropriate studies. The material for this study consists of (i) interviews with researchers in dendrochronology and end users represented by cultural heritage researchers with focus on building conservation and building history in Sweden, and (ii) a review of dendrochronological reports and the literature where results from the reports have been interpreted. From these sources we can conclude that a continuous two-way communication between the dendrochronologists and end users often would have resulted in improved cultural heritage studies. The communication can take place in several steps. Firstly, the design of a sampling plan, which according to the current standard for sampling of cultural materials often is required, is an excellent common starting point for communication. Secondly, the survey reports could be developed with a more extensive general outline of the method and guidance in how to interpret the results. Thirdly, the potential contribution from dendrochronology is often underused, foreseeing historical information on local climate, silviculture, and choice of quality of the wooden resource, as the focus most often is the chronological dating. Finally, the interpretation of the results should consider all the available sources where dendrochronology is one stake for a conciliant conclusion.","[Edvardsson, Johannes; Linderson, Hans] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Lab Wood Anat & Dendrochronol, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Almevik, Gunnar; Lindblad, Linda; Melin, Karl-Magnus] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Conservat, Guldhedsgatan 5c, S-41320 Gothenburg, Sweden",Lund University; University of Gothenburg,"Edvardsson, J (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Lab Wood Anat & Dendrochronol, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",johannes.edvardsson@geol.lu.se; gunnar.almevik@conservation.gu.se; linda.lindblad@conservation.gu.se; hans.linderson@geol.lu.se; kalle@timmermanskonst.se,,,"project Old Wood in a New Light [IN20-0026]; project Historic Carpentry art in the Diocese of Lund, Diocese of Lund, Church of Sweden; Church of Sweden","project Old Wood in a New Light; project Historic Carpentry art in the Diocese of Lund, Diocese of Lund, Church of Sweden; Church of Sweden","The compilation of reports and metadata for the study has been part of a pilot study ahead of the project Old Wood in a New Light (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, grant no: IN20-0026), which started in January 2021.

Leveraging C-O-H chemistry and operating near 600 degrees C allows the cells to be exothermic in both modes, improving efficiency and operability. This study characterizes ReSOC balance-of-plant hardware off-design performance to investigate component mode compatibility, the effect of tank dynamics, and part-load performance for a 100 kW/800 kWh plant. We also introduce a variable volume floating piston tank concept to improve energy storage density and evaluate operability advantages. Results show that with proper system design, balance-of-plant components are compatible, and tank dynamics have minimal impact when tanks are uninsulated and designed for storage near ambient temperature. System AC roundtrip efficiency is between 53% and 54%, depending on the tank technology selected and the compressor operating approach. Energy density is 84.4 kWh/m(3) for rigid tanks, and 146.1 kWh/m(3) for the variable volume tank concept at 100 bar storage pressure. This study also shows that ReSOC systems can maintain high efficiency at part-loads as low as 15% of rated capacity, Economic analysis of the system estimates an installed capital cost of $422-452/kWh, and a levelized cost of storage of 18.8-19.6 (sic)/kWh, values competitive with state-of-the-art battery technology.","[Reznicek, Evan; Braun, Robert J.] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Mech Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Colorado School of Mines,"Braun, RJ (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Mech Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",rbraun@mines.edu,,,Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project [51922],Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project,This research was supported by the Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project through award #51922.,,87,21,21,1,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

The research proposes a simplified model for the assessment of coastal risk on built environment expressed in terms of potential, direct and tangible, economic damages. The CoastRiskBySea (COASTal zones RISK assessment for Built environment bY extreme SEA level) is developed in GIS and the risk is evaluated based on the IPCC AR5 and AR6 frameworks through an equation that combines exposure, vulnerability and hazard. The first step is the creation of the land use grid derived from the Copernicus Coastal Zones database, after which then damage scenarios are calculated using depth-damage functions that enable to translate climate impacts into economic damages (exposure). Vulnerability is then assessed in relation to coastal elevation through the DTM and, finally, climate projections of Extreme Sea Level (ESL) are introduced (hazard). To test and verify the approach, the model is applied to the metropolitan city of Naples, Italy, the results show multiple areas at medium and high risk for ESL events with significant economic impacts. From the output maps it is possible to identify the higher risk areas and to understand how, with significant mitigation actions, the risks could be significantly reduced. In conclusion, the Coast-RiskBySea, as it has been developed with input data characterised by a homogeneous spatial coverage, it can be replicable in all EU coastal zones that dispose of a DTM with adequate vertical accuracy.","[Clemente, Maria Fabrizia; D'Ambrosio, Valeria] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Architecture, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Focareta, Mariano] Mapsat Srl, I-82100 Contrada Santa Cumana, Benevento, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Clemente, MF (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Architecture, I-80134 Naples, Italy.",mariafabrizia.clemente@unina.it; valeria.dambrosio@unina.it; m.focareta@mapsat.it,,"Focareta, Mariano/0000-0003-1408-3460",,,,,64,1,1,2,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Here, we compared the residues after acid hydrolysis (6 N HCl) with those obtained after NaOCl treatment (6 wt%) of the silt + clay fractions from 48 soil samples. The samples were taken at sites differing in climate and land use across Switzerland. To determine the influence of the two treatments on soil organic matter and mineral structures, we examined infrared spectra and isotopic signatures of carbon (C-14 and delta C-13) of the residues. Treatment with NaOCl removed more (63 to 91%) organic carbon (OC than did treatment with HCl (35 to 66%), and it had no effect on mineral structures, whereas treatment with HCl converted crystalline minerals to more amorphous ones. Increases in specific soil surface area (SSA) did not correlate with the amount of OC removed. The amount of OC removed by each treatment was not (NaOCl) or only weakly (HCl) related to the initial OC content of the silt + clay fraction, suggesting the presence of a relatively constant fraction of chemically resistant OC. C-14 activities of NaOCl-resistant residues were lower than those of HCl residues, indicating that soil organic matter residues isolated by NaOCl treatment were older than the residues obtained by acid hydrolysis. It is concluded that oxidation with NaOCl is the better way than hydrolysis with HCl to obtain an operationally-defined stable organic matter fraction from soils. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

New tools such as the Process Wheels, the Learning Adventure Card user interface/database, and the Discover Living Lab Web App, which are based on the conceptual Urban Living Lab Learning Frameworks (UL3), are introduced as examples of customizable, shared resources that cultivate leadership, team building, and creative problem-solving skills.

The general approaches lack the ability to simulate the farmlands' production potential under different scenarios. This paper proposes a modified farmland protection zoning framework to demarcate farmland protection by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model with a state-of-the-art farmland protection zoning framework. The modified zoning framework was applied to China, a typical fast developing country. The results indicated that the average potential production of the entire country would increase by 2.96 % in the coming decade if the irrigation efficiency criteria of 55 % established by the National Program for Agricultural Water Conservation (2012-2020) can be fulfilled. Furthermore, the farmland protection area could also be reduced by 2.91 % (2.96 million ha) while the total production potential of the protected areas would remain unchanged. This study contributes two main aspects: (1) The AEZ model was used as a replacement for the general land-use suitability analysis (LUSA) or multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based farmland assessment models in a farmland zoning framework, which can accurately assess the production potential of the farmland protection demarcation. (2) This farmland protection zoning approach can analyze and simulate a wide range of scenarios on the effect of environmental factors (climate, soil, terrain, etc.) and human production factors (irrigation condition, cropping system, etc.).","[Liu, Yilun; Liu, Luo; Hu, Yueming] South China Agr Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Land Use & Consolidat, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yilun; Zhu, A-Xing] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lao, Chunhua] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Hu, Guohua] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Inst Belt & Rd & Global Dev, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yueming] Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, Xining 810016, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Guangdong University of Technology; East China Normal University; Qinghai University,"Liu, L; Hu, YM (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",liuluo@scau.edu.cn; yueminghugis@163.com,"Liu, Luo/GWC-4660-2022; Hu, Guohua/H-4269-2016","Hu, Guohua/0000-0001-8033-9378","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601404, 41601082]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province [2017B090907030]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0800307]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou [201807010048]; China Scholarship Council [201708440442]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 41601404 and 41601082), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (Grants No. 2017B090907030), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grants No. 2016YFD0800307), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou (Grants No. 201807010048), and China Scholarship Council (Grants No. 201708440442).",,64,7,8,18,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,JUN,2020,,,,,,,104581,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104581,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU5VQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000537823200033,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the RECONCILE (Reconciliation of essential process parameters for an enhanced predictability of Arctic stratospheric ozone loss and its climate interactions) campaign, apparently very large NAT (nitric acid trihydrate) particles were observed by the airborne in situ probe FSSP-100 (Molleker et al., 2014). Our analysis shows that the FSSP-100 observations associated with the flight on 25 January 2010 cannot easily be explained assuming compact spherical NAT particles due to much too short growing time at temperatures below the existence temperature of NAT (T-NAT). State-of-the-art simulations using CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere; Grooss et al., 2014) suggest considerably smaller particles. We consider the hypothesis that the simulation reproduces the NAT particle masses in a realistic way, but that real NAT particles may have larger apparent sizes compared to compact spherical particles, e. g. due to non-compact morphology or aspheric shape. Our study focuses on the consequence that such particles would have reduced settling velocities compared to compact spheres, altering the vertical redistribution of HNO3. Utilising CLaMS simulations, we investigate the impact of reduced settling velocities of NAT particles on vertical HNO3 redistribution and compare the results with observations of gas-phase HNO3 by the airborne Fourier transform spectrometer MIPAS-STR associated with two RECONCILE flights. The MIPAS-STR observations confirm conditions consistent with denitrification by NAT particles for the flight on 25 January 2010 and show good agreement with the simulations within the limitations of the comparison. Best agreement is found if settling velocities between 100 and 50% relative to compact spherical particles are considered (slight preference for the 70% scenario). In contrast, relative settling velocities of 30% result in too weak vertical HNO3 redistribution. Sensitivity simulations considering temperature biases of +/- 1K and multiplying the simulated nucleation rates by factors of 0.5 and 2.0 affect the comparisons to a similar extent, but result in no effective improvement compared to the reference scenario. Our results show that an accurate knowledge of the settling velocities of NAT particles is important for quantitative simulations of vertical HNO3 redistribution.","[Woiwode, W.; Oelhaf, H.; Gulde, T.; Maucher, G.; Piesch, C.; Orphal, J.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Grooss, J. -U.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Stratosphere IEK 7, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Molleker, S.; Borrmann, S.; Frey, W.] Max Planck Inst Chem MPI, Particle Chem Dept, Mainz, Germany; [Borrmann, S.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, IPA, D-55122 Mainz, Germany; [Ebersoldt, A.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Data Proc & Elect, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Khaykin, S.] Cent Aerol Observ, Dolgoprudnyi, Moscow Region, Russia",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Max Planck Society; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Woiwode, W (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",wolfgang.woiwode@kit.edu,"Grooß, Jens-Uwe/N-3305-2019; Borrmann, Stephan/E-3868-2010; Grooß, Jens-Uwe/A-7315-2013; Orphal, Johannes/A-8667-2012; Frey, Wiebke/G-2058-2014","Grooß, Jens-Uwe/0000-0002-9485-866X; Borrmann, Stephan/0000-0002-4774-9380; Grooß, Jens-Uwe/0000-0002-9485-866X; Orphal, Johannes/0000-0002-1943-4496; Frey, Wiebke/0000-0003-4282-1264",European Commission [RECONCILE-226365-FP7-ENV-2008-1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Open Access Publishing Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; VSR project [ID JICG11],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; VSR project,"RECONCILE was funded by the European Commission under the grant number RECONCILE-226365-FP7-ENV-2008-1.

Changes in moisture availability-whether from changes in climate from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or those induced by land cover change (LCC)-can have profound impacts on food production. In this study, we examined the patterns of evaporative sources that contribute to moisture availability over five major global food producing regions (breadbaskets), and the potential for land cover change to influence these moisture sources by altering surface evapotranspiration. For a range of LCC scenarios we estimated the impact of altered surface fluxes on crop moisture availability and potential yield using a simplified linear hydrologic model and a state-of-the-art ecosystem and crop model. All the breadbasket regions were found to be susceptible to reductions in moisture owing to perturbations in evaporative source (ES) from LCC, with reductions in moisture availability ranging from 7 to 17% leading to potential crop yield reductions of 1-17%, which are magnitudes comparable to the changes anticipated with greenhouse warming. The sensitivity of these reductions in potential crop yield to varying magnitudes of LCC was not consistent among regions. Two variables explained most of these differences: the first was the magnitude of the potential moisture availability change, with regions exhibiting greater reductions in moisture availability also tending to exhibit greater changes in potential yield; the second was the soil moisture within crop root zones. Regions with mean growing season soil moisture fractions of saturation >0.5 typically had reduced impacts on potential crop yield. Our results indicate the existence of LCC thresholds that have the capability to create moisture shortages adversely affecting crop yields in major food producing regions, which could lead to future food supply disruptions in the absence of increased irrigation or other forms of water management.","[Bagley, Justin E.; Desai, Ankur R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Dirmeyer, Paul A.] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies COLA, Calverton, MD USA; [Foley, Jonathan A.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm IonE, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Bagley, Justin E.; Desai, Ankur R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm SAGE, Madison, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bagley, JE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, IGB, Urbana, IL USA.",jbagley@illinois.edu; desai@aos.wisc.edu; dirmeyer@cola.iges.org; jfoley@umn.edu,"Dirmeyer, Paul/B-6553-2016; Desai, Ankur/L-2495-2019; Foley, Jonathan A/GRS-5522-2022; Desai, Ankur R/A-5899-2008; Bagley, Justin/I-8019-2016; Dirmeyer, Paul/P-3275-2019","Dirmeyer, Paul/0000-0003-3158-1752; Desai, Ankur/0000-0002-5226-6041; Desai, Ankur R/0000-0002-5226-6041; Bagley, Justin/0000-0003-4534-431X; Dirmeyer, Paul/0000-0003-3158-1752",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We would like to thank P West for his helpful comments on early drafts of this letter.

Quantifying the CO2 flux across the air-sea interface requires time-dependent maps of surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), which can be estimated using global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) and observational-based data products. GOBMs are internally consistent, mechanistic representations of the ocean circulation and carbon cycle, and have long been the standard for making spatio-temporally resolved estimates of air-sea CO2 fluxes. However, there are concerns about the fidelity of GOBM flux estimates. Observation-based products have the strength of being data-based, but the underlying data are sparse and require significant extrapolation to create global full-coverage flux estimates. The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory-Hybrid Physics Data (LDEO-HPD) pCO(2) product is a new approach to estimating the temporal evolution of surface ocean pCO(2) and air-sea CO2 exchange. LDEO-HPD uses machine learning to merge high-quality observations with state-of-the-art GOBMs. We train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm to learn a non-linear relationship between model-data mismatch and observed predictors. GOBM fields are then corrected with the predicted model-data misfit to estimate real-world pCO(2) for 1982-2018. The resulting reconstruction by LDEO-HPD is in better agreement with independent pCO(2) observations than other currently available observation-based products. Within uncertainties, LDEO-HPD global ocean uptake of CO2 agrees with other products and the Global Carbon Budget 2020.","[Gloege, L.; McKinley, G.

This study used four different genotypes of P. infestans to evaluate the influence of freezing temperatures on survival of mycelium in vitro. Sporangium-free mycelium of P. infestans US1, US8, US11, and US14 growing on rye agar plates was exposed to temperatures ranging from -20 and 0degreesC (experiment A) for different periods up to 24 h and from -5 and 0degreesC (experiment B) for periods up to 5 days. Cultures were incubated at 12degreesC after exposure, and survival of the cultures was estimated after 28 days by a digital image analysis technique that measured the average reflectance intensity (ART) of images of the mycelium of temperature-treated cultures. The ART values of treated cultures were compared with the growth of mycelium in negative controls (mycelium not present) and positive controls (mycelmin exposed to 12degreesC for an equivalent period), and determination of recovery was based on statistical differences from the controls. There were significant differences in ART values among genotypes, temperature treatment, and exposure periods in all experiments. An index of recovery was calculated for each genotype at all treatment temperatures and exposure periods for both experiments. In experiment A, exposure of mycelium of P. infestans (all genotypes) to -20 and -10degreesC proved lethal for exposure periods of more than I It. All genotypes showed some degree of recovery up to 24-h exposure at -5 and -3degreesC. In both experiments, exposure of mycelium of P. infestans to 0degreesC was not lethal to any genotype tested for any exposure period. In experiment 13, all of the genotypes survived exposure up to 3 days at -3degreesC to some degree, but at -5degreesC, exposure of I day was lethal to all genotypes. Tolerance of freezing temperatures by mycelium of P infestans may be an ecologically important survival mechanism and the increased tolerance of US8 and US14 may explain their predominance in cooler climates such as north-central United States.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Kirk, WW (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kirkw@msu.edu,,,,,,,33,12,14,0,0,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA",0031-949X,1943-7684,,PHYTOPATHOLOGY,Phytopathology,NOV,2003,11,,,,1400,1406,,10.1094/PHYTO.2003.93.11.1400,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2003.93.11.1400,,,7,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,736NN,18944068,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000186177000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We focus specifically on the use of dolutegravir (DTG) because of a recently identified potential safety issue related to neural tube defects in the fetuses of women who used DTG at the time of conception. Nurses and advanced practice registered nurses should engage in shared decision-making processes for reproductive life planning with women of childbearing age who are living with or are at risk for HIV. During these processes, exploration of the full range of ART regimens is essential.

While some fish populations may be able to escape global warming via range shifts, they cannot escape ocean acidification (OA), an inevitable consequence of the dissolution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in marine waters. How ocean acidification affects population dynamics of commercially important fish species is critical for adapting management practices of exploited fish populations. Ocean acidification has been shown to impair fish larvae's sensory abilities, affect the morphology of otoliths, cause tissue damage and cause behavioural changes. Here, we obtain first experimental mortality estimates for Atlantic cod larvae under OA and incorporate these effects into recruitment models. End-of-century levels of ocean acidification (similar to 1100 mu atm according to the IPCC RCP 8.5) resulted in a doubling of daily mortality rates compared to present-day CO2 concentrations during the first 25 days post hatching (dph), a critical phase for population recruitment. These results were consistent under different feeding regimes, stocking densities and in two cod populations (Western Baltic and Barents Sea stock). When mortality data were included into Ricker-type stock-recruitment models, recruitment was reduced to an average of 8 and 24% of current recruitment for the two populations, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of including vulnerable early life stages when addressing effects of climate change on fish stocks.","[Stiasny, Martina H.; Mittermayer, Felix H.; Reusch, Thorsten B.

Such conditions usually result in relatively more positive (enriched) oxygen isotope ratios in tree leaf sugars and ultimately in the tree-ring cellulose formed in that year, the converse being true in cooler, wet summers dominated by westerly air flow and cyclonic conditions. There should therefore be a strong link between tree-ring delta O-18 and the amount of summer precipitation. Stable oxygen isotope ratios from the latewood cellulose of 40 oak trees sampled at eight locations across Great Britain produce a mean delta O-18 chronology that correlates strongly and significantly with summer indices of total shear vorticity, surface air pressure, and the amount of summer precipitation across the England and Wales region of the United Kingdom. The isotope-based rainfall signal is stronger and much more stable over time than reconstructions based upon oak ring widths. Using recently developed methods that are precise, efficient and highly cost-effective it is possible to measure both carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope ratios simultaneously from the same tree-ring cellulose. In our study region, these two measurements from multiple trees can be used to reconstruct summer temperature (delta C-13) and summer precipitation (delta O-18) with sufficient independence to allow the evolution of these climate parameters to be reconstructed with high levels of confidence. The existence of long, well-replicated oak tree-ring chronologies across the British Isles mean that it should now be possible to reconstruct both summer temperature and precipitation over many centuries and potentially millennia.","[Young, Giles H.

This consumption is primarily dedicated to heating and cooling. Thermal insulation in construction plays an important role in the minimization of operational energy consumption. Currently, insulation is performed via mineral and fossil-derived materials, which require high manufacturing energy. For this reason, attention has been paid to finding clean and energy-efficient alternatives. Subsequently, biomass-based insulation materials have been identified as low-embodied energy materials that reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. These green and sustainable insulation materials fall in line with the transition in France towards low-carbon and positive-energy buildings. In this respect, research works have mostly focused on renewable biomass resources and wastes, the design and production of insulation materials, the testing of their properties and their installation in buildings; however, few articles have reviewed their durability and end-of-life management. To fit more in the circular bioeconomy concept, light has been shed in this review on the end-of-life of these biomaterials to avoid their landfilling. Therefore, this review provides a state-of-the-art of the different biobased building products commercialized in France, with a forecast of their volumes and waste deposits by 2050. Furthermore, this study explores waste management strategies, focusing on waste-to-energy routes, which are revealed to be the most promising. The energy recovery from bio-based insulation wastes expected in 2050 saves 4.1 million m(3) of land, 75,000 tons of fossil fuels and 89 million euros while avoiding the rejection of 312,771 t(CO2eq).","[Rabbat, Christelle; Awad, Sary; Villot, Audrey; Andres, Yves] IMT Atlantique, CNRS, GEPEA, UMR 6144, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler, F-44000 Nantes, France; [Rollet, Delphine] Inddigo, 367 Ave Grand Arietaz,CS 52401, F-73024 Chambery, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Ecole Nationale Veterinaire, Agroalimentaire et de l'Alimentation Nantes-Atlantique; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique","Awad, S (corresponding author), IMT Atlantique, CNRS, GEPEA, UMR 6144, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler, F-44000 Nantes, France.",sary.awad@gmail.com,,"Rabbat, Christelle/0000-0001-9776-7539",French Ecologic Transition Agency (ADEME),French Ecologic Transition Agency (ADEME),"The present work was supported by the French Ecologic Transition Agency (ADEME) in the framework of the Valo-Mat-Bio project coordinated by the consulting and engineering firm Inddigo.

This study proposed a clothing model (IC-RM model) to predict indoor clothing insulation based on people's thermal history. In the IC-RM model, the running mean (RM) outdoor temperature (exponentially weighted running mean of the past outdoor temperatures) was used as the outdoor climate index to reflect the thermal history. Different from the existing models, the IC-RM model adopted a four parameters logistic function to fit the relation between indoor clothing insulation and the RM outdoor temperature. A longitudinal thermal comfort survey (13 months) was conducted in two different types of naturally ventilated building in Changsha China. The decreased freedom of clothing adjustment at high/low outdoor temperatures and notable effects of the past outdoor temperatures on the indoor clothing insulation were observed. The IC-RM model was implemented using 1427 useful clothing records collected during the survey. The high R-2 value (> 0.9) for the IC-RM model indicated that the proposed model provides an effective method to quantify the change of indoor clothing insulation based on the effect of thermal history.

The idea is to replace expensive numerical integration of complex coupled partial differential equations at fine time scales performed on supercomputers, with machine-learned surrogates that efficiently and accurately forecast future system states using data sampled from the underlying system. One particularly popular technique being explored within the weather and climate modelling community is the echo state network (ESN), an attractive alternative to other well-known deep learning architectures. Using the classical Lorenz 63 system, and the three tier multi-scale Lorenz 96 system (Thomes T, Duben P, Palmer T. 2017 Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 143, 897-908. (doi:10.1002/qj.2974)) as benchmarks, we realize that previously studied state-of-the-art ESNs operate in two distinct regimes, corresponding to low and high spectral radius (LSR/HSR) for the sparse, randomly generated, reservoir recurrence matrix. Using knowledge of the mathematical structure of the Lorenz systems along with systematic ablation and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, we show that state-of-the-art LSR-ESNs reduce to a polynomial regression model which we call Domain-Driven Regularized Regression (D2R2). Interestingly, D2R2 is a generalization of the well-known SINDy algorithm (Brunton SL, Proctor JL, Kutz JN. 2016 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 113, 39323937. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1517384113)). We also show experimentally that LSR-ESNs (Chattopadhyay A, Hassanzadeh P, Subramanian D. 2019 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08829)) outperform HSR ESNs (Pathak J, Hunt B, Girvan M, Lu Z, Ott E. 2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 024102. (doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.024102)) while D2R2 dominates both approaches. A significant goal in constructing surrogates is to cope with barriers to scaling in weather prediction and simulation of dynamical systems that are imposed by time and energy consumption in supercomputers. Inexact computing has emerged as a novel approach to helping with scaling. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three models (LSR-ESN, HSR-ESN and D2R2) by varying the precision or word size of the computation as our inexactness-controlling parameter. For precisions of 64, 32 and 16 bits, we show that, surprisingly, the least expensive D2R2 method yields the most robust results and the greatest savings compared to ESNs. Specifically, D2R2 achieves 68x in computational savings, with an additional 2x if precision reductions are also employed, outperforming ESN variants by a large margin.

During dry periods, soil-water deficit can limit evapotranspiration, leading to warmer and drier conditions in the lower atmosphere(1,2). Soil moisture can influence the development of convective storms through such modifications of low-level atmospheric temperature and humidity(1,3), which in turn feeds back on soil moisture. Yet there is considerable uncertainty in how soil moisture affects convective storms across the world, owing to a lack of observational evidence and uncertainty in large-scale models(4). Here we present a global-scale observational analysis of the coupling between soil moisture and precipitation. We show that across all six continents studied, afternoon rain falls preferentially over soils that are relatively dry compared to the surrounding area. The signal emerges most clearly in the observations over semi-arid regions, where surface fluxes are sensitive to soil moisture, and convective events are frequent. Mechanistically, our results are consistent with enhanced afternoon moist convection driven by increased sensible heat flux over drier soils, and/or mesoscale variability in soil moisture. We find no evidence in our analysis of a positive feedback-that is, a preference for rain over wetter soils-at the spatial scale (50-100 kilometres) studied. In contrast, we find that a positive feedback of soil moisture on simulated precipitation does dominate in six state-of-the-art global weather and climate models-a difference that may contribute to excessive simulated droughts in large-scale models.","[Taylor, Christopher M.; Harris, Phil P.] NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [de Jeu, Richard A.

In-depth comparisons between modeled and observed regional-average precipitation, 2 m temperature, and snowpack are performed. The regional model reproduces the spatial distribution of precipitation quite well, but substantially overestimates rainfall along windward slopes. This is due to strong overprediction of precipitation intensity; precipitation frequency is actually underpredicted by the model. Moisture fluxes impinging on the coast seem to be well-represented over California, implying that precipitation bias is caused by processes internal to WRF. Positive-definite moisture advection and use of the Grell cumulus parameterization result in some decrease in precipitation bias, but other sources are needed to explain the full bias magnitude. Surface temperature is well simulated in all seasons except summer, when overly-dry soil moisture results in a several degree warm bias in both CCSM3 and WRF. Additionally, coastal temperatures appear to be too warm due to a coastal sea surface temperature bias inherited from CCSM3. Modeled snowfall/snowmelt agrees quite well with observations, but snow water equivalent is found to be much too low due to monthly reinitialization of all regional model fields from CCSM3 values.","[Caldwell, Peter; Chin, Hung-Neng S.; Bader, David C.; Bala, Govindasamy] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94566 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Caldwell, P (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, L-103,POB 808, Livermore, CA 94566 USA.",caldwell19@llnl.gov,"Caldwell, Peter M/K-1899-2014; Bala, Govindasamy/ABF-3255-2020; Bader, David/H-6189-2011","Bala, Govindasamy/0000-0002-3079-0600; Bader, David/0000-0003-3210-339X; Caldwell, Peter/0000-0001-8604-0844",U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344],U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank NOAA's Earth Science Research Lab/Physical Sciences Division, D.

However, despite arguably some of the most encouraging policy in the world, teachers in Scotland often remain thwarted by the pragmatics of schooling and furthermore they may lack personal or professional conviction to take learning outside. In their defence, teachers in Scotland are working with a school population and ways of learning increasingly removed from nature and the specificity of place. This chapter describes the author's attitude to teaching and learning, which has always been to get stuck in and face issues head on. Therefore, creating an opportunity from this pedagogical challenge was an obvious response. Donna Haraway's curiosity is likewise piqued by the entanglements between beings and becoming, implicating such response-ability. Her passionate use of art and story describes the delicate, yet tenacious, webs of implicit relationality humans find themselves within. Haraway's theorising of the worlding game on Earth, a game the children and the author played out each week at the beach, develops understandings of the value of alternative ways of learning which can occur when citizen scientist meets artist in a littoral contact zone. This chapter explores Haraway's writing, in parallel with a description of a lived inquiry, to extend and deepen understanding of how sensorial encounter can complement rather than counter or polarise experiences of the other and of other learning.","[Francis, Catherine] Univ Aberdeens, Sch Educ, Aberdeen, Scotland",,"Francis, C (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeens, Sch Educ, Aberdeen, Scotland.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,2,BRILL SENSE,LEIDEN,"P O BOX 9000, LEIDEN, 2300 PA, NETHERLANDS",2542-8721,2542-873X,978-90-04-42163-9; 978-90-04-42158-5; 978-90-04-39611-1,CRIT ISSU FUT LEA T,,,2020,,,,,381,401,,10.1163/9789004421585_021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004421585_021,,,21,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Education & Educational Research,BR6WT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000664379200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amount of GHGs in the atmosphere has escalated immensely, with a substantial growth of 5.8% in 2010; a similar increase was observed in Pakistan as well. In Pakistan, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stand at 54% of total GHG emissions whereas methane, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic carbon contribute to emissions at 36%, 9%, 0.75% and 0.3%, respectively. One of the key reasons for climatic changes is GHG emission generation from human interventions and activities related to transportation, urban development, industrialization, energy sources, farming and agriculture, waste's improper management, land use and forestry. In 2011, Pakistan's entire GHG emissions were a whopping 347 Mt of CO2-eq, and by 2050, they are estimated to reach 4621 Mt CO2-eq. This review evaluates and assesses GHG emissions generating from various sectors in Pakistan, in a socio-scientific prospect that is caused by human activities and interventions in different economic sectors in Pakistan, endangering the environment across the country. Additionally, the review examines the current level of GHG emissions while accounting for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor-based emissions, abatement strategies including development of a state-of-the-art technique for carbon capture and storage/utilization technologies in Pakistan.

In this study, a field survey on thermal sensation of players in a basketball game was carried out in a naturally ventilated gymnasium in Guangzhou, China. The results showed that the human physiology and thermal sensation of subjects were highly different during active sport state. Moreover, the thermal sensation vote was increased with a rise in the air temperature, the mean radiant temperature and humidity ratio, while thermal sensation vote was reduced with an increase in the air velocity. The metabolic rate, systolic blood pressure and skin temperature were shown to have a positive correlation with the thermal sensation vote.

OLAM is a new, state-of-the-art earth system model, capable of user-specified grid resolution and local mesh refinement. An objective optimization of the microphysics parameterization is carried out. Data products from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) are used to construct a maximum likelihood function, and thousands of simulations using different values for key parameters are carried out. Shortwave fluxes are found to be highly sensitive to both the density of cloud droplets and the assumed shape of the cloud droplet diameter distribution function. Because there is considerable uncertainty in which values for these parameters to use in climate models, they are targeted as the tunable parameters of the objective optimization procedure, which identified high-likelihood volumes of parameter space as well as parameter uncertainties and covariances. Once optimized, the model closely matches observed large-scale radiative fluxes and precipitation. The impact of model resolution is also tested. At finer characteristic length scales (CLS), smaller-scale features such as the ITCZ are better resolved. It is also found that the Amazon was much better simulated at 100- than 200-km CLS. Furthermore, a simulation using OLAM's variable resolution functionality to cover South America with 100-km CLS and the rest of the world with 200-km CLS generates a precipitation pattern in the Amazon similar to the global 100-km CLS run.","[Medvigy, David; Walko, Robert L.; Otte, Martin J.; Avissar, Roni] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Avissar, R (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",ravissar@rsmas.miami.edu,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Otte, Martin/0000-0002-4205-6462","National Science Foundation [NSF ID 0634745, ATM 0902197]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the National Science Foundation Grants NSF ID 0634745 and ATM 0902197.

Recent advancements in new polymeric materials development and nanomaterial synthesis have led to opportunities for new generation substrate development. Considering the importance of TFC membranes for industrial separation process, this review will give a state-of-the-art account of the subject matter by emphasizing substrates made by different techniques and various materials. More specifically, the article will review the roles of the developed substrates on the physiochemical properties of polyamide selective layer and further their influences on TFC membrane performance for both pressure-driven (nanofiltration/reverse osmosis) and osmotically-driven (forward osmosis/pressure retarded osmosis) processes, aiming to stimulate progress in the field. A framework for better understanding the substrate development to fulfill the industrial requirements of TFC membrane application will also be presented in this review before ending with future perspectives.

The purpose of this paper is to contextualise disasters involving slow-onset hazards within the broader literature on disasters, assess the current state of knowledge and identify themes in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - This paper employs a semi-structured review design with the purpose of identifying both scholarship engaging directly with the term and less obvious but related literatures. Findings - The majority of publications that mention slow-onset hazards and their adverse impacts do so only by means of delimitation. The paper finds that there is a great need for empirical and theoretical work on onset and manifestation speed and to test the degree to which existing theories and frameworks of disaster management are also relevant for the study of slow-onset hazard impacts. Research limitations/implications - The review identifies several gaps in existing research disasters involving slow-onset hazards and proposes research on community, political, policy and practical challenges, including answering the question of how to secure proactive response to emerging slow-onset hazard impacts. Practical implications - In theory, hazards with a gradual and creeping onset are easier to manage and proactively respond to than that of sudden and unexpected ones. Not only do slow-onset hazards provide more lead time, but also a larger potential for proactive response, which in turn provides ample time to take early action to cushion their impacts. Yet, warnings often go unheard and response is put on hold until impacts become unnecessarily costly to reverse. More research on onset speed and gradual manifestation patterns should therefore be carried out. Originality/value - Gradually occurring hazards have remained largely absent from the core literature on disasters, including most definitions of the term. This paper represents an initial effort to assess the state-of-the-art on the concept and the phenomenon of disasters involving slow-onset hazards.","[Staupe-Delgado, Reidar] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, ITS, Tromso, Norway; [Staupe-Delgado, Reidar] UiS Univ Stavanger, ISOP, Stavanger, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Staupe-Delgado, R (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, ITS, Tromso, Norway.;Staupe-Delgado, R (corresponding author), UiS Univ Stavanger, ISOP, Stavanger, Norway.",staupedelgado@gmail.com,,"Staupe-Delgado, Reidar/0000-0002-4244-9725",,,,,70,21,21,4,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

It is essential for understanding the role of oceanographic processes on marine food webs and producing climate change projections of variables affecting key ecosystem functions. In this work, we evaluate the horizontal and vertical patterns of four state-of-the-art coupled physical-biogeochemical models, three of them already published. Two of the models include data assimilation, physical and/or biological, and two do not. Simulations are compared to the most exhaustive dataset ofin situobservations in the North Western Mediterranean, builtad hocfor this work, comprising gliders and conventional CTD surveys and complemented with satellite observations. The analyses are performed both in the whole domain and in four subregions (Catalan Shelf, Ebro Delta, Mallorca Channel, and Ibiza Channel), characterized bya prioridivergent primary production dynamics and driving mechanisms. Overall, existing models offer a reasonable representation of physical processes including stratification, surface temperature, and surface currents, but it is shown that relatively small differences among them can lead to large differences in the response of biogeochemical variables. Our results show that all models are able to reproduce the main seasonal patterns of primary production both at the upper layer and at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), as well as the differential behavior of the four subregions. However, there are significant discrepancies in the local variability of the intensity of the winter mixing, phytoplankton blooms, or the intensity and depth of the DCM. All model runs show markedly contrasting patterns of interannual phytoplankton biomass in all four subregions. This lack of robustness should dissuade end users from using them to fill gaps in time series observations without assessing their appropriateness. Finally, we discuss the usability of these models for different applications in marine ecology, including fishery oceanography.","[Ramirez-Romero, Eduardo; Amores, Angel; Catalan, Ignacio A.] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Esporles, Spain; [Jorda, Gabriel] Inst Espanol Oceanog IEO, Ctr Oceanog Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Kay, Susan] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Segura-Noguera, Mariona] Univ Lincoln, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lincoln, England; [Macias, Diego M.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Maynou, Francesc; Sabates, Ana] Inst Cencies Mar CSIC, Barcelona, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Mediterraneo de Estudios Avanzados (IMEDEA); Universitat de les Illes Balears; Spanish Institute of Oceanography; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; University of Lincoln; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ramirez-Romero, E (corresponding author), IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Esporles, Spain.",eramirez@imedea.uib-csic.es,"Catalan, Ignacio/C-5382-2011; Kay, Susan/C-5659-2008; Ramirez-Romero, Eduardo/I-2563-2019; Segura-Noguera, Mariona/C-4524-2012","Catalan, Ignacio/0000-0002-6496-9182; Kay, Susan/0000-0003-1510-8578; Ramirez-Romero, Eduardo/0000-0002-7228-6939; Segura-Noguera, Mariona/0000-0003-4832-7590","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [678193]; Govern de les Illes BalearsConselleria d'Innovacio, Recerca i Turisme, Programa Vicenc Mut.","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; Govern de les Illes BalearsConselleria d'Innovacio, Recerca i Turisme, Programa Vicenc Mut.","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under grant agreement no. 678193 (CERES, Climate Change and European Aquatic Resources).

The surface exchange flux is derived from a measured concentration difference and micrometeorological quantities (turbulent exchange coefficient). The significance of the measured concentration difference is crucial for the significant determination of surface exchange fluxes. Additionally, measurements of surface exchange fluxes of ammonia, nitric acid and ammonium nitrate are often strongly affected by phase changes between gaseous and particulate compounds of the triad, which make measurements of the four individual species (NH3, HNO3, NH4+, NO3-) necessary for a correct interpretation of the measured concentration differences. We present here a rigorous analysis of results obtained with a multi-component, wet-chemical instrument, able to simultaneously measure gradients of both gaseous and particulate trace substances. Basis for our analysis are two field experiments, conducted above contrasting ecosystems (grassland, forest). Precision requirements of the instrument as well as errors of concentration differences and micrometeorological exchange parameters have been estimated, which, in turn, allows the establishment of thorough error estimates of the derived fluxes of NH3, HNO3, NH4+, and NO3-. Derived median flux errors for the grassland and forest field experiments were: 39% and 50% (NH3), 31% and 38% (HNO3), 62% and 57% (NH4+), and 47% and 68% (NO3-), respectively. Additionally, we provide the basis for using field data to characterize the instrument performance, as well as subsequent quantification of surface exchange fluxes and underlying mechanistic processes under realistic ambient measurement conditions.","[Wolff, V.; Ammann, C.] Agroscope ART, Air Pollut & Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wolff, V.; Trebs, I.; Meixner, F.

A network of 31 meteorological stations in the Hellenic area and the Asia Minor coasts and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis datasets were used for this purpose. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis datasets were created by assimilating climate observations from different sources including ships, satellites, ground stations, radiosonde observations and radar. The general purpose of conducting the reanalyses was to produce multiyear global state-of-the-art gridded representations of atmospheric states, generated by a constant model and a constant data assimilation system. The findings of the analysis show that the mean annual surface air temperature in the wider region of Greece exhibits a pronounced cooling trend from the beginning of the 1950s up to the mid-1970s. It then remained at low levels until the beginning of the 1990s, and then increased up to 2000, when a turning-point is clear although the temperature remained at high levels. The well-known atmospheric circulation indices of the wider region of Europe, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), the Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI) and the North Sea Caspian Pattern Index (NCPI), were used to investigate the relationship between surface air temperature and atmospheric circulation in this region of the Eastern Mediterranean. The surface air temperature is not correlated to the NAOI, while it is statistically significantly (95% confidence level (CL)) correlated to the MOI, but only during wintertime. On the contrary, good correlations, which are statistically significant (95% CL), appear between the NCPI and the surface air temperature during all seasons, but particularly in winter.","[Nastos, P.

However, despite this broad consensus and its technical maturity, CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale commensurate with the ambitions articulated a decade ago. Thus, in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective, moving from the global to molecular scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2 degrees C, we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS, we reflect on recent experience from the UK's CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas, we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed in the coming decade.","[Bui, Mai; Mac Dowell, Niall] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 1NA, England; [Bui, Mai; Adjiman, Claire S.; Galindo, Amparo; Shah, Nilay; Mac Dowell, Niall] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Adjiman, Claire S.; Fennell, Paul S.; Galindo, Amparo; Hallett, Jason P.; Jackson, George; Maitland, Geoffrey C.; Petit, Camille; Shah, Nilay; Trusler, J.

In this respect, it is important to assess the environment of such open space along with the demographic factors of the visitors. This study used the soft-computing method of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to investigate the thermal comfort of visitors at a public square in Iran during hot and cold weather conditions. The ANFIS process for variable selection was implemented in order to detect the predominant variables affecting the individual's comfortable feeling. Model's training and testing data were collected through the field measurement and survey during hot and cold times of the year. We used 18 input parameters, representative of demographic and environmental factors, to compute visitor's thermal sensation, comfort feeling, and 4 common indices, namely the mean radiant temperature (T-mrt), mean physiological equivalent temperature (PET), standard effective temperature (SET) and predicted mean vote (PMV). The results indicated that among the examined factors, the air temperature (T-a) is the most influential parameter and best predictor of accuracy for the individual's comfort feeling at the studied urban square. The results show that T-a can best predict the common indices of outdoor comfort, namely the PMV, PET, SET, thermal sensation, T-mrt, and comfortable felling compared to other parameters with the least error of 1.94, 18.87, 13.67, 0.91, 7.80, and 0.34 %, respectively. Some of the main advantages of the ANFIS scheme are that it is adaptable to the optimization and adaptive methods, and is computationally efficient.","[Kariminia, Shahab] Islamic Azad Univ, Najafabad Branch, Fac Art Architecture & Urban Planning, Dept Architecture, Najafabad, Isfahan, Iran; [Motamedi, Shervin; Roy, Chandrabhushan; Hashim, Roslan] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Motamedi, Shervin; Hashim, Roslan] Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Petkovic, Dalibor] Univ Nis, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mechatron & Control, Aleksandra Medvedeva 14, Nish 18000, Serbia",Islamic Azad University; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; University of Nis,"Motamedi, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Motamedi, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",shervin.motamedi@gmail.com; shamshirband1396@gmail.com,"S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; S.Band, Shahab/AAD-3311-2021","S.Band, Shahab/0000-0002-8963-731X; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X",HIR-MOHE University of Malaya [UM.C/HIR/MOHE/ENG/34],HIR-MOHE University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),The authors express their sincere thanks to the funding support of the HIR-MOHE University of Malaya under Grant No. UM.C/HIR/MOHE/ENG/34.,,62,14,15,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

Moreover, dealing with the peak demand becomes difficult for these stochastic natured DERs. Solar Photovoltaics (PV), being prominent at the low voltage distribution network has the fluctuating output which, however, can be compensated by the energy storage (ES). This paper presents a week ahead PV power generation and demand side forecasting for a particular region in the United Kingdom (UK) through machine learning (ML) algorithms and optimize the future schedule of ES to manage the peak demand. A Bayesian hyperparameter tuning approach has been adopted here to develop the models for both PV generation and load demand forecasting. The results have been compared with the existing state of the art ML models based on root mean square error (RMSE) values and found that the proposed model has the least error among all. This model is further selected to optimize the ES schedule. The scheduled power mismatch has also been compared with the actual data, the data forecasted with a baseline ML model and the proposed model. ES scheduling with proposed model is 24% more accurate than the existing benchmark models.","[Trivedi, Rohit; Khadem, Shafi] Tyndall Natl Inst, Int Energy Res Ctr, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Trivedi, R (corresponding author), Tyndall Natl Inst, Int Energy Res Ctr, Cork, Ireland.",rohit.trivedi@ierc.ie; shafi.khadem@ierc.ie,,"Trivedi, Rohit/0000-0003-2874-3132","Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications","Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications","This work is a part of MiFIC project and the authors in IERC thankfully acknowledge the support from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.",,32,1,1,1,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-3299-3,,,,2021,,,,,157,163,,10.1109/EUROCON52738.2021.9535559,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EUROCON52738.2021.9535559,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BS5CI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000728121700029,View Full Record in Web of Science

As ECHAM6 has its uppermost layer centered at 0.01 hPa in the upper mesosphere, these simulations offer the opportunity to study the middle atmosphere climate change and its relation to the troposphere on the basis of a very comprehensive set of state-of-the-art model simulations. The goals of this paper are (a) to introduce those new features of ECHAM6 particularly relevant for the middle atmosphere, including external forcing data, and (b) to evaluate the simulated middle atmosphere and describe the simulated response to natural and anthropogenic forcings. New features in ECHAM6 with respect to ECHAM5 include a new short-wave radiation scheme, the option to vary spectral irradiance independent of total solar irradiance, and a latitude-dependent gravity-wave source strength. The description of external forcing data focuses on solar irradiance and ozone. Stratospheric temperature trends simulated with the MPI-ESM for the last decades of the 20th century agree well with observations. The future projections depend strongly on the scenario. Under the high emission scenario RCP8.5, simulated temperatures are locally lower by more than 20 K than preindustrial values. Many of the simulated patterns of the responses to natural forcings as provided by solar variability, volcanic aerosols, and El Nino-Southern Oscillation, largely agree with the observations.","[Schmidt, H.; Rast, S.; Bunzel, F.; Esch, M.; Giorgetta, M.; Kinne, S.; Krismer, T.; Timmreck, C.; Tomassini, L.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Stenchikov, G.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Phys Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Walz, M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany",Max Planck Society; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Free University of Berlin,"Schmidt, H (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",hauke.schmidt@zmaw.de,"Schmidt, Hauke/J-4469-2013; Georgiy, Stenchikov/J-8569-2013; Stenchikov, Georgiy/AAA-4371-2022","Schmidt, Hauke/0000-0001-8271-6456; Schmidt, Hauke/0000-0001-7977-5041; Timmreck, Claudia/0000-0001-5355-0426; Giorgetta, Marco/0000-0002-4278-1963; Bunzel, Felix/0000-0002-2401-6176; Stenchikov, Georgiy Lvovich/0000-0001-9033-4925","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [GI 541/3-1, SCHM 2158/2-2]; BMBF [FKZ:01LP1130A]",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We like to thank Elisa Manzini for many useful comments and her contributions to the development of different middle atmosphere versions of ECHAM, and Bjorn Stevens for a careful internal review.

The study was conducted by a combination of field measurements and simulations. Indoor climate, typical houses and structures as well as the current condition and need for renovation were determined by field measurements. Based on field measurements, indoor climate and energy simulation models were validated and used to calculate energy use for different renovation measures. Energy renovation packages were calculated for different scenarios (minimal influence on the appearance of the house, improvement of thermal comfort, improvement of building service systems) for different energy saving levels. The analysis showed that the improvement of building service systems and the energy source holds the largest energy saving potential. The building envelope of old rural houses needs improvement also due to high thermal transmittance and air leakage.

The results show how energy savings depend on energy saving targets, typology of the building, thermal transmittance of original structures, and building service systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have examined hydrological effects of changes in total vegetation coverage and density, whereas the impact of change in vegetation components (i.e., proportion of different vegetation types) is rarely considered and little known. Actually, even though the changes in total vegetation coverage and density are similar, the differences in vegetation components alteration among catchments can be pronounced, and thus result in distinct hydrological consequence. Here, using a state-of-the-art dataset of vegetation composition including tree canopy (TC) cover, short vegetation (SV) cover and bare ground (BG) cover, we quantitatively assess the hydrological consequences of vegetation components change in 76 large catchments globally under the water balance framework. We find SV is apparently the most sensitive vegetation component for runoff change, which is reinforced in regions with a drier climate. Attributing water yield change shows that runoff variations caused by TC change are usually offset by those caused by SV change. In typical afforested catchments across the world, the loss of SV can alleviate 39.3-108.7% runoff decrease due to the expansion of TC and the contraction of BG. Our results imply that hydrological sensitivity is much diverse among vegetation types, and trade-offs exist among the hydrological effects of different vegetation components. These previously unrevealed findings suggest that more vegetation properties (including vegetation composition) should be accounted when evaluating the impact of vegetation change on regional water resources.","[Chen, Zefeng; Wang, Weiguang] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zefeng; Wang, Weiguang] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Woods, Ross A.] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Shao, Quanxi] Australian Resources Res Ctr, CSIRO Data 61, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia",Hohai University; Hohai University; University of Bristol; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Wang, WG (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",wangweiguang006@126.com,"Shao, Quanxi/A-2028-2009; Woods, Ross/C-6696-2013","Shao, Quanxi/0000-0002-9768-137X; Woods, Ross/0000-0002-5732-5979","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51979071, 51779073]; Distinguished Young Fund Project of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180021]; National Ten Thousand Program Youth Talent; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Distinguished Young Fund Project of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; National Ten Thousand Program Youth Talent; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province,"This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51979071, 51779073), the Distinguished Young Fund Project of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20180021), the National Ten Thousand Program Youth Talent, and the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province.

In Anatolia, which has hosted many communities, it is possible to encounter intangible and tangible cultural heritage elements. Handicrafts, which are among the essential elements of our material culture, are defined as works of art with a use-value and aesthetic appearance. These artefacts, which come into existence due to making identifiable materials such as wood, metal, leather, reed, soil, animal, and vegetable fiber, which have no shape, with the help of various tools, supply the material-based needs of people. These productions, which require experience, talent, and manual dexterity, are produced by skilled masters who learn and teach art and constitute material cultural assets. The production methods taught by master to apprentice, by father to son, by grandparents to grandchildren became traditional over time and various handicraft branches such as carving, inlay making, cradle making, tanning, quilt making, carpet making, felt making, madder making, weaving, knife making, tile making, etc. have emerged. These material productions constitute the cultural heritage of the region in which they are produced. Sakarya is one of the centers where handicraft-based productions in Anatolia are carried out. It is known that the settlement of Sakarya, located northeast of Marmara and named after the river in the area, had started with Hittites before the Common Era and was dwelled in respectively by Phrygians, Lydians, and Bithynians. In the Common Era, Roman, Seljuk, Byzantion, and Ottoman domination is observed in the region. The region, known as a Turkmenian village named Ada (Island) in the Orhan Gazi period, was initially established as a marketplace and grown into an ever-developing central by its geographical location, climate, and fertile soil lands. By the end of the 1800s, with the immigration starting from Balkans and Caucasia, the region is dwelled in by members of different cultures, a cosmopolitan environment has occurred, and cultural diversity has consisted. In Sakarya, dwelled by various communities in different eras, the public has engaged in agriculture and stockbreeding and has continued their previous handicrafts in the region they migrated and ensured handicrafts such as pottery, quitting, comb making, coppersmithing. The aim of this study, evaluated within the scope of Sakarya's cultural heritage; is to introduce wood, vegetable and animal fibres, soil, metal handicrafts and artisans. In this context, making field researches in Sakarya and its surroundings, taking photographs of the identified handicrafts and recording them, interviewing the artisans and filling in the information slips constitute the method followed. It is understood that handicrafts, which are among the cultural heritage values of Sakarya, are under risk of extinction, as in many regions of Anatolia.","[Tas, Ela] Sakarya Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Sanat Tarihi Bolumu, Sakarya, Turkey",Sakarya University,"Tas, E (corresponding author), Sakarya Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Sanat Tarihi Bolumu, Sakarya, Turkey.",elatas@sakarya.edu.tr,,,,,,,55,0,0,2,4,EGE UNIV,IZMIR,"BORNOVA, IZMIR, 35100, TURKEY",1300-5707,2636-8064,,SANAT TARIHI DERG,Sanat Tarihi Derg.,OCT,2021,2,,,,1245,1279,,10.29135/std.948208,http://dx.doi.org/10.29135/std.948208,,,35,Art,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Art,XU7IZ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000734435000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In rice, a staple grain crop in the world, submergence creates a long-term and re-current problem for crops withstanding and their succeed-ing productivity. Therefore, to restore a satisfactory yield instead of a failure of crop in such submerged areas, the analysis of plants' responses is important. Such analy-sis will facilitate research about the entity components of plants responses to anoxia or submergence. For example, the development of cellular and molecular cascade in gene expression of ROS signaling and its subsequent responses may lead to either tolerance or susceptibility in plants. In-terplay of plant growth regulators [e.g., ethylene (ET), ab-scisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA) etc.] is the well-recognized residues in the coordination of signaling, its transmission through cellular network, and finally, modulation of gene expression are the keys to such tolerance. Nucleotide elements that are specifically sensitive to ethy-lene have been rescued from land-races of aus-type group of rice (Oryza sativa) and those are considered as the prime determinants for tolerance against anoxia. In this compre-hensive text, we tried to accommodate and revise the fun-damental and pivotal mechanisms of submergence stress at different angles of physiological and cellular responses of plants. These have also been reviewed for modern state of art techniques deciphering the molecular rejoinders like mi-croRNA, protein-protein interaction, feedback regulation of expression, sugar sensing, amplification of elicitor's re-sponses and others. Finally, strategies including physiolog-ical selection, metabolic engineering, marker assisted se-lection, genetical manipulation, interspecific hybridization are involved in developing stress resilience and plants' ar-chitecture to support sustainable agriculture under lowland systems.","[Adak, Malay Kumar; Saha, Indraneel; Dolui, Debabrata] Univ Kalyani, Dept Bot, Plant Physiol & Mol Biol Res Unit, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India; [Hasanuzzaman, Mirza] Sher e Bangla Agr Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh",Kalyani University; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU),"Adak, MK (corresponding author), Univ Kalyani, Dept Bot, Plant Physiol & Mol Biol Res Unit, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India.;Hasanuzzaman, M (corresponding author), Sher e Bangla Agr Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh.",mkadak09@gmail.com; mhzsauag@yahoo.com,"Hasanuzzaman, Mirza/A-1665-2010","Hasanuzzaman, Mirza/0000-0002-0461-8743",,,,,98,0,0,5,19,IMR PRESS,ROBINSON,"112 ROBINSON RD, ROBINSON, SINGAPORE",2768-6701,2768-6698,,FRONT BIOSCI-LANDMRK,Front.

Initiated at the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis, the Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx) aims at evaluating state-of-the-art sea-ice models using existing and new metrics to understand how the simulated deformation fields are affected by different representations of sea-ice physics (rheology) and by model configuration. Part 1 of the SIREx analysis is concerned with evaluation of the statistical distribution and scaling properties of sea-ice deformation fields from 35 different simulations against those from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). For the first time, the viscous-plastic (and the elastic-viscous-plastic variant), elastic-anisotropic-plastic, and Maxwell-elasto-brittle rheologies are compared in a single study. We find that both plastic and brittle sea-ice rheologies have the potential to reproduce the observed RGPS deformation statistics, including multi-fractality. Model configuration (e.g., numerical convergence, atmospheric representation, spatial resolution) and physical parameterizations (e.g., ice strength parameters and ice thickness distribution) both have effects as important as the choice of sea-ice rheology on the deformation statistics. It is therefore not straightforward to attribute model performance to a specific rheological framework using current deformation metrics. In light of these results, we further evaluate the statistical properties of simulated Linear Kinematic Features in a SIREx Part 2 companion paper.","[Bouchat, Amelie; Tremblay, Bruno] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hutter, Nils; Losch, Martin; Wang, Qiang] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Chanut, Jerome; Garric, Gilles] Mercator Ocean Int, Ramonville St Agne, France; [Dupont, Frederic] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Serv Meteorol Canadien, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Dukhovskoy, Dmitry] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Lee, Younjoo J.; Maslowski, Wieslaw] Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA USA; [Lemieux, Jean-Francois] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Rech Previs Numer Environm, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Lique, Camille; Talandier, Claude] Univ Brest, CNRS, IRD, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS,IFREMER,IUEM, Brest, France; [Myers, Paul G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Olason, Einar] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Olason, Einar] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Rampal, Pierre] CNRS, Inst Geophys Environm, Grenoble, France; [Rasmussen, Till] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark","McGill University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; Recherche en Prevision Numerique (RPN); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); University of Alberta; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Danish Meteorological Institute DMI","Bouchat, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",amelie.bouchat@mail.mcgill.ca,"Losch, Martin/S-5896-2016; Dukhovskoy, Dmitry/I-9391-2017; Lique, Camille/L-5543-2015","Losch, Martin/0000-0002-3824-5244; Hutter, Nils/0000-0003-3450-9422; Rasmussen, Till Andreas Soya/0000-0003-2931-5180; Wang, Qiang/0000-0002-2704-5394; Dupont, Frederic/0000-0002-9722-4478; Bouchat, Amelie/0000-0002-8228-0426; Dukhovskoy, Dmitry/0000-0002-9114-9796; Lique, Camille/0000-0002-8357-4928; Olason, Einar/0000-0001-7911-5713; Lemieux, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-2084-5759","DOE [DE-SC0014378]; HYCOM NOPP [N00014-19-1-2674]; DoD High-Performance Computing Modernization Program at NRL SSC; Danish State through the National centre for Climate Research; Innovation Fund Denmark; Horizon 2020 Framework Programe of the European Union [690462]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada [RGPIN 04357, RGPCC 433898]; Natural Science and Engineering and Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada Grants & Contributions program; U.S. Department of Energy Regional and Global Model Analysis program; Office of Naval Research Arctic and Global Prediction program; National Science Foundation Arctic System Science program; Projekt DEAL",DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); HYCOM NOPP; DoD High-Performance Computing Modernization Program at NRL SSC; Danish State through the National centre for Climate Research; Innovation Fund Denmark; Horizon 2020 Framework Programe of the European Union; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Natural Science and Engineering and Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Environment and Climate Change Canada Grants & Contributions program; U.S. Department of Energy Regional and Global Model Analysis program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Naval Research Arctic and Global Prediction program; National Science Foundation Arctic System Science program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Projekt DEAL,"The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their dedicated review and constructive comments that helped improve both SIREx manuscripts.

The foundation of coral reefs is an endosymbiosis between coral hosts and their resident photosynthetic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) and this partnership (or holobiont) is exquisitely sensitive to temperature stress. The primary response to hyperthermic stress is coral bleaching, which is the loss of symbionts from coral tissues-the collapse of the symbiosis (Weis 2008). Bleaching can result in increased coral mortality which can ultimately lead to severely compromised reef health (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Despite this grim picture of coral bleaching and reef degradation, coral susceptibility to stress and bleaching is highly variable (Coles & Brown 2003). There is enormous interest in discovering the factors that determine susceptibility in order to help us predict if and how corals will survive a period of rapid global warming. In this issue, Barshis et al. (2010) examine the ecophysiological and genetic basis for differential responses to stress in Porites lobata in American Samoa. They combine a reciprocal transplant experimental design between two neighbouring, but very different reef environments with state-of-the-art physiological biomarkers and molecular genetic markers for both partners to tease apart the contribution of environmental and fixed influences on stress susceptibility. Their results suggest the presence of a fixed, rather than environmental effect on expression of ubiquitin conjugates, one key marker for physiological stress response. In addition, the authors show genetic differentiation in host populations between the two sites suggesting strong selection for physiological adaptation to differing environments across small geographic distances. These conclusions point the study of coral resilience and susceptibility in a new direction.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Weis, VM (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",weisv@science.oregonstate.edu,"Weis, Virginia/T-5095-2019","Weis, Virginia/0000-0002-1826-2848",,,,,22,48,48,3,65,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Traffic count, meteorology and actual ambient measurements were carried out at 5 sampling sites along the studied route for 12 h per day for three consecutive times per rainy and dry season. Dispersion model results were compared with that of actual ambient measurement. Predicted average values were as follow: PM2.5 (112 mu g/m(3); 76.4 mu g/m(3)), NO2 (52.68 mu g/m(3); 37.63 mu g/m(3)), CO (2,141.3 mu g/m(3); 2,834.3 mu g/m(3)), while measured levels showed PM2.5 (208.49 mu g/m(3); 167.05 mu g/m(3)), NO2 (67.10 mu g/m(3); 50.16 mu g/m(3)), and CO (6,489.47 mu g/m(3); 10,115.88 mu g/m(3)) along the studied route during the dry and wet seasons respectively. The model and actual measurement results were used as an input for the percentile analysis based on hourly analysis and seasonal variation. In general, the measured PM2.5, CO and NO2 values were higher than the model values at all the sampling stations due to contributions from other sources. Also, higher values were recorded for the measured pollutants during dry season than the wet season due to lower precipitation and greater wind speed. Concentrations of the pollutants were below their tolerable limits (except PM2.5) at some locations. However, accumulation of these harmful pollutants in the airshed will alter climatic conditions, pose threat to the environment with their ill-health attendants.","[Joshua, O. H.; Asubiojo, O.

Here, we present the abstracts and proceedings of our 8th annual conference, held in Detroit, Michigan in May 2019, themed From Challenges, to Opportunities. Our far-ranging discussions addressed the complex interdependent ecological challenges of advancing global urbanization, including the biopsychosocial interactions in our living environment on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, together with the wider community and societal factors that govern these. We had a strong solutions focus, with diverse strategies spanning from urban-greening and renewal, nature-relatedness, nutritional ecology, planetary diets, and microbiome rewilding, through to initiatives for promoting resilience, positive emotional assets, traditional cultural narratives, creativity, art projects for personal and community health, and exploring ways of positively shifting mindsets and value systems. Our cross-sectoral agenda underscored the importance and global impact of local initiatives everywhere by contributing to new normative values as part of a global interconnected grass-roots movement for planetary health.","[Prescott, Susan L.] Univ Western Australia, Perth Childrens Hosp, Telethon Kids Inst, ORIGINS Project, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Prescott, Susan L.; Logan, Alan C.] Worldwide Univ Network WUN, VIVO Planetary Hlth, West New York, NJ 10704 USA; [Hancock, Trevor] Univ Victoria, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Policy retired, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Bland, Jeffrey] Personalized Lifestyle Med Inst, Tacoma, WA 98443 USA; [van den Bosch, Matilda] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Jansson, Janet K.] Pacific Northwestatl Lab, Div Biol Sci, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Johnson, Christine C.; Wegienka, Ganesa] Wayne State Univ, Henry Ford Hlth Syst & Ctr Urban Responses Enviro, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Kondo, Michelle] USDA Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; [Katz, David] Yale Univ, Yale Griffin Prevent Res Ctr, Derby, CT 06418 USA; [Kort, Remco] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kozyrskyj, Anita] Univ Alberta, Dept Pediat, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Nanan, Ralph] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr Nepean, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Poland, Blake] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5T, Canada; [Robinson, Jake] Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Schroeck, Nicholas] Univ Detroit Mercy, Sch Law Detroit, Mercy, MI 48226 USA; [Sinkkonen, Aki] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Program, Lahti 15140, Finland; [Springmann, Marco] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Wright, Robert O.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA",Telethon Kids Institute; University of Western Australia; University of Victoria; University of British Columbia; Wayne State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Yale University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Alberta; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Sydney; University of Toronto; University of Sheffield; University of Detroit Mercy; University of Helsinki; University of Oxford; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Prescott, SL (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Perth Childrens Hosp, Telethon Kids Inst, ORIGINS Project, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.;Prescott, SL (corresponding author), Worldwide Univ Network WUN, VIVO Planetary Hlth, West New York, NJ 10704 USA.",Susan.Prescott@telethonkids.org.au; thancock@uvic.ca; bland@plminstitute.org; matilda.vandenbosch@ubc.ca; janet.jansson@pnnl.gov; CJOHNSO1@hfhs.org; michelle.c.kondo@usda.gov; davkatz7@gmail.com; r.kort@vu.nl; kozyrsky@ualberta.ca; alanxlogan@gmail.com; christopher.lowry@colorado.edu; ralph.nanan@sydney.edu.au; blake.poland@utoronto.ca; jmrobinson3@sheffield.ac.uk; schroenj@udmercy.edu; aki.sinkkonen@helsinki.fi; marco.springmann@dph.ox.ac.uk; robert.wright@mssm.edu; gwegien1@hfhs.org,"Kort, Remco/ABH-1915-2021; Chalmin-Pui, Lauriane Suyin/AAX-8427-2020; van den Bosch, Matilda/F-1550-2013","Kort, Remco/0000-0003-3674-598X; Chalmin-Pui, Lauriane Suyin/0000-0002-1383-7550; Wright, Robert/0000-0003-1180-6459; Lowry, Christopher/0000-0003-3920-5575; Robinson, Jake/0000-0001-8108-3271; Kondo, Michelle/0000-0001-9152-1589; Nanan, Ralph/0000-0002-1749-6378; van den Bosch, Matilda/0000-0003-1410-0099; Tingo, Lina/0000-0002-2482-9281; sinkkonen, aki/0000-0002-6821-553X",Danone; Genuine Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES [P30ES020957] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Danone(Danone Nutricia); Genuine Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)),Our meeting was funded by participants and in-kind support from collaborating academic institutions.

An important example is the decline of the Akkadian Empire in northern Mesopotamia similar to 4.2 ka, for which the existence of a coincident climate event is still uncertain. Here we present an Iranian stalagmite record spanning 5.2 ka to 3.7 ka, dated with 25 U/Th ages that provide an average age uncertainty of 31 y (1 sigma). We find two periods of increased Mg/Ca, beginning abruptly at 4.51 and 4.26 ka, and lasting 110 and 290 y, respectively. Each of these periods coincides with slower vertical stalagmite growth and a gradual increase in stable oxygen isotope ratios. The periods of high Mg/Ca are explained by periods of increased dust flux sourced from the Mesopotamia region, and the abrupt onset of this dustiness indicates threshold behavior in response to aridity. This interpretation is consistent with existing marine and terrestrial records from the broad region, which also suggest that the later, longer event beginning at 4.26 ka is of greater regional extent and/or amplitude. The chronological precision and high resolution of our record indicates that there is no significant difference, at decadal level, between the start date of the second, larger dust event and the timing of North Mesopotamia settlement abandonment, and furthermore reveals striking similarity between the total duration of the second dust event and settlement abandonment. The Iranian record demonstrates this region's threshold behavior in dust production, and its ability to maintain this climate state for multiple centuries naturally.","[Carolin, Stacy A.; Walker, Richard T.; Day, Christopher C.; Henderson, Gideon M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Ersek, Vasile] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Sloan, R.

For this purpose main questiones were found worthy of investigation: What characteristics should be presented in designing an energetic city?, What are the aims of changing a city into an energetic city?, In this paper we provide a model which responds to the sustainability of Bushehr and Masdar. This model uses five levels of activities, with each level responding to at least two significant characteristics of an energetic city with regard to the compact urban form.

Of the five non-native invertebrate species currently in terrestrial Antarctica, the flightless midge Eretmoptera murphyi (Schaeffer, The Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences 2:90-94, 1914) is perhaps the most persistent insect invader. Accidentally introduced to Signy Island (60 degrees S) in the 1960s from sub-Antarctic South Georgia (54 degrees S), E. murphyi has steadily increased its distribution, however, its status has not been reassessed for a decade. Here, we update the distribution of E. murphyi on Signy, specifically assessing whether footpaths to regularly visited research sites represent dispersal corridors. Our findings show that both the abundance and range of E. murphyi have increased significantly since 2009, particularly along paths leading away from the original introduction site, and that the species is now on the cusp of moving into new valley systems. We identify a moderate association with soil/substrate and vegetation types and build Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models to predict areas of the island that may be at highest risk of future colonisation. As a detritivore with no competitors or predators, E. murphyi may have a major impact. For example, accelerating nutrient cycling which may have wider impacts on all levels of biodiversity. This study highlights the need for an assessment of current biosecurity protocols applied within the Antarctic Treaty system, as well as the need for systematic regular monitoring of introduced and invasive species in Antarctica.","[Bartlett, Jesamine C.; Hayward, Scott A.

However, the mechanism of ES change on spatiotemporal scales post-disturbance remains unclear, especially in the context of global climate change. Here, we conducted a global literature review on the impact of two of the most frequent disturbance factors (mining and restoration) on 27 different ESs, intending to synthesize the impacts of human disturbance on ESs in mining areas via a meta-analysis, and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of ESs after disturbance. We screened 3204 disturbance studies published on the Web of Science between 1950 and 2020 and reviewed 340 in detail. The results of independence test showed that human disturbance had a significant impact on ESs in the mining areas (p < 0.001). The impacts (positive and/or negative) caused by mining and restoration differed considerably among ESs (even on the same ESs). Additionally, spatiotemporal scales of human disturbance were significantly related to spatiotemporal scales of ES change (p < 0.001). We found that the positive and negative impacts of disturbances on ESs may be interconversion under specific spatiotemporal conditions. This seems to be associated with spatiotemporal variability, such as the temporal lag, spatial spillover, and cumulative spatiotemporal effects. Climate changes can lead to further spatiotemporal variability, which highlights the importance of understanding the changes in ESs post-disturbance on spatiotemporal scales.

Between the thirteenth and the early eighteenth centuries, the trading village of Kalikata lay on the coastal margin of Bengal. The regional capitals of the Sultanate and Mughal periods were located further inland at Gour, Pandua, Rajmahal, Dhaka, and Murshidabad, in the hinterlands of imperial capitals in the Delhi region. Bengal capitals changed frequently with fluvial and geopolitical conditions, which had implications for their economic and architectural development. Coastal trading settlements competed with one another in commercial and militany matters, which established a new hinterland by the late eighteenth century, with 'hinterland' defined as the economic catchment region of the maritime port of Calcutta. This article retraces these processes from chronicles, revenue records, and archaeological surveys. Our examination concludes with the national eclipse of Calcutta by New Delhi in the early twentieth century, and the prospect of climate- driven retreat to inland capitals in Bengal in a twenty-first-century shift that would resemble urban patterns of the precolonial era.","[Wescoat, James L., Jr.] MIT, Dept Architecture, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room 10-390, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fischer, Rio] Boston Univ, Dept Hist Art & Architecture, 725 Commonwealth Ave,Room 302, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University,"Wescoat, JL (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Architecture, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room 10-390, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",wescoat@mit.edu; rfischer@bu.edu,,,,,,,82,0,0,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2045-5895,2045-5909,,INT J ISLAM ARCHIT,Int.

Existing atmospheric reanalysis datasets offer extensive record lengths and global coverage, but usually their spatial resolution is coarse for distributed hydrologic simulations at small spatial scales. On the other hand, the temporal coverage of high-resolution radar-based rainfall estimates can be rather short for risk applications. To address these shortcomings, we simultaneously bias-correct and downscale a state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) rainfall dataset, using the radar-based Stage IV precipitation product as fine resolution reference, to develop an hourly CONUS-wide precipitation product over a 4-km grid, which extends back to 1979. In this regard, we refine an existing parametric quantile mapping framework based on a two-component theoretical distribution model, where we impose continuity of the parametric forms via optimal threshold selection to transition between higher and lower rain rates. An evaluation over the probability frequency and time domains, using NOAA's raingauge measurements as benchmark, reveals that the developed product benefits from the strengths of the calibration datasets, demonstrating good performance and robust behavior over all studied time periods and Koppen climate classification zones, including snow-prone regions or areas where mesoscale convective systems become dominant. The accuracy of the yielded high spatial-resolution rain rates, especially in low probability events, shows that the developed product can be effectively used for hydroclimatic risk applications and frequency analysis, while its high temporal and spatial resolution makes it particularly useful for distributed hydrologic modeling.","[Emmanouil, Stergios; Anagnostou, Emmanouil N.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Langousis, Andreas] Univ Patras, Dept Civil Engn, Patras, Greece; [Nikolopoulos, Efthymios I.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Civil Engn, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Patras; Florida Institute of Technology,"Anagnostou, EN (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",manos@uconn.edu,"Emmanouil, Stergios/AAC-7838-2022; Nikolopoulos, Efthymios/B-1717-2013","Emmanouil, Stergios/0000-0002-8772-3409; Anagnostou, Emmanouil/0000-0002-1622-0302; Langousis, Andreas/0000-0002-0643-2520; Nikolopoulos, Efthymios/0000-0002-5206-1249",Ever-source Energy Center at the University of Connecticut,Ever-source Energy Center at the University of Connecticut,"This study was supported by the Ever-source Energy Center at the University of Connecticut.

However, there remain significant concerns with the way WFD is implemented and there is now a need for water managers and scientists to communicate better in order to find solutions to these concerns. To address this, a Science-Policy Interface (SPI) activity was launched in 2010 led by Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and Onema (the French national agency for water and aquatic ecosystems), which provided an interactive forum to connect scientists and WFD end-users. One major aim of the SPI activity was to establish a list of the most crucial research and development needs for enhancing WFD implementation. This paper synthesises the recommendations from this event highlighting 10 priority issues relating to ecological status. For lakes, temporary streams and transitional and coastal waters, WFD implementation still suffers from a lack of WFD-compliant bioassessment methods. For rivers, special attention is required to assess the ecological impacts of hydromorphological alterations on biological communities, notably those affecting river continuity and riparian covering. Spatial extrapolation tools are needed in order to evaluate ecological status for water bodies for which no data are available. The need for more functional bioassessment tools as complements to usual WFD-compliant tools, and to connect clearly good ecological state, biodiversity and ecosystem services when implementing WFD were also identified as crucial issues.

As is well known, spherical harmonics (SHs), which are commonly used to recover gravity fields, are orthogonal basis functions with global coverage. However, the chosen SH truncation involves a global compromise between data coverage and obtainable resolution, and strong localized signals may not be fully captured. Radial basis functions (RBFs) provide another representation, which has been proposed in earlier works to be better suited to retrieve regional gravity signals. In this paper, we propose a MRBF approach by embedding the known coastal geometries in the RBF parameterization and imposing global mass conservation and equilibrium behavior of the oceans. Our hypothesis is that with this physically justified constraint, the GRACE-derived gravity signals can be more realistically partitioned into the land and ocean contributions along the coastlines. We test this new technique to invert monthly gravity fields from GRACE level-1b observations covering 2005-2010, for which the numerical results indicate that (1) MRBF-based solutions reduce the number of parameters by approximately 10% and allow for more flexible regularization when compared to ordinary RBF solutions and (2) the MRBF-derived mass flux is better confined along coastal areas. The latter is particularly tested in the southern Greenland, and our results indicate that the trend of mass loss from the MRBF solutions is approximately 11% larger than that from the SH solutions and approximately 4%-6% larger than that of RBF solutions.","[Yang, Fan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan; Kusche, Juergen; Rietbroek, Roelof] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Bonn, Germany; [Forootan, Ehsan] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Wuhan University; University of Bonn; Cardiff University,"Yang, F (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Yang, F (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Bonn, Germany.",mrfanyang90@gmail.com,"Rietbroek, Roelof/AAE-8820-2020; Kusche, Jurgen/E-9805-2014","Rietbroek, Roelof/0000-0001-5276-5943; Kusche, Jurgen/0000-0001-7069-021X; Forootan, Ehsan/0000-0003-3055-041X",Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC); COAST project [DFG KU1207/20-1]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB23030100],Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); COAST project; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"The authors acknowledge financial supports through the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC), the COAST project (DFG KU1207/20-1), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant XDB23030100).

We developed a method for building statistical regressions that estimate public health cost of emissions accurately like a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (CTM) but without its high computational cost. This method achieves detailed spatial resolution according to the location of the emission source, accounting for differences in the exposed population downwind. Using tagged CTM simulations, our method builds a large dataset of air quality public health costs from marginal emissions throughout the United States. Two methods were developed to describe exposed population, one that assumes a generic downwind plume concentration profile derived from CTM outputs and a simpler method that uses the size of population within certain distances as variables. Using the former method, we parameterized marginal public health cost [$/t] and intake fraction [ppm] as a function of exposed population and key atmospheric variables. We derived models for elemental carbon, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ammonia. Compared to estimates calculated directly using CTM outputs, our models generally show mean fractional errors of only 10%-30% and up to 50% for NOx in some seasons, which are generally similar to or less than CTM's performance. Our results show that the public health costs of emissions can be efficiently parameterized for policy analyses based on state-of-the-art CTMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate changes have many effects, including lack of annual rainfall and pests, heat waves, changes in sea level, and global ozone/atmospheric CO2 fluctuation, on land and agriculture in similar ways. Climate change also affects the environment. Based on these factors, farmers chose their crops to increase productivity in their fields. Many existing agricultural ontologies are either domain-specific or have been created with minimal vocabulary and no proper evaluation framework has been implemented. A new agricultural ontology focused on subdomains is designed to assist farmers using Jaccard relative extractor (JRE) and Naive Bayes algorithm. The JRE is used to find the similarity between two sentences and words in the agricultural documents and the relationship between two terms is identified via the Naive Bayes algorithm. In the proposed method, the preprocessing of data is carried out through natural language processing techniques and the tags whose dimensions are reduced are subjected to rule-based formal concept analysis and mapping. The subdomain ontologies of weather, pest, and soil are built separately, and the overall agricultural ontology are built around them. The gold standard for the lexical layer is used to evaluate the proposed technique, and its performance is analyzed by comparing it with different state-of-the-art systems. Precision, recall, F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve area, and precision-recall curve area are the performance metrics used to analyze the performance. The proposed methodology gives a precision score of 94.40% when compared with the decision tree(83.94%) and K-nearest neighbor algorithm(86.89%) for agricultural ontology construction.","[Deepa, Rajendran] Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Vigneshwari, Srinivasan] Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Sathyabama Institute of Science & Technology; Sathyabama Institute of Science & Technology,"Deepa, R (corresponding author), Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",deepa.deepavijay@gmail.com,"Vigneshwari, S/A-4282-2017","Vigneshwari, S/0000-0001-8656-7371",,,,,33,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1225-6463,2233-7326,,ETRI J,ETRI J.,AUG,2022,4,,,,573,587,,10.4218/etrij.2020-0439,http://dx.doi.org/10.4218/etrij.2020-0439,,22-May,15,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Telecommunications,3T7QP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000790326200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It includes the central area of Rome-the Roman Forum, the Palatine, the Colosseum and the Domus Aurea-and has an extension of about 77 hectares, of which about 32 are buildings. With these objectives, the Parco Archeologico del Colosseo has launched a static and dynamic monitoring project consisting of six fundamental levels of activities. The project involves the creation of a multi-parameter system of permanent control of the entire archaeological area, with the associated indicators of the level of risk, for which it is necessary the combined use of innovative technologies.","[Della Giovampaola, Irma] Parco Archeol Colosseo, Piazza Sta Maria Nova 53, I-00186 Rome, Italy",,"Della Giovampaola, I (corresponding author), Parco Archeol Colosseo, Piazza Sta Maria Nova 53, I-00186 Rome, Italy.",irma.dellagiovampaola@beniculturali.it,,,"Parco [333-18-2.1.2.021, 15]",Parco,"SyPEAH and the related laboratory, designed by the Author of this paper, have been funded by the Parco, where they are being implemented (Pgt. 333-18-2.1.2.021-Del. n. 15 dated 11/09/2018-RUP, Designer and DEC Dr Irma Della Giovampaola).",,42,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,JUN,2021,6,,,,,,246,10.3390/geosciences11060246,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences11060246,,,21,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,SZ0HA,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000666256600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The understanding of groundwater flow and age distribution is crucial for the prediction of the future dispersion and impact of the contamination. State of the art tracer methods (H-3, He-3, He-4, Kr-85, Ar-39 and C-14) were, therefore, used to obtain insights to ageing and mixing processes of groundwater along a north-south flow line in the centre of the two most important aquifers of Cenomanian and middle Turonian age. Dating of groundwater is particularly complex in this area as: (i) groundwater in the Cenomanian aquifer is locally affected by fluxes of geogenic and biogenic gases (e.g. CO2, CH4, He) and by fossil brines in basement rocks rich in Cl and SO4; (ii) a thick unsaturated zone overlays the Turonian aquifer; (iii) a periglacial climate and permafrost conditions prevailed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and iv) the wells are mostly screened over large depth intervals. Large disagreements in Kr-85 and H-3/He-3 ages indicate that processes other than ageing have affected the tracer data in the Turonian aquifer. Mixing with older waters (> 50 a) was confirmed by Ar-39 activities. An inverse modelling approach, which included time lags for tracer transport throughout the unsaturated zone and degassing of He-3, was used to estimate the age of groundwater. Best fits between model and field results were obtained for mean residence times varying from modern up to a few hundred years. The presence of modern water in this aquifer is correlated with the occurrence of elevated pollution (e.g. nitrates). An increase of reactive geochemical indicators (e.g. Na) and radiogenic He-4, and a decrease in C-14 along the flow direction confirmed groundwater ageing in the deeper confined Cenomanian aquifer. Radiocarbon ages varied from a few hundred years to more than 20 ka. Initial C-14 activity for radiocarbon dating was calibrated by means of Ar-39 measurements. The C-14 age of a sample recharged during the LGM was further confirmed by depleted stable isotope signatures and near freezing point noble gas temperature. Radiogenic He-4 accumulated in groundwater with concentrations increasing linearly with C-14 ages. This enabled the use of He-4 to validate the dating range of C-14 and extend it to other parts of this aquifer. In the proximity of faults, Ar-39 in excess of modern concentrations and C-14 dead CO2 sources, elevated He-3/He-4 ratios and volcanic activity in Oligocene to Quaternary demonstrate the influence of gas of deeper origin and impeded the application of He-4, Ar-39 and C-14 for groundwater dating.

CWatM is open source in the Python programming environment and has a modular structure. It uses global, freely available data in the netCDF4 file format for reading, storage, and production of data in a compact way. CWatM includes general surface and groundwater hydrological processes but also takes into account human activities, such as water use and reservoir regulation, by calculating water demands, water use, and return flows. Reservoirs and lakes are included in the model scheme. CWatM is used in the framework of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which compares global model outputs. The flexible model structure allows for dynamic interaction with hydro-economic and water quality models for the assessment and evaluation of water management options. Furthermore, the novelty of CWatM is its combination of state-of-the-art hydrological modeling, modular programming, an online user manual and automatic source code documentation, global and regional assessments at different spatial resolutions, and a potential community to add to, change, and expand the open-source project. CWatM also strives to build a community learning environment which is able to freely use an open-source hydrological model and flexible coupling possibilities to other sectoral models, such as energy and agriculture.","[Burek, Peter; Satoh, Yusuke; Kahil, Taher; Tang, Ting; Greve, Peter; Smilovic, Mikhail; Guillaumot, Luca; Wada, Yoshihide] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Satoh, Yusuke] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Guillaumot, Luca] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Zhao, Fang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fang] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fang] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Wada, Yoshihide] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Rennes; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Utrecht University,"Burek, P (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",burek@iiasa.ac.at,"Greve, Peter/K-5311-2015; Greve, Peter/AAD-4377-2019; Wada, Yoshihide/F-3595-2012; Burek, Peter/ABF-4741-2020; Burek, Peter/HCH-8080-2022","Greve, Peter/0000-0002-9454-0125; Greve, Peter/0000-0002-9454-0125; Wada, Yoshihide/0000-0003-4770-2539; Burek, Peter/0000-0001-6390-8487; Burek, Peter/0000-0001-6390-8487; Tang, Ting/0000-0002-2867-9241; Guillaumot, Luca/0000-0002-6579-6287; Kahil, Taher/0000-0002-7812-5271; Smilovic, Mikhail/0000-0001-9651-8821","US National Science Foundation [ICER/EAR-1829999]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the FUSE - Belmont Forum [730254]; EUCP (European Climate Prediction System) project - European Union under Horizon 2020 [776613]; European Union; Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (BMWFW); CO-MICC project, ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the FUSE - Belmont Forum; EUCP (European Climate Prediction System) project - European Union under Horizon 2020; European Union(European Commission); Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (BMWFW); CO-MICC project, ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate","This study and the model development were also conducted as part of the Belmont Forum Sustainable Urbanisation Global Initiative (SUGI)/Food-Water-Energy Nexus theme for which coordination was supported by the US National Science Foundation under grant ICER/EAR-1829999 to Stanford University.

These systems can translate across spatial regions spanning 1000's of km. Climate scientists, numerical modelers, and operational hydro-meteorologists are especially interested in understanding how the characteristics of precipitation systems change over space and time. For example, a topic of current interest is whether global climate change can be observed in the changing characteristics of precipitating weather systems. In addition, there are many outstanding questions regarding the ability of numerical weather prediction systems to predict realistic weather events that translate and evolve over time and space that could be addressed with appropriate forecast evaluation methods. For example, do state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models accurately predict temporal changes in the morphological characteristics of convective precipitation systems? In order to answer these types of questions, automated techniques of identifying and tracking individual weather systems must be developed and applied to forecast and observed data, and methods of comparing forecasts and observations of time-varying features must be developed. This paper will focus on the problem of developing a framework for the comparison of meteorological features that evolve with time. Since weather systems typically evolve and translate in space and time, explicit analysis of their characteristics requires a feature-based or object-oriented approach. Such an approach involves identification of the precipitating weather system of interest and measurement of appropriate characteristics of each system. Individual systems within the forecast and observed data must be tracked over time, which involves issues of determining the beginning and ending of specific events. Issues related to comparing predicted and observed weather events must also be addressed, as well as the problem of comparing forecast and observed events with unequal lifetimes.","Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Sch Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Baldwin, ME (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Sch Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",baldwin@purdue.edu,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,2,UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,NEDLANDS,"NEDLANDS, WA, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9758400-7-8,,,,2009,,,,,4177,4183,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BUQ27,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290045004037,View Full Record in Web of Science

A set of seven paintings belonging to the first altarpiece of Goa Cathedral now remain in its sacristy. Art history states that these paintings, assigned to the painter Garcia Fernandes, were produced in Lisbon circa 1530 and carried to Goa shortly after, Serrao (2011), Reis-Santos (1957).Presently, the conservation state of the paintings indicates urgent treatment. The most damaged paintings show significant loss of the original chromatic layer. This is mostly due to the high temperatures and relative humidity existing in tropical climates, such as Goa, different from the European. The Baltic oak support is covered with ground layers of calcium suphate, which present fissures and great losses due to the shrinkages of the wood support. The high reactivity of the ground materials to water is also a factor leading to specific material deterioration and degradation mechanisms. In comparison with the paintings of the same period produced in Portugal using the same materials, we verify a much higher degradation of the state of conservation. To access the procedures for preservation and restoration of this set of paintings we must take into account the possible degradation mechanisms of the constituent materials brought by specific environmental factors. This paper discusses the degradation problematic of this specific set of paintings taking into account their particular environment, while bringing results on the materials used. Concluding, this study will allow the knowledge on how to preserve and restore one of the most ancient sets of European paintings in India, kept since the 16th century in tropical climate.

In this regard, exploiting the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) for producing high value bioproducts and bioenergy under a biorefinery approach has attracted great interest. This paper presents the state of the art of urban biowaste biorefinery concepts. Accordingly, different novel valorization pathways, namely single cell protein, biosuccinic acid, and lactic acid, as well as bioenergy production were consolidated into some scenarios. Moreover, successfully tested hydrogen-assisted biological biogas upgrading was also incorporated into some scenarios as energy source for methanotrophs to upcycle nitrogen rich digestate into single cell protein. Upon the successful lab-scale experiments, different biorefinery platforms were developed and their sustainability was environmentally scrutinized using consequential life cycle assessment. The results obtained herein demonstrated that despite having different net environmental benefits, all the developed scenarios were eco-friendly solutions for valorizing biowaste into bioproducts and bioenergy. Scenarios including microbial protein production led to a saving of -58 to -147 kg CO2,eq/t biopulp in Climate change category, depending on the biorefining pathway. The net saving in Climate change category achieved for Succinic acid- and Lactic acid-based biorefinery was estimated at -73 and -173 kg CO2,eq/t biopulp, respectively. Biological biogas upgrading, if implemented, could increase energy payback by 9724 MJ/t biopulp and contribute more to the sustainability of other developed scenarios. Although scenarios with the main focus on bioenergy production outperformed others in terms of environmental sustainability, some complementary factors such as policy decisions, energy directives, economic issues, and carbon trade schemes must be taken into account in order to introduce the best valorization pathway.","[Khoshnevisan, Benyamin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Nonpoint Source Pollut Control, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Plantat & Agrotechnol, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Biofuel Res Team BRTeam, Karaj, Iran; [Tsapekos, Panagiotis] AREEO, ABRII, Microbial Biotechnol Dept, Karaj, Iran; [Tsapekos, Panagiotis; Angelidaki, Irini] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Rafiee, Shahin; Aghbashlo, Mortaza] Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn Agr Machinery, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran; [Lindeneg, Susanne] Tech & Environm Adm, Unit Resources & Waste Planning, City Dev, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Technical University of Denmark; University of Tehran","Khoshnevisan, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Nonpoint Source Pollut Control, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Tabatabaei, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Plantat & Agrotechnol, Biofuel Res Team BRTeam, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",benkho@caas.cn; meisam_tab@yahoo.com,"Aghbashlo, Mortaza/L-2752-2017; Tabatabaei, Meisam/E-7235-2013; Khoshnevisan, Benyamin/AAY-1212-2021; Tsapekos, Panagiotis/AAK-5902-2021; Angelidaki, Irini/AAX-2562-2020; Khoshnevisan, Benyamin/AAS-7221-2021","Aghbashlo, Mortaza/0000-0001-8534-4686; Tabatabaei, Meisam/0000-0001-8067-1944; Khoshnevisan, Benyamin/0000-0003-0236-5970; Tsapekos, Panagiotis/0000-0002-5309-4624; Angelidaki, Irini/0000-0002-6357-578X; ",Copenhagen municipality,Copenhagen municipality,The authors would like to thank the Copenhagen municipality for its financial support.

Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects-in particular, ocean warming and acidification. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photosymbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolution, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the -omics complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition (2016-2018) has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east-west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south-north transect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout 32 island systems with local replicates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high-throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a massive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.","[Planes, Serge; Banaigs, Bernard; Boissin, Emilie; Planes, S.; Banaig, B.; Boissin, E.; Iwankow, G.] PSL Res Univ, Univ Perpignan, Lab Excellence CORAIL, EPHE UPVD CNRS,USR 3278 CRIOBE, Perpignan, France; [Planes, Serge; Bowler, Chris; Galand, Pierre E.; Ghiglione, Jean-Francois; Romac, Sarah; Trouble, Romain; de Vargas, Colomban; Wincker, Patrick] Tara Oceans GOSEE, FR2022, Res Federat Study Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut, Paris, France; [Allemand, Denis; Moulin, Clementine; Reynaud, Stephanie; Zoccola, Didier; Allemand, D.; Beraud, E.; Reynaud, S.; Zoccola, D.] Ctr Sci Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco; [Agostini, Sylvain] Shimoda Marine Res Ctr, Shimoda, Japan; [Boss, Emmanuel; Bourdin, Guillaume; Boss, E.; Bourdin, G.; Haentjens, N.; Karp-Boss, L.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USA; [Bourdin, Guillaume; Lombard, Fabien; da Silva, O.; Dolan, J.

The simulations are carried out by adding artificial noise to a real observation dataset. Instead of using the delta and sigma parameters computed from slant wet delay, as in previous studies, we employ the Bias and RMS parameters, computed from the tomography results of total voxels, in order to obtain a more direct and comprehensive evaluation of the precision of the refractivity field determination. The results show that: (1) the precision of tropospheric wet refractivity estimated using BDS alone (only 9 satellites used) is basically comparable to that of GPS; (2) BDS+GPS (as of current operation) may not be able to significantly improve the data's spatial density for the application of refractivity tomography; and (3) any slight increase in the precision of refractivity tomography, particularly in the lower atmosphere, bears great significance for any applications dependent on the Chinese operational meteorological service.","[Wang Xiaoying; Ke Fuyang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Remote Sensing, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang Xiaoying] Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & Geoinformat, Key Lab Land Environm & Disaster Monitoring, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China; [Wang Xianliang; Wang Feifei] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Dai Ziqiang] China Elect Technol Grp, Res Inst 28, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cao Yunchang] China Meteorol Adm, Meteorol Observat Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Song Lianchun] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; China Electronics Technology Group; China Meteorological Administration; China Meteorological Administration,"Song, LC (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",songlc_cma@163.com,,,"National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China [2012CB955903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [20907047, 71373131]; National Industry-specific Topics [GYHY 201406078]",National Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Industry-specific Topics,"The authors wish to thank Profs.

The High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) instrument is used as example to illustrate the method. The method uses two basic ideas. Firstly, the channel radiance can be approximated by a weighted mean of the radiance at some representative frequencies, where the weights can be determined by linear regression. Secondly, a near-optimal set of representative frequencies can be found by simulated annealing. The paper does not only describe and analyze the method, it also describes how the method was used to derive optimized frequency grids for the HIRS instruments on the satellites TIROS N, NOAA 6-19, and Metop A.

However, many peatlands have been drained for peat extraction or agricultural use. This converts peatlands from sinks to sources of carbon, causing approx. 5% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect and additional negative effects on other ecosystem services. Rewetting peatlands can mitigate climate change and may be combined with management in the form of paludiculture. Rewetted peatlands, however, do not equal their pristine ancestors and their ecological functioning is not understood. This holds true especially for groundwater-fed fens. Their functioning results from manifold interactions and can only be understood following an integrative approach of many relevant fields of science, which we merge in the interdisciplinary project WETSCAPES. Here, we address interactions among water transport and chemistry, primary production, peat formation, matter transformation and transport, microbial community, and greenhouse gas exchange using state of the art methods. We record data on six study sites spread across three common fen types (Alder forest, percolation fen, and coastal fen), each in drained and rewetted states. First results revealed that indicators reflecting more long-term effects like vegetation and soil chemistry showed a stronger differentiation between drained and rewetted states than variables with a more immediate reaction to environmental change, like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variations in microbial community composition explained differences in soil chemical data as well as vegetation composition and GHG exchange. We show the importance of developing an integrative understanding of managed fen peatlands and their ecosystem functioning.","[Jurasinski, Gerald; Guenther, Anke; Koebsch, Franziska; Koehn, Daniel] Univ Rostock, Landscape Ecol & Site Evaluat, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, J V Liebig Weg 6, D-18051 Rostock, Germany;

The condensate from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems has been identified as potential source of clean water, which is typically removed and disposed of in a sanitary drain. The condensate can be beneficially used for water sustainability and building energy recovery. The focus of this article is a state of the art review of HVAC condensate recovery, the progress in research and development of condensate recovery systems (CRSs), quality concerns and potential applications. Specific attention is given to review all the existing CRSs around the globe, theoretical and experimental studies on condensate recovery, mathematical models proposed and evaluation of quality characteristics. The issues and challenges involved and suggestions for future work are highlighted. The review reveals that, given the importance of water conservation and clean and sustainable energy resources, the domain of HVAC condensate recovery and utilization has significant scope for research and development in order to realize practical CRSs that can contribute for water sustainability and energy management in buildings.","[Algarni, Salem; Saleel, C.

In parallel, recent climate change, human activities and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. However, several formidable challenges, including the cold and harsh climate, high altitude and complex topography, inhibit complete and consistent data collection where and when it is needed, which hinders the development of remote-sensing technologies and alpine hydrological models. The current study presents a suite of datasets consisting of long-term hydrometeorological, snow cover and frozen-ground data for investigating watershed science and functions from an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation network in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in China. Meteorological and hydrological data were monitored from an observation network connecting a group of automatic meteorological stations (AMSs). In addition, to capture snow accumulation and ablation processes, snow cover properties were collected from a snow observation super-station using state-of-the-art techniques and instruments. High-resolution soil physics datasets were also obtained to capture the freeze-thaw processes from a frozen-ground observation superstation. The updated datasets were released to scientists with multidisciplinary backgrounds (i.e., cryospheric science, hydrology and meteorology), and they are expected to serve as a testing platform to provide accurate forcing data and validate and evaluate remote-sensing products and hydrological models for a broader community.

The territory is characterised by a semi-arid climate with a dry and a wet semester occurring in the year. Evaporative losses are strong during the summer and, on an annual basis, they often exceed precipitation. Thus, reservoirs constitute an important water resource for the island to supply drinking water and to provide for agricultural needs in the periods of drought. However, despite their importance, they receive poor attention from the scientific and political communities and in the absence of any environmental policy or suitable territorial planning, their water quality is undergoing a rapid decline, principally due to the inadequate treatment of urban waste waters and to the excessive and irrational spreading of fertilizer. The convinction that reservoirs may differ significantly from lakes and the necessity to better understand what rules drive the functioning of these environments, were the engine to carry out several limnological investigations on these artificial environments with special reference to their pelagic compartment. The principal characteristics of these water bodies lie in their peculiar hydrological cycle. The absence of precipitations during summer, when the reservoirs are intensively used, and their re-filling in winter without any outflow contribute to water-level fluctuations which interfere with their thermal structure, underwater light climate and nutrient dynamics'. The structure of phytoplankton assemblages is, in the absence of a severe nutrient limitation, modulated by hydrological forcing. In addition to these bottom-up effects some top-down ones, also mediated by the water-level fluctuations. These involved the strength of predation pressure exherted by fish on zooplankton assemblage. Ultimately, it has been demonstrated that these water movements influence the structure of these ecosystems profoundly and their effects have to be carefully considered when management procedures have to be developed.","Univ Palermo, Dept Bot, Sicily, Italy",University of Palermo,"Naselli-Flores, L (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Bot, Sicily, Italy.",,"Naselli-Flores, Luigi/AAE-7756-2022; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008","Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862",,,,,68,29,31,2,4,INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE ECOLOGY,SAO CARLOS,"RUA ALFREDO LOPES, 1717, VILA ELIZABETH, S D05, BR-13560460 SAO CARLOS, SP, BRAZIL",,,85-87418-02-5,,,,1999,,,,,283,311,,,,,,29,"Ecology; Engineering, Geological; Fisheries; Limnology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Engineering; Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,BP90N,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000086563300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

I focus on creative cultural and digital initiatives that have emerged within the last 5-7 years in an autonomous region of the Russian Federation: the Republic of Tatarstan. These initiatives were launched by young grass-roots activists and entrepreneurs who are Tatars - an ethnic group that predominantly resides in the Republic of Tatarstan. As a republic with a certain degree of autonomy under the Russian federal legislation, Tatarstan has been the centre of the Tatar classic cultural production (theatre, music, arts, and literature), as well as of the Tatar language education. Under the policies of centralization and cultural unification Russia has pursued under the presidency of Vladimir Putin (2000 onwards), most of the political autonomy arrangements that Tatarstan achieved in the 1990s have been dismantled. The new restrictive ideological climate in Russia has repercussions for activism around ethnocultural questions, such as preservation of minority language and identity. At the same time, dissemination of transnational forms of cultural production and the advancement of digital technologies in Russia contribute to innovative cultural developments in the regions. Adapting these global formats and genres to the local cultural activities, the young members of the Tatar community develop new forms of ethnocultural activism. They produce alternative ways of representing and articulating ethnic identity, which depart sharply from the Soviet-born templates of representing ethnic culture. The urban activities these groups pursue allow for the de-politicization of ethnocultural activism in the conditions of an increasingly restrictive ideological and political climate in which minority activism is often equated with separatism.","[Suleymanova, Dilyara] Univ Zurich, Dept Social Anthropol & Cultural Studies, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Suleymanova, D (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Social Anthropol & Cultural Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",d.suleymanova@access.uzh.ch,,,,,,,53,11,12,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-2386,1466-4348,,CULT STUD,Cult.

The design highlights the dynamic relationships between Inuit people, seals and the land in the community of Panniqtuuq (or Pang for short), Nunavut, Canada. Seals become Inuit and Inuit become seal through hunting, eating, storytelling and art making. The t-shirt shows the idea of a shared seal-human life world, and highlights the idea that someone, not something, continually dies for the continuation of life (and ways of living). In pointing to a relational ecology that grounds Inuit ways of knowing, it simultaneously pushing back against the decades long ban and curtailment of trade on seal fur in Europe and the United States.Kevin O'Connor and duskin drum, two practicing performing artists and PhD students in performance studies at UC Davis write alongside Paulette Metuq, an Inuit graphic designer from Pang who created the final Wear Qisi image. In this essay, Wear Qisi, Become Seal they provide an ethnographic account of how the creative process involving the creation of the t-shirt design became an exploration into a set of complex questions concerning Inuit ways of life, especially in regards to human/seal co-relation. They place the Wear Qisi design alongside global warming discourse, and Inuit climate justice activist Shiela Watt-Cloutier's international diplomacy, to highlight the ways the global world is always already threaded through Inuit-seal wording. By tracing the effects of colonialism, including global organic pollutants that move through seals into Inuit bodies, and based on Inuit responses to climate change, the writers argue, that we, who are not Inuit, are all potentially seal, in seal, of seal, through and for seal. The Wear Qisi design counters colonial designs by entangling the global world into Inuit-seal relations.","[Drum, Duskin] Univ Tyumena, Sch Adv Studies, Tyumen, Tyumenskaya Obl, Russia",,"Drum, D (corresponding author), Univ Tyumena, Sch Adv Studies, Tyumen, Tyumenskaya Obl, Russia.",,,"drum, duskin/0000-0001-9184-8709",,,,,14,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1352-8165,1469-9990,,PERFORM RES,Perform.

For example, pigs generally locate themselves in the wet dunging area at high ambient temperatures in order to avoid heat stress, as wetting the body surface is the major path to dissipate the heat by evaporation. Thus, the portion of pigs in the dunging area and resting area, respectively, could be used as an indicator of failure of controlling the climate in the pig environment as pigs are not supposed to rest in the dunging area. The computer vision methodology utilizes a learning based segmentation approach using several features extracted from the image. The learning based approach applied is based on extended state-of-the-art features in combination with a structured prediction framework based on a logistic regression solver using elastic net regularization. In addition, the method is able to produce a probability per pixel rather than form a hard decision. This overcomes some of the limitations found in a setup using grey-scale information only. The pig pen is a difficult imaging environment because of challenging lighting conditions like shadows, poor lighting and poor contrast between pig and background. In order to test practical conditions, a pen containing nine young pigs was filmed from a top view perspective by an Axis M3006 camera with a resolution of 640 x 480 in three, 10-min sessions under different lighting conditions. The results indicate that a learning based method improves, in comparison with greyscale methods, the possibility to reliable identify proportions of pigs in different areas of the pen. Pigs with a changed behaviour (location) in the pen may indicate changed climate conditions. Changed individual behaviour may also indicate inferior health or acute illness.","[Nilsson, M.; Ardo, H.; Astrom, K.] Lund Univ, Ctr Math Sci, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Herlin, A.

Studies showed that deficiencies in simulating mid-latitude MCSs in state-of-the-art climate models can be alleviated by kilometer-scale models. However, whether these models can also improve tropical MCSs and whether we can find model settings that perform well in both regions is understudied. We take advantage of high-quality MCS observations collected over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facilities in the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) and the Amazon basin near Manaus (MAO) to evaluate a perturbed physics ensemble of simulated MCSs with 4 km horizontal grid spacing. A new model evaluation method is developed that enables to distinguish biases stemming from spatiotemporal displacements of MCSs from biases in their reflectivity and cloud shield. Amazon MCSs are similarly well simulated across these evaluation metrics than SGP MCSs despite the challenges anticipated from weaker large-scale forcing in the tropics. Generally, SGP MCSs are more sensitive to the choice of model microphysics, while Amazon cases are more sensitive to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. Although our tested model physics combinations had strengths and weaknesses, combinations that performed well for SGP simulations result in worse results in the Amazon basin and vice versa. However, we identified model settings that perform well at both locations, which include the Thompson and Morrison microphysics coupled with the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme and the Thompson scheme coupled with the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic PBL scheme.","[Prein, Andreas F.; Ge, Ming; Valle, Alexandra Ramos] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wang, Die; Giangrande, Scott E.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory,"Prein, AF (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",prein@ucar.edu,"Prein, Andreas/N-4928-2017","Prein, Andreas/0000-0001-6250-179X","US Department of Energy Atmospheric System Research, an Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research Program [DE-SC0020050]; U.S. DOE [DE-SC0012704]; National Science Foundation [1852977]; DOE Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","US Department of Energy Atmospheric System Research, an Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research Program; U.S. DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the US Department of Energy Atmospheric System Research, an Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research Program (Grant No. DE-SC0020050).S.

Here we quantify for the first time the potential use of ozone information for Northern Hemisphere seasonal forecasts, using observations and a nine-member chemistry climate model ensemble. The ensemble composite correlations between March total column ozone (TCO) and April surface temperatures display a similar structure to observations, but with slightly lower correlation magnitudes. This is likely due to the larger number of cases smoothing out sampling error in the pattern, which is visible in the difference between correlations calculated from individual ensemble members. Using a linear regression model with March TCO as the predictor, predictions of the following April surface temperatures in regions that show large correlations are possible up to 4 years following the regression model end date in individual ensemble members, and up to 6 years in observations. We create an empirical forecast model to predict the sign of the observed as well as the modeled surface temperature anomalies using March TCO. Through a leave-three-years-out cross-validation method, we show that March TCO can forecast the sign of the April surface temperature anomalies well in parts of Eurasia that show the lowest model internal variability. Plain Language Summary There are known linkages between springtime Arctic ozone in the upper atmosphere and Northern Hemisphere regional surface temperatures in the following months. Here, using both a state-of-the-art climate model and observations, we investigate whether these linkages can be useful for seasonal forecasting of regional surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Not only do we find good agreement between the model and the observations, using a predictive model, we show that March ozone can forecast the sign of the April surface temperature anomaly well in parts of Eurasia.","[Stone, Kane A.; Solomon, Susan] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kinnison, Douglas E.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Baggett, Cory F.; Barnes, Elizabeth A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Colorado State University,"Stone, KA (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",stonek@mit.edu,"Barnes, Elizabeth A/O-1790-2014","Barnes, Elizabeth A/0000-0003-4284-9320; Kinnison, Douglas/0000-0002-3418-0834","National Science Foundation [1419667, 1338814]; NOAA [NA16OAR4310064]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"K.

Accurate and timely forecasts of dengue incidence in China are still lacking. We aimed to use the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model of dengue. Methodology/Principal findings Weekly dengue cases, Baidu search queries and climate factors (mean temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) during 2011-2014 in Guangdong were gathered. A dengue search index was constructed for developing the predictive models in combination with climate factors. The observed year and week were also included in the models to control for the long-term trend and seasonality. Several machine learning algorithms, including the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm, step-down linear regression model, gradient boosted regression tree algorithm (GBM), negative binomial regression model (NBM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression model and generalized additive model (GAM), were used as candidate models to predict dengue incidence. Performance and goodness of fit of the models were assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and R-squared measures. The residuals of the models were examined using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function analyses to check the validity of the models. The models were further validated using dengue surveillance data from five other provinces. The epidemics during the last 12 weeks and the peak of the 2014 large outbreak were accurately forecasted by the SVR model selected by a cross-validation technique. Moreover, the SVR model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of dengue and forecasting the outbreaks in other areas in China. Conclusion and significance The proposed SVR model achieved a superior performance in comparison with other forecasting techniques assessed in this study. The findings can help the government and community respond early to dengue epidemics.","[Guo, Pi; Wang, Li; Zhang, Qingying; Luo, Ganfeng] Shantou Univ, Med Coll, Dept Prevent Med, Shantou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tao; Xiao, Jianpeng; Li, Zhihao; Ma, Wenjun] Guangdong Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangdong Prov Inst Publ Hlth, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qin] Shantou Univ, Med Coll, Canc Hosp, Good Clin Practice Off, Shantou, Peoples R China; [He, Jianfeng; Zhang, Yonghui] Guangdong Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shantou University; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Shantou University; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention,"Ma, WJ (corresponding author), Guangdong Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangdong Prov Inst Publ Hlth, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mawj@gdiph.org.cn,"马, 文军/GQQ-7852-2022; Xiao, Jian/GYU-4351-2022; Batista, Ewerthon/AAY-5409-2020; Li, Zhi-Hao/AAX-2941-2020; Li, Zhi-Hao/GVU-9321-2022; Xiao, Jianpeng/GRY-5231-2022","Li, Zhi-Hao/0000-0002-1597-2676; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81703323, 81773497]; Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Project Funding [2014A040401041]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Project Funding,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81703323 and 81773497).

Until recently, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) has been used as a soil erosion model on the field scale. Since then, more process-based soil erosion models have been developed such as the 'Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. This new technology represents the state-of-the-art in modeling the effects of changes in surface characteristics on soil erosion. In this study, the capability of the WEPP hillslope interface in version 2002.07 for simulating runoff and soil loss, applied to selected runoff plots, was tested in the Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico by comparing runoff and soil loss from live tree hedgerow terraces (TMV-TA 1.0 m) as an erosion control method with a conventional tillage (CT) practice. The breakpoint climate data generator (BPCDG) was used to generate the climate file. When compared to measured data, the CT WEPP estimated runoff and soil loss were low, whereas the TMV-TA 1.0 m WEPP estimated soil loss was high. For soil loss, the model over-predicts small events and under-predicts the larger ones. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies for predicting runoff and soil loss using an optimization method were 0.84 and 0.86 for the TMV-TA 1.0 m and 0.88 and 0.84 for the CT. The sensitivity analysis and calibration process show that the model is very sensitive in the effective hydraulic conductivity value and erodibility parameters. This study showed that in order to apply the WEPP model, revision of data collection system is necessary for studying the hydrologic and erosion soil processes with reliable estimates of soil erodibility parameters, effective hydraulic conductivity, and crop and managements parameters, in order to provide realistic estimates of runoff and soil loss.","Colegio Postgrad, Inst Recursos Nat, Programa Edafol, Montecillo 56230, Mexico; Colegio Postgrad, Inst Recursos Nat, Programa Hidrociencias, Montecillo 56230, Mexico; ARS, USDA, Natl Soil Eros Res Lab, W Lafayette, IN USA; INIFAP, San Andres Tuxtla, Veracruz, Mexico",Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico; Colegio de Postgraduados - Mexico; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Larose, M (corresponding author), Colegio Postgrad, Inst Recursos Nat, Programa Edafol, Montecillo 56230, Mexico.",,,,,,,,20,6,7,0,15,COLEGIO POSTGRADUADOS,MONTECILLO,"CARRETERA MEXICO TEXCOCO KM 36 5, MONTECILLO 56230, ESTADO MEXICO, MEXICO",1405-3195,,,AGROCIENCIA-MEXICO,Agrociencia,MAR-APR,2004,2,,,,155,163,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,828BI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000221947200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, a high tandem cell efficiency under the standard condition does not guarantee high power generation in outdoor environment due to the requirement of current matching in a tandem device. Here, we predict the global energy yields of hybrid perovskite/Si tandem and Si heterojunction single modules by establishing a new rigorous self-consistent model that performs full device simulations incorporating all fundamental time-varying parameters affecting the module power output. In particular, the temperature dependences of the optical and electrical characteristics are modeled explicitly and reliable model parameters are extracted from an industry-compatible Si heterojunction single cell (23.27% efficiency with a 120 mu m wafer thickness), whereas ideal cell characteristics are assumed for a hybrid perovskite top cell. Our simulation approach is justified from the remarkable agreement with experimental results. We find that the tandem architecture improves a module energy yield in all places by a maximum of 1.6 times, compared with a state-of-the-art Si heterojunction single module. Importantly, the annual energy yields of the tandem and single modules scale linearly with annual sun irradiation, even with the requirement of the current matching in the case of the tandem device, and the ratio of the tandem and single energy yields is governed essentially by the module efficiency ratio obtained under standard conditions. We have further revealed the climate-dependent energy yield variation with a magnitude of similar to 5% based on Koppen-Geiger climate classification. Moreover, the optimization of the top-cell band gap based on real meteorological data shows that the optimum top-cell gap needs to be increased at a place with a lower solar irradiation.","[Kato, Yoshitsune; Kobayashi, Tomoya; Kozawa, Masayuki; Nishigaki, Yukinori; Kinden, Yosuke; Oiwake, Kohei; Ishihara, Ryo; Fujiwara, Hiroyuki] Gifu Univ, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Katayama, Hirotaka; Aya, Youichirou; Hashiguchi, Taiki; Kanematsu, Daiji; Terakawa, Akira] Panasonic Corp, Energy Syst Div, Kaizuka, Japan; [Kobayashi, Tomonao] Gifu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Gifu, Japan; [Matsui, Taisuke] Panasonic Corp, Technol Innovat Div, Moriguchi, Osaka, Japan",Gifu University; Panasonic; Gifu University; Panasonic,"Fujiwara, H (corresponding author), Gifu Univ, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan.",fujiwara@gifu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,75,0,0,8,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1062-7995,1099-159X,,PROG PHOTOVOLTAICS,Prog.

NICHI is serving as a clearinghouse for research and advocacy, exploring the premise that the future protection of metropolitan New York from catastrophic extreme weather events and climate change necessitates a regional approach that transcends geographical and political boundaries. Using recent scientific, engineering, and economic evaluations, NICHI advocates the construction of moveable marine-based storm surge barriers at two strategic locations: between Sandy Hook and Far Rockaway (to arrest ocean surges) and across the upper East River (to block surges from Long Island Sound). The navigation gates would normally be open to shipping traffic, but activated only when a significant storm surge threat is forecast. Such a system could have a useful working life of at least 100 years, when sea level may have risen by similar to 2 m; at that time, a planned retreat inland may be necessary. NICHI is working to develop a consensus among elected officials, agency personnel, advisory groups, policy makers, and stakeholders on risk reduction and mitigation measures; disseminate information on the risks of climate change and extreme storm events to the public and governmental officials. NICHI seeks to provide agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers and supporting state and city agencies creative ideas and information necessary for the evaluation of risk reduction, cost/benefits, design, construction, and operational costs necessary to fully develop a long-term regional plan to protect Metropolitan New York as a world center of finance, business, transportation, communication, medicine, and the arts.","[Bowman, Malcolm J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Yaro, Robert] Univ Penn, Sch Design, Meyerson Hall,210 Sth 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Golden, William B.] Natl Inst Coastal & Harbor Infrastruct, Princeton, NJ USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Pennsylvania,"Bowman, MJ (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",malcolm.bowman@stonybrook.edu; yaro@design.upenn.edu; lightship612@aol.com,,,,,,,12,2,2,1,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-0-7844-8120-2,,,,2017,,,,,336,347,,,,,,12,"Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Civil; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BJ7JX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000427389600032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simulated data was used to demonstrate that the relationship between proxy values and the climatic data are adversely affected by falling correlation, to the point where, in a training set consisting of 100 pairs of temperature and tree-ring proxies, the mean 95% confidence interval width for the reconstructed temperature exceeds the total range of temperatures in the training set at or below r = 0.65. This correlation is typical of that used in many climate-proxy reconstructions, and it suggests that understanding of past climate variability may be somewhat constrained. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We present the Joint Research Centre Two-stream Inversion Package (JRC-TIP) for retrieval of variables characterising the state of the vegetation-soil system. The system provides a set of land surface variables that satisfy all requirements for assimilation into the land component of climate and numerical weather prediction models. Being based on a 1-D representation of the radiative transfer within the canopy-soil system, such as those used in the land surface components of advanced global models, the JRC-TIP products are not only physically consistent internally, but they also achieve a high degree of consistency with these global models. Furthermore, the products are provided with full uncertainty information. We describe how these uncertainties are derived in a fully traceable manner without any hidden assumptions from the input observations, which are typically broadband white sky albedo products. Our discussion of the product uncertainty ranges, including the uncertainty reduction, highlights the central role of the leaf area index, which describes the density of the canopy. We explain the generation of products aggregated to coarser spatial resolution than that of the native albedo input and describe various approaches to the validation of JRC-TIP products, including the comparison against in situ observations. We present a JRC-TIP processing system that satisfies all operational requirements and explain how it delivers stable climate data records. Since many aspects of JRC-TIP are generic, the package can serve as an example of a state-of-the-art system for retrieval of EO products, and this contribution can help the user to understand advantages and limitations of such products.","[Kaminski, Thomas; Vossbeck, Michael] Invers Lab, Tewessteg 4, D-20249 Hamburg, Germany; [Pinty, Bernard; Gobron, Nadine; Robustelli, Monica] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Sustainable Resources, Knowledge Sustainable Dev & Food Secur Unit, TP440 Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Lopatka, Maciej] European Commiss, Res Execut Agcy, Future & Emerging Technol, FET Open COV2 17-120,16 Pl Rogier, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Kaminski, T (corresponding author), Invers Lab, Tewessteg 4, D-20249 Hamburg, Germany.",thomas.kaminski@inversion-lab.com,,,International Space Science Institute (ISSI); ESA GHG-CCI project,International Space Science Institute (ISSI); ESA GHG-CCI project,We acknowledge the support from the International Space Science Institute (ISSI).

It was signed in 2019 by all of the member countries of the Union, seeks to reverse the climate change trend by establishing a series of goals for improving environmental and economic quality for 2030 and 2050 and also aims to enact social justice in rural areas and in the urban environment. Landscape architecture, which is the art of combining the physical and immaterial elements in cities' open spaces, is taken in this work as the method of interpreting the existing environment. The description, together with the narrative analysis of five selected site-specific urban renovations projects carried out in the last 15 years by some of the main contemporary landscape architects, such as Micheal Desvigne, Peter Latz and Gilles Clement, demonstrates, by means of their empirical experiences, the benefits of the landscape design. It is able to match both the ecological need expressed in the Deal and to respond to the ambition of an open and rightful city, as called for by the theories of Sennet and Balmori. In order to reach the just transition and to leave no one behind, and to meet and to implement the Green Deal objectives, the new, positive and long-lasting explained transformations require the consideration of landscape design, in all its material and immaterial components, as a theoretical synthesis capable of obtaining a practical application in fighting climate change, and it should be considered and included in city management policies and in the Deal, too.","[Olivetti, Maria Livia] Univ Palermo, Dept Architecture, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Olivetti, ML (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Architecture, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",marialivia.olivetti@unipa.it,,"Olivetti, Maria Livia/0000-0002-1677-556X",,,,,20,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,,,,,,8751,10.3390/su14148751,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14148751,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3H3TE,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000831960400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, accurate predictions of the boundaries can contribute to improve the accuracy of global climate analysis and sea level prediction. However, an accurate boundary detection in radar sounder data collected from the polar ice sheet has still been a challenge because the boundaries of the ice layer are usually very weak and noisy, and subglacial topography is highly variable. In recent years, the deep learning methods have surpassed the performances of traditional technology and helped to overcome a series of problems, including image boundary segmentation and target detection. This paper proposes a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) for boundary detection of ice sheet radar echograms, where the ground truth supervises the output of the network at different stages, rather than the output of the last layer of the network. Also, a multi-scale convolution module (MCM) is introduced to learn the rich multi-scale representation of each network stage from shallow to deep, which uses convolution with different dilation rates to obtain multi-scale features. Furthermore, an improved loss function makes the proposed MFFN more effective to solve the sample imbalance problem of boundary detection, and further improves the accuracy of boundary detection. The proposed method is verified experimentally using the radar echograms from 2009 provided by the Center of Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) that are used as training and test data. In the experiments, the proposed MFFN not only achieves state-of-the-art boundary detection accuracy on the test set but also improves the visual effect by generating fine boundaries.","[Cai, Yiheng; Wan, Fuxing; Hu, Shaobin; Lang, Shinan] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology,"Lang, SN (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.",langshinan803@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41776186]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1703302],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41776186, and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (NO. 2017YFC1703302).",,23,0,0,11,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-669X,1573-7497,,APPL INTELL,Appl.

As cities expand, so do the food needs of urban populations, especially families. The urbanization process in many developing countries goes hand-in-hand with increasing urban poverty and growing food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for the urban poor. Changes in climate add to the challenges faced by cities and the urban poor. Many cities are at risk of becoming disaster traps, either through the direct effects of floods, hurricanes, or rising sea levels, or through severe food supply problems due to droughts, hailstorms or frosts that affect agricultural production in their hinterlands - and thus the urban food markets. These are urgent and pressing challenges demanding an equally urgent and adequate response from city and national authorities as well as international support organizations. Urban policies, planning and design must incorporate food security considerations and focus on building cities that are more resilient to crises. Urban and periurban agriculture will have to feature prominently in urban food security, economic development, land use and climate change strategies and action plans. Several countries and local governments have already taken such initiatives, but in many other countries and cities, new initiatives are needed. This paper will provide a state-of-the-art overview of current national and local policies and experiences in integrating urban and peri-urban agriculture in policy making, planning and design.

INTEX-B was performed in two phases. In its first phase (1-21 March), INTEX-B operated as part of the MILAGRO campaign with a focus on observations over Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. In the second phase (17 April-15 May), the main INTEX-B focus was on trans-Pacific Asian pollution transport. Multiple airborne platforms carrying state of the art chemistry and radiation payloads were flown in concert with satellites and ground stations during the two phases of INTEX-B. Validation of Aura satellite instruments (TES, OMI, MLS, HIRDLS) was a key objective within INTEX-B. Satellite products along with meteorological and 3-D chemical transport model forecasts were integrated into the flight planning process to allow targeted sampling of air parcels. Inter-comparisons were performed among and between aircraft payloads to quantify the accuracy of data and to create a unified data set. Pollution plumes were sampled over the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific several days after downwind transport from source regions. Signatures of Asian pollution were routinely detected by INTEX-B aircraft, providing a valuable data set on gas and aerosol composition to test models and evaluate pathways of pollution transport and their impact on air quality and climate.

It is a transdisciplinary speculative entry, part empirical, part analytical, part applied phenomenology. We write this as a collaboration between two members of the Harmattan Theater company, a New York City based environmental performance ensemble applying environmental theory to site-specific performances engaging oceans and islands. The article is driven by the following research questions: What are the historic relationalities between the Venice lagoon and the Indian Ocean? How has the acqua alto flooding of Venice, accompanied by the mnemonic histories of the Venetian lagoon, impacted understandings of lagoon cultures in the global South, particularly the Malabar Coast of South Asia? This question has propelled the artistic and academic research of May Joseph and Sofia Varino across environmental history, island studies and performance. Drawing on histories of Venetian navigation and lagoon culture, Joseph and Varino propose a comparative lagoon aesthetics, one that would link two archipelagic regions, the Venetian Lagoon and the extended archipelagic region of the Laccadive Sea of India. While we believe a contemporary archipelagic study connecting these two regions does not currently exist, the historical archives suggest otherwise. We draw on the Venetian Camaldolese monk and cartographer Fra Mauro's Mappa Mundi from the 15th Century to initiate this comparative dialogue between North/Southisland ecologies, seafaring histories and ocean futures affected by climate change and rising sea levels. This research is part of a book that Joseph and Varino are co-writing on islands, archipelagos, coastal regions and climate change, drawing on a ten-year collaboration working with large-scale site-specific environmental performance as research, activism and embodied phenomenology.","[Joseph, May] Pratt Inst, Brooklyn, NY 11205 USA; [Varino, Sofia] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",University of Potsdam,"Joseph, M (corresponding author), Pratt Inst, Brooklyn, NY 11205 USA.",mjoseph@pratt.edu; varino.sofia@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,2,2,2,2,"MACQUARIE UNIV, DIV HUMANITIES",SYDNEY,"MACQUARIE UNIV, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA",1834-6049,1834-6057,,SHIMA,Shima,,2021,1,,,,256,272,,10.21463/shima.118,http://dx.doi.org/10.21463/shima.118,,,17,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,RN1ZH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000640151600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Indeed, the use of water has been intensified in urban buildings because of the proliferation of HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning) systems, for instance cooling towers, where an abundant amount of water is lost during the evaporation process. The measurement of the evaporation is challenging, so a virtual sensor could be used to tackle it, allowing to monitor and manage the water consumption in different scenarios and helping to plan efficient operation strategies which reduce the use of fresh water. In this paper, a deep generative approach is proposed for developing a virtual sensor for probabilistic estimation of the evaporation in cooling towers, given the surrounding conditions. It is based on a conditioned generative adversarial network (cGAN), whose generator includes a recurrent layer (GRU) that models the temporal information by learning from previous states and a densely connected layer that models the fluctuations of the conditions. The proposed deep generative approach is not only able to yield the estimated evaporation value but it also produces a whole probability distribution, considering any operating scenario, so it is possible to know the confidence interval in which the estimation is likely found. This deep generative approach is assessed and compared with other probabilistic state-of-the-art methods according to several metrics (CRPS, MAPE and RMSE) and using real data from a cooling tower located at a hospital building. The results obtained show that, to the best of our knowledge, our proposal is a noteworthy method to develop a virtual sensor, taking as input the current and last samples, since it provides an accurate estimation of the evaporation with wide enough confidence intervals, contemplating potential fluctuations of the conditions.","[Alonso, Serafin; Moran, Antonio; Perez, Daniel; Prada, Miguel A.; Fuertes, Juan J.; Dominguez, Manuel] Univ Leon, Esc Ingn Ind Informat & Aerosp, Grp Invest Supervis Control & Automatizac Proc In, Campus Vegazana S-N, Leon 24007, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Alonso, S (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Esc Ingn Ind Informat & Aerosp, Grp Invest Supervis Control & Automatizac Proc In, Campus Vegazana S-N, Leon 24007, Spain.",saloc@unileon.es,"Gonzalez, Manuel Dominguez/L-3105-2014; Prada, Miguel A./K-7837-2014","Gonzalez, Manuel Dominguez/0000-0002-3921-1599; Prada, Miguel A./0000-0002-1563-1556",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; European Regional Development Fund [DPI2015-69891-C21-R/2-R]; Universidad de Leon,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Universidad de Leon",This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and the European Regional Development Fund under project DPI2015-69891-C21-R/2-R and the Universidad de Leon.,,58,0,0,3,6,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1069-2509,1875-8835,,INTEGR COMPUT-AID E,Integr.

The response of the middle atmosphere to the 11 year solar cycle, its impact on the troposphere, and especially the role of an externally prescribed stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is investigated with NCAR's Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM3). The model experiments use either fixed solar cycle inputs or fixed solar cycle together with prescribed QBO phase. The annual mean solar response in temperature and ozone in the upper stratosphere is in qualitative agreement with other modeling and observational studies and does not depend on the presence of the imposed QBO. However, the solar response in the middle to lower stratosphere differs significantly for the two QBO phases. During solar maxima a weaker Brewer-Dobson circulation with relative downwelling, warming, and enhanced ozone occurs in the tropical lower stratosphere during QBO east conditions, while a stronger circulation, cooling, and decreased ozone exists during QBO west conditions. The net ozone increase during QBO east is the combined result of production and advection, whereas during QBO west the effects cancel each other and result in little net ozone changes. Especially during Southern Hemisphere late winter to early spring, the solar response at polar latitudes switches sign between the two QBO phases and qualitatively confirms observations and other recent model studies. During a poleward downward modulation of the polar night jet and a corresponding modulation of the Brewer-Dobson circulation in time, solar signals are detected all the way down to the extratropical troposphere. Possible limitations of the model experiments with respect to the fixed solar cycle conditions or the prescribed QBO phases, as well as the constant sea surface temperatures, are discussed.","[Matthes, Katja] Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Marsh, Daniel R.; Garcia, Rolando R.; Kinnison, Douglas E.; Walters, Stacy] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Sassi, Fabrizio] USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Matthes, Katja] Free Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research Laboratory; Free University of Berlin,"Matthes, K (corresponding author), Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",matthes@gfz-potsdam.de,"Matthes, Katja/F-7361-2014; Marsh, Daniel/A-8406-2008","Matthes, Katja/0000-0003-1801-3072; Marsh, Daniel/0000-0001-6699-494X; Sassi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-9492-7434",Freie Universitat Berlin; National Science Foundation; European Community,Freie Universitat Berlin; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Community(European Commission),"This paper is dedicated to the memory of Byron Boville, who initiated the development of WACCM.

Operational models, including HARMONIE-AROME run at the Spanish Meteorological Agency, missed this event and thus no relevant warnings were issued to take preventive actions. Satellite, radar and conventional observations indicate the presence of convective activity along a convergence line, forming during the morning east of Menorca and moving westwards. This convective line is identified as a key factor for the initiation of the moist deep convection responsible for the extreme rain rates associated to this episode. Indeed, the failure of operational numerical models in predicting the flash flood is most likely attributable to their inability to properly simulate the convergence line and the associated convection. To further understand the predictability of this case, we assess multiple different high-resolution ensemble generation strategies, including data assimilation. Results show that among all, only configurations that assimilate reflectivities have the potential to predict significant precipitation amounts over useful lead times in Sant Llorenc basin. In any case, simulated precipitation values are underestimated, and we prove that the predictability of the responsible moist convective systems drops off near the 3-4 h lead times. Numerical predictability challenges of this episode and limitations of the EnKF in these situations are discussed in detail. Overall, the study shows that accurate prediction of this episode is beyond the current prediction capabilities of state-of-the art numerical models and data assimilation techniques.","[Carrio, D.

The use of outdoor spaces is highly dependent on climatic conditions. Thermally uncomfortable outdoor spaces may discourage participation in outdoor activities and increase indoor energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and adopt thermal adaptive strategies to provide appropriate thermal conditions for urban residents. A number of studies that review the literature on different thermal adaptive strategies exist. However, the existing reviews lack comprehensiveness, often present results which are mixed with simulation and field studies, recommended strategies suitable for certain climate conditions or are not properly structured. Therefore, this study intends to present a critical analysis on the thermal adaptive strategies that are advisable for outdoor spaces. This review is structured around the Adaptation to Outdoor Climate (AOC) model containing three clusters of adaptive strategies: (a) environmental and technological modifications, (b) behavioural adjustments and (c) psychological adaptation. Reviewing mostly recent studies, this paper aims to shed light on the cutting-edge knowledge on improving outdoor thermal comfort conditions.","[Shooshtarian, Salman; Rajagopalan, Priyadarsini] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Rajagopalan, Priyadarsini] RMIT Univ, SBi Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sagoo, Amrit] Coventry Univ, Dept Civil Engn Architecture & Built Environm, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Coventry University,"Shooshtarian, S (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",salman.shooshtarian@rmit.edu.au,"Shooshtarian, Salman/B-5709-2016","Shooshtarian, Salman/0000-0002-6991-8931; Rajagopalan, Priyadarsini/0000-0001-7445-0985",,,,,220,42,42,17,86,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

One possibility to counteract that is microbial production of butanol, a promising new fuel and alternative to many petrochemical reagents. However, the high butanol toxicity to all known microbial species is the main obstacle to its industrial implementation. The present state of the art review aims to expound the recent advances in modern omics approaches to resolving this insurmountable to date problem of low butanol tolerance. Genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics show that butanol tolerance is a complex phenomenon affecting multiple genes and their expression. Efflux pumps, stress and multidrug response, membrane transport, and redox-related genes are indicated as being most important during butanol challenge, in addition to finetuning of global regulators of transcription (SpoOA, GntR), which may further improve tolerance. Lipidomics shows that the alterations in membrane composition (saturated lipids and plasmalogen increase) are very much species-specific and butanol-related. Glycomics discloses the pleiotropic effect of CcpA, the role of alternative sugar transport, and the production of exopolysaccharides as alternative routes to overcoming butanol stress. Unfortunately, the strain that simultaneously syntheses and tolerates butanol in concentrations that allow its commercialization has not yet been discovered or produced. Omics insight will allow the purposeful increase of butanol tolerance in natural and engineered producers and the effective heterologous expression of synthetic butanol pathways in strains hereditary butanol-resistant up to 3.2 - 4.9% (w/v). Future breakthrough can be achieved by a detailed study of the membrane proteome, of which 21% are proteins with unknown functions.","[Arsov, Alexander; Petrova, Penka] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Acad G Bontchev Str,Bl 26, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Petrov, Kaloyan] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Chem Engn, Acad G Bontchev Str,Bl 103, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Medical University Sofia; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; University of Chemical Technology & Metallurgy - Bulgaria,"Petrova, P (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Acad G Bontchev Str,Bl 26, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.;Petrov, K (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Chem Engn, Acad G Bontchev Str,Bl 103, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",kaloian04@yahoo.com; pepipetrova@yahoo.com,"Arsov, Alexander/AGY-6817-2022","Arsov, Alexander/0000-0003-4733-9530","Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science; Healthy Foods for a Strong Bio-Economy and Quality of Life National Research Programme [577/17.08.2018, KP-06-COST7]; COST Action [18101]",Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science; Healthy Foods for a Strong Bio-Economy and Quality of Life National Research Programme; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),This work was funded by the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science with the financial support by the Healthy Foods for a Strong Bio-Economy and Quality of Life National Research Programme approved by DCM #577/17.08.2018 and Contract KP-06-COST7 with national co-financing to COST Action 18101.,,245,8,8,7,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0734-9750,1873-1899,,BIOTECHNOL ADV,Biotechnol.

As a result, renewable energy sources (RESs) are used for power generation where battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are widely used to store electrical energy for backup, match power consumption and generation during peak hours, and promote energy efficiency in a pollution-free environment. Accurate battery state of health (SOH) prediction is critical because it plays a key role in ensuring battery safety, lowering maintenance costs, and reducing BESS inconsistencies. The precise power consumption forecasting is critical for preventing power shortage and oversupply, and the complicated physicochemical features of batteries dilapidation cannot be directly acquired. Therefore, in this paper, a novel hybrid architecture called 'CL-Net' based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed for multi-step SOH and power consumption forecasting. First, battery SOH and power consumption-related raw data are collected and passed through a preprocessing step for data cleansing. Second, the processed data are fed into ConvLSTM layers, which extract spatiotemporal features and form their encoded maps. Third, LSTM layers are used to decode the encoded features and pass them to fully connected layers for final multi-step forecasting. Finally, a comprehensive ablation study is conducted on several combinations of sequential learning models using three different time series datasets, i.e., national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) battery, individual household electric power consumption (IHEPC), and domestic energy management system (DEMS). The proposed CL-Net architecture reduces root mean squared error (RMSE) up to 0.13 and 0.0052 on the NASA battery and IHEPC datasets, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-arts. These experimental results show that the proposed architecture can provide robust and accurate SOH and power consumption forecasting compared to the state-of-the-art.","[Khan, Noman; Haq, Ijaz Ul; Ullah, Fath U.

The focus is on transmediation of narratives and truthfulness. Specifically, the discussions centre around narratives of human actions changing the environment on a global scale. Such narratives are vital to scrutinize because they concern the conditions of future human existence. To make the discussions truly relevant, the complex issue of truthfulness in communication is also included. Different media types can be, and are often expected to be, truthful in different ways, and because of media differences it may well be the case that narratives and their truthfulness are corrupted in transmediation. Whereas communication in general has many widely different purposes, its function is sometimes essentially to get things right - to represent certain things truthfully. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the capacities of different media types to narrate truthfully. The paper starts with explications of some of the core concepts of the investigation - transmediation, narration and truthfulness - and continues with a discussion of general media differences between scientific articles and feature films. This is followed by a brief analysis of a scientific article (The 'Anthropocene', published by Paul J. Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer in 2000), a somewhat longer examination of the transmediation of this article to a feature film (The Day after Tomorrow, directed by Roland Emmerich and released in 2004) and a conclusion.","[Ellestrom, Lars] Linnaeus Univ, Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University,"Ellestrom, L (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Vaxjo, Sweden.",lars.ellestrom@lnu.se,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,4,"BABES-BOLYAI UNIV, FAC THEATRE & TELEVISION",CLUJ-NAPOCA,"STR  MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU, NR 1, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400084, ROMANIA",2067-631X,2559-2068,,EKPRASIS,Ekprasis,,2020,2,,,,36,48,,10.24193/ekphrasis.24.3,http://dx.doi.org/10.24193/ekphrasis.24.3,,,13,"Film, Radio, Television",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Film, Radio & Television",PG7RI,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000599927900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the important characteristics of the sea surface is the front-back asymmetry of wind-wave crests. The wind-wave conditions on the surface of the sea constitute a sea state, which is listed as an essential climate variable by the Global Climate Observing System and is considered a critical factor for structural safety and optimal operations of offshore oil and gas platforms. Methods such as statistical representations of sensor-based wave parameters observations and numerical modeling are used to classify sea states. However, for offshore structures such as oil and gas platforms, these methods induce high capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX), along with extensive computational power and time requirements. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel, low-cost deep learning-based sea state classification model using visual-range sea images. Firstly, a novel visual-range sea state image dataset was designed and developed for this purpose. The dataset consists of 100,800 images covering four sea states. The dataset was then benchmarked on state-of-the-art deep learning image classification models. The highest classification accuracy of 81.8% was yielded by NASNet-Mobile. Secondly, a novel sea state classification model was proposed. The model took design inspiration from GoogLeNet, which was identified as the optimal reference model for sea state classification. Systematic changes in GoogLeNet's inception block were proposed, which resulted in an 8.5% overall classification accuracy improvement in comparison with NASNet-Mobile and a 7% improvement from the reference model (i.e., GoogLeNet). Additionally, the proposed model took 26% less training time, and its per-image classification time remains competitive.","[Umair, Muhammad; Hashmani, Manzoor Ahmed; Memon, Mehak Maqbool] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Umair, Muhammad; Hashmani, Manzoor Ahmed; Memon, Mehak Maqbool] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, High Performance Cloud Comp Ctr, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Rizvi, Syed Sajjad Hussain] Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi 75600, Pakistan; [Taib, Hasmi; Abdullah, Mohd Nasir] PETRONAS, Grp Tech Solut, Kuala Lumpur 50450, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science & Technology; Petronas,"Umair, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.;Umair, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, High Performance Cloud Comp Ctr, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",m-umair@outlook.com; manzoor.hashmani@utp.edu.my; dr.sajjad@szabist.edu.pk; hasmi@petronas.com; mnasir_abdullah@petronas.com; mehak_19001057@utp.edu.my,,"Hashmani, Manzoor/0000-0002-6617-8149","Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS-Fundamental Research Grant [YUTP-FRG-2019, 015LC0-158]",Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS-Fundamental Research Grant,"This research was funded by Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS-Fundamental Research Grant (YUTP-FRG-2019, grant number 015LC0-158).",,51,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-8994,,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,JUL,2022,7,,,,,,1487,10.3390/sym14071487,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym14071487,,,31,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3H6BA,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000832118300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three state-of-the-art cooling load prediction algorithms are - multiple-linear regression (MLR) model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model and Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMB-NN) model. The Pearson correlation analysis is practiced calculating the correlation between actual cooling load demand and input feature variables of climate parameters. The impact of climate variability on the building load requirement is also analyzed. Forecasting intervals are divided into two basic parts: (i) 7-day ahead prediction; and (ii) 1-month ahead prediction. To assess the prediction performance, four performance evaluation indices are applied, which are: (i) coefficient of correlation (R); (ii) mean absolute error (MAE); (iii) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); and (iv) coefficient of variation (CV). The model's performance is compared with the selection of different hidden neurons at different load conditions. The MAPE for 7-day ahead prediction interval by MLR, GPR and LMB-NN model is 13.053%, 0.405% and 2.592%, respectively. Furthermore, the data-mining algorithms are compared and validated with the previous study, and the MAPE of Bayesian regularization neural networks is calculated 2.515% for 7-day ahead prediction. It was witnessed that the algorithms could be applied to facilitate the building cooling load prediction, by applying a relatively limited number of parameters related to energy usage as well as environmental impact in the building environment. The forecasting results show that the three algorithms are effective in predicting the irregular behavior in the data as well as cooling load demand prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

The new LEED (R) rating system, GBC Historic Building (TM) protocol, proposed by Green Building Council Italy and addressed to Italian historical heritage, was applied to the High School A. Canova in Treviso, chosen because it was built before 1945 and it required a restoration work. The aim of this paper is to present a retrofit design based on strategies according to three objectives: energy saving, preservation of historical architecture, improvement of indoor environmental quality for users. The application of GBC Historic Building (TM) protocol has been carried out according to the protocol guidebook. The novelty of this paper is that GBC Historic Building' has been used as a design tool, not as assessment tool, in order to develop a design strategy. At first a building survey of the building has been performed to define the state of art in terms of structural instability and deterioration of surfaces and architectural elements in order to propose the most important renovation measures; the dynamic simulation was performed to calculate the building envelope thermal losses and the building energy demand for heating. Different energy efficiency measures have been proposed and an optimal solution has been defined according to simulation data and cost analysis evaluation. Three main goals have been achieved: the reduction of building energy consumptions up to 39 %, the conservation of the historical parts of the building and the attainment of good thermal comfort in school classrooms. A Silver LEED level of certification has been gained. (C) 2017 The Authors.

To test this assumption, low-frequency North Pacific variability was examined using a state-of-the-art coupled general circulation model (CGCM). Earlier studies had shown that slowly varying dynamical modes in a CGCM can be effectively isolated using the breeding technique. In this study, the breeding method was applied to the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) anomaly coupled GCM ( ACGCM), and it was found that several types of slow modes can be isolated depending on the parameters of the breeding cycle. Tropical bred vector SST and upper-ocean heat content are dominated by the ENSO, which is consistent with the results obtained earlier using other CGCMs. Extratropical bred vector upper-ocean heat content is dominated by oceanic instability localized east of Japan, varying on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, and decadal modes with the large-scale pattern over the central and eastern extratropical North Pacific. Similar to ocean basin modes, the decadal modes have a signature of westward-propagating long baroclinic Rossby waves, but do not exhibit the global imprint typical for global basin modes. The relationship between the decadal bred vectors and the background anomalies is consistent with linear damped dynamics. Presumably, the growth of the decadal bred vectors is due to the atmospheric stochastic forcing, but the existence of extratropical instability on decadal time scales still needs to be verified.","Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; George Mason Univ, Calverton, MD USA",George Mason University,"Vikhliaev, Y (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",yuri@cola.iges.org,"Vikhliaev, Yury/H-2315-2012",,,,,,26,14,15,0,1,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Extreme weather events, such as floods, rising sea levels, and storms, stand as characteristic examples that impair the core services of the global ecosystem. Especially floods have a severe impact on human activities, hence, early and accurate delineation of the disaster is of top priority since it provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits and eases relief efforts. In this article, we introduce OmbriaNet, a deep neural network architecture, based on convolutional neural networks, that detects changes between permanent and flooded water areas by exploiting the temporal differences among flood events extracted by different sensors. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, we generated OMBRIA, a bitemporal and multimodal satellite imagery dataset for image segmentation through supervised binary classification. It consists of a total number of 3.376 images, synthetic aperture radar imagery from Sentinel-1, and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, accompanied with ground-truth binary images produced from data derived by experts and provided from the Emergency Management Service of the European Space Agency Copernicus Program. The dataset covers 23 flood events around the globe, from 2017 to 2021. We collected, co-registrated and preprocessed the data in Google Earth Engine. To validate the performance of our method, we performed different benchmarking experiments on the OMBRIA dataset and we compared with several competitive state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental analysis demonstrated that the proposed formulation is able to produce high-quality flood maps, achieving a superior performance over the state-of-the-art.

We also highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of different estimation approaches. A comparability analysis of existing studies shows a clearly higher level of stocks per capita and per area in developed countries and cities, confirming the role of urbanization and industrialization in built environment stock growth. However, more spatially refined case studies (e.g., on developing cities and nonresidential buildings) and standardization and improvement of methodology (e.g., with geographic information system and architectural knowledge) and data (e.g., on material intensity and lifetime) would be urgently needed to reveal more robust conclusions on the patterns, drivers, and implications of built environment stocks.

The transformation of a greenhouse gas like CO2 into energy sources, i.e., CO, CH3OH, CH4, etc. is a promising strategy to alleviate the interlinked issues of environmental pollution, global warming and climate change. This article presents an overview of the fundamentals of photocatalytic systems and the latest developments in CO2 chemical reduction towards solar fuels over titanium dioxide (TiO2). The basic principle of photocatalysis states new photocatalyst synthesis and how the current materials can be used to improve the existing catalysts, focusing on the surface area, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability of TiO2. In the study of the state of the art it was observed that at a lower CH4/CO2 ratio, more H2 was produced, while a higher feed ratio promoted CO production. The maximum production rate reported for CH4 was 0.64 mmol g(-1)h(-1), for CO was 158 mmol/h/g(cat), and 102 mmol h(-1)Kg(cat )(_1) . Detailed insights for enhanced performance, especially factors affecting mass transfer, thermodynamics, selectivity, and reaction mechanism are provided and discussed. This review summarizes and analyzes research work on the photoreduction of CO(2 )in the presence of TiO2 over the past ten years. State of the art in photocatalytic CO2 chemical reduction over TiO2 emphasizes material design and reactor configurations. One section is dedicated to reactor design optimization and studying the synergic effect in photocatalysis. Also, brief perspectives and the main challenges in photocatalytic CO2 reduction are outlined, which are vital for improving the con-version efficiency of CO2. The use of solar energy to drive CO2 photocatalytic reactions and the recent progress in this area are also explored and discussed.","[Belinda Dominguez-Espindola, Ruth; Maria Arias, Dulce; Sebastian, P.

The results show that the hot-spots for the ML risk concentrate in the coastal regions, and are mainly conditioned by the biodiversity in the region.

From 1 January 1816 to 25 January 1839, Esmark at his house in Ovre Voldgate in the morning, early afternoon and late evening recorded air temperature with state-of-the-art thermometers. He also noted air pressure, cloud cover, precipitation and wind directions, and experimented with rain gauges and hygrometers. From 1818 to the end of 1838 he twice a month provided weather tables to the official newspaper Den Norske Rigstidende, and thus acquired a semi-official status as the first Norwegian state meteorologist. This paper evaluates the quality of Esmark's temperature observations and presents new metadata, new homogenization and analysis of monthly means. Three significant shifts in the measurement series were detected, and suitable corrections are proposed.

The in-depth analysis of geothermal resources in China, including their distribution and breakdown by shallow, hydrothermal, and hot dry rock (HDR) resources, is made in this study. Using the recent economic reports and state-of-the-art technological solutions, this survey outlines the latest trends in the geothermal power generation in China. The application of geothermal power generation in China is still at an early stage, with the total installed capacity of 27.78 MW. The geothermal power generation technologies, such as dry steam technology, flash technology, binary cycle technology, and enhanced geothermal system (EGS), are briefly discussed and linked to their lucrative implementation sites. In particular, Tibet's Yangbajing is considered to be the most lucrative site for the EGS pilot project. The comparative analysis of low-cost/large-scale geothermal power generation technologies, such as low- to medium-temperature one, solar-geothermal hybrid one, and geothermal power generation in mines, was made, whose results strongly indicated the EGS technical and economical advantages. The concentration of 96% of China's population in the area to the east of Hu line affects the perspectives of high-cost geothermal projects and has to be accounted in the comprehensive analysis of available data. Based on the revealed trends of geothermal resources' development in China, the following guidelines are strongly recommended: comprehensive incorporation of geothermal energy generation into China's national energy and climate improvement plans, the rapid implementation of HDR technology, as well as comprehensive adaptation of the geothermal-related projects to the local conditions/biased distribution of power consumers and state-of-the-art challenges of power consumption.","[Zhang, Lei; Chen, Shuai] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Mines, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Deep Coal Resource Min, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Cun] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Resource & Safety Engn, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Safe Min, Beijing, Peoples R China","China University of Mining & Technology; Ministry of Education, China; China University of Mining & Technology","Chen, S (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Mines, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Deep Coal Resource Min, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",cscumt@cumt.edu.cn,"Zhang, Cun/GYV-0970-2022; chen, shuai/AAG-1536-2019; Chen, Shuai/GRF-1012-2022","chen, shuai/0000-0002-2676-125X; Chen, Shuai/0000-0002-2676-125X; Zhang, Cun/0000-0001-8673-3077",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017CXNL01]; Priority Academic Programme Development of Higher Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Priority Academic Programme Development of Higher Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2017CXNL01; Priority Academic Programme Development of Higher Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province",,98,23,23,34,102,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2050-0505,,,ENERGY SCI ENG,Energy Sci.

This study presents a state-of-the-art estimate of the heating components and their total over the TP, with the aid of high-accuracy experimental data, an updated land surface model, and carefully selected satellite data. The new estimate differs from previous estimates in three aspects: 1) different seasonality-the new estimation shows the maximum total heat source occurs in July (the mature period of the monsoon), rather than in the previously reported month of May or June (around the onset of the monsoon), because previous studies greatly overestimated radiative cooling during the monsoon season [June August (JJA)]; 2) different regional pattern-the eastern TP exhibits stronger heating than the western TP in summer, whereas previous studies gave either an opposite spatial pattern because of overestimated sensible heat flux over the western TP or an overall weaker heat source because of overestimated radiative cooling; and 3) different trend-sensible heat, radiative convergence, and the total heat source have decreased since the 1980s, but their weakening trends were overestimated in a recent study.

J,"Musa, TR",,,,"Musa, Tea Rogic",,,How to read Tadeusz Peiper today?,KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA,,,Croatian,Article,,,,,,,,"In Poland in the early 1920s a fierce debate about the aims of socially committed literature took place. Since crucial aspect of the literary agenda of the Krakow avant-garde were their opposition to traditional values and their critique of predecessors, its principal thinker Tadeusz Peiper strove to articulate the change in cultural paradigm and a new intellectual climate which signalled a decisive break with the past-modernity permeated the entire society especially in the form of the city, machine and the crowd, to which Peiper added velocity, innovation, power, the spirit of the new age and the leap into the present. In his formula Three Ms (masa, miesto, maszyna), Peiper saw a possibility of innovation in poetry and of its compatibility with the times. He favoured the metaphor because of its anti-realist thrust and its economy, and he accomplished the change of aesthetic hierarchy by a device of vivification by which the defunct and discarded objects on the lower level of development are brought into more complex relations by endowing them with qualities that enhance their nature, provide them with feelings and volition, and enable them to exist independently in space. In Peiper's concept of the mediated speech, the central position is occupied by pseudonyms and synonyms, as well as his thinking through structure, which encompasses the writer's total relationship to reality-hence Peiper's wish to weld together the poetic and the social. A new aesthetics built on social changes turned Peiper into a prime proponent and advocate of avant-garde ideas in Poland. Modem interpretations of the Krakow avant-garde should take into account both the operative principles of avant-garde art still applicable today and numerous poetic conventions engendered and promoted by avant-garde movements, which have been on the wane with the end of avant-garde art.",,,,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,FILOZOFSKI FAKULTET,ZAGREB,"IVANA LUCICA 3, ZAGREB, 10 000, CROATIA",0455-0463,,,KJNIZEV SMOTRA,Knjizev.

In addition, the abiotic factors determining forest dynamics vary depending on its location. Forest modeling thus faces the new challenge of supporting forest management in the context of environmental change. This review focuses on three types of models that are used in forest management: empirical (EM), process-based (PBM) and hybrid models. Recent approaches may lead to the applicability of empirical models under changing environmental conditions, such as (i) the dynamic state-space approach, or (ii) the development of productivity-environment relationships. Twenty-five process-based models in use in Europe were analyzed in terms of their structure, inputs and outputs having in mind a forest management perspective. Two paths for hybrid modeling were distinguished: (i) coupling of EMs and PBMs by developing signal-transfer environment-productivity functions; (ii) hybrid models with causal structure including both empirical and mechanistic components. Several gaps of knowledge were identified for the three types of models reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of the three model types differ and all are likely to remain in use. There is a trade-off between how little data the models need for calibration and simulation purposes, and the variety of input-output relationships that they can quantify. PBMs are the most versatile, with a wide range of environmental conditions and output variables they can account for. However, PBMs require more data making them less applicable whenever data for calibration are scarce. EMs, on the other hand, are easier to run as they require much less prior information, but the aggregated representation of environmental effects makes them less reliable in the context of environmental changes. The different disadvantages of PBMs and EMs suggest that hybrid models may be a good compromise, but a more extensive testing of these models in practice is required.","[Fontes, L.] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Estudos Florestais, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bontemps, J. -D.] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR 1092, INRA,Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bontemps, J. -D.] AgroParisTech, INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR 1092,Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Bugmann, H.] ETH, Dept Environm Sci, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Van Oijen, M.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol CEH Edinburgh Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kramer, K.] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Kramer, K.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lindner, M.] EFI, FIN-80100 Joensuu, Finland; [Roetzer, T.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecosyst & Landscape Management, Chair Forest Yield Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Skovsgaard, J.

Approximately one-third of the total food produced is lost/wasted every year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that represents a significant threat to food systems sustainability and environment. Multi-faceted and state-of-the-art solutions are continuously being explored and executed by research scientists, food industries, and government/non-government organizations to address the social, economic, and environmental concerns, depleted fossil fuel resources and climate change. Discarded food waste and bio-residues are enriched with a plethora of high-value biomolecules, such as Carbohydrates, lipids, lignin-based molecules, and proteins. These compounds are thought to exhibit a vast economic potential for transforming into a range of revenue sources, such as biofuels, biopolymers, organic acids, enzymes, nutraceuticals, and functional sugars etc. Enzyme-assisted bio-transformations have been stepped up as a sustainable valorization way for the effective treatment of such food waste. This approach is capable of efficient conversion of lignin-based food bio-residues into a large number of high-value bioproducts and industrial commodities given excellent catalytic performance, eco-sustainability, process stability, and amenability to commercial utility. This review spotlights recent and state-of-art information about food waste as a growing environmental burden, current practices, and enzyme-based valorization approaches to convert food waste into marketable products, including biofuels, prebiotics, biodegradable plastics, sweeteners, bioactive compounds, rare functional sugars, biosurfactants, etc. Current challenges, conclusive remarks, and future bioeconomy prospects are also discussed to accomplish the target goals of sustainable industrial production along with food waste minimization. In conclusion, enzymes' deployment might constitute an eco-friendly and sustainable solution for food waste management by producing high-value products.","[Bilal, Muhammad] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Food Engn, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China; [Mehmood, Tahir; Nadeem, Fareeha] Univ Vet & Anim Sci, Inst Biochem & Biotechnol, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Barbosa, Andriele Mendonca; de Souza, Ranyere Lucena; Ferreira, Luiz Fernando Romanholo] Tiradentes Univ UNIT, Grad Program Proc Engn, Ave Murilo Dantas 300, BR-49032490 Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil; [de Souza, Ranyere Lucena] Tiradentes Univ UNIT, Inst Technol & Res ITP, Ave Murilo Dantas 300, BR-49032490 Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil; [Pompeu, Georgia Bertoni] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz ESALQ, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Meer, Bisma] Quaid I Azam Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan; [Ferreira, Luiz Fernando Romanholo] Univ Tiradentes, Inst Technol & Res ITP, Waste & Effluent Treatment Lab, BR-49032490 Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil; [Iqbal, Hafiz M.

This study refers to the analysis of thermal properties and energy performance of the combination of green roof and night ventilation. Firstly, a field experiment was conducted to compare the thermal performance of green roof and bare roof when combining with night ventilation. Three series experiments were carried out to analyze cooling effect of green roof with and without night ventilation on summer sunny day and another experiment with natural ventilation all day long on summer rainy day was also monitored. Then, data from the field study were used to validate the green roof and night ventilation model incorporated within a building energy simulation program. This model was then used to estimate the energy saving for an office building in three typical climates. Results show that combining green roofs and night ventilation can significantly reduce the indoor air temperature and heat gains on sunny day but have no appreciable effect on rainy day. Because the cooling potential of green roof and night ventilation strongly depends on the climate and thermal mass, a simple equation to assess the air flow rate of night ventilation when combined with green roof was proposed. Furthermore, the correlation analysis between weather factors and cooling effect of green roofs as well as the air organization mode for night ventilation is also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Each model consists of a high-resolution ocean GCM of either the tropical Pacific or near-global oceans coupled to a moderate- or high-resolution atmospheric GCM, without the use of flux correction. The seasonal behavior of sea surface temperature (SST) and eastern Pacific rainfall is presented for each model. The results show that current state-of-the-art coupled GCMs share important successes and troublesome systematic errors. All 11 models are able to simulate the mean zonal gradient in SST at the equator over the central Pacific. The simulated equatorial cold tongue generally tends to be too strong, too narrow, and extend too far west. SSTs are generally too warm in a broad region west of Peru and in a band near 10 degrees S. This is accompanied in some models by a double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) straddling the equator over the eastern Pacific, and in others by an ITCZ that migrates across the equator with the seasons; neither behavior is realistic. There is considerable spread in the simulated seasonal cycles of equatorial SST in the eastern Pacific. Some simulations do capture the annual harmonic quite realistically, although the seasonal cold tongue tends to appear prematurely. Others overestimate the amplitude of the semiannual harmonic. Nonetheless, the results constitute a marked improvement over the simulations of only a few years ago when serious climate drift was still widespread and simulated zonal gradients of SST along the equator were often very weak.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT ATMOSPHER SCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90095; SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,LA JOLLA,CA; METEOROL OFF,HADLEY CTR CLIMATE PREDICT & RES,BRACKNELL,BERKS,ENGLAND; UNIV PARIS 06,LODYC,PARIS,FRANCE; NATL CTR ATMOSPHER RES,BOULDER,CO 80307; CTR OCEAN LAND ATMOSPHERE STUDIES,CALVERTON,MD; MAX PLANCK INST METEOROL,HAMBURG,GERMANY; METEOROL DYNAM LAB,CNRS,PARIS,FRANCE; TOKYO INST TECHNOL,TOKYO 152,JAPAN; GEOPHYS FLUID DYNAM LAB,PRINCETON,NJ; NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,GREENBELT,MD 20771; EUROPEAN CTR MEDIUM RANGE WEATHER FORECASTS,READING RG2 9AX,BERKS,ENGLAND; CERFACS,F-31057 TOULOUSE,FRANCE",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Max Planck Society; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Tokyo Institute of Technology; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); CERFACS,,,"Robertson, Andrew W/H-7138-2015; Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016; THUAL, Olivier/AAV-3844-2020; Neelin, J.

Smartphones are nowadays ubiquitous sensor devices with high computational power, moderate cost, and high-quality sensors. A smartphone app, which is called PocketLAI, was recently presented and tested for acquiring ground LAI estimates. In this letter, we explore the use of state-of-the-art nonlinear Gaussian process regression (GPR) to derive spatially explicit LAI estimates over rice using ground data from PocketLAI and Landsat 8 imagery. GPR has gained popularity in recent years because of its solid Bayesian foundations that offer not only high accuracy but also confidence intervals for the retrievals. We show the first LAI maps obtained with ground data from a smartphone combined with advanced machine learning. This letter compares LAI predictions and confidence intervals of the retrievals obtained with PocketLAI with those obtained with classical instruments, such as digital hemispheric photography (DHP) and LI-COR LAI-2000. This letter shows that all three instruments obtained comparable results, but PocketLAI is far cheaper. The proposed methodology hence opens a wide range of possible applications atmoderate cost.","[Campos-Taberner, Manuel; Javier Garcia-Haro, Franciso; Moreno, Alvaro; Amparo Gilabert, Maria; Sanchez-Ruiz, Sergio; Martinez, Beatriz] Univ Valencia, Dept Earth Phys & Thermodynam, Fac Phys, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; [Camps-Valls, Gustau] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab, Valencia 46980, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Campos-Taberner, M (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Earth Phys & Thermodynam, Fac Phys, E-46100 Valencia, Spain.",manuel.campos@uv.es; gcamps@uv.es,"Camps-Valls, Gustavo/A-2532-2011; García-Haro, F.

State-of-the-art models exhibit intermodel spread in simulating long-term changes in the SAM. Results from Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) experiments from 28 models archived in CMIP5 show that the intermodel spread in the linear trend in the austral winter (June-July-August) SAM is significant, with an intermodel standard deviation of 0.28 (10 yr)(-1), larger than the multimodel ensemble mean of 0.18 (10 yr)(-1). This study explores potential factors underlying the model difference from the aspect of extratropical sea surface temperature (SST). Extratropical SST anomalies related to the SAM exhibit a dipole-like structure between middle and high latitudes, referred to as the Southern Ocean Dipole (SOD). The role of SOD-like SST anomalies in influencing the SAM is found in the AMIP simulations. Model performance in simulating the SAM trend is linked with model skill in reflecting the SOD-SAM relationship. Models with stronger linkage between the SOD and the SAM tend to simulate a stronger SAM trend. The explained variance is about 40% in the AMIP runs. These results suggest improved simulation of the SOD-SAM relationship may help reproduce long-term changes in the SAM.","[Zheng, Fei; Yao, Shuailei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 10029, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Pilot Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol QNLM, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology","Zheng, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 10029, Peoples R China.",zhengfei08@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Zheng, Fei/AAV-7512-2021; Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012","Zheng, Fei/0000-0001-6135-6148; Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070402]; National Key Research and Development Project [2018YFA0606404]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41790474, 41775090]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was jointly supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19070402), a National Key Research and Development Project (Grant No. 2018YFA0606404), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41790474 and 41775090).

To answer these questions, a low-cost sensor network of 135 iButton'' thermometers was deployed for summer 2015 in Baltimore, Maryland (a midsized American city with a temperate climate), focusing on an underserved area that exhibits high LST from satellite imagery. The sensors were evaluated against commercial and NOAA/NWS stations and showed good agreement for daily minimum temperatures. Variability within the study site was small: mean minimum daily temperatures have a spatial standard deviation of 0.9 degrees C, much smaller than the same measure for satellite-derived LST. The sensor-measured temperatures agree well with the NWS weather station in downtown Baltimore, with a mean difference for all measurements in time and space of 0.00 degrees C; this agreement with the station is not found to be correlated with any meteorological variables with the exception of radiation. Surface properties are found to be important in determining spatial variability: vegetated or green spaces are observed to be 0.5 degrees C cooler than areas dominated by impervious surfaces, and the presence of green space is found to be a more significant predictor of temperature than surface properties such as elevation. Other surface properties-albedo, tree-canopy cover, and distance to the nearest park-are not found to correlate significantly with air temperatures.","[Scott, Anna A.; Zaitchik, Ben; Waugh, Darryn W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [O'Meara, Katie] Maryland Inst Coll Art, Architectural Design Dept, Baltimore, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Scott, AA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",annascott@jhu.edu,"Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020; Waugh, Darryn W/K-3688-2016","Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Waugh, Darryn W/0000-0001-7692-2798","Baltimore City Department of Sustainability, National Science Foundation (NSF) IGERT Grant [DGE-1069213]; NSF Hazards SEES Grant [1331399]; Johns Hopkins Department of Earth and Planetary Science summer field fund; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1631409] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Baltimore City Department of Sustainability, National Science Foundation (NSF) IGERT Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Hazards SEES Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Johns Hopkins Department of Earth and Planetary Science summer field fund; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We acknowledge Kristin Baja and the Baltimore City Department of Sustainability, National Science Foundation (NSF) IGERT Grant DGE-1069213, NSF Hazards SEES Grant 1331399, and the Johns Hopkins Department of Earth and Planetary Science summer field fund for their support, as well as Clara Hickman, Sophie Stoerkel, and the Maryland Institute College of Art for the radiation shield design.

However, the efficacy of PCMs depends highly on its thermo-physical properties and climatic condition. In this regard, a multi-objective optimization technique is adopted to unearth the optimal type and location of PCM that can minimize heating and cooling loads considering five cities of Iran namely Tehran, Tabriz, Bandar Abas, Shiraz and Yazd with distinctive climates. Then, the optimal PCMs are environmentally and economically assessed. The study showed that the PCM with a melting temperature of 25 degrees C outperforms in terms of cooling load while the PCM with a melting temperature of 21 degrees C favors the heating performance. Moreover, the utilization of PCM results in electricity saving of 4.5-5.5% for all the climates. On average, the annual carbon footprint is reduced by 1297 kg, 1420 kg, 2040 kg, 1027 kg, and 1248 kg for Tehran, Tabriz, Bandar Abas, Shiraz, and Yazd, respectively. The payback period was found to be more than 70 years for all the cities considering current economic conditions.

Unlike intermittent and ephemeral rivers, they are disconnected from groundwater and do not support aquatic life. DR have often been undervalued by some scientific and social groups in terms of nature's contributions to people (NCP) because of the lack of an integrative perspective to encompass them and their high aridity and low flow. This study aims to provide the state of the art on DR in terms of geographic distribution, NCP, human well-being and drivers of change, and to identify knowledge gaps and the tools to bridge them. To this end, a systematic review of 79 scientific documents (26 case studies, 53 evidence-based works) published between 1995 and 2019 was conducted. Firstly, we analysed the main research trends using publication rates and bibliometric techniques. Secondly, we analysed DR distribution, NCP and drivers of change using mapping techniques, descriptive statistics and bibliographic analysis respectively. We especially identified regulating NCP but to a lesser extent, also material and non-material NCP affected by land use change, climate change, overexploitation, and demographic, political and economic changes. We found relevant gaps on NCP and how they affect the different components of well-being, and the effect of indirect drivers of change on them. Geographical information systems, international scientific collaboration, and basin and transdisciplinary approaches, could accelerate bridging gaps while new research, rehabilitation, management and conservation, and socio-economic opportunities are developed in parallel.","[Nicolas Ruiz, Nestor; Suarez Alonso, Maria Luisa; Rosario Vidal-Abarca, Maria] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol & Hydrol, Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain",University of Murcia,"Ruiz, NN (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol & Hydrol, Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",nestor.nicolas@um.es; mlsuarez@um.es; charyvag@um.es,,"Nicolas-Ruiz, Nestor/0000-0003-0739-4551","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) [CGL2017-84625-C2-2-R]; Seneca Foundation (Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia, Spain); State Research Agency","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ERDF (European Regional Development Fund)(European Commission); Seneca Foundation (Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia, Spain)(Fundacion Seneca); State Research Agency","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, State Research Agency and ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) (Project ref: CGL201784625C22R) .

In nature, however, the observed land surface warming is not spatially uniform in recent decades as GHG concentration has risen rapidly. There is no warming and even cooling trend in spring northwest North America (NWNA) surface temperature since 1980. Here, we link the observed multidecadal surface cooling trend in NWNA to the weakening of spring Aleutian low (AL), which is ecologically important during the growing season. The AL weakening leads to reductions of southwesterly wind and warm air transport from eastern North Pacific to NWNA. The spring AL weakening and associated NWNA surface cooling are reasonably reproduced by AMIP models, driven by the historical external forcing and imposed sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) from observations. Further investigations into the roles of different forcing components suggest that the changes in the AL are most likely driven by the tropical SST changes in recent decades while the external forcing and SIC play minor roles. There is a zonal dipole pattern of trends in tropical SSTs since 1980, with central-eastern Pacific cooling and warming in other tropical basins, and the atmospheric responses to this SST change show a meridionally propagating Rossby wave train from tropics into subarctic North Pacific, which mediates the SST forcing and the AL changes.","[Sun, Cheng; Wang, Kaicun; Xie, Fei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci GCESS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Cheng; Kang, In-Sik; Lian, Tao; Liu, Ting] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kucharski, Fred] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Kucharski, Fred] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Li, Jianping] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ding, Ruiqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); King Abdulaziz University; Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Sun, C (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci GCESS, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sun, C (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",scheng@bnu.edu.cn,"Ding, Ruiqiang/AAF-9948-2021; Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012; Wang, Kaicun/F-7813-2012; Sun, Cheng/O-7918-2015; Xie, Fei/I-9766-2016","Ding, Ruiqiang/0000-0003-4139-3843; Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575; Wang, Kaicun/0000-0002-7414-5400; Sun, Cheng/0000-0003-0474-7593; Kucharski, Fred/0000-0002-8710-8051; Xie, Fei/0000-0003-2891-3883","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775038, 41975082, 41975047, 41790474]; National Program on Global Change and AirSea Interaction [GASI-IPOVAI-03, GASI-IPOVAI-06]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Program on Global Change and AirSea Interaction,"This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41775038, 41975082, 41975047 and 41790474) and the National Program on Global Change and AirSea Interaction (GASI-IPOVAI-03 and GASI-IPOVAI-06).

Current state-of-the-art hole-transport materials require additional oxidizing dopants to achieve sufficient hole-transport properties; however, these dopants are environmentally harmful while also deteriorating the stability of PSCs. The development of high-performance dopant-free hole-transport materials is an important goal in the field of PSCs. In this work, we developed novel conjugated small-molecule based dopant-free hole-transport materials for PSCs containing di(1-benzothieno)[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DBTP) as a core unit. These small molecule hole-transport materials achieved higher hole mobility and interfacial charge transfer rates than optimally doped spiro-OMeTAD, the current-state-of-the-art hole-transport material. A low-temperature PSC device using a dopant-free small molecule hole-transport material displayed a PCE of 18.09% with negligible hysteresis, higher than a device using doped spiro-OMeTAD (17.82%). Notably, the hydrophobic nature of our dopant-free small molecule hole-transport materials afforded excellent air-storage stability of low-temperature PSCs (81% retention after 33 days), whereas the doped spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs rapidly degraded under identical conditions (< 1% retention after 33 days).","[Azmi, Randi; Sinaga, Septy; Akbar, Zico Alaia; Jung, In Hwan; Jang, Sung-Yeon] Kookmin Univ, Dept Chem, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Nam, So Youn; Yoon, Sung Cheol] KRICT, Div Adv Mat, Daejeon 34114, South Korea; [Lee, Chang-Lyoul] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, APRI, Gwangju 61005, South Korea",Kookmin University; Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT); Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST),"Jung, IH; Jang, SY (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Dept Chem, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.",ihjung@kookmin.ac.kr; syjang@kookmin.ac.kr,"Akbar, Zico Alaia/W-5257-2019; AZMI, RANDI/K-2720-2019","AZMI, RANDI/0000-0002-8518-9388; Alaia Akbar Junior, Zico/0000-0002-1341-9850","National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIP) [2016R1A5A1012966, 2017R1A2B2009178, 2017R1C1B2010694, 2017M2A2A6A01020854]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2016M1A2A2940912]; Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea","National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIP); Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea","The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the National Research Foundation (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIP, No. 2016R1A5A1012966, No. 2017R1A2B2009178, No. 2017R1C1B2010694, No. 2017M2A2A6A01020854), the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (NRF-2016M1A2A2940912), and the Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea.",,44,104,105,17,275,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-2855,2211-3282,,NANO ENERGY,Nano Energy,FEB,2018,,,,,191,198,,10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.12.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.12.002,,,8,"Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,FS5KN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000419833900023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spatiotemporal variations of precipitable water vapor (PWV) are important aspects in understanding the water cycle and water resources. However, station observations in central Asia are limited and the performance of satellite and reanalysis products of PWV in central Asia has not been evaluated. Based on radiosonde observations, we show evidence that the two satellite products, namely, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder-only and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, are applicable to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of PWV in central Asia. The two satellite products can capture the main climatological features, annual cycle, and monthly variations of PWV in central Asia, with high correlations with radiosonde observations, although slightly underestimate PWV values by -15% to 0%. All the eight current state-of-the-art reanalysis data sets, including European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis, the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERAS), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)1, NCEP2, Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, 55-year modern Japanese Reanalysis Project, Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and MERRA version 2 (MERRA2), can reasonably reproduce the spatiotemporal variations of PWV, although with an overestimation in spring, autumn, and winter and an underestimation in summer. ERAS and MERRA2 (NCEP1 and NCEP2) perform better (poorer) compared with other reanalysis data sets. A skill-weighted ensemble mean of reanalysis data sets is constructed based on the different performance of individual data sets. It is better for understanding the climatological spatial pattern than the equally weighted ensemble mean and individual reanalysis data sets, while ERAS is suggested to be used for revealing the interannual variations of PWV in central Asia.","[Jiang, Jie; Zhou, Tianjun; Zhang, Wenxia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jie; Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Jiang, Jie/Y-8371-2019; Zhang, Wenxia/L-8394-2015","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Jiang, Jie/0000-0002-2095-4667; Zhang, Wenxia/0000-0001-8614-8070",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA2006010203]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [134111KYSB20160031],Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"We thank Aiguo Dai and Junhong Wang for providing the homogenized radiosonde observations.

In the face of negative demographic forecasts, urbanization and suburbanization processes, and climate change, the use of pro-environmental solutions in the development of cemeteries cannot be overestimated. On the basis of analyses of contemporary cemeteries from Europe (78 objects), including Poland (8 objects), a catalog of pro-environmental solutions is developed. The catalog is created based on the proposed functional and spatial model of cemeteries as a multifunctional space, integrating natural and cultural environments. Environmental activities related to the context, burial space, architecture, and other spatial elements, as well as the vegetation of modern cemeteries, are included. Then, in order to increase the environmental values of the cemetery, these solutions were implemented by developing an integrated concept for the project of a multifunctional and ecological municipal cemetery in Gniezno, Poland (the Greater Poland voivodeship).","[Anna, Dlugozima; Ewa, Kosiacka-Beck] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Environm Engn, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Landscape Art, Nowoursynowska 166 St, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Anna, D (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Environm Engn, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Landscape Art, Nowoursynowska 166 St, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",anna_dlugozima@sggw.pl; ewa_kosiacka_beck@sggw.pl,,"Dlugozima, Anna/0000-0002-5754-9542; Kosiacka-Beck, Ewa/0000-0002-1696-0415",National Science Centre [2016/23/D/HS4/03043],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research was funded by National Science Centre grant Planning cemeteries in the existing urban and rural structures in Poland, seen from the spatial order aspect, against the background of the contemporary European sepulchral space (No. 2016/23/D/HS4/03043).",,74,12,12,1,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Mar,2020,6,,,,,,2374,10.3390/su12062374,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12062374,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LA1YW,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000523751400221,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast to other studies, the teleconnection is considered in both directions-from the Pacific to the Atlantic and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The model ensemble is generally able to simulate the propagation of atmospheric and oceanic signals to the adjacent ocean basin, generated by warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical eastern oceans with Atlantic summer events lagging or leading Pacific boreal winter events. This is investigated by means of time-lagged composite analyses of different atmospheric parameters, including sea level pressure, wind, stream function, velocity potential, vertical air movement and divergent wind at several levels. However, the modelled inter-basin teleconnection and its correct frequency of occurrence depend on the strong warm SST biases in the Atlantic Benguela upwelling region and in the Pacific Ocean.","[Ott, Irena; Romberg, Karin; Jacobeit, Jucundus] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Ott, I (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",irena.ott@geo.uni-augsburg.de,,"Kaspar-Ott, Irena/0000-0002-5151-201X",DFG (German Research Foundation) [JA 831/9-1],DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Financial support was provided by the DFG (German Research Foundation) under contract JA 831/9-1.,,31,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

This method was developed as a tool for choosing a new microclimate for temporary moves. At the present stage of development, this method is not intended to be used for identifying harmful conditions. The proposed method is based on experimental evidence indicating that the sensitivity of wooden objects to environmental fluctuations can differ front object to object, depending on many physical and mechanical parameters. Some objects could be effected by fluctuations that would not be significant for other objects. The parameter adopted in this work is equilibrium moisture content, that is the equilibrium value that a wooden object would tend to maintain under stable temperature and relative humidity values for a long period of time. It must be considered potential because in a fluctuating climate it is never reached. The methodology is based on two parts. The first describes in a mathematically simplified way how climate is perceived by objects with different sensitivities. The second analyzes the climatic distance between different climatic data sets using the mathematical technique of principal components analysis, according to the previously defined object's sensitivity. As a test of the proposed method, four different microclimatic cases studies are analyzed and the results described.","[Dionisi-Vici, Paolo] Metropolitan Museum Art, New York, NY 10028 USA; [Uzielli, Luca] Univ Florence, DEISTAF, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [De Vincenzi, Matteo] CNR, IBIMET, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Metropolitan Museum of Art; University of Florence; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR),"Dionisi-Vici, P (corresponding author), Metropolitan Museum Art, 1000 5th Ave, New York, NY 10028 USA.",paolo.dionisivici@metmuseum.org; m.devincenzi@ibimet.cnr.it; luca.uzielli@unifi.it,"Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/G-3829-2011; DE VINCENZI, MATTEO/D-7730-2016; Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/V-1426-2019","Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/0000-0002-9692-9695; DE VINCENZI, MATTEO/0000-0002-5698-4286; Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/0000-0002-9692-9695; Uzielli, Luca/0000-0002-0195-4936",,,,,23,10,10,0,5,MANEY PUBLISHING,LEEDS,"STE 1C, JOSEPHS WELL, HANOVER WALK, LEEDS LS3 1AB, W YORKS, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

The presence of speckle noise, the absence of efficient feature expression, and the limited availability of labelled SAR samples have hindered the application of the state-of-the-art CNNs for the classification of SAR imagery. This is of great concern for mapping complex land cover ecosystems, such as wetlands, where backscattering/spectrally similar signatures of land cover units further complicate the matter. Accordingly, we propose a new Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture that can be trained in an end-to-end scheme and is specifically designed for the classification of wetland complexes using polarimetric SAR (PoISAR) imagery. The proposed architecture follows an encoder-decoder paradigm, wherein the input data are fed into a stack of convolutional filters (encoder) to extract high-level abstract features and a stack of transposed convolutional filters (decoder) to gradually up-sample the low resolution output to the spatial resolution of the original input image. The proposed network also benefits from recent advances in CNN designs, namely the addition of inception modules and skip connections with residual units. The former component improves multi-scale inference and enriches contextual information, while the latter contributes to the recovery of more detailed information and simplifies optimization.

These are some of the most extensive outcrops in the area and hold the key to evaluating the connections of the Antarctic Peninsula in Gondwana; however, they are still poorly understood. Here we present our provenance study of the Trinity Peninsula Group using petrographic and geochemical approaches in combination with cathodoluminescence of detrital quartz in order to constrain its source characteristics and tectonic setting. Using differences in modal composition and quartz cathodoluminescence characteristics, we define three petrofacies derived from the progressive uplift and erosion of a volcano-plutonic continental arc, which exposed the plutonic-metamorphic roots. As indicated by major and trace elements, the source is felsic with a composition ranging from tonalitic to granodioritic. The relatively unweathered condition of the source area points to a dry and cold climate at the time of deposition, but this does not necessarily mean that it was glaciated. Deposition of the sediments occurred within an active continental margin, relatively close to the source area, probably along the south Patagonia-Antarctic Peninsula sector of Gondwana. Strong chronological, petrological and chemical similarities with the sediments of the Duque the York Complex in Patagonia suggest that they were derived from the same source.","[Castillo, Paula] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Castillo, Paula; Herve, Francisco] Univ Chile, Dept Geol, Santiago, Chile; [Lacassie, Juan Pablo] Serv Nacl Geol & Mineria, Santiago, Chile; [Augustsson, Carita] Univ Munster, Inst Geol & Palaontol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Augustsson, Carita] Univ & Stavanger, Inst Petr Steknol, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Herve, Francisco] Univ Andres Bello, Escuela Ciencias Tierra, Santiago, Chile",Australian National University; Universidad de Chile; University of Munster; Universitetet i Stavanger; Universidad Andres Bello,"Castillo, P (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",paula.castillo@anu.edu.au,"Herve, Francisco/HDO-6628-2022",,Anillo Antartico project [ART-105]; Inach project [B-01-08],Anillo Antartico project(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS); Inach project,"This work was supported by the Anillo Antartico ART-105 and Inach B-01-08 projects.

However, evidence of its use in either or both capacities is limited. This protocol proposes a systematic narrative review of peer-reviewed, published literature on the use of storytelling as a research tool within the public health arena. Methods and analysis Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center), Web of Science, Art and Humanities database (ProQuest), Scopus and Google Scholar will be searched for studies that look at the use of storytelling in the research of pressing current public health issues, for example, vaccinations, antimicrobial resistance, climate change and cancer screening. The review will synthesise evidence of how storytelling is used as a research tool to (a) gain insights into KAB and (b) to effect change in KAB when used as an intervention. Included studies will be selected according to carefully defined criteria relevant to public health issues of interest, and data from qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies will be extracted with a customised data extraction form. A narrative synthesis will be performed according to Economic and Social Research Council guidance from Popay, J, 2006.The study protocol follows the recommendations by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P).

SF2SE3 then iteratively (1) samples pixel sets to compute SE(3)-motion proposals, and (2) selects the best SE(3)-motion proposal with respect to a maximum coverage formulation. Finally, objects are formed by assigning pixels uniquely to the selected SE(3)-motions based on consistency with the input scene flow and spatial proximity. The main novelties are a more informed strategy for the sampling of motion proposals and a maximum coverage formulation for the proposal selection. We conduct evaluations on multiple datasets regarding application of SF2SE3 for scene flow estimation, object segmentation and visual odometry.

These measures cause new ways of heat and moisture exchange in the building envelope and are likely to create high internal moisture load with consequences for durability of materials and inhabitants' comfort and health. Improvement in the thermal performance of the envelope can then lead to the paradoxical need for high energy consumption in order to handle the vapor peaks indoors by using mechanical ventilation equipments. Even if with HVAC devices it is possible to provide an acceptable indoor climate, there is still a need to develop more passive and less energy intensive methods to moderate the indoor environment in NZEB. In recent decades many authors have focused on a promising strategy related to the use of moisture buffering materials which dampen indoor humidity variations without additional energy costs. Nevertheless, many internal finishing materials commonly used at present are still not highly performant or lead to problems of hysteresis. In the present study, we propose an alternative solution, which is the design of a moisture buffering active device, to be integrated in a part of the building envelope, which is able to measure the relative humidity indoors and control its loads by a low-energy-consumption fan system. The humidity control performance of the device has been dynamically tested in a climate chamber and has been compared with traditional passive material samples in order to measure the Moisture Buffering Value (MBV) according to the DTU test method. Experimental results showed that passive samples have high moisture buffering values [MBV = 6.12 g/(m(2).% RH)] and do not lead to hysteresis phenomena. The MBV measured in the active devices increased up to 29%, which predicts promising future applications for low-energy-consumption indoor humidity control. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Fundamental aspects in invasion ecology are not yet fully understood, as there is neither a clear definition of invasive species nor their characteristics. Likewise, regulations to tackle marine invasions are fragmentary and either restricted to specific regions or certain aspects of the invasion process. Nonetheless, marine anthropogenic vectors (e.g., vessel fouling, ballast water, aquaculture, marine static structures, floating debris, and human-mediated climate change) are well described. The most important distribution vector for marine non-indigenous species is the shipping sector, composed by vessel fouling and ballast water discharge. Ship traffic is a constantly growing sector, as not only ship sizes are increasing, but also remote environments such as the polar regions are becoming accessible for commercial use. To mitigate invasions, it is necessary to evaluate species' capability to invade a certain habitat, as well as the risk of a region of becoming invaded. On an ecological level, this may be achieved by Ecological Niche Modelling based on environmental data. In combination with quantitative vector data, sophisticated species distribution models may be developed. Especially the ever-increasing amount of available data allows for comprehensive modelling approaches to predict marine invasions and provide valuable information for policy makers. For this article, we reviewed available literature to provide brief insights into the backgrounds and regulations of major marine vectors, as well as species distribution modelling. Finally, we present some state-of-the-art modelling approaches based on ecological and vector data, beneficial for realistic risk assessments.","[Laeseke, Philipp; Schiller, Jessica] Univ Bremen, Marine Bot, Bremen, Germany; [Letschert, Jonas] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Llanos, Sara Doolittle] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Bremen; Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT); University of Groningen,"Laeseke, P (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Marine Bot, Bremen, Germany.",philipp.laeseke@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,166,4,4,3,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-20389-4; 978-3-030-20388-7,,,,2020,,,,,195,209,,10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_10,,,15,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,BQ2MU,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000582468900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Model results showed that the modified ECHAM6.3, i.e., with the SMCM, improves the simulation of seasonal evolution of anomalous rainfall and low-level circulation. Analysis revealed that the improvement in the simulation of precipitation anomalies of the first mode is associated with the improvement in both enhanced and suppressed convection. In addition, the enhanced easterly vertical shear over the Maritime Continent in the modified ECHAM6.3 contributes to the improvement in an equatorial asymmetry of precipitation anomalies of the first mode. Moreover, the moisture budget analysis demonstrated that the modified ECHAM6.3 improves the seasonal anomalous rainfall of the first mode by ameliorating the vertical mass integral of the moist flux divergence. In addition, the second mode of the AAM interannual variability produced by the modified ECHAM6.3 potentially exerts stronger influence on the ENSO variability compared to the default ECHAM6.3.","[Ma, Libin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, CIC FEMD,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Minist Educ KL, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Ningliu Rd 219,Meteorol Bldg, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zijun] Hunan First Normal Univ, Sch Math & Computat Sci, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Libin] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Hunan First Normal University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Ma, LB (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, CIC FEMD,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Minist Educ KL, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Ningliu Rd 219,Meteorol Bldg, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Ma, LB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",malibin109@163.com,,"Ma, Libin/0000-0002-5236-5429",Basic Research Fund of CAMS [2018Z007]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2018r064],Basic Research Fund of CAMS; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,The authors appreciate Dr. Karsten Peters for his help on coupling the SMCM to ECHAM6.3.

A. D. 1257 or 1258, most probably in the tropics. Estimates based on sulfate deposition in these records suggest that it yielded the largest volcanic sulfur release to the stratosphere of the past 7,000 y. Tree rings, medieval chronicles, and computational models corroborate the expected worldwide atmospheric and climatic effects of this eruption. However, until now there has been no convincing candidate for the mid-13th century mystery eruption. Drawing upon compelling evidence from stratigraphic and geomorphic data, physical volcanology, radiocarbon dating, tephra geochemistry, and chronicles, we argue the source of this long-sought eruption is the Samalas volcano, adjacent to Mount Rinjani on Lombok Island, Indonesia. At least 40 km(3) (dense-rock equivalent) of tephra were deposited and the eruption column reached an altitude of up to 43 km. Three principal pumice fallout deposits mantle the region and thick pyroclastic flow deposits are found at the coast, 25 km from source. With an estimated magnitude of 7, this event ranks among the largest Holocene explosive eruptions. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal are consistent with a mid-13th century eruption. In addition, glass geochemistry of the associated pumice deposits matches that of shards found in both Arctic and Antarctic ice cores, providing compelling evidence to link the prominent A.

Such events have been studied considering satellite/radar images and output fields from two Limited Area Models in the summer period of 2011-2013. A total of 20 days have been detected in which the precipitation due to sea-breeze convergence was clearly observed in satellite and radar images. The synoptic conditions associated with these events have been identified considering the averages of some relevant meteorological parameters in the selected days and the anomaly with respect to the climate. The presence of a cold trough in the central Mediterranean basin appears as a fundamental ingredient for the occurrence of sea breeze convergence and associated precipitation. High-resolution simulations with two state-of-art numerical models have revealed that both of them are generally able to simulate a convergence pattern correctly, apart from a couple of cases for each model. The higher rainfall amounts occur with weak synoptic wind, and weak-to-moderate values of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). When the synoptic wind is of moderate intensity, the region of convergence moves toward the Adriatic coast for a prevailing southerly component, and toward the Ionian coast for a prevailing northerly component. On the opposite, the skin sea surface temperature is relatively uniform and the difference between the Ionian and the Adriatic Seas, surrounding the peninsula on the east and west side, is generally smaller than 1 K, having only a marginal effect on the sea breeze patterns. Similarly, the value of CAPE before the occurrence of rainfall has low prognostic value. The results shows that limited area models with a grid spacing of few km appear as appropriate tools for the simulation for such relatively small scale phenomena. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, it may miss some forests due to its spatial separation of individual spots. A number of efforts have been made to overcome the limitation of global LiDAR datasets to generate wall-to-wall canopy height products, among which a global satellite product produced by Simard et al. (2011) (henceforth, the Simard-map) has been the most widely applied. However, the accuracy of the Simard-map is uncertain in boreal forests, which play important roles in the terrestrial carbon cycle and are encountering more extensive climate changes than the global average. In this letter, we evaluated the Simard-map in boreal forests through a literature review of field canopy height. Our comparison shows that the Simard-map yielded a significant correlation with the field canopy height (R-2 = 0.68 and p < 0.001). However, remarkable biases were observed with the root mean square error (RMSE), regression slope, and intercept of 6.88 m, 0.448, and 10.429, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the evaluation results showed an identical trend with a validation of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) tree-cover product (MOD44B) in boreal forests, which was used as a crucial input data set for generating the Simard-map. That is, both the Simard-map and MOD44B yielded an overestimation (underestimation) in the lower (upper) tails of the scatterplots between the field and satellite data sets. This indicates that the MOD44B product is the likely source of error for the estimation biases of the Simard-map. Finally, a field calibration was performed to improve the Simard-map in boreal forests by compensating for the estimation biases and discarding non-forest areas, which provided a more reliable canopy height product for future applications.","[Yang, Wei; Kondoh, Akihiko] Chiba Univ, Ctr Environm Remote Sensing, Chiba 2638522, Japan",Chiba University,"Yang, W (corresponding author), Chiba Univ, Ctr Environm Remote Sensing, Chiba 2638522, Japan.",yangwei@chiba-u.jp; kondoh@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Yang, Wei/M-6620-2015","Yang, Wei/0000-0003-3342-7679",JAXA Second Research Announcement on the Earth Observations (GCOM-C) [106]; JSPS [17K00540],"JAXA Second Research Announcement on the Earth Observations (GCOM-C); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This research is funded by JAXA Second Research Announcement on the Earth Observations (GCOM-C no. 106), as well as a JSPS Grant-Aid for Scientific Research (C) no. 17K00540.",,31,0,0,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,APR,2020,7,,,,,,1114,10.3390/rs12071114,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12071114,,,10,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,LU4EF,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000537709600064,View Full Record in Web of Science

Deliberately engaging in transformation processes inevitably requires imagination. We refer to imagination for transformations as interdependent cognitive and social processes that create representations of present and possible future states of the world that can inform public deliberation, policy, decision making, and behavior from the individual to the global scale. We contend that imagination is an essential capacity for securing ecological, social, economic, and cultural well-being in times of rapid and often unpredictable global change. We sketch an emerging interdisciplinary research agenda on imagination as a transformational capacity and its role in transformation processes, building on contributions to a special issue on this subject. We specifically focus on imagination in relationship to transformative agency, causation, and individual-collective dynamics. Our aim is to identify research questions and challenges that are most pressing with a view to supporting efforts of transformations toward sustainability.","[Moore, Michele-Lee] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Moore, Michele-Lee] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Moore, Michele-Lee] Univ Victoria, Ctr Global Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Milkoreit, Manjana] Purdue Univ, Dept Polit Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Stockholm University; University of Victoria; University of Victoria; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Moore, ML (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.;Moore, ML (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada.;Moore, ML (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Ctr Global Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada.",michelelee.moore@su.se,,", Michele-Lee/0000-0002-8837-524X",Global Synergy Research Faculty Grant of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University [209553]; GRAID program at the Stockholm Resilience Centre - Swedish International Development Agency,Global Synergy Research Faculty Grant of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University; GRAID program at the Stockholm Resilience Centre - Swedish International Development Agency,"This work was supported by a Global Synergy Research Faculty Grant (#209553) of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University.

Wonderwerk Cave occupies a central position in the interior where the Kalahari Thornveld/dry woodland vegetation and generally arid conditions are expected to be sensitive to subtle past climate perturbations, and evidence from this site has been key to forming views on environmental change in the interior. A compilation of existing data including principal component analysis of pollen suggested broad trends, ranging from variably arid and open in the early Holocene to moister conditions from about 7500 to 5000 years, followed by aridity thereafter. In an effort to better establish the nature and timing of shifts from the Late Pleistocene sequence onwards, we analyse carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in a robust sample of ostrich eggshell from Wonderwerk Cave. The resulting data are then placed within a temporal framework established by Bayesian modelling of existing radiocarbon dates and compared against shifts in the Wonderwerk cultural sequence. Several shifts and trends in aridity include an arid to moist shift in layer 4b near 6000 years, coincident with a cultural shift within the Wilton assemblage, and thereafter an aridification trend culminating at about 2000 years with the appearance of the ceramic LSA.","[Lee-Thorp, Julia A.; Ecker, Michaela] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Lee-Thorp, JA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",Julia.lee-thorp@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,,,NERC [NE/G005338/2] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G005338/2] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,56,21,22,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0263-0338,1572-9842,,AFR ARCHAEOL REV,Afr.

Here we use a state of the art coupled chemistry-climate model HadGEM2-ES, with extended tropospheric chemistry, to assess the impacts that changes in emissions from anthropogenic activity have had on the burden and impacts of air pollutants over the last three decades. We use HadGEM2-ES to assess an alternative trajectory in air pollutant emissions to that which we have seen, with a regional focus on the contiguous United States and areas of Western Europe. This alternative trajectory can be considered to reflect a world avoided. In this world avoided, the significant levels of air pollution legislation imposed over the last three decades are simulated to not have come into effect in the contiguous United States and Western Europe. Rather a business as usual emission scenario is followed from 1970 to the present day. By combining the results of simulations of the world avoided with a base case present day atmosphere our model runs demonstrate that as a result of air pollution legislation, over 500 000 early mortalities a year have been mitigated owing to extensive reduction in sulfate aerosol and up to 8000 early mortalities a year have been mitigated as a result of improvements in ozone and nitrogen dioxide pollution. These results highlight the important role of legislation in reducing air pollution related mortality in these areas of the globe and highlight a compelling case for developing regions to follow.","[Archibald, A.

Here, we analyze ocean energetics in coupled GCMs in terms of two integral parameters describing net energy loss in the system using the approach recently proposed by Brown and Fedorov (J Clim 23:1563-1580, 2010a) and Fedorov (J Clim 20:1108-1117, 2007). These parameters are (1) the efficiency gamma of the conversion of wind power into the buoyancy power that controls the rate of change of the available potential energy (APE) in the ocean and (2) the e-folding rate alpha that characterizes the damping of APE by turbulent diffusion and other processes. Estimating these two parameters for coupled models reveals potential deficiencies (and large differences) in how state-of-the-art coupled GCMs reproduce the ocean energetics as compared to ocean-only models and data assimilating models. The majority of the coupled models we analyzed show a lower efficiency (values of gamma in the range of 10-50% versus 50-60% for ocean-only simulations or reanalysis) and a relatively strong energy damping (values of alpha(-1) in the range 0.4-1 years versus 0.9-1.2 years). These differences in the model energetics appear to reflect differences in the simulated thermal structure of the tropical ocean, the structure of ocean equatorial currents, and deficiencies in the way coupled models simulate ENSO.","[Brown, Jaclyn N.; Fedorov, Alexey V.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Brown, Jaclyn N.] CSIRO Wealth Oceans Natl Res Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Guilyardi, Eric] CNRS IRD UPMC MNHN, IPSL LOCEAN, Paris, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, NCAS, Reading, Berks, England",Yale University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Fedorov, AV (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Alexey.Fedorov@yale.edu,"Guilyardi, Eric/D-4868-2011; fedorov, alexey/F-1879-2010; Brown, Jaclyn/A-1121-2013","Guilyardi, Eric/0000-0002-2255-8625; Brown, Jaclyn/0000-0002-2503-9337","National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP); NSF [OCE-0901921]; Department of Energy Office of Science [DE-FG02-06ER64238, DE-FG02-08ER64590]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; CNRS (France); European Community [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]; CNRS; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish",National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); CNRS (France)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); European Community(European Commission); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset.

The simulated modern ice sheets generated by these models differ markedly as input parameters are varied. To ensure accurate ice sheet mass loss projections, these parameters must be constrained using observational data. Which model parameter combinations make sense, given observations? Our method assigns probabilities to parameter combinations based on how well the model reproduces the Greenland Ice Sheet profile. We improve on the previous state of the art by accounting for spatial information and by carefully sampling the full range of realistic parameter combinations, using statistically rigorous methods. Specifically, we estimate the joint posterior probability density function of model parameters using Gaussian process-based emulation and calibration. This method is an important step toward calibrated probabilistic projections of ice sheet contributions to sea level rise, in that it uses data-model fusion to learn about parameter values. This information can, in turn, be used to make projections while taking into account various sources of uncertainty, including parametric uncertainty, data-model discrepancy, and spatial correlation in the error structure. We demonstrate the utility of our method using a perfect model experiment, which shows that many different parameter combinations can generate similar modern ice sheet profiles. This result suggests that the large divergence of projections from different ice sheet models is partly due to parametric uncertainty. Moreover, our method enables insight into ice sheet processes represented by parameter interactions in the model.","[Chang, W.; Haran, M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Applegate, P.

The concerns about sustainability and ecological health are growing in this extremely diversified sector just like in the whole agriculture industry. The use of probiotics in aquaculture already has a long history and has served from the beginning the goals of more sustainable production; however, the expansion of intensive systems along with global climate change produces new challenges. The present work aims to provide an overview of the most relevant literature. Firstly, the microbiome of aquatic animals and its functioning is surveyed followed by the aims and methods of probiotic application. The screening and testing of novel probiotics are also assessed as well as the scientific and technical novelties in probiotics research. The mainstream development in probiotic research aims to serve the sustainability of aquaculture in all respects including traditional animal health, feed efficiency, and environmental issues. New state-of-the-art techniques may lead to a future paradigm change in aquaculture under the aegis of the Blue Revolution.","[Hancz, Csaba] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Kaposvar Campus,Guba S 40, H-7400 Kaposvar, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Hancz, C (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Kaposvar Campus,Guba S 40, H-7400 Kaposvar, Hungary.",hancz.csaba@uni-mate.hu,,,Ministry of Human Resources of Hungary [EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00005],Ministry of Human Resources of Hungary,This work was supported by the Ministry of Human Resources of Hungary (EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00005).,,118,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,22,,,,,,15479,10.3390/su142215479,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142215479,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6K8SZ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000887765800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, several characteristics of CC technologies are analysed, the negative environmental impacts of CO2 emissions are highlighted, policies that have recently been adopted to decrease GHG emissions are discussed, and state-of-the-art post-combustion CC, pre-combustion CC, and oxyfuel combustion CC technologies are reviewed. Furthermore, this study investigates and compares the three most common carbon separation techniques, namely, absorption, adsorption, and membrane methods. Through the investigation of the CC technologies, we discuss the practicality of implementing such methods and discuss specific case studies that have implemented CC technologies. Furthermore, we summarise ways of utilising the end-product (the captured carbon) of these technologies. Much research has gone into investigating the negative environmental impacts that are currently arising.

Not only do they provide an evocative link to the beliefs of our ancestors, but also they are iconic to Britain and have major economic and tourism value. However, despite their past immutability, ASMs are under increasing pressure from human-agro-industrial activity and changing climatic conditions, and are growing in disrepair at accelerating rates. Although some scientific information on stone resilience exists, most does not readily apply to ASMs because of bias towards built environments; therefore, critical gaps exist in our understanding of what regulates their deterioration in rural landscapes. As such, an urgent need exists to understand better the decay of ASMs and to develop proactive safeguarding strategies. This paper will evaluate the current information relating to the decay of ancient stone monuments in rural settings and place this in the context of climate change. The paper will conclude with a recommendation regarding the development of a Condition Assessment and Risk Evaluation (CARE) scheme to formalise condition assessments, prioritise management interventions, and predict the resilience of ASMs.","[Giesen, M.

However, with advances in instrumentation and techniques, it is now possible to apply Raman lidar to the monitoring of atmospheric water vapor, aerosols and clouds throughout the diurnal cycle. Upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric measurements of water vapor using Raman lidar are also possible but are limited to nighttime and require long integration times. However, boundary layer studies of water vapor variability can now be performed with high temporal and spatial resolution. This paper will review the current state-of-the-art of Raman lidar for high-resolution measurements of the atmospheric water vapor, aerosol and cloud fields. In particular, we describe the use of Raman lidar for mapping the vertical distribution and variability of atmospheric water vapor, aerosols and clouds throughout the evolution of dynamic meteorological events. The ability of Raman lidar to detect and characterize water in the region of the tropopause and the importance of high-altitude water vapor for climate-related studies and meteorological satellite performance are discussed.

(Armillaria s.s. and Desarmillaria) has a worldwide distribution and plays a central role in the dynamics of numerous woody ecosystems, including natural forests, tree plantations for timber production, orchards, vineyards and gardens. Early studies have shown that all Armillaria species are capable of degrading dead woody substrates, causing white rot. Moreover, most species exhibit a parasitic ability, and can be considered as facultative necrotrophs. Although over the years extensive research has been conducted on the phylogeny, biology and ecology of different Armillaria species, numerous theoretical and applied questions remain open. Recently published studies have provided new perspectives, the most significant of which we present in this review. First, new investigations have highlighted the importance of a multilocus approach for depicting the phylogeny of the genus Armillaria. Second, the importance of clonality and sexuality for the different species is now better described, enabling a more accurate prediction of population dynamics in various environments. Third, genome sequencing has provided new insights into genome evolution and the genetic basis of pathogenicity and wood degradation ability. Fourth, several new studies have pointed out the possible influence of climate change on Armillaria distribution, biology and ecology, raising questions regarding the future evolution of Armillaria species and their effect on ecosystems. In this review, we also give a state-of-the-art overview of the control possibilities of parasitic Armillaria species. Finally, we outline some still open questions in Armillaria research, the investigation of which will strongly benefit from recent methodological advances.","[Heinzelmann, Renate] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Dutech, Cyril; Soularue, Jean-Paul] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, BIOGECO, UMR 1202, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33610 Cestas, France; [Tsykun, Tetyana; Prospero, Simone] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Labbe, Frederic] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, 100 Galvin Life Sci Ctr, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","University of British Columbia; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Notre Dame","Heinzelmann, R (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",renate.heinzelmann@ubc.ca,"Labbé, Frédéric/AAA-4623-2020","Labbé, Frédéric/0000-0002-4064-2361",,,,,225,29,29,8,88,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0706-0661,1715-2992,,CAN J PLANT PATHOL,Can.

We use the Rally to Restore Sanity,'' hosted by Jon Stewart of The Daily Show, as an exemplar. Through a combination of an academic essay and a short film, we examine the voice of participants at the rally, who questioned the polarized climate of the modern television industry.

The CLASS modelling framework, its components and their algorithms are described in a detailed technical report (Tuteja et al., 2004; available for download from Catchment Modelling Toolkit website http://www.toolkit.net.au/class). CLASS can be used to predict land-use effects at paddock, hillslope and catchment scales. Effects of climate scenarios predicted by stochastic climate models as well as the effects of spatio-temporal climate variations within a catchment can also be analysed. CLASS can be used for water balance, solute balance, vegetation growth and terrain modelling. Recharge-discharge dynamics, lateral flow and streamflow can also be modelled using CLASS. CLASS uses bottom-up modelling approach and offers an alternative to the commonly used simple top down modelling approaches. Distinctive features of CLASS include grid cell based analysis and the ability to allow for interactions within the model structure between energy (turbulent and radiation exchange), vertical and horizontal redistribution of soil moisture, plant growth, surface and groundwater fluxes, transport of conservative solutes and streamflow routing. Sufficient tools and databases exist in the CLASS framework that can be used for generating the information generally not available for catchment scale implementations (eg. flow path, soil depth, climate zoning, pedotransfer functions etc.). Tools in the CLASS modelling framework can be implemented easily at the hillslope scale. However, at the catchment scale, CLASS is a computationally demanding modelling approach and requires good understanding of the modelling concepts. New South Wales Department of Natural Resources has developed the CLASS framework. The work formed part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology (CRCCH) Associate Project. CLASS is supported by a windows based user friendly graphical users interface (GUI). It is fully object oriented and has been developed on Microsoft. Net platform. Considerable effort has been made in representing vegetation growth as well as in the pathways that water takes from hillslope to stream. The framework consists of seven tools of which three are available for free download from the CRCCH Catchment Modelling Toolkit website (about 430 downloads to date). Three other CLASS modelling tools would be available through the Toolkit web site by December 2005 and the catchment model would be available by June 2006. All modelling tools in the CLASS framework (with the exception of 3PG+) have been developed as an integral part of CLASS using comprehensive and published scientific methods. State of the art numerical, scientific and software development technologies have been used. CLASS has been peer reviewed by experts in distributed eco-hydrological modelling.","[Tuteja, N.

Consequently, the need to develop and optimize remediation strategies such as pump and treat is indispensable. An effective and efficient strategy can reduce the spread of contaminants and cost of clean-up. However, developing such a strategy is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty and sequential nature of the problem. For example, taking actions such as drilling wells is interwoven with information gathering over time. In this paper, we formulate the groundwater remediation planning and decision problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A POMDP formulation allows planning by optimizing the trade-off between information gathering and the performance of possible future scenarios. We use a state-of-the-art POMDP solver called DESPOT for planning remediation strategies. The results show that DESPOT can yield much better remediation strategies than hand crafted heuristics and optimization methods. The superior performance of DESPOT is due to the incorporation of both previous information and future reward into the current decision. We also demonstrate the robustness of the POMDP formulation to measurement error.","[Wang, Yizheng; Zechner, Markus; Caers, Jef Karel] Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Earth Resources Forecasting, Dept Geol Sci, Doerr Sch Sustainabil, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mern, John Michael; Kochenderfer, Mykel J.] Stanford Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Stanford Intelligent Syst Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Wang, YZ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yizhengw@stanford.edu,,,,,,,41,1,1,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0309-1708,1872-9657,,ADV WATER RESOUR,Adv.

It analyzes the way the author describes the physical, environmental and human elements of the Italian territory in his travel report, among them the geology, relief, botany, climate, land use, art and culture of that country. In his narrative, Goethe often opposes the characteristics and conditions found throughout his expedition with those existing in Germany. In the course of landscapes very different from those of his homeland, the celebrated poet finds, in the south of the Alps, environmental conditions much more favorable to the study of nature, in view of the lower latitudes, the less frigid thermal conditions and the more luxuriant vegetation of the Mediterranean Region, as we tried to emphasize in the title of this article. The event of the journey is analyzed in the context of Goethe's biography, and it is concluded that the period that he spent in Italy, between 1786 and 1788, determined his formation as a natural scientist, providing him with materials, ideas and inspiration for the further development of various researches around nature.","[Diogo Filho, Geraldo Jose] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Programa Posgrad Solos & Nutr Plantas, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Diogo, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Programa Posgrad Solos & Nutr Plantas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",geobelisco@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,REVUES ORG,PARIS,"CENTRE SOCIOLOGIE ORGANISATIONS CSO SCIENCES PO-CNRS, 27 RUE SAINT-GUILLAUME, PARIS, 75007, FRANCE",1958-9212,,,CONFINS,Confins,,2018,,,,,,,,10.4000/confins.13118,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/confins.13118,,,17,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,HB5HO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000451090600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, climate and land-use change in headwaters have disproportionate impacts on downstream ecosystems and societies that rely on them. Despite decades of hydrological research, difficulties in observing hydrological properties across scales means that scientific knowledge of processes driving streamflow in headwaters remains limited. However, the recent emergence of two complementary technologies, drones and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, has potential to collect data at scales and resolutions needed to advance hydrological process understanding in headwaters. In this commentary, we explain how drone-based TIR can offer unique high-resolution observations of surface connectivity and headwater network dynamics across multiple spatio-temporal scales. We explore the current state-of-the-art of drones and TIR imaging in the hydrological sciences, highlighting the potential benefits but also steps that will need to be taken to release these technologies' full potential.

WWTPs are characteristically heterogeneous (in size, technology, climate, function ...) which limits the correct application of DEA. This paper proposes and describes the Robust Energy Efficiency DEA (REED) in its various stages, a systematic state-of-the-art methodology aimed at including exogenous variables in nonparametric frontier models and especially designed for WWTP operation. In particular, the methodology systematizes the modelling process by presenting an integrated framework for selecting the correct variables and appropriate models, possibly tackling the effect of exogenous factors. As a result, the application of REED improves the quality of the efficiency estimates and hence the significance of benchmarking. For the reader's convenience, this article is presented as a step-by-step guideline to guide the user in the determination of WWTPs energy efficiency from beginning to end. The application and benefits of the developed methodology are demonstrated by a case study related to the comparison of the energy efficiency of a set of 399 WWTPs operating in different countries and under heterogeneous environmental conditions.

Is photosynthesis enhanced or depressed by frequent light fluctuations and how? These long-lasting questions are still under debate. A great diversity of responses has been documented relative to the spatial and temporal scale of study, the groups and species, etc. The answers to these questions probably lie in the interplay between fast photoregulation and longer term photoacclimation whose framework (amplitude, kinetics) is defined by environmental genetic adaptation. One of the main photoregulatory processes is the light-dependent operation of the so-called xanthophyll cycle (XC). XC is activated when the incident light becomes excessive with respect to its optimum necessary for maximization of photosynthesis. The present paper aims at (i) describing a short state-of-the-art on the XC functioning in microalgae with an ecophysiological point of view, (ii) discussing the relevance of the in situ XC operation and its response to the underwater light climate, (iii) addressing a series of open questions for filling the gap between XC functional features and field studies with respect to its role in the photophysiology of microalgae and its potential use for characterizing the hydrodynamics of water bodies.","[Brunet, Christophe] Stn Zool A Dohrn, Lab Ecol & Evolut Plankton, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Lavaud, Johann] Univ La Rochelle, Inst Coastal & Environm Res ILE, CNRS, UMR 6250 LIENSS, F-17000 La Rochelle, France",Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); La Rochelle Universite,"Brunet, C (corresponding author), Stn Zool A Dohrn, Lab Ecol & Evolut Plankton, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",christophe.brunet@szn.it; johann.lavaud@univ-lr.fr,"brunet, christophe/AAD-7817-2021; Lavaud, Johann/N-6185-2014","Lavaud, Johann/0000-0002-4704-2502",National French Institute for Scientific Research-CNRS; French consortium CPER-Littoral; German Research Foundation-DFG [LA 2368/2-1],National French Institute for Scientific Research-CNRS; French consortium CPER-Littoral; German Research Foundation-DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"C.B. work is supported by the Stazione Zoologica A.

Here we use a quality-controlled dataset of in situ observations, global reanalyses, and a long record of global mean surface temperature to constrain both recent and future changes in global mean total precipitable water. Most state-of-the-art global climate models tend to exaggerate the projected atmospheric moistening, in line with their overestimation of global warming and of the sensitivity of atmospheric humidity to both anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols across the 20(th) century. A 39% narrowing in the range of the projections is obtained after applying the observational constraints, with a best-guess estimate of + 7% per degrees C of global warming. This finding provides further evidence of a substantial intensification of the global water cycle as long as global warming continues. In situ observations, reanalyses, and global mean surface temperature records constrain global mean total precipitable water projections to 7% per degrees C, which further supports substantial intensification of the water cycle due to global warming.","[Douville, Herve; Qasmi, Said; Ribes, Aurelien] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Bock, Olivier] Univ Paris Cite, IPGP, CNRS, IGN, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bock, Olivier] ENSG Geomat, IGN, F-77455 Marne La Vallee, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Douville, H (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France.",herve.douville@meteo.fr,"Bock, Olivier/B-7629-2018; Douville, Herve/H-5967-2018","Bock, Olivier/0000-0001-5980-938X; Douville, Herve/0000-0002-6074-6467",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the EUCP [776613]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under CONSTRAIN [820829],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the EUCP; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under CONSTRAIN,"The authors are grateful to all global modelling centres which have contributed to CMIP5 and CMIP6, as well as to the people in charge of the ESGF archive (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/) and of the ESPRI platform (https://mesocentre.ipsl.fr/plate-formephysique/).The study has been partly supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the EUCP (Grant Agreement 776613) and the CONSTRAIN (Grant Agreement 820829) projects.",,33,0,0,1,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-4435,,COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,Commun.

After providing a historical overview of pre-Soviet and early-Soviet receptions of Prometheus' image in Alexander Scriabin's symphony Prometheus: The Poem of Fire (Prometei: Poema Ognia, 1908-10) and in the unfinished production of the ancient Greek tragic trilogy at the Moscow Art Theatre (1925-27), I focus on the analysis of Prometheus' myth in three screen adaptations: the 1936 film Prometheus (Prometei) by Soviet Ukrainian director Ivan Kavaleridze and the animated films The Return from Olympus (Vozvrashchenie s Olimpa, 1969), and Prometheus (Prometei, 1974) by Alexandra Snezhko-Blotskaya. I demonstrate that, besides the animation films directed by Snezhko-Blotskaya, the rest of the receptions were not successful at the time of their production. I examine how the creative programs of these projects did not fit the contemporary context, institutional framework, or official ideology because of technical, aesthetical, and political reasons. I argue that the screen receptions of Prometheus' myth employed Prometheus' image to reflect on and to address the changing political and cultural climate of the Soviet Union during critical periods of its history.","[But, Ekaterina] HSE Univ, Sch Philosophy & Cultural Studies, Moscow 105066, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"But, E (corresponding author), HSE Univ, Sch Philosophy & Cultural Studies, Moscow 105066, Russia.",katbout@gmail.com,,"But, Ekaterina/0000-0001-5333-5195",,,,,101,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1759-5134,1759-5142,,CLASS RECEPT J,Class.

Therefore, there is growing interest in using hydrogen as an eco-friendly energy source. Among the diverse applications of hydrogen energy, hydrogen mobility has attracted considerable attention because it can compensate for the limitations of existing internal combustion engines and electricity-based mobility. To this end, relevant hydrogen-based infrastructure is being built in urban areas with rapid technological advancements. However, recent explosions of hydrogen charging stations in Norway and hydrogen storage tanks in South Korea have led to anxiety and the rejection of hydrogen application infrastructure. Therefore, to ensure the stability and safe operation of newly built infrastructure for hydrogen mobility in urban areas, an advanced system is required to improve existing technologies for hydrogen safety management. A hydrogen sensor is a front-line device for identifying initial hydrogen leaks and monitoring the status of hydrogen; thus, it is a building block for safety management systems. In this review, the operating principles and state-of-the-art hydrogen sensors are described by focusing on their suitability in hydrogen mobility applications based on the possibility of miniaturization and high hydrogen selectivity.","[Lee, Jun-Seo; An, Jin Woo; Lee, Seoung-Ki] Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Bae, Sukang] Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Inst Adv Composite Mat, Wonju 55324, South Korea",Pusan National University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST),"Lee, SK (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea.;Bae, S (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Inst Adv Composite Mat, Wonju 55324, South Korea.",ifriend@pusan.ac.kr; sbae@kist.re.kr,,"Bae, Sukang/0000-0002-3019-0584; Lee, Seoung-Ki/0000-0002-8786-0251",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government [2022R1F1A1072339]; Pusan National University Research Grant,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government(National Research Foundation of Korea); Pusan National University Research Grant(Pusan National University),"This work was financially supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (Grant no. 2022R1F1A1072339) and a Pusan National University Research Grant, 2021.",,64,0,0,25,25,KOREAN VACUUM SOC,SEOUL,"1616, SUNGJI HEIGHTS, 313 TEHERAN-RO, GANGNAM-KU, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",2288-6559,,,APPL SCI CONVERG TEC,Appl.

The struggle to legitimise aesthetic insights is indicative of a larger challenge: how academic disciplines discipline thought in ways that constrains innovative scholarly contributions and their potential to address concrete political problems. The essay advances an argument in favour of seeing beyond the discipline of International Relations. The international is not some higher-order realm that is separate from the rest of the social and political world. The most pressing challenges, from terrorism to climate change, are too complex to be understood as uniquely international phenomena. They implicate the local as much as the global, the psychological as much as the institutional and the relational as much as the structural. Finding practical and policy-relevant solutions to complex transnational problems requires insights from fields as diverse as psychology, neuroscience, literature, demography art and economics, to name just a few. Needed, then, is greater acceptance and support for creative approaches that can understand and address political challenges from multiple parallel perspectives and without having to adhere to preconceived disciplinary conventions.","[Bleiker, Roland] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Bleiker, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",bleiker@uq.edu.au,,"Bleiker, Roland/0000-0003-1435-2990",,,,,114,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1035-7718,1465-332X,,AUST J INT AFF,Aust.

For this purpose, a bibliometric study is carried out taking as reference the two most important scientific databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The results show that, as of 2013, there is an exponential increase in the number of publications. This is due to the fact that significant regions of the planet, such as Europe, have adopted strategies aimed at promoting the use of GI since 2013. The keyword analysis points out that ecosystem services is the most relevant concept, which shows the capacity of these infrastructures to facilitate multiple goods and services related to the water cycle.

Traditional land-cover classification methods with multi-feature extractions on specific scene perform well on a single river basin, however, poorly address inter-basin classification owing to the varied texture shown in satellite images cross river basins (e.g., topography and climates). Current transfer learning approaches with domain adaptation, which can shorten the discrepancies between two river basins, pay less attention to diversity of multi-feature extractions given by remote sensing images, which may lead to negative transfer. To better address the above challenges, this paper proposes a model known as Dual Adversarial Networks for Land-cover Classification (DANLC). Our DANLC architecture consists of two domain adversarial networks in a paralleled structure, namely RGB and texture networks, for multi-feature extractions, which are able to capture the underlying representation of satellite images from different perspectives and get invariable transfer component. Results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model in both the classification effect and robustness compared with traditional methods and state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches.","[An, Jingyi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Qian Xuesen Coll, Xian, Peoples R China; [Wei, Rongzhe] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Qian Xuesen Coll, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zha, Zhichao] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Software Engn, SPKLSTN Lab, Xian, Peoples R China; [Dong, Bo] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Distance Educ, Natl Engn Lab Big Data Analyt, Xian, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"An, JY (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Qian Xuesen Coll, Xian, Peoples R China.",ajy2000@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; jessonwrz@163.com; zzc941022@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; dong.bo@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,"Fundamental Theory and Applications of Big Data with Knowledge Engineering under the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB1000903]; MOE [IRT 17R86]; National Science Foundation of China [61721002, 61532015]; Project of SERVYOU-XJTU Joint Innovation Center of Big Tax Data; Baidu Pinecone Program",Fundamental Theory and Applications of Big Data with Knowledge Engineering under the National Key Research and Development Program of China; MOE(Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of SERVYOU-XJTU Joint Innovation Center of Big Tax Data; Baidu Pinecone Program,"This research was partially supported by The Fundamental Theory and Applications of Big Data with Knowledge Engineering under the National Key Research and Development Program of China with Grant No. 2016YFB1000903, the MOE Innovation Research Team No. IRT 17R86, the National Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61721002 and 61532015, the Baidu Pinecone Program, and Project of SERVYOU-XJTU Joint Innovation Center of Big Tax Data.",,32,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0730-3157,,978-1-7281-7303-0,P INT COMP SOFTW APP,,,2020,,,,,394,399,,10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.0-216,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.0-216,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BR0HX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000629086600053,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, while technical research and development into the feasibility of CO2 utilisation options are accelerating rapidly; at present, there has been limited research into the social acceptance of the technology and CO2-derived products. This review article outlines and explores three key dimensions of social acceptance (i.e., socio-political, market, and community acceptance) pertaining to innovation within CO2 utilisation. The article highlights the importance of considering issues of social acceptance as an aspect of the research, development, demonstration, and deployment process for CO2 utilisation and explores how key stakeholders operating on each dimension might affect the innovation pathways, investment, and siting decisions relating to CO2 utilisation facilities and CO2-derived products. Beyond providing a state-of-the-art review of current research into the social acceptance of CO2 utilisation, this article also outlines an agenda for future research in the field.","[Jones, Christopher R.; Armstrong, Katy] Univ Sheffield, UK Ctr Carbon Dioxide Utilisat CDUUK, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Christopher R.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, EBRG, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Olfe-Kraeutlein, Barbara; Naims, Henriette] IASS, Potsdam, Germany",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Jones, CR (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, UK Ctr Carbon Dioxide Utilisat CDUUK, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Jones, CR (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, EBRG, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",c.r.jones@sheffield.ac.uk,"Armstrong, Katy/AAQ-9312-2021","Armstrong, Katy/0000-0003-3827-9951; Jones, Christopher/0000-0001-9854-3334","EPSRC CO2Chem grant [EP/K007947/1]; EPSRC LifesCO2R grant [EP/N009746/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N009746/1, EP/P026435/1, EP/K007947/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/N009746/1, EP/K007947/1, EP/P026435/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC CO2Chem grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC LifesCO2R grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This article is part-funded under EPSRC CO2Chem grant EP/K007947/1 and EPSRC LifesCO2R grant EP/N009746/1.,,75,49,49,14,77,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-598X,,,FRONT ENERGY RES,Front.
