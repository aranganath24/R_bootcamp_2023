This is particularly true of conserving historic interiors where many different professional disciplines (e.g. conservator, curator, architect, engineer, and museum administrator, among others) are represented. This was certainly the case in the conservation of the McFaddin-Ward home, an early-20th-century stately mansion in Beaumont, Texas. The interior of this home is a combination of haute bourgeois and regional beaux-arts, with elaborate painted fabric walls, boiserie, gilded surfaces, stained glass, and historic woodwork; the most elaborate of the rooms is the Pink Parlor. The ultimate goal of the project was to turn this majestic residence into an historic house museum. This paper describes the conservation efforts necessitated by the project, and how a successful outcome was achieved through a positive working relationship among all involved. The initial difficulties and setbacks to the project taught us, as conservators, that other professionals will not understand our profession unless we explain our purpose clearly. Within the framework of such a complex project to conserve and restore cultural property, it took a plea for common sense and understanding to retain as much of the original building fabric as possible while still meeting the multiple requirements of making a private home into a climate-controlled modem house museum. Working as a team that goal was achieved.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53701 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,CANADIAN CONSERVATION INST,OTTAWA,"1030 INNES RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0M5, CANADA",,,0-660-18147-9,,,,2000,,,,,145,148,,,,,,4,Architecture; Construction & Building Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Construction & Building Technology,BX76S,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000186347200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, we investigated the relative importance of different ecophysiological processes on the determination of the community structure, focusing both on the bottom-up and the top-down controls. The models reasonably reproduced the observed global distribution and seasonal variation of phytoplankton biomass. The fraction of diatoms with respect to the total phytoplankton biomass increases with the magnitude of the spring bloom in all models. However, the governing mechanisms differ between models, despite the fact that current PFT models represent ecophysiological processes using the same types of parameterizations. The increasing trend in the percentage of diatoms with increasing bloom magnitude is mainly caused by a stronger nutrient dependence of diatom growth compared to nanophytoplankton (bottom-up control). The difference in the maximum growth rate plays an important role in NEMURO and PlankTOM5 and determines the absolute values of the percentage of diatoms during the bloom. In CCSM-BEC, the light dependency of growth plays an important role in the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. The grazing pressure by zooplankton (top-down control), however, strongly contributes to the dominance of diatoms in PISCES and CCSM-BEC. The regional differences in the percentage of diatoms in PlankTOM5 are mainly determined by top-down control. These differences in the mechanisms suggest that the response of marine ecosystems to climate change could significantly differ among models, even if the present-day ecosystem is reproduced to a similar degree of confidence. For further understanding of plankton competition and for the prediction of future change in marine ecosystems, it is important to understand the relative differences in each physiological rate and life history rate in the bottom-up and the top-down controls between PFTs.","[Hashioka, T.; Yamanaka, Y.; Hirata, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan; [Hashioka, T.; Le Quere, C.; Buitenhuis, E.

This provision of public goods is generally accepted as a justification for public intervention in a market economy. Ever since the reform in 1985, Common Agricultural Policy has been targeted to enhance the provision of public goods. A recent CAP reform introduced the Green Direct Payment - a new policy instrument in Pillar 1 - which remunerates farmers for the provision of environmental public goods. However, there are also instruments in Pillar II that support the provision of environmental goods, including social public goods. The paper addresses these issues and focuses on public goods provided by Czech agriculture. The research question is focused on the possibility of economically valuating all these goods together using one valuation method. The research questions will be answered by designating public goods in agriculture and specifying the most used method of their valuation. A precise literature survey will be conducted, previous studies and scientific publications will be compared, and the results of ecological, biological and economic research will be linked. The final state of art will be used as a basis for calculating a level of subsidy that covers the production of agricultural public goods.","[Halova, Pavlina; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova; Havlikova, Michaela; Cechura, Lukas; Maly, Michal] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Halova, P (corresponding author), CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",halova@pef.czu.cz,"Kroupová, Zdeňka Žáková/H-1993-2018; Havlikova, Michaela/H-5272-2018; Hálová, Pavlína/H-6831-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; Malý, Michal/GXF-9941-2022; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018; Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018","Kroupová, Zdeňka Žáková/0000-0001-5834-3338; Havlikova, Michaela/0000-0002-2694-3862; Hálová, Pavlína/0000-0003-2236-3227; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874; Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895",,,,,100,6,6,0,20,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,145,158,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000373210600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Plant communities ranged with elevation, and consistently with art increase of precipitation and a decrease of temperature, from oak forest to beech Sorest. One transect was made on siliceous parent material (schists, limolites) and the other on calcareous material (marls, limestones). Pedogenic carbonate content, absent in the siliceous transect, decreased with the increase of elevation. The pH, cation exchange capacity, and clay content were higher in the calcareous transect than in the siliceous transect. The exchangeable complex was always saturated in the calcareous toposequence but, in the siliceous sequence, deer-eased with the increase of elevation. An increase of organic matter content and C/N ratio were observed with elevation, especially in the siliceous transect. The humus type was lime mull along the entire calcareous toposequence, while different transition types of humus between mull and moder were described in the siliceous toposequence. A decrease of exchangeable cations with depth, especially in the siliceous transect, was observed. The main genetic features in the soils studied were melanization and decarbonatation-recarbonatation processes in the calcareous transect and desaturation processes in the siliceous transect.

However, the experimental analyses of the ejector-based system have only been performed for system performance evaluation, mapping the performance of ejectors or validation of the ejector numerical simulation. Therefore, the main goal/scope of this paper is to enhance the experimental knowledge of the state-of-the-art R744 vapour compression rack equipped with an efficient two-phase ejector, the relationship between the ejector and other components, and the influence of unsteady system work on the ejector performance and cooling demand. The test campaign was carried out on the R744 ejector-based test rig with a cooling capacity of 50 kW, high-side pressures from 60 bar to 100 bar and temperatures from 15 degrees C to 40 degrees C. The experimental analysis was conducted for three different system operating conditions, namely, short-term, long-term, and unsteady-state conditions, for refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. Utilisation of the ejector influenced the system instability, especially at the internal heat exchanger control. In addition, the low-pressure lift below 4 bar allowed the most efficient control strategy of the cooling demand for the operation below the critical point. For the transcritical unsteady operation, the most efficient operation was obtained for the defined pressure lift of 6 bar.","[Haida, Michal; Palacz, Michal; Bodys, Jakub; Smolka, Jacek; Nowak, Andrzej J.] Silesian Tech Univ, Dept Thermal Technol, Konarskiego 22, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland; [Gullo, Paride] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Mech Engn, Nils Koppels Alle 403, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Silesian University of Technology; Technical University of Denmark,"Haida, M (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Dept Thermal Technol, Konarskiego 22, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.",Michal.Haida@polsl.pl,"Palacz, Michal MP/M-2563-2015; Palacz, Michal/M-5293-2019; Gullo, Paride/A-8720-2019; Haida, Michal/GLV-1134-2022","Palacz, Michal MP/0000-0002-7222-6303; Palacz, Michal/0000-0002-7222-6303; Gullo, Paride/0000-0001-9256-875X; Haida, Michal/0000-0002-4592-6275; Bodys, Jakub/0000-0002-0852-8470","National Centre of Science [2017/27/B/ST8/00945]; SUT [08/060/RGJ20/0253, 08/060/BKM20/0273]",National Centre of Science; SUT,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Centre of Science through project No. 2017/27/B/ST8/00945.

To identify the behaviors and beliefs of these teachers, the researcher conducted classroom observations and interviews with the teachers and their principals. The information gathered was coded and triangulated, and then reported by themes. The findings revealed that participating teachers believed that all students could and would learn, and that student learning was a direct reflection of their teaching. They also believed that for learning to take place, teachers engaged in their own professional learning and provided appropriate instruction. Professional learning included collaborating with colleagues and analyzing student data. Appropriate instruction included behaviors that engaged students in learning activities and provided a positive class climate. The findings of this study will contribute to teachers' and school principals' understanding of behaviors and beliefs of effective teachers.

The boundary conditions of the simulation are specified according to preindustrial conditions and are kept constant from year to year. It is shown that long lasting (similar to 20 years) positive and negative anomalies of the northern winter stratospheric polar vortex exist in the simulation. Given that there are no externally imposed low frequency time variations, these persistent variations are due to internal dynamical processes of the modeled coupled atmosphere ocean system. By composite analysis, it is shown that the long lasting stratospheric vortex anomalies are connected through the troposphere to mean sea level pressure, surface temperature and sea ice cover anomalies. These connections are reminiscent of intra-seasonal stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Over the ocean, the surface temperature and sea ice cover anomalies are indicative of the delayed Atlantic meridional overturning circulation response to atmospheric forcing. The latter is indeed found to be anomalously strong/weak during the long lasting positive/negative stratospheric vortex anomalies, providing evidence for a potential role of the stratosphere in decadal prediction.

The impact of particular matter on both human health and global climate has long been recognized. Despite its importance, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the formation and evolution of SOA in the atmosphere. This study uses a modeling approach to understand the preferred partitioning behavior of SOA species into aqueous or organic condensed phases. More specifically, this work uses statistical analyses of approximately 24,000 data values for each variable from a state of the art 3D airshed model. Spatial and temporal distributions of fractions of SOA residing in the aqueous phase (fAQ) in the South Coast Air Basin of California are presented. Typical values of fAQ within the basin near the surface range from 5 to 80%. Results show that the likelihood of large fAQ values is inversely proportional to the total SOA loading. Analysis of various meteorological parameters indicates that large fAQ values are predicted because modeled aqueous-phase SOA formation is less sensitive than that of organic-phase SOA to atmospheric conditions that are not conducive to SOA formation. There is a diurnal variation of fAQ near the surface: It tends to be larger during daytime hours than during nighttime hours. Results also indicate that the largest fAQ values are simulated in layers above ground level at night. In summary, one must consider SOA in both organic and aqueous phases for proper regional and global SOA budget estimation.","[Chang, Wayne L.; Dabdub, Donald] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Griffin, Robert J.] Rice Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Rice University,"Dabdub, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",ddabdub@uci.edu,,"Griffin, Robert/0000-0001-7682-8769",AirUCI Environmental Molecular Science Institute; National Science Foundation [CHE-431512],AirUCI Environmental Molecular Science Institute; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported in part by the AirUCI Environmental Molecular Science Institute, funded by National Science Foundation Grant CHE-431512.",,23,14,14,4,24,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

A quantitative experimental measure of the state of the art and variations therein is a first step towards establishing principles of bicycle helmet ventilation. A thermal headform mounted in a climate-regulated wind tunnel was used to study the ventilation efficiency of 24 bicycle helmets at two wind speeds. Flow visualization in a water tunnel with a second headform demonstrated the flow patterns involved. The influence of design details such as channel length and vent placement was studied, as well as the impact of hair. Differences in heat transfer among the helmets of up to 30% (scalp) and 10% (face) were observed, with the nude headform showing the highest values. On occasion, a negative role of some vents for forced convection was demonstrated. A weak correlation was found between the projected vent cross-section and heat transfer variations when changing the head tilt angle. A simple analytical model is introduced that facilitates the understanding of forced convection phenomena. A weak correlation between exposed scalp area and heat transfer was deduced. Adding a wig reduces the heat transfer by approximately a factor of 8 in the scalp region and up to one-third for the rest of the head for a selection of the best ventilated helmets. The results suggest that there is significant optimization potential within the basic helmet structure represented in modern bicycle helmets.","Empa, CH-9014 St Gallen, Switzerland; ETH, Inst Fluiddynam, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bruhwiler, PA (corresponding author), Empa, Lerchenfeldstr 5, CH-9014 St Gallen, Switzerland.",paul.bruehwiler@empa.ch,"MOORE-MILLAR, KARENA/A-9015-2012; Bogerd, Cornelis Peter/B-4430-2008",,,,,,29,34,34,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-0414,,,J SPORT SCI,J.

The evolution of stabilization in the past quarter century is illustrated with data generated with polyolefin tapes, multifilaments, films and plaques. The state-of-the-art, based on combinations of light stabilizers, mainly combinations of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) is discussed. The light stability data are generated either in various accelerated weathering devices or outdoors in various climates. Correlation between the various accelerated devices on the one hand and between accelerated and natural weathering data on the other hand was the subject of many publications. It is still one of the major problems encountered in assessing the durability of plastic materials for outdoor use. It is found that, even with adequate precautions concerning the light source and its intensity as well as sample temperature, correlation between natural and artificial weathering is the exception rather than the rule. Therefore, another model for lifetime forecasting is proposed. It is based on the quantitative laws deduced for HALS performance in polyolefins. They are, linear increase of performance with HALS concentration in PP and linear increase with the square root of HALS concentration in PE-HD. Then, the knowledge of the effect of one HALS concentration on outdoor weathering with a given polymer and sample form allows prediction of the lifetime with other HALS concentrations. As a consequence, the problem of lifetime forecasting is reduced to an analytical problem, i.e. determination of the stabilizer system.",,,"GUGUMUS, F (corresponding author), CIBA GEIGY AG,CH-4002 BASEL,SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,,15,53,54,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0141-3910,,,POLYM DEGRAD STABIL,Polym.

Despite of the close relationship between process planning and scheduling, existing research efforts often consider energy efficiency-related issues by treating them separately and sequentially. This may cause various problems such as unbalanced resource allocation and infeasible production solutions, thus limiting their potential application. To advance the current state of the art in this area, this paper investigates energy-efficient integration of process planning and scheduling. Specifically, a mixed-integer linear programming model is firstly developed to formulate this problem mathematically. Subsequently, to solve more realistic large-sized problems, a heuristic-based two-stage approach is proposed. Stage 1 and Stage 2 aim at minimizing the total tardiness and reducing the total energy consumption, respectively. A realistic case study shows that the proposed two-stage approach works more efficiently and effectively than a modified genetic algorithm from existing literature. Through instructive modification of the solution space, the proposed approach can effectively reduce the total tardiness and total energy consumption; meanwhile the machining cost of individual process plans can also be kept at low level throughout the searching process. Results show that the proposed approach can allocate the machining resources in a more reasonable manner. As such, this paper may be a valuable supplement to existing efforts aiming at developing energy-efficient manufacturing techniques.","[Liu, N.; Zhang, Y. F.; Lu, W.

In this paper, we provide the state-of-the-art of the theme of escarpment retreat, reviewing both the classic contributions, often forgotten but important case studies, and the latest research. In separate parts of the paper we discuss: (1) terminology applied to the geomorphology of escarpments; (2) the main assumptions and pathways of long-term evolution of escarpments, including conceptual models presented so far; (3) processes involved in cliff retreat, mainly weathering, mass movements and erosion; (4) the role of spring erosion and fluvial processes, leading to fluvial dissection and development of canyons present in many tablelands; (5) the possible role of climate change in escarpment evolution; (6) rates of escarpment retreat In conclusions, we summarize the major advances in our understanding of escarpment evolution of the last two-three decades such as the recognition of the key role of emerging groundwater in non-uniform escarpment retreat, of an important role of silica dissolution and underground removal of dissolved solids, increasing appreciation of rock properties in governing the patterns of escarpment retreat, the proposal that cliffs do not necessarily retreat via catastrophic rock slope failures but may disintegrate in situ, and the first attempts to date escarpment retreat using cosmogenic isotopes. Finally, the remaining gaps and possible research priorities for the future are identified.","[Duszynski, Filip; Migon, Piotr; Strzelecki, Mateusz C.] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Geog & Reg Dev, Pl Uniwersytecki 1, PL-50137 Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Duszynski, F (corresponding author), Univ Wroclaw, Inst Geog & Reg Dev, Pl Uniwersytecki 1, PL-50137 Wroclaw, Poland.",filip.duszynski@uwr.edu.pl; piotr.migon@uwr.edu.pl; mateusz.strzelecki@uwr.edu.pl,"Strzelecki, Mateusz C/Y-9851-2019; Migoń, Piotr/AAU-9514-2021","Strzelecki, Mateusz C/0000-0003-0479-3565; Duszynski, Filip/0000-0002-7094-9727; Migon, Piotr/0000-0001-5232-7476","National Science Centre, Poland [2014/15/N/ST10/00828, 2017/24/T/ST10/00101]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","We are grateful to four journal reviewers for insightful comments and suggestions which helped us to improve the paper.

Because of aging, colloids can undergo dramatic changes in their physicochemical properties once in the soil environment, thus leading to diverse or even unpredictable environmental behaviour and fate. Herein, we provide a state-of-art review of colloid aging mechanisms and characteristics and implications for risk mitigation. First, we review aging-induced formation of colloidal contaminants and aging-associated changes. We place a special focus on emerging nanoplastic (NP) contaminants and associated physical, chemical, and biological aging processes in soil environments. Second, we assess aging and survival features of colloidal pathogens, especially viruses. Viruses in soils may survive from several days to months, or even several years in groundwater, depending on their rates of inactivation and the reversibility of attachment. Furthermore, we identify implications for risk mitigation based on aging mechanisms. Hotspots of (photo)chemical aging of NPs, including plastic gauzes at construction sites and randomly discarded plastic waste in rural areas, are identified as area requiring greater research attention. For COVID-19, we suggest taking greater care in regions where viruses are persist for long periods, such as cold climate regions. Soil amendment with quicklime (CaO) may act as an effective means for pathogen disinfection. Future risk mitigation of colloidal contaminants and pathogens relies on a better understanding of aging mechanisms and more sophisticated models accurately depicting processes in real soil environments.","[Wang, Liuwei; Hu, Zhongtao; Yin, Hanbing; Hou, Deyi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zhongtao] Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Yin, Hanbing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bradford, Scott A.] ARS, USDA, Sustainable Agr Water Syst Unit, Davis, CA USA; [Luo, Jian] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Tsinghua University; University of Melbourne; Beijing Forestry University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Hou, DY (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",houdeyi@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wang, Liuwei/AAK-4902-2020; Hou, Deyi/B-1030-2016","Wang, Liuwei/0000-0002-6176-6056; Hou, Deyi/0000-0002-0511-5806",Guangxi Key Research and Development Program [GUIKE AB22035036],Guangxi Key Research and Development Program,This work was supported by the Guangxi Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. GUIKE AB22035036).,,183,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-0032,1475-2743,,SOIL USE MANAGE,Soil Use Manage.,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/sum.12849,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12849,,22-Oct,22,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,5M4VU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000871095600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is traditionally used in the building sector, where it has gained importance in recent years as a sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. Additionally, it is the basis for the development of novel bio-based functional materials. However, wood's sustainability as a green resource is often diminished by unsustainable processing and modification techniques. They mostly rely on fossil-based precursors and yield inseparable hybrids and composites that cannot be reused or recycled. In this article, we discuss the state of the art of environmental sustainability in wood science and technology. We give an overview of established and upcoming approaches for the sustainable production of wood-based materials. This comprises wood protection and adhesion for the building sector, as well as the production of sustainable wood-based functional materials. Moreover, we elaborate on the end of lifetime perspective of wood products. The concept of wood cascading is presented as a possibility for a more efficient use of the resource to increase its beneficial impact on climate change mitigation. We advocate for a holistic approach in wood science and technology that not only focuses on the material's development and production but also considers recycling and end of lifetime perspectives of the products.

At least one major flood disaster does occur yearly. The recurring incidences of flooding and associated calamitous socio-economic risks and anticipated increase of its prevalence soon in cities of developing countries such as Ghana have necessitated an intelligence system to offer efficient and early warning of its occurrence.

Attitude toward the universe and its phenomena has been raised since far past in ancient cultures and worldviews. It should note that human and nature are considered as architectural system environment. Because this system is firmly related to its environment, its great number of environmental impacts makes a subsystem in the whole architectural system. Research and inference process are based on case study analysis of case studies among which Niakie neighborhood houses in Amol are chosen through all the magnificent architectural works from Qajar period. The research achievements indicate that there are the greatest effects done by using the natural materials, the natural forms as well as climate principles on the manner of natural ten deny in the architecture of houses in Qajar era. The main question in this research is how the natural systems have been expressed in the architecture of old Iranian houses descriptive analytical techniques are used in research process. The required data for theoretical formulation of the topic, which collected by Briary Method and the analysis, is given for each work by field study. This study seeks to examine how some architectural art works interact with nature by analyzing a number of architectural artifacts through stem systems, applying the natural process and obtaining appropriate natural patterns.","[Sanaei, Zohreh; Mirhadi, Jamshid; Asgharzadeh, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Architecture, ChalousBranch, Chalous, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Sanaei, Z (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Architecture, ChalousBranch, Chalous, Iran.",zohrehsanaei.architect@gmail.com; jamshid.mirhadi@gmail.com; ali.asgharzadeh@iauc.ac.ir,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,FUNDACAO UNIV TOCANTINS,PALMAS-TOCANTINS,"PRO-REITORIA PESQUISA & POS-GRADUACAO 108 SUL ALAMEDA 11 LOTE 03 CX POSTAL 173, PALMAS-TOCANTINS, CEP77020-122, BRAZIL",2358-8322,,,HUMANID INOV,Humanid.

Green technologies are still developing to provide sustainable solutions to the problems that modern cities and peri-urban areas face at an ever-increasing rate and intensity. Constructed wetlands technology is an established green multi-purpose option for water management and wastewater treatment, with numerous effectively proven applications around the world and multiple environmental and economic advantages. These systems can function as water treatment plants, habitat creation sites, urban wildlife refuges, recreational or educational facilities, landscape engineering and ecological art areas. The aim of this article is to highlight the synergies between this green technology and urban areas in order to reconnect cities with nature, to promote circularity in the urban context and to apply innovative wetland designs as landscape infrastructure and water treatment solutions. This approach could be a step further in the effort to mitigate the current degradation process of the urban landscape. Following the concept of green infrastructure, the article presents and suggests ways to integrate wetland technology in the urban environment, namely: (i) stormwater and urban runoff management (storage and treatment of water during storm events) to provide protection from flood incidents, especially considering climate change, (ii) innovative low-impact infrastructure and design solutions for urban wastewater treatment, and (iii) wetland technology for habitat creation and ecosystem services provision.","[Stefanakis, Alexandros, I] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, GR-73100 Khania, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Stefanakis, AI (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, GR-73100 Khania, Greece.",stefanakis.alexandros@gmail.com,"Stefanakis, Alexandros I./H-6523-2019","Stefanakis, Alexandros I./0000-0001-8124-1428",,,,,88,80,80,19,87,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Dec,2019,24,,,,,,6981,10.3390/su11246981,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11246981,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KC0SU,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000506899000094,View Full Record in Web of Science

Treating urban wastewaters, such as greywater and hydroponic wastewater, may represent a strategic point for the implementation of urban farming, ensuring food security, reducing pressures on water resources and promoting climate change mitigation. The WETWALL design concept proposes a unique ecotechnology for secondary wastewater treatment at an urban scale, which brings the novelty of a modular living wall hybrid flow. This concept is based on the integration of two established nature-based solutions/ecomimetic designs: constructed wetlands and a modular living walls. First presented is an overview about the state of the art in the scope of living walls treating wastewater, in order to identify the main design aspects related to the performance of such systems, which mainly concerns the removal of nitrates and phosphates. Second, the WETWALL design concept is presented. A scheme regarding the selection of the main components, such as plants and substrate, is proposed, and potential structure developments and operation strategies are discussed. In addition, considering the scope of integrating the circular economy with the design process, potential interactions between this technology and the urban environment are discussed. The main goal of this article is to substantiate the potential of the WETWALL design concept as an innovative wastewater treatment at an urban scale.","[Castellar da Cunha, Joana America; Montserrat Canals, Joan; Farreras Morato, Jordi] Univ Politecn Cataluna, UNESCO Chair Sustainabil, C Colom 1, Terrassa 08222, Spain; [Arias, Carlos A.; Carvalho, Pedro] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ole Worms Alle 1,Bldg 1135, DK-1135 Aarhus, Denmark; [Rysulova, Martina] Tech Univ Kosice, Inst Architectural Engn, Fac Civil Engn, Vysokoskolska 4, Kosice 04200, Slovakia; [Perez, Gabriel] Univ Lleida, INSPIRES Res Ctr, dGREA Innovacio Concurrent, C Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain; [Bosch Gonzalez, Montserrat] Univ Politecn Cataluna, GICITED Grp Interdisciplinar Ciencia & Tecnol Edi, Av Doctor Maranon 31, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Aarhus University; Technical University Kosice; Universitat de Lleida; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"da Cunha, JAC (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, UNESCO Chair Sustainabil, C Colom 1, Terrassa 08222, Spain.",joana.america.castellar@upc.edu; carlos.arias@bios.au.dk; pedro.carvalho@bios.au.dk; martina.rysulova@gmail.com; joan.montserrat@estudiant.upc.edu; gperez@diei.udl.cat; montserrat.bosch@upc.edu; jordi.morato@upc.edu,"Morato, Jordi/AAC-7435-2021; Bosch-Gonzalez, Montserrat/L-8170-2014; Arias, Carlos A/I-8007-2013; Perez, Gabriel/I-5444-2012; Carvalho, Pedro Neves/K-1894-2012; Carvalho, Pedro/HHN-1424-2022","Morato, Jordi/0000-0003-2588-8846; Arias, Carlos A/0000-0002-6628-7564; Perez, Gabriel/0000-0002-4440-5312; Carvalho, Pedro Neves/0000-0002-7131-9102; Castellar da Cunha, Joana America/0000-0003-2362-4417; Bosch Gonzalez, Montserrat/0000-0001-5908-1288",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - Brazil (CNPQ); research group GREA [2014 SGR 123]; research group DIOPMA [2014 SGR 1543]; research group GICITED [2014 SGR 1298],National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - Brazil (CNPQ)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); research group GREA; research group DIOPMA; research group GICITED,"Biggest thanks to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - Brazil (CNPQ), for their financial support (doctoral fellowship).

However, many state-of-the-art ocean observing system (OOS) technologies are operationally constrained in shallow coastal waters. Texas A&M University (TAMU) researchers are overcoming the constraint by combining traditional platforms with modern shipboard OOS. Shipboard observations provide the spatial context and are complemented by moored observations providing the temporal context of spatial observations. In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GUM), OOS provide researchers with large, continuous spatial and temporal data sets to investigate naturally occurring environmental events. The summer of 2010 has been a unique season for researchers in the GUM with the British Petroleum oil spill off the Louisiana coast and the shift of seasonal wind and precipitation events along the western GUM coastline impacting the formation and sustainability of a common hazard on the Texas-Louisiana shelf-hypoxia. Such events have and are currently emphasizing an environmental revitalization of coastal GUM OOS to better monitor and predict unexpected events directly impacting coastal waters. This manuscript describes TAMU's existing interdisciplinary operating OOS and supplemental instrumentation added to address spatial and temporal scales of northern GUM coastal hazards. Details also will be included in TAMU's future directions as an OOS leader on the Texas shelf and in how OOS plays vital role in community education and awareness of the coastal oceans.","[Mullins, R.

CO2 is emitted in all the operational units of conventional WWTPs and even after the disposal of treated effluents and sludges. CO2 emissions from wastewater can be captured or mitigated by several technologies such as the production of biochar from sludge, the application of constructed wetlands (CWs), the treatment of wastewater in microbial electrochemical processes (microbial electrosynthesis, MES; microbial electrolytic carbon capture, MECC; in microbial carbon capture, MCC), and via microalgal cultivation. Sludge-to-biochar and CW systems showed a high cost-effectiveness in the capture of CO2, while MES, MECC, MCC technologies, and microalgal cultivation offered efficient capture of CO2 with associate production of value-added by-products. At the state-of-the-art, these technologies, utilized for carbon capture and utilization from wastewater, require more research for further configuration, development and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the integration of these technologies has a potential internal rate of return (IRR) that could equate the operation or provide additional revenue to wastewater management. In the context of circular economy, these carbon capture technologies will pave theway for new sustainable concepts of WWTPs, as an essential element for the mitigation of climate change fostering the transition to a decarbonised economy.

By analyzing available modern literature sources, it can be seen that the swarm intelligence metaheuristics have obtained significant results in this domain. Research that is presented in this paper is aimed towards achieving further improvements in solving the wireless sensor networks localization problem by employing swarm intelligence. To accomplish this goal, we have improved basic versions of the tree growth algorithm and the elephant herding optimization swarm intelligence metaheuristics and applied them to solve the wireless sensor networks localization problem. In order to determine whether the improvements are accomplished, we have conducted empirical experiments on different sizes of sensor networks ranging from 25 to 150 target nodes, for which distance measurements are corrupted by Gaussian noise. Comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms that have been already tested on the same problem instance, the butterfly optimization algorithm, the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the firefly algorithm, is conducted. Simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms can obtain more consistent and accurate locations of the unknown target nodes in wireless sensor networks topology than other approaches that have been proposed in the literature.","[Strumberger, Ivana; Tuba, Milan; Bacanin, Nebojsa] Singidunum Univ, Fac Informat & Comp, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11010, Serbia; [Minovic, Miroslav] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11010, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Bacanin, N (corresponding author), Singidunum Univ, Fac Informat & Comp, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11010, Serbia.",istrumberger@singidunum.ac.rs; miroslav.minovic@fon.bg.ac.rs; tuba@ieee.org; nbacanin@singidunum.ac.rs,"Bacanin, Nebojsa/L-5328-2019; Tuba, Milan/B-6779-2009","Bacanin, Nebojsa/0000-0002-2062-924X; Minovic, Miroslav/0000-0002-4270-7595; Tuba, Milan/0000-0003-3794-3056; Strumberger, Ivana/0000-0002-1154-6696",Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Serbia [III-44006],"Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This research is supported by Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Serbia, Grant No. III-44006.",,62,58,58,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,1-Jun,2019,11,,,,,,2515,10.3390/s19112515,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19112515,,,30,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,IE1GF,31159373,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000472133300093,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the other hand, the investigation of phase change materials (PCMs) in the building sector was tested consisting a very promising field of research and development. A number of substances have been tested as potential PCMs; however, only few of them have been further developed for commercial purposes. This is attributed to a number of thermophysical barriers, which make the applications of PCMs in buildings difficult. Several studies have examined the potential of PCM use, either incorporated into building envelopes or in heating and cooling applications. Regarding building envelope applications, PCMs are used to mainly ensure indoor thermal comfort and contribute to energy performance. The positive impact of PCMs on the building's annual cooling and heating loads in various climate zones is a common conclusion. Concerning heating and cooling applications, the main idea has been to substitute the storage medium with PCMs, which have higher storage capacity. Hence, the use of PCMs can be considered as scientifically mature, although there are still technical, environmental, and economic barriers. The present study is the state of the art of the existing research of PCM for thermal applications taking into consideration environmental (based mainly on life cycle analysis methodology) and economic performance (accounting to life cycle cost analysis methodology) criteria, while excluding solar power generation applications.","[Kyriaki, Elli; Konstantinidou, Christina; Giama, Effrosyni; Papadopoulos, Agis M.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Sch Engn, Univ Campus, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Kyriaki, E (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Sch Engn, Univ Campus, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",kelli@auth.gr,"GammaIotaAlphaMuAlpha, EpsilonUpsilonPhiRhoOmicronSigmaUpsilonNuEta/AAO-3254-2021; Papadopoulos, Agis/AAO-3274-2021; Papadopoulos, Agis/AAG-5174-2020","Papadopoulos, Agis/0000-0002-4470-8903; Konstantinidou, Christina A./0000-0003-3134-700X",,,,,91,36,36,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Although those events are well described in non-assimilatory ocean simulations, the recent appearance of a massive open ocean polynya in the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II reanalysis product (ECCO2) raises questions on which mechanisms are responsible for those spurious events and whether they are also present in other state-of-the-art assimilatory reanalysis products. To investigate this issue, we evaluate how three recently released high-resolution ocean reanalysis products form AABW in their simulations. We found that two of the products create AABW by open ocean deep convection events in the Weddell Sea that are triggered by the interaction of sea ice with the Warm Deep Water, which shows that the assimilation of sea ice is not enough to avoid the appearance of open ocean polynyas. The third reanalysis, My Ocean University Reading UR025.4, creates AABW using a rather dynamically accurate mechanism. The UR025.4 product depicts both continental shelf convection and the export of Dense Shelf Water to the open ocean. Although the accuracy of the AABW formation in this reanalysis product represents an advancement in the representation of the Southern Ocean dynamics, the differences between the real and simulated processes suggest that substantial improvements in the ocean reanalysis products are still needed to accurately represent AABW formation.","[Aguiar, Wilton; Mata, Mauricio M.; Kerr, Rodrigo] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Lab Estudos Oceanos & Clima, Inst Oceanog, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,"Aguiar, W (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Lab Estudos Oceanos & Clima, Inst Oceanog, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",aguiar.wilton@gmail.com,"Kerr, Rodrigo/I-2494-2012; Aguiar, Wilton/AAK-3747-2021; Mata, Mauricio M/H-4605-2011","Kerr, Rodrigo/0000-0002-2632-3137; Mata, Mauricio M/0000-0002-9028-8284; Aguiar, Wilton/0000-0003-2453-9791","Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) through Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (MMA); Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication (MCTIC); Council for Research and Scientific Development of Brazil (CNPq) [550370/2002-1, 520189/2006-0, 556848/2009-8, 405869/2013-4]; CAPES Foundation; CNPq [306896/2015-0, 302604/2015-4]","Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) through Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (MMA); Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication (MCTIC); Council for Research and Scientific Development of Brazil (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); CAPES Foundation(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","This study is a contribution to the activities of the Brazilian High Latitudes Oceanography Group (GOAL) and the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology of the Cryosphere (INCT-CRIOSFERA; 573720/2008-8, 465680/20143).

This paper discusses why people write, plagiarism, Original and Copied' writings and where history writing goes wrong and how this can be applied to Medical writing today. The paper also discusses the nature of Science and Knowledge as viewed by Ibn Khaldoun, the anatomy of intelligence, types of thought processes, and effects of environment and craftsmanship on intellect. Ibn Khaldoun's definition of the Medical profession and its social standing is discussed as well as his emphasis of the importance of exercise, diet and climate on healthy living. Ibn Khaldoun has clear and advanced concepts on education and methodology of education. He emphasizes 3 stages of coaching, and the importance of travel in consolidating and clarifying knowledge attainment. He abhors coercion as a method of educating the young. Developing the interest of the pupil in the art he is studying, is thought by Ibn Khaldoun to be the central theme of good education. Relevance of all this to contemporary medical education is discussed. Ibn Khaldoun has fascinating ahead-of-time views on the influence of peer pressure and what is now known as Emotional Intelligence and he rejects the idea that intelligence is ethnically determined. Instead, he emphasizes the environmental, social and craftsmanship influence on human behavior. He stresses that the method of education has alot to do with the 'apparent intelligence or stupidity of pupils.","Armed Forces Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Riyadh 11159, Saudi Arabia",Prince Sultan Military Medical City,"Al-Khader, AA (corresponding author), Armed Forces Hosp, Dept Nephrol, POB 7897, Riyadh 11159, Saudi Arabia.",aaalkhader@hotmail.com,"Al Sayyari, Abdulla/N-2190-2017","Al Sayyari, Abdulla/0000-0002-3462-5514",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,SAUDI MED J,RIYADH,"ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL, PO BOX 7897,, RIYADH 11159, SAUDI ARABIA",0379-5284,,,SAUDI MED J,Saudi Med.

Current non-intrusive identification techniques do not scale beyond 20 people whereas commercial buildings can have 100 or more people. This paper proposes a new method to identify occupants by sensing their body shape, movement and walking patterns as they walk through a SonicDoor, a door instrumented with three ultrasonic sensors. The proposed method infers contextual information such as path detection and historical walks through different doors of the building in order to enhance the identification accuracy. Each SonicDoor is instrumented with ultrasonic ping sensors, one on the top to sense height and two on the sides of the door to sense width of the person walking through the door. SonicDoor detects a walking event and analyzes it to infer whether the Walker is using a phone, holding a handbag, or wearing a backpack. It extracts a set of features from the walking event and corrects them using a set of transformation functions to mitigate the bias. We deployed five SonicDoors in a real building for two months and collected data consisting of over 9000 walking events spanning over 170 people. The proposed method identifies up to 100 occupants with an accuracy of 90.2%, which makes it suitable for large-scale realistic buildings. SonicDoor method surpasses the state of the art by a factor of five, which is limited to 20 people.","[Khalil, Nacer; Benhaddou, Driss; Gnawali, Omprakash; Subhlok, Jaspal] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Khalil, N (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",nkhalil@uh.edu; dbenhad@central.uh.edu; gnawali@cs.uh.edu; jaspal@cs.uh.edu,"Gnawali, Omprakash/AAG-4531-2020",,,,,,25,3,3,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-5476-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,,10.1145/3137133.3137154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3137133.3137154,,,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM4PS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000463798000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This at-tide analyzes 2,805 organized interest advertorials that appeared on the lower light quadrant of The New York Times op-ed page from 1985 to 1998. Advertorials take two broad forms: (a) image advertorials, which are paid messages by organized interests designed to create a favorable climate of opinion, and (b) advocacy advertorials, which are sponsored messages intended to win support for an interest's viewpoints on controversial issues. Typologies of advertorials (11 categories), organized interests (21 categories), corporate and noncorporate economic interests (29 categories), and policy content (28 categories) are used to document annually and over time who is sponsoring advertorials, what types of advertorials are being used what interests avail themselves of advertorial campaigns, which issue areas are receiving attention, what images and policy messages are being communicated which organizations sponsor the most advertorials, and the timing of such political advertising campaigns. We find over time an increasing number of advertorials, an increasing number and diversity of sponsoring interest organizations, an increasing trend toward advocacy advertorials, a continuing but declining sponsorship dominance by corporate interests, a shifting policy issue emphasis that corresponds to events in the political environment, and evidence that organized interests employ a variety of sponsorship strategies.","Miami Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Oxford, OH 45046 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Brown, C (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 218 Harrison Hall, Oxford, OH 45046 USA.",,,,,,,,61,22,23,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The two commercial low temperature electrolyzer technologies each suffer from serious drawbacks. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers remain expensive and depend strongly on the scarce metal iridium. The alkaline electrolyzers suffer from a large footprint due to low rate capability. Here we present an approach to make an alkaline electrolyzer perform like a PEM electrolyzer by means of an ion-solvating membrane. A long lasting effort to replace the state-of-the-art thick porous diaphragm by an anion exchange membrane has not proven successful. The ion-solvating membrane represents a third way. Demonstration cells based on KOH doped polybenzimidazole membranes and nickel based electrodes exhibited 1700 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V. This is far exceeding what has previously been achieved with membranes in alkaline environments without platinum group metal catalysts, and is comparable to state-of-the-art PEM electrolyzers.","[Kraglund, Mikkel Rykaer; Aili, David; Christensen, Erik; Jensen, Jens Oluf] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Energy Convers & Storage, Elektrovej 375, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Carmo, Marcelo] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, IEK Electrochem Proc Engn 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Schiller, Guenter; Ansar, Syed Asif] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Engn Thermodynam, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",Technical University of Denmark; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Jensen, JO (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Energy Convers & Storage, Elektrovej 375, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",jojen@dtu.dk; m.carmo@fz.juelich.de; guenter.schiller@dlr.de,"Kraglund, Mikkel Rykær/HHM-2336-2022; Jensen, Jens Oluf/I-1210-2016","Kraglund, Mikkel Rykær/0000-0002-1229-1007; Jensen, Jens Oluf/0000-0002-2427-7763; Aili, David/0000-0002-3510-135X; Ansar, Asif/0000-0001-6300-0313; Christensen, Erik/0000-0003-3265-3121",EUDP programme in Denmark [EUDP17-1: 12542],EUDP programme in Denmark,"The authors would like to acknowledge the project Boosting economic electricity storage (BEEST) funded by the EUDP programme in Denmark (no.

To date, existing public large-scale datasets collected from websites do not focus on specific scenarios. As a characteristic of these datasets, the quantity of the images and instances is also still at a low level. To accelerate the development of water surface autonomous driving, this paper proposes a large-scale, high-quality annotated benchmark dataset, named Water Surface Object Detection Dataset (WSODD), to benchmark different water surface object detection algorithms. The proposed dataset consists of 7,467 water surface images in different water environments, climate conditions, and shooting times. In addition, the dataset comprises a total of 14 common object categories and 21,911 instances. Simultaneously, more specific scenarios are focused on in WSODD. In order to find a straightforward architecture to provide good performance on WSODD, a new object detector, named CRB-Net, is proposed to serve as a baseline. In experiments, CRB-Net was compared with 16 state-of-the-art object detection methods and outperformed all of them in terms of detection precision. In this paper, we further discuss the effect of the dataset diversity (e.g., instance size, lighting conditions), training set size, and dataset details (e.g., method of categorization). Cross-dataset validation shows that WSODD significantly outperforms other relevant datasets and that the adaptability of CRB-Net is excellent.","[Zhou, Zhiguo; Sun, Jiaen; Yu, Jiabao; Liu, Kaiyuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Duan, Junwei] Jinan Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Long] Univ Macau, Fac Sci & Technol, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Chen, C.

A review on the current state-of-the-art practices in agricultural use of organic residues in LCA studies is presented. This reveals that agricultural use of organic residues in LCA studies can be represented in several ways and at different levels of detail. About 100 published references were thoroughly analyzed showing that agricultural use of organic residues usually replaces the use of a mineral fertilizer (substitution of avoided mineral fertilizer). The mineral fertilizer equivalents (MFE) applied are rarely documented, although LCA results can be significantly affected by the way avoided impacts are modeled. Accounting of field emissions from organic residue application varies with the topic of the LCA study. To facilitate nitrogen MFE and field emission calculations, an Excel-tool is proposed for determining the nitrogen MFE of organic residues, direct nitrogen field emissions from organic residue applications, as well as avoided emissions (avoided mineral fertilizers). Computation of the nitrogen MFE of organic residues is based on their nitrogen content and composition, and on nitrogen emissions from field applications of the organic residues. Nitrogen field emissions were estimated using simple models and average climate and soil conditions. A global sensitivity analysis revealed that the choice of the application method, which determines the extent of incorporation into the soil, is the main cause of uncertainty in calculated nitrogen MFE values.","[Brockmann, D.; Helias, A.] Univ Montpellier, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro, LBE, 102 Ave Etangs, F-11100 Narbonne, France; [Brockmann, D.; Helias, A.] Elsa, Res Grp Environm Lifecycle & Sustainabil Assessme, Montpellier, France; [Pradel, M.] Irstea, UR TSCF, 40 Route Chazeuil, F-03150 Montoldre, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE,"Brockmann, D (corresponding author), INRA Transfert Environm, 102 Ave Etangs, F-11100 Narbonne, France.",doris.brockmann@inra.fr,"Hélias, Arnaud/B-7289-2011","Hélias, Arnaud/0000-0002-8652-5611; Brockmann, Doris/0000-0002-2447-0416; Pradel, Marilys/0000-0003-2053-6366",French National Research Agency [ANR-09-ECOT-014],French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was financially supported by the French National Research Agency, for the Phosph'OR (ANR-09-ECOT-014) project.

Important variables contributing to their development, growth and/or demise include sedimentary dynamics, food supply, physical and chemical characteristics of water masses and local hydrodynamic regimes. Geomorphological studies of bioconstructions are therefore critical in deciphering the physical and biological processes contributing to their development. The aim of this chapter is to summarise the state of the art of geomorphic studies on temperate coralligenous bioconstructions and cold-water coral reefs/mound systems, both representing the two most important and largest carbonate bioconstructions in temperate and deep-sea waters. The importance of these biogenic constructions covers several aspects. They can represent important carbonate factories of the deep sea, archives of past climate and oceanographic conditions and they support increased species diversity and complex biotic interactions with respect to the surrounding seafloor. Because of their remote location (from hundreds to thousands of meters below sea level), only since the last tens of years, technological advances are allowing fine-scale physical and ecological investigations of these bioconstructions, containing ecosystem engineers able to strongly modify the landscape heterogeneity. An increased awareness of their potential extension and significance as natural resource, is now steering scientific efforts towards the need to overcome the gaps in knowledge and contribute to prevent their vulnerability to an increasing human pressure.","[Lo Iacono, Claudio] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Savini, Alessandra; Basso, Daniela] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Piazza Sci 4, I-20126 Milan, Italy",NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Lo Iacono, C (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",cllo@noc.ac.uk; alessandra.savini@unimib.it; daniela.basso@unimib.it,"Savini, Alessandra/C-2264-2019; Iacono, Claudio Lo/O-6908-2017; Basso, Daniela/B-7693-2013","Savini, Alessandra/0000-0002-5818-5947; Iacono, Claudio Lo/0000-0002-1086-6743; Basso, Daniela/0000-0002-9352-3569",NERC [noc010011] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,187,19,19,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2197-9545,,978-3-319-57852-1; 978-3-319-57851-4,SPR GEOL,,,2018,,,,,425,455,,10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1_22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1_22,10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1,,31,"Geography, Physical; Geology; Oceanography",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology; Oceanography,BJ9SH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000429825400023,View Full Record in Web of Science

A clear plan and strategy for knowledge creating, sharing it, and managing it provides sustainable competitive advantages for knowledge-based organizations. Knowledge as an important source of capital for an organization can only be created and managed properly and successfully in a healthy cultural environment. The knowledge stores of organizations are in the minds of their employees, and it is through the art of management that a climate and policy for converting this tacit and valuable knowledge into explicit knowledge is created. This study employs the health, safety, environment, and culture (HSEC) model as a managerial tool to help managers create a health and safety culture for creating and managing knowledge and also gain a real competitive advantage in this highly competitive era. According to this model, knowledge-based organizations must consider the role of cultural assessment, control risk, cultural hazards, and cultural syndromes when creating a health and safety culture. A successful HSEC model enables an organization to manage its complexity and uncertainty, improve performance, create competitive advantages, and enhance its business reputation. This model will create a deep understanding of a health and safety culture that facilitates the interaction and conversion process and also determines how the knowledge process should be developed and managed by identifying cultural hazards and risks.

Indeed, bone and teeth, as biomaterials register in their chemical composition and structure the life conditions (diets, climate, life circumstances). However, ancient bone materials are exposed to many alteration phenomena due to the interactions with the burial environment. The aim of the work is to reveal alteration mechanisms of, ancient bone material during burial and induced by heat treatments. The composite structure of these materials consisting of fibrous collagen stiffened by an extremely dense filling and surrounding of calcium apatite crystals at the nanometer scale requires the use of a high resolution analytical methodology combining the observation at different scales with chemical and structural analysis. The acquired knowledge on the physico-chemical alteration phenomena of bone materials and the heat-induced modifications allowed to elucidate a phenomenon which has remained the subject of controversy for a long time: the appearance of blue colour of fossil bone material while heated; this mineral called bone turquoise or odontolite was used as semi-precious stone to decorate art objects of the Middle Ages. This methodology can now be applied to other archaeological problems such as the use of fire by prehistoric populations and the differentiation of natural fires during burial from firing of the objects. In the future, this research is intended to establish a conservation-restoration strategy of ancient bone material.","[Reiche, Ina; Chadefaux, Celine; Vignaud, Colette; Menu, Michel] Palais Louvre, UMR 171, CNRS, C2RMF, F-75001 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Reiche, I (corresponding author), Palais Louvre, UMR 171, CNRS, C2RMF, Porte Lions,14 Quai Francois Mitterrand, F-75001 Paris, France.",ina.reiche@culture.gouv.fr; celine.chadefaux@culture.gouv.fr; Colefte.vignaud@noos.fr; michel.menu@culture.gouv.fr,"MENU, MICHEL/AAS-8325-2020; Reiche, Ina/C-6271-2015; Reiche, Ina/AAQ-3897-2020","Reiche, Ina/0000-0002-9897-6620; ",,,,,16,1,1,0,13,SOC FRANCAISE CHIMIE,PARIS,"250 RUE SAINT-JACQUES, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE",0151-9093,2105-2409,,ACTUAL CHIMIQUE,Actual Chim.,OCT-NOV,2007,312-13,,,,86,92,,,,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Chemistry,242MG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000251728600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased availability of large sample hydrology data sets, together with recent advances in deep learning techniques, has presented new opportunities to explore temporal and spatial patterns in hydrological signatures for improving streamflow forecasting. The purpose of this study is to adapt and benchmark several state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) architectures, including ChebNet, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and GraphWaveNet, for end-to-end graph learning. We explicitly represent river basins as nodes in a graph, learn the spatiotemporal nodal dependencies, and then use the learned relations to predict streamflow simultaneously across all nodes in the graph. The efficacy of the developed GNN models is investigated using the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set under two settings, fixed graph topology (transductive learning), and variable graph topology (inductive learning), with the latter applicable to prediction in ungauged basins (PUB). Results indicate that GNNs are generally robust and computationally efficient, achieving similar or better performance than a baseline model trained using the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Further analyses are conducted to interpret the graph learning process at the edge and node levels and to investigate the effect of different model configurations. We conclude that graph learning constitutes a viable machine learning-based method for aggregating spatiotemporal information from a multitude of sources for streamflow forecasting","[Sun, Alexander Y.] Univ Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Jiang, Peishi; Mudunuru, Maruti K.; Chen, Xingyuan] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Sun, AY (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",alex.sun@beg.utexas.edu,,"Mudunuru, Maruti/0000-0002-2158-7723","ExaSheds project - U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division, Data Management Program; DOE [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","ExaSheds project - U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division, Data Management Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was funded by the ExaSheds project, which was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division, Data Management Program.

Establishing the causes of historical variability in AMOC strength on different timescales can tell us how the circulation may respond to natural and anthropogenic changes at the ocean surface. However, understanding observed AMOC variability is challenging because the circulation is influenced by multiple factors that co-vary and whose overlapping impacts persist for years. Here we reconstruct and unambiguously attribute intermonthly and interannual AMOC variability at two observational arrays to the recent history of surface wind stress, temperature and salinity. We use a state-of-the-art technique that computes space- and time-varying sensitivity patterns of the AMOC strength with respect to multiple surface properties from a numerical ocean circulation model constrained by observations. While, on interannual timescales, AMOC variability at 26 degrees N is overwhelmingly dominated by a linear response to local wind stress, overturning variability at subpolar latitudes is generated by the combined effects of wind stress and surface buoyancy anomalies. Our analysis provides a quantitative attribution of subpolar AMOC variability to temperature, salinity and wind anomalies at the ocean surface. Wind stress controls annual variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at mid-latitudes, while surface buoyancy also matters at subpolar latitudes, according to an attribution analysis using a numerical model constrained by observational array data.","[Kostov, Yavor] Univ Exeter, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Johnson, Helen L.] Univ Oxford, Earth Sci, Oxford, England; [Marshall, David P.] Univ Oxford, Phys, Oxford, England; [Heimbach, Patrick; Pillar, Helen R.; Smith, Timothy] Univ Texas Austin, Oden Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Heimbach, Patrick] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Heimbach, Patrick] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX USA; [Forget, Gael] MIT, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Holliday, N.

Such energy systems will be needed to mitigate the negative impacts of economic development based on the use of fossil fuels, but will rely on variable renewable energy resources. As two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to fossil fuel combustion, decarbonization of energy systems is imperative for combating the climate change. Integrating future energy systems with CO2 capture and utilization technologies can contribute to deep decarbonization. As these technologies can be operated flexibly, they can be used to balance the grid to allow for high levels of variable renewable energy in the power mix. The captured CO2 can be either utilized as a feedstock for various value-added applications in the chemical industry and related sectors such as the food and beverage industries.

Biophysical feedbacks on climate are highly dependent on transpiration, which is mediated by vegetation phenology and plant responses to stress conditions. Here, we explore the potential of satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)normalized by photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR)to diagnose the ratio of transpiration to potential evaporation (transpiration efficiency', ). This potential is validated at 25 eddy-covariance sites from seven biomes worldwide. The skill of the state-of-the-art land surface models (LSMs) from the eartH2Observe project to estimate is also contrasted against eddy-covariance data. Despite its relatively coarse (0.5 degrees) resolution, SIF/PAR estimates, based on data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), correlate to the in situ significantly (average inter-site correlation of 0.59), with higher correlations during growing seasons (0.64) compared to decaying periods (0.53). In addition, the skill to diagnose the variability of in situ demonstrated by all LSMs is on average lower, indicating the potential of SIF data to constrain the formulations of transpiration in global models via, e.g., data assimilation. Overall, SIF/PAR estimates successfully capture the effect of phenological changes and environmental stress on natural ecosystem transpiration, adequately reflecting the timing of this variability without complex parameterizations.","[Pagan, Brianna R.; Maes, Wouter H.; Martens, Brecht; Miralles, Diego G.] Univ Ghent, Lab Hydrol & Water Management, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Gentine, Pierre] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, 842D SW Mudd,500 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA",Ghent University; Columbia University,"Pagan, BR (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Hydrol & Water Management, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Brianna.Pagan@ugent.be; Wh.Maes@ugent.be; pg2328@columbia.edu; Brecht.Martens@UGent.be; Diego.Miralles@UGent.be,"Maes, Wouter/AAK-3124-2021; Miralles, Diego G/K-8857-2013; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Gentine, Pierre/C-1495-2013","Maes, Wouter/0000-0002-1592-9299; Miralles, Diego G/0000-0001-6186-5751; Gentine, Pierre/0000-0002-0845-8345; Martens, Brecht/0000-0002-7368-7953; Pagan, Brianna R./0000-0001-8028-0310",European Research Council (ERC) [715254]; Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) [SR/02/329]; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Water Resource and Policy Initiative's (WRPI) Water Resources Fellowship; American Geophysical Union (AGU) Horton Hydrology Research Grant,European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Water Resource and Policy Initiative's (WRPI) Water Resources Fellowship; American Geophysical Union (AGU) Horton Hydrology Research Grant,This work is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under grant agreement no 715254 (DRY-2-DRY) and the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) in the framework of the STEREO III project SR/02/329 (STR3S).

It is also possible to speak of its far reaching synchronicity, encompassing change on both local and global scales. This is witnessed by successive culminations of cycles with the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, the revolutionary surges of the 1830s and 1840s, the events of the 1860s and 1870s, the turbulences and wars of the early 20th century (notably World War I), then World War II, the great transformations of the 1980s, and the recently observed increase in political tension in various parts of the world (e.g. the Middle East, Ukraine, etc.). In the economic sphere the symptoms are shifts in the business climate, which can even be calculated by reference to quantitative indicators. Then, in the sphere of culture, it is possible to denote successive periods in literature and the arts. In the political sphere in turn, events that shape the state or territorial order are to be observed readily. The present article thus seeks to propose the existence of a universal and synchronous 30-40 years long generation cycle, which manifests itself in real symptoms in the world of politics, and for instance in the cyclicity seen to characterise intensity of change on the political map of Europe.","[Kowalski, Mariusz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences,"Kowalski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland.",mar.kow@twarda.pan.pl,/ABB-8127-2021,/0000-0003-3417-0369,,,,,48,2,2,0,1,"POLISH ACAD SCIENCES, INST GEOGRAPHY & SPATIAL ORGANIZATION",WARSAW,"TWARDA 51-55, WARSAW, 00818, POLAND",0016-7282,2300-7362,,GEOGR POL,Geogr.

Biogenic monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are important precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), but the amounts and pathways of SOA generation from these precursors are not well constrained by observations. We propose that the less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) factor resolved from positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis on aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) data can be used as a surrogate for fresh SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the southeastern US. This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including lab-in-the-field perturbation experiments, extensive ambient ground-level measurements, and state-of-the-art modeling. We performed lab-in-the-field experiments in which the ambient air is perturbed by the injection of selected monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and the subsequent SOA formation is investigated. PMF analysis on the perturbation experiments provides an objective link between LO-OOA and fresh SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes as well as insights into the sources of other OA factors. Further, we use an upgraded atmospheric model and show that modeled SOA concentrations from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes could reproduce both the magnitude and diurnal variation of LO-OOA at multiple sites in the southeastern US, building confidence in our hypothesis. We estimate the annual average concentration of SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the southeastern US to be roughly 2 mu g m(-3).","[Xu, Lu; Ng, Nga Lee] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Pye, Havala O.

The applications in this field can be generally divided into two areas: environmental and defense. In the environmental remote sensing area, NIST has had programs with agencies such as the National Aeronautical and Space Administration. (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to verify and improve traceability of the radiometric calibration of sensors that fly on board Earth-observing satellites. These produce data used in climate models and weather prediction. Over the years, the scope of activities has expanded from existing routine calibration services for artifacts such as lamps, diffusers, and filters, to development and off-site deployment of portable radiometers for radiance- and irradiance-scale intercomparisons. In the defense remote sensing area, NIST has had programs with agencies such as the Department of Defense (DOD) for support of calibration of small, low-level infrared sources in a low infrared background. These are used by the aerospace industry to simulate ballistic missiles in a cold space background. Activities have evolved from calibration of point-source cryogenic blackbodies at NIST to measurement of irradiance in off-site calibration chambers by a portable vacuum/cryogenic radiometer. Both areas of application required measurements on the cutting edge of what was technically feasible, thus compelling NIST to develop a state-of-the-art radiometric measurement infrastructure to meet the needs. This infrastructure has led to improved dissemination of the NIST spectroradiometric quantities.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Technol Adm, US Dept Commerce, Opt Technol Div, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA",National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA,"Rice, JP (corresponding author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Technol Adm, US Dept Commerce, Opt Technol Div, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",,"Johnson, B.

This helps them get a step closer towards understanding and predicting how fish respond to climate change, habitat degradation and fishing pressure. This information is essential for developing sustainable fisheries for human consumption, and for preserving the environment. However, the enormous volume of collected videos makes extracting useful information a daunting and time-consuming task for a human being. A promising method to address this problem is the cutting-edge deep learning (DL) technology. DL can help marine scientists parse large volumes of video promptly and efficiently, unlocking niche information that cannot be obtained using conventional manual monitoring methods. In this paper, we first provide a survey of computer visions (CVs) and DL studies conducted between 2003 and 2021 on fish classification in underwater habitats. We then give an overview of the key concepts of DL, while analysing and synthesizing DL studies. We also discuss the main challenges faced when developing DL for underwater image processing and propose approaches to address them. Finally, we provide insights into the marine habitat monitoring research domain and shed light on what the future of DL for underwater image processing may hold. This paper aims to inform marine scientists who would like to gain a high-level understanding of essential DL concepts and survey state-of-the-art DL-based fish classification in their underwater habitat.","[Saleh, Alzayat; Sheaves, Marcus; Azghadi, Mostafa Rahimi] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Azghadi, Mostafa Rahimi] James Cook Univ, ARC Res Hub Supercharging Trop Aquaculture Genet, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Azghadi, MR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",mostafa.rahimiazghadi@jcu.edu.au,"Saleh, Alzayat/ABG-9456-2020; Sheaves, Marcus/G-4283-2012","Saleh, Alzayat/0000-0001-6973-019X; Rahimi Azghadi, Mostafa/0000-0001-7975-3985; Sheaves, Marcus/0000-0003-0662-3439",Australian Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; Food Agility HDR TopUp Scholarship; Australian Research Council,Australian Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; Food Agility HDR TopUp Scholarship; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported by an Australian Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship, Food Agility HDR TopUp Scholarship, and the Australian Research Council funding through their Industrial Transformation Research Program",,143,3,3,12,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-2960,1467-2979,,FISH FISH,Fish.

This review will investigate the different generations of biofuels and more particularly, the developmental and production processes for creating liquid biofuels. Initially, the first-generation biofuel was dependent on edible resources, which has caused controversy and arguments on whether to fulfil the food or fuel requirement for civilization. Second-generation biofuels employed inedible resources, however, the cost of production at a commercial scale has restricted its expansion. Recently, third and fourth-generation use microorganisms and genetically modified microorganisms, respectively, to produce biofuels and create an efficient synthetic fuel switch route. Although the last two generations are still in the developmental phase, thorough research is required before commercial-scale production. In conclusion, this review has found that first- and second-generation biofuel production approaches will soon be inadequate to satisfy the exponentially rising demand for biofuels. Therefore, substantial research efforts currently and in the future should focus on the production of third and fourth-generation biofuels, especially on engineered microorganisms. Ultimately, the structure of this review is to outline the current state of the art research regarding biofuels, their production processes and limitations/challenges. This was done through critically reviewing the most up-to-date literature and utilizing bibliometric analysis tools to put forward the guidelines for the future routes of the four generations of biofuels.","[Osman, Ahmed, I; Rooney, David W.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland; [Osman, Ahmed, I] South Valley Univ, Fac Sci Qena, Chem Dept, Nanocomposite Catalysts Lab, Qena 83523, Egypt; [Qasim, Umair; Jamil, Farrukh] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Chem Engn, Lahore Campus, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan; [Al-Muhtaseb, Ala'a H.; Al-Riyami, Mohammed; Al-Maawali, Suhaib; Al-Abri, Mohammed] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Petr & Chem Engn, Muscat, Oman; [Abu Jrai, Ahmad] Al Hussein Bin Talal Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Maan, Jordan; [Al-Haj, Lamya] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Muscat, Oman; [Al-Hinai, Amer] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Coll Engn, Muscat, Oman; [Inayat, Abrar] Univ Sharjah, Dept Sustainable & Renewable Energy Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Waris, Ammara] Lahore Coll Women Univ, Dept Zool, Lahore, Pakistan; [Farrell, Charlie] South West Coll, Cookstown BT80 8DN, Co Tyrone, North Ireland; [Farrell, Charlie] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Maksoud, M.

To gain an understanding of the scientific contributions emerging from the intersection of psychology and marketing, this study conducts a bibliometric retrospection of a premier journal dedicated to the application of psychological theories and techniques to marketing: Psychology & Marketing (P&M). To do so, this study employs bibliometrics to unpack the publication trends and the intellectual structure of P&M. In doing so, this study reveals several interesting findings. First, P&M's publications grew by 71.9 times, authorships grew by 82.1 times, and citations grew by 150.8 times between 1984 and 2020, indicating a healthy growth of marketing research informed by psychology. Second, P&M's contributions manifest through eight intellectual clusters-namely, marketing environment; consumer engagement; online consumer behavior and marketing; luxury consumption and marketing; sustainable consumption and marketing; influencer and international marketing; customer relationship, satisfaction, and loyalty; and marketing futures. Finally, P&M's emerging and promising areas for future exploration include aesthetics and consumer impressions; celebrity endorsement; conspicuous consumption and hedonic adaptation; climate change; choice likelihood; consumer engagement; consumer psychology; marketing communication; sensory marketing; sharing economy; and social media marketing.

The wave model will inherit the uncertainty of the atmospheric data, and additional discretization errors will be introduced due to a limited spatial and temporal resolution of the forcing data. In this study, we apply an atmospheric downscaling to (i) add regional details to the wind field, (ii) increase the temporal resolution of the wind fields, (iii) provide a more detailed representation of transient events such as storms and (iv) generate ensembles with perturbed atmospheric conditions, which allows for a flow-dependent and spatio-temporally variable uncertainty estimation. We test different strategies to generate an ensemble hindcast of a relatively strong storm event in February 2002 in the Baltic Sea. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model used for this purpose is driven by the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis, and wind fields are passed to the third-generation wave model WAVEWATCH III (R). A combination of initial conditions from the ERA5 ensemble of data assimilations and stochastic perturbations during runtime is identified as the most promising strategy. The final aim of the ensemble approach is to quantify the hindcast error, but this approach can also be used to generate alternative representations of historical extreme events to sample the recent climate and to increase the sample size for statistical studies, such as for civil engineering applications for coastal protection studies.","[Osinski, Robert Daniel; Radtke, Hagen] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde Phys Ocean, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany",,"Osinski, RD (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde Phys Ocean, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.",robert.osinski@io-warnemuende.de,,"Osinski, Robert Daniel/0000-0002-1923-3053",Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,The publication of this article was funded by the Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association.,,47,16,16,2,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1812-0784,,,OCEAN SCI,Ocean Sci.,17-Mar,2020,2,,,,355,371,,10.5194/os-16-355-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-16-355-2020,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,KW4MZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000521141400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Third-generation solar cells (SCs) are solution processed SCs based on semiconducting organic macromolecules, inorganic nanoparticles or hybrids. This review considers and compares three types of promising 3rd-generation SCs: polymer: fullerene, hybrid polymer and perovskite SCs. The review considers work reported since an earlier review (Saunders et al., Adv. Colloid Interface Sci., 2008, 138, 1) and highlights the great progress that has been made in each area. We consider the operation principles for each SC type and also review the state-of-the-art devices. The polymer: fullerene and hybrid polymer SC open circuit voltages are compared to values predicted from the well-known Scharber equation and similarities and differences discussed. The perovskite SCs are also considered and their remarkable rate of power conversion efficiency performance increase is discussed. The review considers the requirements for large-scale deployment in the contexts of semiconducting polymer and hole transport matrix synthesis and materials selection. It is concluded that the 3rd-generation SC technologies discussed here are well placed for major contribution to large scale energy production. (This has already been partially demonstrated for polymer: fullerene SCs.) Looking further ahead we propose that several of the 3rd-generation SCs considered here have excellent potential to provide the low cost large-scale deployment needed to meet the terawatt challenge for solar electricity generation.","[Yan, Junfeng; Saunders, Brian R.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mat, Polymer Sci & Technol Grp, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Saunders, BR (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Mat, Polymer Sci & Technol Grp, Grosvenor St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Brian.Saunders@manchester.ac.uk,"Saunders, Brian/AAN-8082-2020; Yan, Junfeng/GRF-5811-2022","Saunders, Brian/0000-0003-1410-2967",EPSRC; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K009710/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K009710/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors would like to thank the EPSRC for funding our 3rd-generation solar energy research.

For that reason, the Po and six Apennine rivers (Metauro, Musone, Potenza, Tronto, Chienti and Pescara) are investigated. The climate-driven hydrological model HydroTrend is used to simulate discharge and sediment loads where observational data are limited. The northern Apennine hinterland has a significant impact on the sediment flux leaving the Po River, contributing 56% of the sediment it delivers to the Adriatic Sea. The Po River experienced a strong decrease in its sediment load (17.2-6.4 Mt/yr) across 1933-1987, in contrast to a small increase in its water discharge. The rivers draining the southern Apennine hinterland contribute more than 50% of the sediment load entering the Adriatic Sea, and this is in spite of human modification of their discharge through numerous small reservoirs that invariably reduce a river's sediment load. As a result, hyperpycnal flows, which historically carried 20-40% of the sediment flux from these Apennine rivers, become rare. Sediment load reduction is also reflected by retreat of the Apennine coastline. Based on the ART model (used in HydroTrend), the total sediment load to the northern Adriatic is 43MT/yr where the northern Alpine rivers contribute 8MT/yr, the Po River 13MT/yr and the Apennine rivers contribute 22MT/yr.

The present littoral morphodynamics related to the wave climate, swash and back-wash processes and anthropic activities actually held in the area, has been also considered. Top-hydrographic profiles, sediment sampling, and textural analysis all over the year of 2001 have been performed. The results were compared to the previous ones aiming at achieving the state of the art of the coastal hydrodynamics processes and their relationship to the degeneration and/or regeneration of the coastline morphology together with its uses and occupation. The beach zonation have been worked out, different compartments and three cells were calculated which allowed the definition of vulnerability inside in each one of the sectors. The progradation and inverse beach shift have been assigned to be cyclic process, but it must be said that wave refraction and diffraction, offroad vehicles and vandalism on the rigid structures and the dwelling of sediment supplying areas are responsible for part of the process during 2001. At the same time the Caponga Roseira flooding runoff responds for most of these processes at cell 3. This has been also compared to the development carried out in 2003.

Due to the diversified consumer base representing varied climate zones, food habits, and standards of living, the generation and growth opportunities for the plastic industry in India are particularly distinct and humongous. The present work extensively reviews the Indian plastic industry with primary focus on the evolving technologies for plastic waste valorization encompassing their level of utilization, technology readiness, and progress achieved at R&D level. The study attempts to recognize different issues related to technology, recycling, policy, research, regulation that should be given attention to formulate an improved plastic waste management strategy in the region. Though significant shares of waste plastics in the country are processed by traditional practices, state-of-the-art technologies primarily plastic to oil conversion, in road making and in cement manufacturing, are being deployed at increasing rate. Action to tackle the problem of plastic contamination in India will need to adopt a pan India strategic consensus/concurrent approach for effective waste collection and segregation with active participation of urban local bodies, fixing the role of the informal sectors, investment for reliable technology adoption with skilled manpower for operation, adoption of circular economy schemes involving plastic waste co-processing, and providing support to work on R&D for better penetration of the proven plastic valorization options along with their environmental and social implications.","[Kataki, Sampriti; Nityanand, Krithika; Chatterjee, Soumya; Dwivedi, Sanjai K.; Kamboj, Dev Vrat] DRDO, Biodegradat Technol Div, Def Res Lab, Tezpur 784001, Assam, India; [Nityanand, Krithika] Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi 110042, India",Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO); Defence Research Laboratory (DRL); Delhi Technological University,"Chatterjee, S (corresponding author), DRDO, Biodegradat Technol Div, Def Res Lab, Tezpur 784001, Assam, India.",drlsoumya@gmail.com,,,DRDO fellowship,DRDO fellowship,The funding source for this project work was supported by DRDO fellowship.,,166,0,0,3,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

These problems are challenging because of unique spatial, short-term and long-term patterns, as well as the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for spatio-temporal forecasting problems. We explicitly design the neural network architecture for capturing various types of spatial and temporal patterns, and the model is robust to missing data. In a preprocessing step, a time series decomposition method is applied to separately feed short-term, longterm and spatial patterns into different components of the neural network. A fuzzy clustering method finds clusters of neighboring time series residuals, as these contain short-term spatial patterns. The first component of the neural network consists of multi-kernel convolutional layers which are designed to extract short-term features from clusters of time series data. Each convolutional kernel receives a single cluster of input time series. The output of convolutional layers is concatenated by trends and followed by convolutional-LSTM layers to capture long-term spatial patterns. To have a robust forecasting model when faced with missing data, a pretrained denoising autoencoder reconstructs the model's output in a fine-tuning step. In experimental results, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model for the traffic flow prediction. The results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art neural network models. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This allows for comparisons between products and makes environmentally friendly choices of a product more transparent to decision makers. In the field of slope stabilization, the high tensile steel wire mesh TECCO (R) in combination with soil or rock nailing is the state of the art in many countries. Compared to shotcrete, load transfer capacity is equal or higher. The open mesh leaves enough space for plants to grow through the system. Recent CO2-footprint evaluation taking into account production and transport of the material of an equivalent slope stabilization measure shows that the TECCO (R) system has a very low CO2-footprint. The methods used for assessing the impact were, the level of carbon dioxide emissions from burning of fossil fuels as well as all other emissions which contribute to climate change. These other emissions have been recorded and weighted according to their specific contribution to give an overall index, Global Warming Potential (GWP). Compared to shotcrete, the CO2-footprint of the mesh solution is 4-5 times lower! One reason for the good result is the high CO2-emitting level of concrete in general. Furthermore, less material weight and also transport costs for the same stabilizing effect of the product on the slope also account for a better CO2 balance of the mesh solution.","[Gross, Dennis; Roduner, Armin] GEOBRUGG AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland; [Kytzia, Susanne] Univ Appl Sci, Rapperswil, Switzerland",,"Gross, D (corresponding author), GEOBRUGG AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2366-3405,2366-3413,978-3-319-61902-6; 978-3-319-61901-9,SUSTAIN CIV INFRASTR,,,2018,,,,,69,78,,10.1007/978-3-319-61902-6_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61902-6_7,,,10,"Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Geological",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BL7ND,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000455225700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

These clouds usually form at night in association with a nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ) and can persist into the early afternoon hours. Recent work suggests that the stratus deck is unsatisfactorily represented in standard satellite retrievals and state-of-the-art climate models. Here the authors use high-resolution regional simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and observations from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) 2006 campaign to investigate (i) the spatiotemporal distribution, (ii) the influence on the shortwave radiation balance, and (iii) the detailed formation and maintenance mechanisms of the stratiform clouds. At least some configurations of WRF satisfactorily reproduce the diurnal cycle of the low-cloud evolution, yielding the following main conclusions: (i) The simulated stratus deck forms after sunset along the coast, spreads inland during the course of the night, and dissipates in the early afternoon. (ii) The average surface net shortwave radiation balance in stratus-dominated regions is about 35 W m(-2) lower than in those with fewer clouds. (iii) The cloud formation is related to a subtle balance between stratogenic upward (downward) fluxes of latent (sensible) heat caused by shear-driven turbulence below the NLLJ, cold advection, orographic lifting, and radiative cooling on one hand, and stratolytic dry advection and latent heating on the other hand.","[Schuster, Robert; Fink, Andreas H.] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Knippertz, Peter] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Cologne; University of Leeds,"Schuster, R (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Kerpener Str 13, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",schuster@meteo.uni-koeln.de,"Fink, Andreas H./F-3024-2017; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Redl, Robert/K-7355-2015","Fink, Andreas H./0000-0002-5840-2120; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Redl, Robert/0000-0003-3055-7603",MIKLIP VESPA project (BMBF) [01LP1110B]; IMPETUS project (BMBF) [01LW06001A]; IMPETUS project (North Rhine-Westphalia) [313-21200200]; EU FP6 AMMA project [004089],MIKLIP VESPA project (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); IMPETUS project (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); IMPETUS project (North Rhine-Westphalia); EU FP6 AMMA project,"RS acknowledges financial support through the MIKLIP VESPA project (BMBF Grant 01LP1110B).

It is this quality that provides them dexterity for evolving new strategies and adaptations to changing environmental conditions.

J,"Weigand, F",,,,"Weigand, F",,,Closed,BALLETTANZ,,,German,Article,,,,,,,,"Can dance overcome barbed wire and concrete walls? Author Frank Weigand went to Israel to see if there is hope for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation and found out that different attitudes, different body images and particularly the political situation make contact through dance virtually impossible. While the Suzanne Dellal Dance Centre in Tel Aviv and the Arab-Hebrew Theatre in Jaffa work with artists from both cultures, it is on a strictly personal, non-political basis. Here, normality is the most important issue. By contrast, the only internationally renowned Palestinian dance company, EI-Funoun, rules out any collaboration with Israelis until occupation is over, or at least demands that potential partners sign a charter declaring that they are working against Israeli oppression. Back on the Jewish side, this politicisation of art is met with anger and regret.

The risk assessment connected to flow-like landslides utilizes several study approaches, such as the mapping of lands affected in the past, the understanding of triggering and propagation mechanisms through the monitoring of some watershed basins periodically subject to flow-like landslides, and the prediction of flow-like landslide propagation by means of advanced mathematical models. Research has made much progress in the development of advanced mathematical models able to account for various rheological models, 3D morphology of the slope, and engagement of other materials from the boundary, etc. Calibration of the parameters is, however, one of the most problematic phases of numerical modelling; the validation of propagation models is usually carried out on the basis of laboratory flume tests executed in very simple conditions or on the basis of data achieved from field observation, which are very often of low quality. After a brief state-of-art review concerning the most recent developments in flow-like landslide modelling, the present paper examines the techniques adopted for calibrating the models. Particularly, it considers the difficulties linked to the upscaling of rheological properties moving from the physical tests performed in viscometer or artificial flume and attaining the estimation of average properties of the heterogeneous materials involved in real flow-like landslides.","[Cola, Simonetta; Brezzi, Lorenzo; Gabrieli, Fabio] Univ Padua, Dept ICEA, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Cola, S (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept ICEA, Padua, Italy.",,"Gabrieli, Fabio/HDL-9128-2022; Brezzi, Lorenzo/AAD-1425-2022; Brezzi, Lorenzo/AAW-5489-2021; Cola, Simonetta/D-3866-2013","Gabrieli, Fabio/0000-0002-9562-9527; Brezzi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1077-8874; Cola, Simonetta/0000-0002-7547-9904",,,,,221,1,1,2,19,PATRON EDITORE S R L,BOLOGNA,"VIA BADINI 12, QUARTO INFERIORE, BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",0557-1405,,,ITAL GEOTECH J,Ital.

One barrier to interdisciplinary research is the widespread perception that interdisciplinary projects are less likely to be funded than those with a narrower focus(3,4). However, this commonly held belief has been difficult to evaluate objectively, partly because of lack of a comparable, quantitative measure of degree of interdisciplinarity that can be applied to funding application data(1). Here we compare the degree to which research proposals span disparate fields by using a biodiversity metric that captures the relative representation of different fields (balance) and their degree of difference (disparity). The Australian Research Council's Discovery Programme provides an ideal test case, because a single annual nationwide competitive grants scheme covers fundamental research in all disciplines, including arts, humanities and sciences. Using data on all 18,476 proposals submitted to the scheme over 5 consecutive years, including successful and unsuccessful applications, we show that the greater the degree of interdisciplinarity, the lower the probability of being funded. The negative impact of interdisciplinarity is significant even when number of collaborators, primary research field and type of institution are taken into account. This is the first broad-scale quantitative assessment of success rates of interdisciplinary research proposals. The interdisciplinary distance metric allows efficient evaluation of trends in research funding, and could be used to identify proposals that require assessment strategies appropriate to interdisciplinary research(5).","[Bromham, Lindell; Dinnage, Russell; Hua, Xia] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, 116 Daley Rd, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Bromham, L (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, 116 Daley Rd, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",lindell.bromham@anu.edu.au,"Dinnage, Russell/H-9023-2019; Bromham, Lindell/D-1046-2009","Dinnage, Russell/0000-0003-0846-2819; Bromham, Lindell/0000-0003-2202-2609",,,,,27,242,252,28,271,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,30-Jun,2016,7609,,,,684,+,,10.1038/nature18315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature18315,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DP7JV,27357795,,Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000378676000036,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the catchment scale, these simulation models are commonly based on conservation principles for surface and subsurface water flow and solute transport (e.g., the Richards, shallow water, and advection-dispersion equations), and they require robust numerical techniques for their resolution. Traditional (and still open) challenges in developing reliable and efficient models are associated with heterogeneity and variability in parameters and state variables; nonlinearities and scale effects in process dynamics; and complex or poorly known boundary conditions and initial system states. As catchment modeling enters a highly interdisciplinary era, new challenges arise from the need to maintain physical and numerical consistency in the description of multiple processes that interact over a range of scales and across different compartments of an overall system. This paper first gives an historical overview (past 50 years) of some of the key developments in physically based hydrological modeling, emphasizing how the interplay between theory, experiments, and modeling has contributed to advancing the state of the art. The second part of the paper examines some outstanding problems in integrated catchment modeling from the perspective of recent developments in mathematical and computational science.","[Paniconi, Claudio] Ctr Eau Terre Environm, INRS ETE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Putti, Mario] Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy",University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); University of Padua,"Paniconi, C (corresponding author), Ctr Eau Terre Environm, INRS ETE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",claudio.paniconi@ete.inrs.ca,"Putti, Mario/I-5996-2014; Putti, Mario/A-5148-2012","Putti, Mario/0000-0002-0382-0202; Putti, Mario/0000-0002-0382-0202; Paniconi, Claudio/0000-0003-2063-2841",,,,,627,147,153,13,133,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

Among the different existing tracers, the fallout component of the radioisotope lead-210, also termed unsupported or excess lead-210 (Pb-210(ex)) when referring to its presence in soil or sediment, arguably offers the broadest potential for environmental applications, due to its origin and relatively long half-life. For more than five decades, Pb-210(ex) has been widely used for dating sediments, to investigate sedimentation processes and, since the 1990s, to provide information on the magnitude of soil and sediment redistribution. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evaluation and discussion of the various applications of Pb-210(ex) as a tracer in terrestrial and aquatic environments, with particular emphasis on catchment sediment budget investigations. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art related to the use of this tracer, the main assumptions, the requirements (including the need for accurate analytical measurements and for parallel validation), and the limitations which must be recognised when using this fallout radionuclide as a soil and sediment tracer. Lessons learned and current and future research needs in the environmental and radiochronological application of Pb-210(ex) are also presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is usually linked to the idea of a checkpoint: where celibate rules, no sexual interaction can be allowed. However, organizing and managing climates in professional bureaucracies have always led towards the empowerment of the operatives (regional bishops and local parish priests in the case of the Catholic Church). History of the church is repeated by corporate bureaucracies in the wake of the globalized and individualized multimedia communications, ushering in the era of hyper-connectivity and traceability of individual behaviour. From industrial camera records at the parking lot or building entrance to the Google analysis of surfing behaviour, all of us generate public confessions and see more private acts subjected to the public ethical clearings. Universities, like hospitals, airlines and armies before them, had to enter the game of cognitive and institutional conscience game with codes of conduct and other digital tablets with 10 or more commandments. What about the gravest capital and collective sins of our societies translated daily into millions of unethical behaviours? Inequalities and injustices usually circle around gender, race, poverty and nature.

Among the several strategies employed, adsorption on a porous solid seems to be a promising alternative to conventional CO2 capture technologies. However, to employ this technology under real-world CO2 capture conditions, the stability of the adsorbent materials under humid conditions is of paramount importance. To date, several CO2 sorbent materials have been reported to show remarkable CO2 uptake capacities both by physical and chemical adsorption. Nevertheless, the stability of many of these superior adsorbents under humid conditions is questionable. This is a key issue that hinders their commercial exploration under real flue gas conditions. The systematic tuning of material properties such as porosity, wettability, and hydrophobicity and functionalization strategies can play a decisive role in enhancing the material stability and CO2 sorption capacity. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of the trends and innovations in CO2 capture under humid conditions. Various materials and methodologies employed for CO2 capture from a humid stream are extensively reviewed. In particular, some of the key strategies such as tuning the hydrophobicity, amine modifications, introduction of polar functional groups, and water enhanced CO2 uptake are discussed in detail. We believe that the present review can lead this emerging field to develop state-of-the-art materials that can have a potential future in real-world CO2 capture technologies.","[Ray, Bitan; Churipard, Sathyapal R.; Peter, Sebastian C.] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, New Chem Unit, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India; [Ray, Bitan; Churipard, Sathyapal R.; Peter, Sebastian C.] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Sch Adv Mat, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India",Department of Science & Technology (India); Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR); Department of Science & Technology (India); Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR),"Peter, SC (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, New Chem Unit, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India.;Peter, SC (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Sch Adv Mat, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India.",sebastiancp@gmail.com,,"Ray, Bitan/0000-0002-9403-170X; Chirambatte Peter, Sebastian/0000-0002-5211-446X","Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scienti.c Research (JNCASR); Department of Science and Technology, India (DST) [DST/TM/EWO/MI/CCUS/13(G), DST/TMD/(EWO)/IC#5-2018/02]; DST [DST/SJF/CSA-02/2017-18]; University Grants Commission","Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scienti.c Research (JNCASR)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Department of Science and Technology, India (DST)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); University Grants Commission(University Grants Commission, India)","We thank the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scienti.c Research (JNCASR) and the Department of Science and Technology, India (DST) (Grant Number: DST/TM/EWO/MI/CCUS/13(G) and DST/TMD/(EWO)/IC#5-2018/02), for.nancial support.

However, distillation columns account for the largest contribution to the total energy consumption of chemical processes due to their high heat demands. Consequently, there is a strong need for energy efficient column designs to reduce drastically the carbon dioxide emissions and thus to reach the settled climate goals of the chemical industry. In this paper, the FluxMax approach is used to identify energy optimal column designs. The representation of the distillation process by the elementary processes mixing, heating/cooling and phase separation leads to increased degrees of freedom of optimization compared to classical column modeling approaches. In this way, a non-conventional design with minimal energy consumption is identified. The energy-optimized configuration is a column with improved heat transfer between vapor and liquid streams. MESH equations are used for the validation of the FluxMax design, as they are state-of-the-art in process modeling tools. While the new design reduces the energy demand by up to 64% compared to the classical design, additional heat exchange area is required to exploit the energy reduction potential. A multi-objective optimization-energy duty vs. heat exchanger area-is carried out to identify the optimal trade-off between energy demand and heat exchanger area related capital cost. The highly energy-efficient designs identified by the FluxMax approach may be realized in practice by horizontal columns or modularized container solutions.","[Schack, Dominik; Jastram, Alexander; Liesche, Georg; Sundmacher, Kai] Max Planck Inst Dynam Complex Tech Syst, Dept Proc Syst Engn, Magdeburg, Germany; [Sundmacher, Kai] Otto von Guericke Univ, Dept Proc Syst Engn, Magdeburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; Otto von Guericke University,"Sundmacher, K (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Dynam Complex Tech Syst, Dept Proc Syst Engn, Magdeburg, Germany.;Sundmacher, K (corresponding author), Otto von Guericke Univ, Dept Proc Syst Engn, Magdeburg, Germany.",sundmacher@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de,,"Jastram, Alexander/0000-0002-4893-6049",,,,,46,2,2,0,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-598X,,,FRONT ENERGY RES,Front.

While most of these wetlands were conserved in a relatively good condition until a few decades ago, pressures brought about by land use and climate change have threaten their integrity in recent years. The aim of this article is to provide a bibliometric analysis of the available scientific literature relating to the remote sensing of wetlands in South America. From 1960 to 2015, 153 articles were published in 63 different journals, with the number of articles published per year increasing progressively since 1990. This rise is also paralleled by an increase in the contribution of local authors. The most intensively studied regions are the wetland macrosystems of South American mega-rivers: the Amazon and Parana Rivers, along with the Pantanal at the headwaters of Paraguay River. Few studies spanned more than two countries. The most frequent objectives were mapping, covering all types of wetlands with optical data, and hydrology, focusing on floodplain wetlands with microwave data as the preferred data source. The last decade substantial growth reflects an increase in technological and scientific capacities. Nevertheless, the state of the art regarding the remote sensing of wetlands in South America remains enigmatic. Fundamental questions and guidelines which may contribute to the understanding of the functioning of these ecosystems are yet to be fully defined and there is considerable dispersion in the use of data and remote-sensing approaches.","[Kandus, Patricia; Gail Minotti, Priscilla; Soledad Morandeira, Natalia; Grimson, Rafael; Gonzalez Trilla, Gabriela; Belen Gonzalez, Eliana; San Martin, Laura; Patricia Gayol, Maira] Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, 3iA, LETyE, Campus Miguelete,25 Mayo & Francia, RA-1650 San Martin, Argentina; [Soledad Morandeira, Natalia; Grimson, Rafael; Gonzalez Trilla, Gabriela; Belen Gonzalez, Eliana; San Martin, Laura; Patricia Gayol, Maira] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Kandus, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, 3iA, LETyE, Campus Miguelete,25 Mayo & Francia, RA-1650 San Martin, Argentina.",pkandus@unsam.edu.ar,"Morandeira, Natalia/AAZ-8625-2021; Minotti, Priscilla Gail/L-8907-2016; Minotti, Priscilla/AAT-8682-2021","Minotti, Priscilla Gail/0000-0001-7478-4598; Minotti, Priscilla/0000-0001-7478-4598; San Martin, Laura/0000-0001-7881-3384; Kandus, Patricia/0000-0001-6660-2977; Gayol, Maira/0000-0003-3236-7264; Morandeira, Natalia/0000-0003-3674-2981; Gonzalez Trilla, Gabriela/0000-0003-4112-5013","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnica FONCyT MinCyT [PICT-2014-0824, 2014-2860]",Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnica FONCyT MinCyT,This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnica FONCyT MinCyT [PICT-2014-0824 and 2014-2860];,,113,23,25,6,87,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

A smart approach would be to develop new materials to produce such fuels, which could be integrated with renewables to improve the efficiency (e.g., solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in smart grid and concentrated solar fuel technologies). In this study, we report the utilization of nonstoichiometric perovskite oxides, Ba2Ca0.66Nb1.34-xFexO6-delta (BCNF) (0 <= x <= 1), to split CO2 into carbon, carbon monoxide, and oxygen at elevated temperatures. Powder X-ray diffraction shows the chemical stability of double perovskite-type BCNF after being exposed to 2000 ppm CO2 in Ar at 700 degrees C. Furthermore, all x <= 0.66 BCNF members exhibit high chemical stability even under pure CO2 at 700 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray, Raman spectroscopy, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and mass spectroscopy (MS), and DFT analyses confirm the formation of solid carbon upon CO2 exposure, which increases with increasing Fe in BCNF. Mossbauer spectroscopy of the as-prepared BCNF shows the presence of Fe3+, Fe4+ and Fe5+. Upon Ar exposure, the higher valent Fe component is reduced to Fe3+ and subsequent oxidation of Fe3+ seems to promote the CO2 reduction. Overall, these promising results of BCNFs, displaying redox activity at significantly lower temperatures compared to state-of-the-art ceria for CO2 reduction, show great potential for their use in renewable-driven fuel technologies.","[Mulmi, Suresh; Thangadurai, Venkataraman] Univ Calgary, Dept Chem, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Chen, Haomin; Adams, Stefan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Hassan, Azfar; Sharif, Farbod; Roberts, Edward P.

Remotely-sensed data acquired by earth-observing satellites offer great advantages for timely monitoring of snow cover. However, the main obstacle is the tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolution of satellite imageries. Soft or subpixel classification of low or moderate resolution satellite images is a preferred technique to overcome this problem. The most frequently employed snow cover fraction methods applied on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have evolved from spectral unmixing and empirical Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) methods to latest machine learning-based artificial neural networks (ANNs). This study demonstrates the implementation of subpixel snow-covered area estimation based on the state-of-the-art nonparametric spline regression method, namely, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). MARS models were trained by using MODIS top of atmospheric reflectance values of bands 1-7 as predictor variables. Reference percentage snow cover maps were generated from higher spatial resolution Landsat ETM+ binary snow cover maps. A multilayer feed-forward ANN with one hidden layer trained with backpropagation was also employed to estimate the percentage snow-covered area on the same data set. The results indicated that the developed MARS model performed better than the ANN model with an average RMSE of 0.1656 over the test areas; whereas the average RMSE of the ANN model was 0.3868.","[Kuter, S.] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Engn, TR-18200 Cankiri, Turkey; [Akyurek, Z.] Middle East Tech Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Kuter, S.; Weber, G. -W.] Middle East Tech Univ, Inst Appl Math, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Akyurek, Z.; Weber, G. -W.] Middle East Tech Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Dept Geodet & Geog Informat Technol, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Cankiri Karatekin University; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University,"Kuter, S (corresponding author), Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Engn, TR-18200 Cankiri, Turkey.;Kuter, S (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Inst Appl Math, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",semihkuter@karatekin.edu.tr; zakyurek@metu.edu.tr; gweber@metu.edu.tr,"Kuter, Semih/AAF-3298-2021; AKYUREK, Zuhal/Q-4297-2016; Weber, Gerhard-Wilhelm/V-2046-2017","Kuter, Semih/0000-0002-4760-3816; Weber, Gerhard-Wilhelm/0000-0003-0849-7771",,,,,26,2,2,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2194-9034,,,INT ARCH PHOTOGRAMM,,,2016,W1,,,,31,36,,10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W1-31-2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W1-31-2016,,,6,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Physical Geography; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BH7IM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000402560000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, we can notice it has become part of the constitution of several states within only a few decades, facilitating appropriate developments at regional and international levels. This study shows that the appearance of the global environment issues (greenhouse effect, climate changes, thinning of the ozone layer, etc.) contributed to the reinforcement of its status: a fundamental right and also the right of the humankind to survive. By our analysis of the case-law establishment, we underline the fact that the right to a healthy environment was stated by the way of interpreting the art. 8.1 in the European Convention on Human Rights, in the absence of an explicit statement in the matter. Thus, the right to a healthy environment is considered a part of the right to private and family life, protected by a bounding effect (the extension of the protection provided by certain rights warranted by the Convention to rights that are not expressly stated therein.

Research purpose: To provide an overview of the JD-R model, which incorporates many possible working conditions and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well-being. Moreover, the studies of the special issue were introduced. Research design: Qualitative and quantitative studies on the JD-R model were reviewed to enlighten the health and motivational processes suggested by the model. Main findings: Next to the confirmation of the two suggested processes of the JD-R model, the studies of the special issue showed that the model can be used to predict work-place bullying, incidences of upper respiratory track infection, work-based identity, and early retirement intentions. Moreover, whilst psychological safety climate could be considered as a hypothetical precursor of job demands and resources, compassion satisfaction moderated the health process of the model. Contribution/value-add: The findings of previous studies and the studies of the special issue were integrated in the JD-R model that can be used to predict well-being and performance at work. New avenues for future research were suggested. Practical/managerial implications: The JD-R model is a framework that can be used for organisations to improve employee health and motivation, whilst simultaneously improving various organisational outcomes.","[Demerouti, Evangelia] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Bakker, Arnold B.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Work & Organisat Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Demerouti, E (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",e.demerouti@tue.nl,"Bakker, Arnold B./F-8494-2010; Demerouti, E/AAD-1334-2019","Bakker, Arnold B./0000-0003-1489-1847; Demerouti, E/0000-0002-4615-6532",,,,,75,481,491,21,138,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-5200,2071-0763,,SA J IND PSYCHOL,SA J.

This resource, however, is undergoing significant declines across the globe, and there is an urgent need to develop change detection techniques appropriate to the scale of loss and applicable to the complex coastal marine environment. Our work aimed to develop remote-sensing-based techniques for detection of changes between 1990 and 2019 in the area of seagrass meadows in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. Four state-of-the-art machine-learning models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), and CatBoost (CB), were evaluated for classification of seagrass cover (presence/absence) in a Landsat 8 image from 2019, using near-concurrent Ground-Truth Points (GTPs). We then used the most accurate one of these models, CB, with historic Landsat imagery supported by classified aerial photographs for an estimation of change in cover over time. The CB model produced the highest accuracies (precision, recall, F-1 scores of 0.94, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively). We were able to use Landsat imagery to document the trajectory and spatial distribution of an approximately 50% reduction in seagrass area from 2237 ha to 1184 ha between the years 1990-2019. Our illustration of change detection of seagrass in Tauranga Harbour suggests that machine-learning techniques, coupled with historic satellite imagery, offers potential for evaluation of historic as well as ongoing seagrass dynamics.","[Nam-Thang Ha; Manley-Harris, Merilyn; Hawes, Ian] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton 3260, New Zealand; [Nam-Thang Ha] Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Fisheries, Hue 530000, Vietnam; [Tien-Dat Pham] Florida Int Univ FIU, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA",University of Waikato; Hue University; Nong Lam University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Pham, TD (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ FIU, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",hanamthang@hueuni.edu.vn; manleyha@waikato.ac.nz; dat6784@gmail.com; ian.hawes@waikato.ac.nz,"Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017; Manley-Harris, Merilyn/E-5260-2013","Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Manley-Harris, Merilyn/0000-0001-5795-0208; Thang, Ha/0000-0002-4661-8602",,,,,76,6,6,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

The perspectives of three researchers, from different experiential and methodological backgrounds, are presented. The article explores: how we define concepts of impact; how we seek to measure the impact of engaging with music, providing examples from our own recent work; and tensions in attempting to capture or measure the 'magic' of music, including how to meet the needs of different audiences and how to develop new ways to capture impact. The authors reflect on the political climate in which music interventions operate, including the need to ask different questions at different times for different audiences, concluding that it is vital to measure both whether there is any impact, how this impact was achieved, and people's experiences of engaging with music. We found consensus about the need to move evidence forwards through both the use of arts-based creative methods that focus on the music- making process itself as well as through collaborations that bring together varied perspectives, experiences, disciplines and research methods. We also argue that - as there is considerable evidence about the impact of music, on different people, in different ways and in different settings - researchers should now aim to take stock of the evidence base. Finally, we posit that there is merit in engaging with a reflective dialogue like the one presented here, as a tool to help challenge, disrupt and influence our own thinking.","[Camlin, Dave] Royal Coll Mus, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BS, England; [Caulfield, Laura] Univ Wolverhampton, Wulfruna St, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, England; [Perkins, Rosie] Royal Coll Mus, Ctr Performance Sci, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BS, England",Royal College of Music - UK; University of Wolverhampton; Royal College of Music - UK,"Camlin, D (corresponding author), Royal Coll Mus, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BS, England.",dave.camlin@rcm.ac.uk; L.Caulfield@wlv.ac.uk; rosie.perkins@rcm.ac.uk,"Camlin, Dave/AAV-9643-2021","Camlin, Dave/0000-0003-4276-7181",AHRC [AH/P009921/1] Funding Source: UKRI,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,37,1,1,0,6,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1752-6299,1752-6302,,INT J COMMUNITY MUSI,Int.

The paper describes the evolution of the project and explains the design process involving 3d parametric modelling and optimization of both the geometry and materials. It shows the challenges of the structural design originating from two opposing interests - the Architect's aesthetical vision and the Contractors requirement for cost efficiency.

Therefore, incisive actions and strategies to safeguard urbanized areas are always more undeniable. In recent years, reliable mathematical models for hyperconcentrated flows and debris flows have been developed and used to plan hazard protection and mitigation strategies successfully. However, the increasing trustworthiness of advanced modelling implies higher complexity and larger computational burdens, with a greater request of high-performing hardware. Therefore, new solutions should be found, in order to overcome these drawbacks and encourage a widespread diffusion of best practices and best available technologies not entailing excessive costs in risk-management field, as the UE Flood Directive (2007/60/EC) requires. In this work, a smart and easy-to-use solution is proposed and applied to the TRENT2D model, which is a state-of-the-art 2D model, simulating debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows. This model was converted into a service and equipped with WebGIS technology, developing a complete, flexible and user-friendly working environment. This solution allows geographically referenced input and output to be managed straightforwardly. Moreover, computational burdens are transferred from the user hardware to a high-performing server, also enhancing model accessibility. To avoid work fragmentation, also a GIS-based BUWAL-type hazard-mapping procedure was implemented in the same working environment.

These storms are one of the main causes for timber loss in European forests and damaged areas are prone to further degradation by, for example, bark beetle infestations. Usually, manual mapping of damaged areas based on aerial photographs is conducted by forest departments. This is very time-consuming and therefore automatic detection of windthrows based on active and passive remote sensing data is an ongoing research topic. In this study we evaluated state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for calamity assessment. The study area is in in the northern part of Hesse (Germany) and was covered by twelve Sentinel-2 scenes from 2018. Labels of damaged areas from the Friedericke storm (18 January 2018) were provided by HessenForst. We conducted several experiments based on a custom U-Net setup to derive the optimal architecture and input data as well as to assess the transferability of the model. Results highlight the possibility to detect damaged forest areas using Sentinel-2 data. Using a binary classification, accuracies of more than 92% were achieved with an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 46.6%. The proposed workflow was integrated into ArcGIS and is suitable for fast detection of damaged areas directly after a storm and for disaster management but is limited by the deca-meter spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data.","[Scharvogel, Daniel; Brandmeier, Melanie] Esri Deutschland, Dept Sci & Educ, Ringstr 7, D-85402 Kranzberg, Germany; [Scharvogel, Daniel] Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Dept Forestry, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 3, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Weis, Manuel] HessenForst, Europastr 10-12, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",,"Scharvogel, D (corresponding author), Esri Deutschland, Dept Sci & Educ, Ringstr 7, D-85402 Kranzberg, Germany.;Scharvogel, D (corresponding author), Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Dept Forestry, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 3, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",D.Scharvogel@gmx.net; m.brandmeier@esri.de; Manuel.Weis@forst.hessen.de,,"Brandmeier, Melanie/0000-0002-6778-2508",,,,,38,3,4,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,DEC,2020,12,,,,,,1239,10.3390/f11121239,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11121239,,,21,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,PJ8GY,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000602000000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have the unique potential to be centres of renewable H-2 generation with the growing availability of two attractive feedstocks: biomethane and ammonia. An innovative and novel method of ammonia recovery from digestate liquor followed by a state-of-the-art H-2 production process named NWaste2H2 is demonstrated for a case-study WWTP. The recovered ammonia is used alongside biomethane for H-2 production and its diversion from conventional biological treatment has two other crucial benefits, with reductions in both associated electricity demand and emissions of nitrous oxide, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. Process modelling, supported by extensive experiments in a packed-bed reactor at bench-scale, demonstrate the prized capability of simultaneously performing steam methane reforming and ammonia decomposition to generate a H-2-rich syngas with yields close to equilibrium values. Greenhouse gas emission abatement from the replacement of diesel buses and reduced N2O emissions from biological treatment could save up to 17.2 kg CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) per year for each person served by the WWTP. An in-depth economic study illustrates the ability to achieve a positive net present value with a 10% discount factor as early as 5.8 years when the H-2 is prepared and sold to power fuel cell electric buses.","[Grasham, Oliver; Dupont, Valerie; Cockerill, Timothy] Univ Leeds, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Camargo-Valero, Miller Alonso] Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Twigg, Martyn V.] Twigg Scient & Tech Ltd, Cambridge CB23 3PQ, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Grasham, O (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",R.Grasham@leeds.ac.uk,"Camargo-Valero, Miller Alonso/AAZ-3647-2020; Dupont, Valerie/E-6833-2010","Camargo-Valero, Miller Alonso/0000-0003-2962-1698; Dupont, Valerie/0000-0002-3750-0266; Cockerill, Tim/0000-0001-7914-2340","UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [NWaste2H2 EP/R00076X/1, EP/L014912/1]; EPSRC [EP/R030243/1, EP/R00076X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors would like to thank the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for their grant award NWaste2H2 EP/R00076X/1.

Recent analyses, however, have indicated a tendency for increased CA precipitation through the 21st century, particularly during December-January-February (DJF). Here we show that this increase is due entirely to an increase in extreme (>90th percentile) daily precipitation. This response is consistent with enhanced horizontal vapor transport off the CA coast, most of which is caused by thermodynamical effects due to increases in atmospheric moisture. Furthermore, observations over the late twentieth century show that CA DJF extreme precipitation is associated with an El Nino-like sea surface temperature anomaly pattern. Models that better simulate the observed El Nino teleconnection with CA DJF precipitation also better reproduce the El Nino-like sea surface temperature anomaly pattern associated with extreme precipitation, including the associated thermodynamical and dynamical atmospheric responses. In turn, these models simulate a significantly larger increase in extreme precipitation under warming. Plain Language Summary In a warmer world, future California hydrological changes remain uncertain. Here we analyze state-of-the-art model simulations and find an increase in California precipitation during the winter. Nearly all of this increase is due to an increase in extreme precipitation, associated with moistening of the warmer atmosphere. Moreover, models that better simulate the El Nino-California precipitation teleconnection yield larger increases in extreme precipitation. This is related to better simulation of the dynamical and thermodynamical atmospheric responses associated with extreme California precipitation.","[Zecca, Katherina; Allen, Robert J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Anderson, Ray G.] USDA ARS, US Salin Lab, George E Brown Jr Salin Lab, 4500 Glenwood Dr, Riverside, CA 92501 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Allen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rjallen@ucr.edu,,"Anderson, Ray/0000-0002-6202-5890; Allen, Robert/0000-0003-1616-9719",NSF [AGS-1455682],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was funded by NSF award AGS-1455682.

Such systems combine the benefits of adaptive shading with facade integrated solar tracking, thus reducing the building energy demand, and simultaneously generating electricity on-site. The inventory for the life cycle assessment (LCA) was acquired using production data, and Energy Plus simulations to calculate the building energy demand. The impact assessment was conducted according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards using the Eco-invent database and openLCA as an analysis tool. The embodied environmental impact of the dynamic BIPV solution is higher than a static alternative due to the added control system, electronics, actuators, and additional supporting structure, resulting in higher life cycle impacts. However when accounting for the systems multi-functionality aspect, i.e. savings through adaptive shading to the building's heating, cooling and lighting loads, the embodied environmental impact can be offset, making the ASF an interesting alternative for BIPV. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate modifications to the actuator type, control system, and location and find that none of the investigated parameters overturn the key findings. The analysis ultimately enables us to provide design recommendations for future dynamic BIPV installations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Especially in the medium and large capacity range but recently also in the residential heating sector the utilisation of fuel assortments other than classical wood fuels (pellets, wood chips, forest residues) opens a wide potential of different and also more cost efficient feedstocks to be utilised. Examples are wood from SRF and agricultural residues such as shells, olive stones, miscanthus and agro-pellets. These fuels often show elevated S and Cl contents. Related problems with HCl and SOx emissions can be overcome with state-of-the-art secondary emission control technologies such as dry sorption. However, the influence of the fuel composition, especially of the S and Cl contents, on low temperature corrosion phenomena such as acid dew point corrosion and corrosion due to deliquescent salts in economisers, filters and air pre-heaters is still not well investigated. Therefore, a series of lab- sale and full-scale combustion test runs with a broad range of biomass fuels under application of novel measurement methods and equipment has been performed in order to investigate the relation between the fuel composition and low-temperature corrosion risks. According to the results achieved, corrosion due to acid dew points plays a minor role for these fuels but deposits of hygroscopic salts such as KCl and K2CO3 may lead to dew points that are significantly higher than the water dew point and consequently to related corrosion risks. Based on these results recommendations regarding minimum surface temperatures to avoid low-temperature corrosion have been derived.","[Brunner, Thomas; Obernberger, Ingwald; Ramerstorfer, Christian; Kanzian, Werner] Bios Bioenergiesysteme GmbH, Hedwig Katschinka Str 4, A-8020 Graz, Austria",,"Brunner, T (corresponding author), Bios Bioenergiesysteme GmbH, Hedwig Katschinka Str 4, A-8020 Graz, Austria.",brunner@bios-bioenergy.at; obernberger@bios-bioenergy.at; ramerstorfer@bios-bioenergy.at; kanzian@bios-bioenergy.at,,,Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [848863]; European Union [654446],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; European Union(European Commission),The work presented in this paper has been derived from project 848863 funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund within the project line e!mission.at and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654446.

Compared to the environments with ice-free waters, the harsh environment in the Arctic is due to ice, low temperatures, remoteness, etc., all of which will complicate ship operations. Research on the shipping risk analysis in ice-covered waters is important because such research can improve the management of shipping businesses and aid accident prevention initiatives in the Arctic. In this paper, we systematically review and compare risk models for shipping in ice-covered waters to report experiences in the field and to identify existing knowledge gaps. This work provides a broad review and comparison of the state-of-the-art risk analysis models by considering the models' purposes, theoretical frameworks, risk factors, and outputs, and it includes an analysis of the field-specific terminology that is used to define accidents. The results indicate that the risk analysis of the Arctic faces challenges, as a complete overview of accident data is not easy to find. There has been significantly less research done on convoy operations in ice and overtaking and meeting in an ice channel. In addition, interactions between risk factors and human factors are not sufficiently understood and thus need to be further studied. Being familiar with knowledge gaps acts as a catalyst for further research on risk analysis within shipping in Arctic conditions.","[Xu, Sheng; Kim, Ekaterina; Haugen, Stein] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Marine Technol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Xu, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Marine Technol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.",sheng.xu@ntnu.no,,,,,,,81,7,7,15,60,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

Green roofs have proved effective at reducing urban stormwater management pressures, mitigating the urban heat island effect, reducing energy consumption, and improving air quality. However, no standard assessment methods and tools exist to value green roof ecosystem service delivery; a balance and coordination between different service values are lacking. Future research should focus on customizable low-cost and innovative green roof designs, increasing the number of quantitative case studies, and conducting multi-perspective evaluations. Considering how environmental, social, economic, and other benefits can be achieved on a larger scale is also necessary. Overall, this review helps advance research on green roofs and guide wide-spread implementation in urban areas in response to environmental challenges.","[Liu, Hongqing; Kong, Fanhua; Zheng, Xiandi; Huang, Jing; Wang, Ding; Wen, Zhihao] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Xianlin Ave 163, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongqing; Zheng, Xiandi; Huang, Jing; Wang, Ding; Wen, Zhihao] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci ESSI, Xianlin Ave 163, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Yin, Haiwei; Xu, Hairong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Middel, Ariane] Arizona State Univ, Sch Arts Media & Engn, 950 S Forest Mall,Stauffer B258, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Kong, FH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Xianlin Ave 163, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",fanhuakong@nju.edu.cn,,", JING/0000-0001-7010-1163","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFE0196000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51878328, 31670470]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFE0196000) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51878328, 31670470).",,103,28,29,54,172,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

In response, we developed an approach to consistently combine state-of-the-art emission inventory and impact assessment models for assessing human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts from pesticide applications, and tested our approach in an LCA case study on pesticides applied to an open-field tomato produced in Martinique (French West Indies). Our results show that impact scores vary over several orders of magnitude, mainly as function of differences in pesticide properties and application time in relation to crop growth stage. Overall, impacts related to pesticide field emissions leading to exposure to pesticide residues in crop harvest are a main contributor to LCA performance results for tomato produced in Martinique, with fertilizer and packaging manufacturing as other dominating aspects. While the proposed approach is applicable to refine currently LCA methods for assessing pesticides, large uncertainties remain. These are mostly related to the parametrization of impact factors for tropical species. Based on our findings, we recommend using initial emission distribution fractions in combination with steady-state characterization factors for environmental emissions and with time-dependent characterization factors for pesticide residues in crop harvest in LCA, while further improving the use of secondary emission fractions to allow for better consideration of local field, soil and climate characteristics.

However, to date, few studies have analyzed the underlying spatial and temporal variability in farmers' individual water use decisions at a landscape scale. We compare estimates of irrigation water requirements derived using state-of-the-art remote sensing models with metered abstraction records for 1400 fields over a 13 year period in the US state of Nebraska, one of the world's most intensively irrigated agricultural regions. We show that farmers' observed water use decisions often diverge significantly from biophysical estimates of crop irrigation requirements. In particular, our findings are consistent with widespread use of water conservation practices by farmers in drought years as an adaptive response to rising irrigation costs and regulatory water supply constraints in these years. We also demonstrate that, in any individual year, farmers observed water use exhibits large field-to-field variability, which cannot be explained fully by differences in weather, soil type, crop choice, or technology. Our results highlight the value of using both in situ monitoring and remote sensing to evaluate farmers' individual water use behavior and understand likely responses to future changes in climate or water policy. Moreover, our findings also demonstrate potential challenges for current efforts in developed and developing countries to apply model-based approaches for field-level water use accounting and enforcement of irrigation water rights.","[Foster, T.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Goncalves, I.

Previous studies have shown that the spectral composition of daylight affects human circadian rhythms, with emphasis on wavelengths towards the blue region of the visible spectrum. Spectrally based metrics such as CCT can therefore aid in evaluating the circadian impact of daylight. TDDs redirect daylight towards interior spaces with changing light levels and color temperatures during the daylight hours. This paper details the color temperature and circadian lighting metrics (circadian luminance and illuminance) in an interior space throughout a period of several days in a mid-latitude, temperate, sunny climate. An automated time-lapse HDR photography apparatus was modified to allow for calculation of CCT and circadian lighting metrics using state-of-the art techniques available in the literature. Prior to the measurements in the space with the TDD, this device was calibrated against a spectrophotometer. Results indicate the level of daily variation in CCT and circadian lighting metrics that can be expected in interior spaces daylit by TDDs without any other sources of daylight. Besides showcasing the use of HDR techniques, these results could be used to support design decisions involving daylighting in interior spaces. These techniques can also be used outside the laboratory in the evaluation of the circadian impact of lighting throughout the built environment.","[Jain, Sneha; Garg, Vishal] Int Inst Informat Technol, Hyderabad, India; [Fernandes, Luis; Regnier, Cynthia] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA",International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Jain, S (corresponding author), Int Inst Informat Technol, Hyderabad, India.",,"Garg, Vishal/H-7898-2016","Garg, Vishal/0000-0002-2599-2785","Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF), Building Energy Efficiency Higher and Advance Networks (BHAVAN) fellowship; California Energy Commission through its Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) Program on behalf of the citizens of California; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF), Building Energy Efficiency Higher and Advance Networks (BHAVAN) fellowship; California Energy Commission through its Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) Program on behalf of the citizens of California; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors would like to acknowledge their LBNL colleagues, Jordan Shackelford for providing the Spectrophotometer, to Marco Pritoni and Taoning Wang, for their help in calculation methods.

The marine environment provides significant benefits to humans often described as stemming from ecosystem services (ES). Cultural ecosystem services (CESs) are included in the majority of ecosystem service frameworks in some form. However, there is a lack of characterisation or valuation of CESs often because they are hard to identify. They are therefore frequently left out of assessments leading to a risk that ES frameworks are not being used to their full potential. By analysing responses from the Turkish public to an open question, posed about the sea, it is possible to access the interface between humans and the marine ecosystem. A number of CES categories were identified; aesthetic information, recreation, inspiration for art and design, and cultural heritage. In addition, provisioning (seafood), air purification and climate modification were recognised. The four CES are characterised, including the hard to identify intangible elements, and the underpinning environmental components and linkages were explored. The analysis used revealed the intangible benefits, including a deeply emotional attachment to the marine environment. The understanding of the cultural linkages between the Turkish people and the Black Sea provides a mechansim for designing policy and ecosystem management measures, and for motivating individuals and communities to work towards protecting and enhancing ecosystems. The research also provides evidence to support the case that cultural experiences are frequently built upon the foundations of a healthy natural environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Accumulation of marine debris, besides climate change factors, including warming water, sea-level rise, and changes in oceans' chemistry, are causing the potential collapse of the marine environment's health. Due to the increase of marine debris, including plastics in coastlines, ocean and sea surfaces, and even in deep ocean layers, there is a need for developing new advanced technology for the detection of large-sized marine pollution (with sizes larger than 1 m) using state-of-the-art remote sensing and machine learning tools. Therefore, we developed a cloud-based framework for large-scale marine pollution detection with the integration of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and advanced machine learning tools on the Sentinel Hub cloud application programming interface (API). Moreover, we evaluated the performance of two shallow machine learning algorithms of random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), as well as the deep learning method of the generative adversarial network-random forest (GAN-RF) for the detection of ocean plastics in the pilot site of Mytilene Island, Greece. Based on the obtained results, the shallow algorithms of RF and SVM achieved an overall accuracy of 88% and 84%, respectively, with available training data of plastic debris. The GAN-RF classifier improved the detection of ocean plastics of the RF method by 8%, achieving an overall accuracy of 96% by generating several synthetic ocean plastic samples.","[Jamali, Ali] Univ Karabuk, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, TR-78050 Karabuk, Turkey; [Mahdianpari, Masoud] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada",Karabuk University; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Mahdianpari, M (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada.",alijamali@karabuk.edu.tr; m.mahdianpari@mun.ca,"Jamali, Ali/Q-5802-2019","Jamali, Ali/0000-0002-6073-5493; Mahdianpari, Masoud/0000-0002-7234-959X",,,,,71,2,2,4,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,18,,,,,,2553,10.3390/w13182553,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13182553,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UX0GD,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000700526600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are many models proposed for this purpose, but their effectiveness on target object detection in remote sensing images is not ideal due to the influence of climate conditions, obstacles and confusing objects presented in images, image clarity, and associated problems with small-target and multi-target detection and recognition. Therefore, how to accurately detect target objects in images is an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, a novel model, called YOLOv4_CE, is proposed in this paper, based on the classical YOLOv4 model with added improvements, resulting from replacing the backbone feature-extraction CSPDarknet53 network with a ConvNeXt-S network, replacing the Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss with the Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss, and adding a coordinate attention mechanism to YOLOv4, as to improve its remote sensing image detection capabilities. The results, obtained through experiments conducted on two open data sets, demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv4_CE model outperforms, in this regard, both the original YOLOv4 model and four other state-of-the-art models, namely Faster R-CNN, Gliding Vertex, Oriented R-CNN, and EfficientDet, in terms of the mean average precision (mAP) and F1 score, by achieving respective values of 95.03% and 0.933 on the NWPU VHR-10 data set, and 95.89% and 0.937 on the RSOD data set.","[Yang, Xunkai; Zhao, Jingyi; Dai, Chenxu; Ji, Zhanlin] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Tangshan 063210, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haiyang] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Comp, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Li] Tsinghua Univ, Res Inst Informat Technol, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Ji, Zhanlin; Ganchev, Ivan] Univ Limerick, Telecommun Res Ctr TRC, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland; [Ganchev, Ivan] Univ Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Dept Comp Syst, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria; [Ganchev, Ivan] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Math & Informat, Sofia 1040, Bulgaria",North China University of Science & Technology; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Tsinghua University; University of Limerick; Plovdiv University; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Ji, ZL (corresponding author), North China Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Tangshan 063210, Peoples R China.;Ji, ZL; Ganchev, I (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Telecommun Res Ctr TRC, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland.;Ganchev, I (corresponding author), Univ Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Dept Comp Syst, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria.;Ganchev, I (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Math & Informat, Sofia 1040, Bulgaria.",zhanlin.ji@gmail.com; ivan.ganchev@ul.ie,"Ganchev, Ivan/D-4973-2012","Ganchev, Ivan/0000-0003-0535-7087","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFE0135700]; MES [D01-168/28.07.2022]; Telecommunications Research Centre (TRC), University of Limerick, Ireland","National Key Research and Development Program of China; MES; Telecommunications Research Centre (TRC), University of Limerick, Ireland","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFE0135700; in part by the MES under Grant No. D01-168/28.07.2022 for NCDSC part of the Bulgarian National Roadmap on RIs; and in part by the Telecommunications Research Centre (TRC), University of Limerick, Ireland.",,41,0,0,21,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,,,,,95527,95538,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204053,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,4O3LJ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000854603700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this regard, a significant amount of research has been done in order to address this issue, deploying a wide variety of technologies and following a multi-disciplinary approach. Notably, computer vision has played a fundamental role in this regard. It can be used to extract and combine information from several imaging modalities in regard to fire detection, characterization and wildfire spread forecasting. In recent years, there has been work pertaining to Deep Learning (DL)-based fire segmentation, showing very promising results. However, it is currently unclear whether the architecture of a model, its loss function, or the image type employed (visible, infrared, or fused) has the most impact on the fire segmentation results. In the present work, we evaluate different combinations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL architectures, loss functions, and types of images to identify the parameters most relevant to improve the segmentation results. We benchmark them to identify the top-performing ones and compare them to traditional fire segmentation techniques. Finally, we evaluate if the addition of attention modules on the best performing architecture can further improve the segmentation results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that evaluates the impact of the architecture, loss function, and image type in the performance of DL-based wildfire segmentation models.","[Ciprian-Sanchez, Jorge Francisco] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Sci & Engn, Av Lago Guadalupe KM 35, Ciudad Lopez Mateos 52926, Mexico; [Ochoa-Ruiz, Gilberto] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Sci & Engn, Av Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Rossi, Lucile; Morandini, Frederic] Univ Cors, Lab Sci Environm, Campus Grimaldi BP 52, F-20250 Corte, France",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Ciprian-Sanchez, JF; Rossi, L (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Sci & Engn, Av Lago Guadalupe KM 35, Ciudad Lopez Mateos 52926, Mexico.;Rossi, L (corresponding author), Univ Cors, Lab Sci Environm, Campus Grimaldi BP 52, F-20250 Corte, France.",jorgefran07@hotmail.com; gilberto.ochoa@tec.mx; rossi_l@univ-corse.fr; morandini_f@univ-corse.fr,,"Ochoa-Ruiz, Gilberto/0000-0002-9896-8727; Rossi, Lucile/0000-0002-7929-4624; Morandini, Frederic/0000-0003-1871-3941; Ciprian Sanchez, Jorge/0000-0003-0672-0503",Tecnologico de Monterrey tuition scholarship [A01373326]; Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT); Jalisco State Council of Science and Technology (COECYTJAL) [7817-2019]; Corsican Region; French Ministry of Research; CNRS under Grant CPER 2014-2020,"Tecnologico de Monterrey tuition scholarship; Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Jalisco State Council of Science and Technology (COECYTJAL); Corsican Region(Region Auvergne-Rhone-AlpesRegion Bourgogne-Franche-ComteRegion Hauts-de-FranceRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine); French Ministry of Research(Ministry of Research, FranceEuropean Commission); CNRS under Grant CPER 2014-2020","This research was supported in part by Tecnologico de Monterrey tuition scholarship A01373326, the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), the Jalisco State Council of Science and Technology (COECYTJAL) project number 7817-2019, the Corsican Region, the French Ministry of Research, and the CNRS under Grant CPER 2014-2020.",,87,3,3,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In this review, the different conventional CD methods based on threshold, time differentiation, machine learning, and the intelligent algorithms including convolution neural networks (CNN), simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), and semantic segmentation algorithms (SSAs) are introduced in detail, and, especially, the majority of CD publications employing the advanced and prevalent DL algorithms during the last decade are summarized and analyzed. First, in terms of the detection for different types of clouds, we meticulously compare the labels, scenarios and volumes of three popular CD datasets and put forward further the constructive recommendations about the cloud images selection, multi-bands images preprocessing, and truth labels combination for creating similar datasets. Subsequently, the structures, detection accuracies, and operating speeds of several different CD network models comprising the fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), U-Net, SegNet, pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), as well as the associated derivatives are conducted elaborately to explore the comprehensively optimal performance for CD. In addition, aiming at expanding the applications in the resource-limited space-borne environment, we conclude the mainstream compression strategies of a number of different lightweight networks.

Chekhov was born 160 years ago. He graduated in 1884 at the Medical School, Moscow University. Then he practiced medicine in a middle-class section of Moscow, but many of his patients were poor and could not pay. He soon started to write stories, and after several years purchased the rundown Melikhovo estate. There he lived until declining health from tuberculosis forced him to move to the milder climate of Yalta. Chekhov asked the big question, what is the purpose of life? Science could not answer, so his writings presented man as a victim of a preposterous world, and he created hundreds of characters who embodied weakness, passivity, and ineffectiveness. In his own personal life, he elected not to marry and serve biological renewal as the purpose of being. Instead, he followed another path: creating innovative stories and plays that would become his legacy. Tolstoy compared Chekhov's stories to impressionist paintings. These masterpieces and his best plays, including, Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard, The Seagull, and Uncle Vanya, have influenced many outstanding writers, and they still strongly appeal to the readers and theatergoers around the world. Chekhov's numerous characters include an array of more than 30 medical doctors who are discouraged by various problems and poor working conditions. Chekhov, many his followers, and the majority of modern doctors-writers are perhaps trying to find the meaning of life in the reign of arts to science.","[Igic, Rajko] Univ Banja Luka, Sch Med, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Banja Luka 78000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Igic, Rajko] John H Stroger Jr Hosp Cook Cty, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Management, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Igic, Rajko] Med Ctr, Sombor 25000, Serbia",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL); John H Stroger Junior Hospital Cook County; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Igic, R (corresponding author), Univ Banja Luka, Sch Med, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Banja Luka 78000, Bosnia & Herceg.;Igic, R (corresponding author), John H Stroger Jr Hosp Cook Cty, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Management, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.;Igic, R (corresponding author), Med Ctr, Sombor 25000, Serbia.",igicrajko@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,2,IMPRIMATUR PUBLICATIONS,ATHENS,"30 DEM POLIORKETES ST, ATHENS, 136 76, GREECE",1107-0625,2241-6293,,J BUON,J.

The design of asphalt pavements for streets and roads evolved from empiric to mechanistic-empiric (M-E) procedures throughout the 20th century. The mechanistic-empiric method, based on layered elastic theory, became a common practice with the publication of separate procedures by Shell Oil, Asphalt Institute, and French LCPC, among others. Since its origin, the M-E procedure can consider incremental pavement design but, only until the beginning of the 21st century, the computational power became available to practicing engineers. American MEPDG represents the state-of-the-art M-E incremental design procedure with significant advantages and drawbacks, the latter mainly related to the extensive calibration activities required to assure a proper analysis and design according to subgrade, climate, and materials at a particular location and for an intended level of reliability. Perpetual pavements are a subset of M-E designed pavements with a proven history of success for the conditions where they are warranted. No design method, either the most straightforward empirical approach or the most elaborated incremental mechanistic one, is appropriate without proper knowledge about the fundamental design factors and calibration of the performance models for each distress mode upon consideration.","[Vasquez-Varela, Luis R.; Garcia-Orozco, Francisco J.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ingn & Arquitectura, Dept Ingn Civil, Carrera 27 64-60, Manizales 170004, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Vasquez-Varela, LR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ingn & Arquitectura, Dept Ingn Civil, Carrera 27 64-60, Manizales 170004, Colombia.",lrvasquezv@unal.edu.co,"Vasquez-Varela, Luis/AAO-7404-2021","Vasquez-Varela, Luis/0000-0003-2293-7294; Garcia Orozco, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-2191-5328",,,,,50,1,1,2,55,IMPRENTA UNIV ANTIOQUIA,MEDELLIN,"67 N 53-108, BLOQUE 28, CIUDAD UNIV, UNIV ANTIQUIA, MEDELLIN, 00000, COLOMBIA",0120-6230,2422-2844,,REV FAC ING-UNIV ANT,Rev.

Most existing works assume that inverse covariance estimators contain sparse structure and then construct models with the l(1) regularization. In this paper, different from existing works, we study the inverse covariance estimation problem from another perspective by efficiently modeling the low-rank structure in the inverse covariance, which is assumed to be a combination of a low-rank part and a diagonal matrix. One motivation for this assumption is that the low rank structure is common in many applications including the climate and financial analysis, and another one is that such assumption can reduce the computational complexity when computing its inverse. Specifically, we propose an efficient COmponent Pursuit (COP) method to obtain the low-rank part, where each component can be sparse. For optimization, the COP method greedily learns a rank-one component in each iteration by maximizing the log likelihood. Moreover, the COP algorithm enjoys several appealing properties including the existence of an efficient solution in each iteration and the theoretical guarantee on the convergence of this greedy approach. Experiments on large-scale synthetic and real world datasets including thousands of millions variables show that the COP method is faster than the state-of-the-art techniques for the inverse covariance estimation problem when achieving comparable log-likelihood on test data.","[Han, Lei; Zhang, Tong] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Zhang, Yu] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tong] Baidu Inc, Beijing, Peoples R China",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Baidu,"Han, L (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",lhan@stat.rutgers.edu; zhangyu@cse.ust.hk; tzhang@stat.rutgers.edu,"Zhang, Tong/HGC-1090-2022","Zhang, Yu/0000-0003-1100-4835","NSF [IIS-1250985, IIS-1407939]; NIH [R01A1116744]; NSFC [61305071]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [R01AI116744] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),"This research was partially supported by NSF IIS-1250985, NSF IIS-1407939, NIH R01A1116744 and NSFC 61305071.",,29,1,1,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4232-2,,,,2016,,,,,1585,1594,,10.1145/2939672.2939851,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939851,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BN6JM,28580192,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000485529800171,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this reason, also energy policy must be designed for the long term. It is, and will remain, an independent policy area; it is nor an annex to other political areas. Nuclear power and renewable energies are no contradictions, bit partners able jointly to meet part of the energy requirement without creating any carbon dioxide emissions. Compared to coal fired power plants, nuclear power world-wide prevents carbon dioxide emissions of more than 2.2 billion tons per annum. Without nuclear power, it world not be possible to meet the targets of carbon dioxide reduction which must be met in the interest of climate protection. Only if Germany continues to rise nuclear power, and develops it further, ave will have a chance to make German safety standards accepted internationally. It would be irresponsible to keep German safety know-how from other countries. It is important for Germany to preserve and advance its nuclear competence, which was acquired at great industrial expense. After all, nuclear power means almost 40,000 highly qualified jobs.

The objective of this paper is to develop novel proposals revealing generalised dynamics on HOW the different normative recommendations can work under different exploratory scenarios. Previous literature has focused more on developing methods for integrating normative and exploratory scenarios than on theorising dynamics of the HOW question. We examine this theoretical question via a case study on potential futures of use and governance of Baltic herring catch. The case study: 1) develops recommendations on how the use of Baltic herring as food can be increased based on a participatory backcasting workshop with fisheries experts; 2) identifies four exploratory scenarios on the future of Baltic fisheries governance based on a literature review; 3) assesses how the recommendations work under four alternative plausible futures. We identify and discuss six generalised dynamics answering the HOW question. Together, these stress the need to analyse simultaneously multiple drivers, stakeholders, exploratory scenarios, normative recommendations, and synergies and frictions between recommendations. This work contributes to capacities to cope with future changes and proactively develop practical means to make our world more sustainable.","[Sarkki, Simo] Univ Oulu, Cultural Anthropol, Fac Humanities, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Pihlajamaki, Mia] Univ Tampere, Fac Management, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland; [Pihlajamaki, Mia] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pihlajamaki, Mia] Univ Oulu, Water Resources & Environm Engn Res Grp, POB 4300, Oulu 90014, Finland",University of Oulu; Tampere University; University of Helsinki; University of Oulu,"Sarkki, S (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Cultural Anthropol, Fac Humanities, Oulu 90014, Finland.",simo.sarkki@oulu.fi; mia.pihlajamaki@uta.fi,,"Pihlajamaki, Mia/0000-0003-1322-0558; Sarkki, Simo/0000-0002-7790-0600",BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland,BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland,"This paper is a contribution from the BONUS GOHERR project (Integrated governance of Baltic herring and salmon stocks involving stakeholders), and it has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and the Academy of Finland.

Laili Cave, in northern Timor-Leste, preserves the oldest human occupation in this insular region with a cultural sequence spanning 11,200 to 44,600 cal BP. Small-bodied vertebrates and invertebrates were recovered to the lowest excavated levels, associated with highly concentrated stone artefacts. We report on human behavioural adaptations within the context of Pleistocene environments and changing landscapes using zooarchaeological, stone artefact, bathymetric, and experimental isotopic. analyses. Results indicate that Pleistocene humans used the abundant local chert liberally and engaged in mobile broad-spectrum exploitation of invertebrates and fishes from marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments within close proximity of Laili Cave. The faunal assemblage indicates heterogeneous but relatively stable environments during the late Pleistocene.

Incorrect cloud forecasts can lead to major uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their intrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this challenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of high-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this article, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called CloudCast. It consists of 70 080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of the atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the dataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3 x 3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between frames for the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. All frames are centered and projected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation study with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as convolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks, and optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video prediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the spatial and temporal domain. Our benchmark models show promising results but with ample room for improvement. This is the first publicly available global-scale dataset with high-resolution cloud types on a high temporal granularity to the authors' best knowledge.","[Nielsen, Andreas Holm; Iosifidis, Alexandros; Karstoft, Henrik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Engn, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Nielsen, AH (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Engn, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.",ahn@eng.au.dk; ai@eng.au.dk; hka@eng.au.dk,"Iosifidis, Alexandros/G-2433-2013","Iosifidis, Alexandros/0000-0003-4807-1345; Nielsen, Andreas Holm/0000-0003-4402-4840",,,,,46,2,2,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

These concepts are becoming ever more central to the resilience debate. They aggregate elements of climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection, and societal resilience in the face of complex, high-impact events. However, despite the potential of these concepts to link together diverse disciplines, scholars and practitioners need to avoid treating them in a superficial or ambiguous manner. Overlapping uses and definitions could generate confusion and lead to the duplication of research effort. This article gives an overview of the state of the art regarding compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks. It is intended to help build a coherent basis for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The main objective is to propose a holistic framework that highlights the complementarities of the four kinds of complex risk in a manner that is designed to support the work of researchers and policymakers. This article suggests how compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks could be used, with little or no redundancy, as inputs to new analyses and decisional tools designed to support the implementation of the SFDRR. The findings can be used to improve policy recommendations and support tools for emergency and crisis management, such as scenario building and impact trees, thus contributing to the achievement of a system-wide approach to resilience.","[Pescaroli, Gianluca; Alexander, David] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Pescaroli, G (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London WC1E 6BT, England.",gianluca.pescaroli@gmail.com,,"Pescaroli, Gianluca/0000-0003-3468-2970",European Commission [607579],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work has been carried out under the aegis of the EC FP7 FORTRESS project.

In this study, we propose an optical flow and super-resolution approach to accurately estimate motion from remote sensing images at a higher spatial resolution than the original data. First, an external example learning-based super-resolution method is applied on the original images to generate higher resolution versions. Then, an optical flow approach is applied on the higher resolution images, identifying sparse correspondences and interpolating them to extract a dense motion vector field with continuous values and subpixel accuracies. Our proposed approach is successfully evaluated on passive microwave, optical, and Synthetic Aperture Radar data, proving appropriate for multi-sensor applications and different spatial resolutions. The approach estimates motion with similar or higher accuracy than the original data, while increasing the spatial resolution of up to eight times. In addition, the adopted optical flow component outperforms a state-of-the-art pattern matching method. Overall, the proposed approach results in accurate motion vectors with unprecedented spatial resolutions of up to 1.5 km for passive microwave data covering the entire Arctic and 20 m for radar data, and proves promising for numerous scientific and operational applications.

Research and development in the field of green infrastructure are steadily progressing, determining aesthetic improvements as well as environmental, social and economic benefits. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic state-of-the-art in the field of vertical greening systems and identify significant gaps in research. Additionally, recent scientific studies are analysed to bundle existing knowledge on research in the specific field of green walls and to derive indications on set up practices to facilities and improvement of their post-comparability. The study is based on literature review using scientific literature such as peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and books as well as master and doctoral theses, research reports, research articles and recommendations. The study concludes that benefits of vertical greening systems in current literature often refer to general benefits of vegetation. Specific knowledge has been promoted on microclimatic effects, but complementary studies with focus on vertical greening systems are still lacking. Additionally, it was revealed that there is great potential for research on vertical greening systems in rural areas, especially taking into consideration the application of green walls on construction buildings like shotcrete walls, tunnel portals or highway bridges. For better comparability of future studies, single parameter-centered analyses under constant and comparable conditions are recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A mixed-methods pilot feasibility assessment of Move it Move it! was conducted in the Spring of 2014 to assess the impact of a before-school physical activity programme on student academic measures and behavioural health. Design:Move it Move it! encourages students and families to run/walk laps in the recess yard. Student miles are tracked and incentives are awarded at several benchmarks Setting: Launched in 2012, Move it Move it! is a voluntary morning running/walking programme at the Integrated Arts Academy (IAA) elementary school designed to build community, increase fitness and prepare students for learning. Methods: Self-reported surveys were administered to all consented students in grades 3-5 (N=129). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with school personnel (N=11). Results: Average Move it Move it! miles ran/walked were significantly positively associated with commitment to school and The New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP) mathematics testing scores. Interviews with school staff/faculty further explained quantitative results including the perceived impact of the programme on academic success and school engagement and the perceived impact of the programme on student behaviour and school climate. Conclusion: Results from this pilot assessment of a community-based initiative suggested that positive academic and behavioural outcomes were associated with engagement in a before-school incentive-based physical activity programme.","[Garnett, Bernice R.] Univ Vermont, Dept Educ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Becker, Kelly] Univ Vermont, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy Studies, Burlington, VT USA; [Vierling, Danielle; Gleason, Cara; Mongeon, Louise] Integrated Arts Acad, Burlington, VT USA; [DiCenzo, Danielle] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Garnett, BR (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Educ, Coll Educ & Social Serv, 533 Waterman Bldg,85 South Prospect St, Burlington, VT 05401 USA.",bgarnett@uvm.edu,,"Becker, Kelly/0000-0003-4290-3665",College of Education and Social Services (CESS) at the University of Vermont; thank the IAA community,College of Education and Social Services (CESS) at the University of Vermont; thank the IAA community,The authors would like to thank the College of Education and Social Services (CESS) at the University of Vermont for supporting this feasibility assessment research project.

Their actual performance depends on many factors and is hard to predict from data sheets. In this study, we investigate the deviations of the distance measurements of a high-end phase-based depth camera. We focus on the impact of: 1) self-warming and external temperature; 2) on range noise as a function of distance and acquisition time; and 3) on distance-dependent biases. We present the dedicated experimental setups comprising a climate chamber, a calibration bench with a reference interferometer, and a laser tracker that provides controlled conditions and ground-truth data. These setups allow investigating the absolute accuracy and mitigating repeatable distance biases by adapting the measurement model based on experimental data. For demonstration, we apply the investigation to two state-of-the-art industrial depth cameras of the same brand and type (Helios Lucid), showing significantly different response to external temperature but similar distance-dependent biases. We adapt the measurement model of one of the cameras for distance-dependent interpixel biases and demonstrate that the resulting parameters reduce also the distance biases of the other camera by about 80% to less than 1 mm at ranges of up to 1 m. This indicates the potential for batch error compensation. This article contributes to better understanding distance deviations of depth cameras and to improving the accuracy of such cameras.","[Frangez, Valens; Salido-Monzu, David; Wieser, Andreas] Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry IGP, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Frangez, V (corresponding author), Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry IGP, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",frangezv@ethz.ch,,"Wieser, Andreas/0000-0001-5804-2164",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as part of the NCCR Digital Fabrication [51NF40-182887],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as part of the NCCR Digital Fabrication(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as part of the NCCR Digital Fabrication under Grant #51NF40-182887.,,34,2,2,8,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9456,1557-9662,,IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS,IEEE Trans.

Recent adaptions to the LA-ICP-MS instrumentation mean we have faster washout times allowing state-of-the-art 2-D imaging of an ice core. This new method has great potential especially when applied to the localization of impurities on the ice sample, something that is crucial, to avoiding misinterpretation of the ultra-fine-resolution signals. Here we present the first results of the application of LA-ICP-MS elemental imaging to the analysis of selected glacial and interglacial samples from the Talos Dome and EPICA Dome C ice cores from central Antarctica. The localization of impurities from both marine and terrestrial sources is discussed, with special emphasis on observing a connection with the network of grain boundaries and differences between different climatic periods. Scale-dependent i mage analysis shows that the spatial significance of a single line profile along the main core axis increases systematically as the imprint of the grain boundaries weakens. It is demon-strated how instrumental settings can be adapted to suit the purpose of the analysis, i.e., by either employing LA-ICP-MS to study the interplay between impurities and the ice microstructure or to investigate the extremely thin climate proxy signals in deep polar ice.","[Bohleber, Pascal; Roman, Marco; Stenni, Barbara; Barbante, Carlo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Sala, Martin] Natl Inst Chem, Dept Analyt Chem, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Delmonte, Barbara] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Milan, Italy; [Barbante, Carlo] CNR, Inst Polar Sci, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; National Institute of Chemistry - Slovenia; University of Milano-Bicocca; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Polari (ISP-CNR),"Bohleber, P (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy.",pascal.bohleber@unive.it,"Roman, Marco/ABC-7022-2020; Bohleber, Pascal/AAM-8839-2020; Roman, Marco/HCI-7752-2022; Sala, Martin/A-3250-2011","Roman, Marco/0000-0003-1289-8236; Sala, Martin/0000-0001-7845-860X; Stenni, Barbara/0000-0003-4950-3664; Delmonte, Barbara/0000-0002-9074-2061; Barbante, Carlo/0000-0003-4177-2288",H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [790280]; H2020 Environment [815384]; Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) [P1-0034],H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; H2020 Environment; Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"This research has been supported by the H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (grant no. 790280), the H2020 Environment (grant no. 815384), and the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) (contract no.

Increased risks caused by the effects of climate change and a high cost of treatment, highlight the importance of skin cancer prevention efforts like this. The methods used to detect these diseases vary from a visual inspection performed by dermatologists to computational methods, and the latter has widely used automatic image classification applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical image analysis in the last few years. This article presents an approach that uses CNNs with a NASNet architecture to recognize in a more accurate way, without segmentation, eight skin diseases. The model was trained end-to-end on Keras with augmented skin diseases images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The CNN architectures were initialized with weight from ImageNet, fine-tuned in order to discriminate well among the different types of skin lesions, and then 10-fold cross-validation was applied. Finally, some evaluation metrics are calculated as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and compare with other CNN trained architectures. This comparison shows that the proposed system offers higher accuracy results, with a significant reduction on the training paraments. To the best of our knowledge and based in the state-of-art recompiling in this work, the application of the NASNet architecture training with skin image lesion from ISIC archive for multi-class classification and evaluated by cross-validation, represents a novel skin disease classification system.","[Cano, Elia; Mendoza-Aviles, Jose; Areiza, Mariana; Guerra, Noemi; Longino Mendoza-Valdes, Jose; Rovetto, Carlos A.] Univ Tecnol Panama, Comp Sci, Panama City, Panama",Universidad Tecnologica de Panama,"Rovetto, CA (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Panama, Comp Sci, Panama City, Panama.",carlos.rovetto@utp.ac.pa,,"MENDOZA AVILES, JOSE LONGINO/0000-0001-5381-6538; Mendoza Valdes, Jose Longino/0000-0001-7374-7373; Areiza, Mariana/0000-0003-2937-4383","Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion of Panama Republic","Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion of Panama Republic","This work was supported by the Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion of Panama Republic.

Excessive cold can be a health hazard, since excessive heat loss from the body may result in hypothermia/frostbite. Decreased body temperature due to heat loss also affects the physical, manual and perceptive performance of individuals. Therefore, protective measures are taken through clothing that controls and regulates heat loss. Clothing is a protective means for thermal insulation. Clothing and garments used in cold climates should have sufficient insulation to maintain the thermal balance of the body. The required clothing insulation (IREQ) is calculated on the basis of the hypothesis concerning the heat flow by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation. This term is well defined in standards such as BS-EN 342 and ISO 11079:2007 (E). This paper presents an experimental study of the use of state-of-the-art Infrared (IR) thermography to estimate IREQ values. However, real IREQ values are difficult to estimate, considering that parameters, such as individual metabolism, are unknown and subject to change. Therefore, relative IREQ (IREQ*) values are computed and compared. Experiments were also conducted to measure the relative IREQ of winter jackets, summer jackets, and sweaters. The infrared images were obtained using a FLIR (R) T1030sc camera and analyzed using FLIR (R) Researcher Max software. The experiments were performed under conditions of -20 degrees C to-35 degrees C in the cold room at UIT-The Arctic University of Norway.","[Ahmad, T.; Rashid, T.; Khawaja, H.; Moatamedi, M.] UiT, Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Khawaja, H (corresponding author), UiT, Tromso, Norway.",hassan.a.khawaja@uit.no,"Khawaja, Hassan/N-6680-2016; Moatamedi, M/GNP-5416-2022; Khawaja, Hassan/E-8499-2015","Khawaja, Hassan/0000-0002-0252-3476; Khawaja, Hassan/0000-0002-0252-3476; Moatamedi, Mojtaba/0000-0002-6089-4072",,,,,24,5,5,0,2,MULTI-SCIENCE PUBL CO LTD,BRENTWOOD,"5 WATES WAY, BRENTWOOD CM15 9TB, ESSEX, ENGLAND",1750-9548,,,INT J MULTIPHYSICS,Int.

J,"Yu, SL",,,,"Yu, Shiao-ling",,,Politics and Theatre in the PRC: Fifty Years of Teahouse on the Chinese Stage,ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Ever since its introduction to China in the early twentieth century, spoken drama (huaju) has been at the forefront of social and political changes. Its realistic portrayal of life and use of spoken dialogue made it an ideal vehicle to promote social reforms and to serve politics. This study investigates the relationship between politics and theatre in the People's Republic of China by focusing on a masterpiece of modern Chinese drama: Lao She's play Chaguan (Teahouse, 1957), which chronicles fifty years of modern Chinese history from the demise of the Qing dynasty to the eve of the communist victory. This essay examines how historical events are portrayed, how history served as a commentary on political conditions of the 1950s, and how changing political climates have affected the productions and reception of this play. It asks whether the new critical opinions of the past few years that question the earlier politically correct interpretation might invite new ways to stage the script. Shiao-ling Yu is an associate professor of Chinese at Oregon State University. Her research interests are Chinese drama, both classical and modern. Her anthology Chinese Drama after the Cultural Revolution was the winner of a National Endowment for Arts translation fellowship.

The PICUs nurse is confronted not only by the impending crises of patients and families, but also by the demand for technologic excellence. Nurse working in PICUs assume an ever-increasing responsibility for good communication. Effective Communication is the richness of the art and process of creating and sharing ideas. Effective communication is more crucial, and often more complicated with children, than it is with adult patients. It has been an issues of concern in Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction can be defined a positive affective orientation towards employment. This study Aimed to investigate staff nurses' effective communication and its relevance to job satisfaction in PICUs. A descriptive correlational design was used. The study was conducted at Menofia University Hospital at Pediatric & Neonatal Intensive Care units. A convenient sample of 87 staff nurses were recruited in the study. Two instruments were used for data collection; the first instrument consists of two parts, socio-demographic data and communication satisfaction questionnaire. The second instrument is the Job Satisfaction Scale. The results of this study revealed that, Most of the nurses are dissatisfied with their communication within work climate, with children and with their supervisors and co-workers. Significant correlations were observed between the total communication and both supervision and work environment which are subcategories of job satisfaction. It is recommendedto develop an effective communication program for all nurses especially those working in PICUs.","[Ibrahim, Manal M.] Umm Al Qura Univ, Menofia Univ, Fac Nursing, Dept Nursing Adm, Menoufia, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Menofia University,"Ibrahim, MM (corresponding author), Umm Al Qura Univ, Menofia Univ, Fac Nursing, Dept Nursing Adm, Menoufia, Egypt.",mmmoussa66@yahoo.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,12,MARSLAND PRESS,LANSING,"PO BOX 21126, LANSING, MI 48909 USA",1097-8135,,,LIFE SCI J,Life Sci.

These disturbances lead to the vulnerability of inhabitants and habitat and climate changes and socio-economic development in the region. Several studies have proposed different methods and techniques to monitor the spatial and temporal changes of LULC. Machine learning is a more popular method. However, the problem of data imbalance is a significant challenge, and the classification results tend to bias the majority classes for unbalanced data. Therefore, this study's objective is to develop a state-of-the-art technique to reduce the problem of data imbalance in LULC classification in Vietnam based on machine learning and SMOTE (Synthesizing Minority Oversampling Technology) with Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN). Various statistical indices, including Kappa and Accuracy, have been used to assess the performance for the classification of Land-use/cover. The results indicate that integrating oversampling and under-sampling with SMOTE ENN gave better overall accuracy and generalization. We also find that the expected proportion of chance agreement after oversampling is higher than before (Kappa score before and after oversampling is 0.905244 and 0.974379, respectively). This study provides an effective method to monitor spatial and temporal land cover change in Vietnam; it plays a role as a framework for other relevant research related to land cover change, which can support planning and sustainable management of the territory.","[Ngo, Hai Ly; Laffly, Dominique] Univ Jean Jaures, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, Toulouse, France; [Ngo, Hai Ly; Loubiere, Peio] CY Techs, Pau, France; [Ngo, Hai Ly; Nguyen, Huu Duy; Van Tran, Truong] Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Fac Geog, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ngo, Hai Ly] Open Dev Mekong, Bangkok, Thailand; [Serban, Gheorghe] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Geog, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Zelenakova, Martina] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Kosice, Slovakia; [Bretcan, Petre] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Fac Humanities, Dept Geog, Dambovita 130105, Romania",Vietnam National University Hanoi; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Technical University Kosice; Valahia University of Targoviste,"Nguyen, HD (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Fac Geog, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi, Vietnam.",lngo@ewmi-odi.org; nguyenhuuduy@hus.edu.vn; peio.loubiere@cyu.fr; tranvantruong@hus.edu.vn; gh.serban@icloud.com; martina.zelenakova@tuke.sk; petrebretcan@yahoo.com; dominique.laffly@univ-tlse2.fr,"SERBAN, Gheorghe/C-3947-2015; Bretcan, Petre S/H-3430-2015; ŞERBAN, Gheorghe/AAB-3555-2019","Bretcan, Petre S/0000-0001-7456-0332; ŞERBAN, Gheorghe/0000-0002-0595-9152",,,,,54,0,0,1,1,BERG FAC TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE,KOSICE,"PARK KOMENSKEHO 19, KOSICE, 043 84, SLOVAKIA",1335-1788,,,ACTA MONTAN SLOVACA,Acta.

In so doing, I suggest that the production and interpretation of photographs can lead to responses that: (1) foster attentive forms of vision in familiar contexts; (2) provoke reflexive self-examination and critiques of broader, complex systems; (3) develop emotional connections with those impacted by social-ecological change; and (4) provide a foundation for precautionary behavioral change in uncertain contexts.

Compared to version 1.0, released in 2016, ESMValTool version 2.0 (v2.0) features a brand new design, with an improved interface and a revised preprocessor. It also features a significantly enhanced diagnostic part that is described in three companion papers. The new version of ESMValTool has been specifically developed to target the increased data volume of CMIP Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the related challenges posed by the analysis and the evaluation of output from multiple high-resolution or complex ESMs. The new version takes advantage of state-of-the-art computational libraries and methods to deploy an efficient and user-friendly data processing. Common operations on the input data (such as regridding or computation of multi-model statistics) are centralized in a highly optimized preprocessor, which allows applying a series of preprocessing functions before diagnostics scripts are applied for in-depth scientific analysis of the model output. Performance tests conducted on a set of standard diagnostics show that the new version is faster than its predecessor by about a factor of 3. The performance can be further improved, up to a factor of more than 30, when the newly introduced task-based parallelization options are used, which enable the efficient exploitation of much larger computing infrastructures. ESMValTool v2.0 also includes a revised and simplified installation procedure, the setting of user-configurable options based on modern language formats, and high code quality standards following the best practices for software development.","[Righi, Mattia;

Many studies have focused on the role of particular ecological traits in driving species responses, but less so on demographic history and levels of standing genetic variation. Additionally, spatial variation in the interaction of demographic and adaptive factors may further complicate prediction of species responses to environmental change. We used environmental and genomic datasets to reconstruct the phylogeographic histories of two ecologically similar and largely co-distributed freshwater fishes, the southern (Nannoperca australis) and Yarra (N. obscura) pygmy perches, to assess the degree of concordance in their responses to Plio-Pleistocene climatic changes. We described contemporary genetic diversity, phylogenetic histories, demographic histories, and historical species distributions across both species, and statistically evaluated the degree of concordance in co-occurring populations. Results Marked differences in contemporary genetic diversity, historical distribution changes and historical migration were observed across the species, with a distinct lack of genetic diversity and historical range expansion suggested for N. obscura. Although several co-occurring populations within a shared climatic refugium demonstrated concordant demographic histories, idiosyncratic population size changes were found at the range edges of the more spatially restricted species. Discordant responses between species were associated with low standing genetic variation in peripheral populations. This might have hindered adaptive potential, as documented in recent demographic declines and population extinctions for the two species. Conclusion Our results highlight both the role of spatial scale in the degree of concordance in species responses to climate change, and the importance of standing genetic variation in facilitating range shifts. Even when ecological traits are similar between species, long-term genetic diversity and historical population demography may lead to discordant responses to ongoing and future climate change.","[Buckley, Sean James; Brauer, Chris J.; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Unmack, Peter J.] Univ Canberra, Ctr Appl Water Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Nat Sci Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; University of Canberra,"Beheregaray, LB (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",Luciano.Beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,"Unmack, Peter J./AAU-3023-2020; Beheregaray, Luciano/A-8621-2008","Unmack, Peter J./0000-0003-1175-1152; Beheregaray, Luciano/0000-0003-0944-3003; Buckley, Sean/0000-0003-4929-6693; Brauer, Chris/0000-0003-2968-5915",Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT130101068]; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","This work was supported by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (FT130101068) awarded to LBB, to assess adaptation and vulnerability of Australian freshwater fishes to environmental change.

The question is if Member States are ready to face the challenges that are specified in the report, such as digital revolution, globalisation, demographic change and social cohesion, economic convergence and climate change. In connection to this basic question, our paper aims to provide an overview about the evolution - rise and fall - of the Hungarian regional level (NUTS2) institutions with a strong emphasis on the state-of-the art, especially regarding administrative capacities. Desk research focused on the era between 1990-2015, while empirical research - in the form of a questionnaire - was conducted in 2017 and 2018 amongst former employees of the former regional development agencies. As there are no institutionalized actors at regional level in Hungary responsible for the implementation of Cohesion Policy any more - with the exception of Central Hungary, that is currently under re-formulation - we hypothesize that former(?) regional development professionals as individuals could play an important role in the preparations for the post-2020 financial period.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is considered a crucial strategy for meeting CO2 emission reduction targets. In this paper, various aspects of CCS are reviewed and discussed including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. The selection of specific CO2 capture technology heavily depends on the type of CO2 generating plant and fuel used. Among those CO2 separation processes, absorption is the most mature and commonly adopted due to its higher efficiency and lower cost. Pipeline is considered to be the most viable solution for large volume of CO2 transport. Among those geological formations for CO2 storage, enhanced oil recovery is mature and has been practiced for many years but its economical viability for anthropogenic sources needs to be demonstrated. There are growing interests in CO2 storage in saline aquifers due to their enormous potential storage capacity and several projects are in the pipeline for demonstration of its viability. There are multiple hurdles to CCS deployment including the absence of a clear business case for CCS investment and the absence of robust economic incentives to support the additional high capital and operating costs of the whole CCS process.

The conclusions regarding the impact of the polymer stabilizers are based on comparisons with selected physical, chemical, mechanical, and microstructural properties of natural Qatari subgrade soil and soils stabilized with the traditional standard, portland cement (PC). The results demonstrate that the polymer binders modify the Qatari subgrade soils resulting in more favorable engineering properties: for example, the compressive strengths of the polymer-stabilized soils are superior to those of the unstabilized soils and those stabilized using PC. The mechanical properties of the stabilized and unstabilized soils were incorporated in the analysis of asphalt pavement sections using the state-of-the-art protocol for pavement design and analysis. Results of the analysis further demonstrated the benefits of using stabilized subgrade soils in improving pavement performance. Of particular practical importance is that polymer subgrade stabilization significantly reduces subgrade rutting. Consequently, polymer subgrade stabilization is a key consideration for perpetual pavements, especially considering the extremely high truck traffic in Qatar. Although the work reported in this paper was carried out with Qatari soil, the results are expected to be relevant to other types of soil and weather conditions experienced throughout the Middle East and in similar climates throughout the world.

The new center was designed to host a variety of events such as concerts, arena football, graduation ceremonies, National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball, and the National Basketball Association's (NBA's) Orlando Magic home games. The Amway Center, which opened in October 2010, had a capacity of 19,000 patrons for NBA games. The Amway Center was adjacent to Interstate 4 and State Road 408 in the downtown core. To prepare for the Amway Center's event management challenges, the City of Orlando's Transportation Engineering Department utilized smart event traffic management techniques, which integrated the following system and plan components: intelligent transportation system infrastructure (software and hardware), traffic control device upgrades, regional planning efforts, and state-of-the-art safety and security protocols. These components also helped minimize the environmental impacts of traffic congestion. When designing smart event plans, it is important to consider high-threshold events such as the NBA All-Star Game for system performance and to understand the balance required for operational efficiency and security in today's global climate. In addition, infrastructure performance is critical during high-profile events so that the local economy can benefit and the municipality can stay competitive to attract more of these types of events. Finally, the resultant operational efficiency is vital for reducing the carbon footprint and negative societal impacts.","[Consoli, Frank A.; Rogers, John] City Orlando, Orlando, FL 32801 USA; [Al-Deek, Haitham; Tatari, Omer; Alomari, Ahmed] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Al-Deek, H (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Room 209 4000 Cent Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",Haitham.Al-Deek@ucf.edu,,/0000-0002-4046-8965,,,,,11,3,3,0,21,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

State of the art building simulation software, ESP-r, was used to generate a database covering the years 1997-2001. The software was used to calculate hourly cooling loads for three office buildings using climate records in Kuwait. The cooling load data for 1997-2000 was used for training and testing the neural networks (NN), while robustness of the trained NN was tested by applying them to a production data set (2001 data) that the networks have never seen before. Three buildings of various densities of occupancy and orientational characteristics were investigated. Parametric studies were performed to determine optimum GRNN design parameters that best predict cooling load profiles for each building. External hourly temperature readings for a 24 h period were used as network inputs.. and the hourly cooling load for the next day is the output. The performance of the NN analysis was evaluated using a statistical indicator (the coefficient of multiple determination) and by statistical analysis of the error patterns, including confidence intervals of regression lines, as well as by examination of the error patterns. The results show that a property designed NN is a powerful instrument for optimizing thermal energy storage in buildings based only on external temperature records. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant cells produce oxygen radicals and their derivatives, so-called reactive oxygen species (ROS), during various processes associated with abiotic stress. Moreover, the generation of ROS is a fundamental process in higher plants and employs to transmit cellular signaling information in response to the changing environmental conditions. One of the most crucial consequences of abiotic stress is the disturbance of the equilibrium between the generation of ROS and antioxidant defense systems triggering the excessive accumulation of ROS and inducing oxidative stress in plants. Notably, the equilibrium between the detoxification and generation of ROS is maintained by both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense systems under harsh environmental stresses. Although this field of research has attracted massive interest, it largely remains unexplored, and our understanding of ROS signaling remains poorly understood. In this review, we have documented the recent advancement illustrating the harmful effects of ROS, antioxidant defense system involved in ROS detoxification under different abiotic stresses, and molecular cross-talk with other important signal molecules such as reactive nitrogen, sulfur, and carbonyl species. In addition, state-of-the-art molecular approaches of ROS-mediated improvement in plant antioxidant defense during the acclimation process against abiotic stresses have also been discussed.","[Hasanuzzaman, Mirza] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh; [Bhuyan, M.

This period is one of dramatic changes in the climates and the distribution of Palaearctic biota. These changes have played their role in generating adaptive and phyletic patterns within the human ancestry, involving several species such as Homo habilis, Homo georgicus, Homo erectus, Homo antecessor and Homo heidelbergensis. In the archaeological record, these species include the Oldowan (Mode 1) and Acheulian (Mode 2) lithic technologies. Taphonomic considerations of palaeoecological research in hominin-bearing sites are provided and evaluated. Syntheses are provided for north Africa, western Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, Britain, and continental Europe. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on multidisciplinary data are given for Ain Boucherit, Ain Hanech and El-Kherba in Algeria, Dmanisi in Georgia, Atapuerca, Cueva Negra, and the Orce Basin in Spain, Monte Poggiolo and Pirro Nord in Italy. Pont-de-Lavaud in France, and Mauer in Germany. The state of the art with the Out of Africa 1 dispersal model is reviewed. A source-sink dynamics model for Palaeolithic Europe is described to explain the morphological disparity of H. heidelbergensis (we will sometimes use the informal name Heidelbergs) and early Neanderthals. Other aspects debated here are the selective value of habitat mosaics including reconstructions based on mammal and avian databases, and the role of geological instability combined with topographic complexity. This review is completed by addressing the question of whether the appearance of evolutionary trends within hominins is concentrated in regions of highest worldwide biological diversity (biodiversity hotspots). It is concluded that the keys for the activation of evolutionary change in hominins may have been geological instabilities, and a shifting physiographical heterogeneity combined with high biodiversity and ecological interaction.

The network spans the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, with two cables extending from a Shore Station in Pacific City, Oregon. One branch extends similar to 480 km due west to Axial Seamount, the largest volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The second branch extends 208 km southward along the base of the Cascadia Subduction Zone (2900 m) and then turns east extending 147 km to 80 m water depth offshore Newport, Oregon. The system is designed for a 25-year lifetime. The Cabled Array includes six state-of-the-art instrumented, full water column moorings (up to 2900 m water depth) hosting instrumented wire crawlers, winched science pods, and platforms to study linkages among physical, biological and chemical processes spanning blue water to coastal systems along the Cascadia Margin. The coastal array is located at highly productive coastal sites strongly impacted by the California Current, upwelling, ocean acidification, and hypoxia events. The network also includes cutting edge seafloor sensors focused on understanding active volcanism, life in extreme environments, seismicity, and biogeochemical processes and fluxes in actively forming gas hydrate systems. Two-way 24/7/365 communication with direct connection to the Internet, with expansion up to 240 Gb/s and high power (8 kW), allow highly interactive, rapid responses with adaptive sampling to events such as formation of thin layers, large storms, internal waves, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. With an operational life of at least 25 years, the Cabled Array will provide decades of sustained, high quality coregistered, multidisciplinary data at rates up to 250 kilisamples/second and at spatial resolutions of centimeters to kilometers. The high bandwidth and power provides significant expansion capabilities for innovative sensing systems that include advancement of autonomous vehicles with companion docking stations that can change missions in response to changing conditions without human intervention, 3D imagers, and in situ DNA samplers. International installation of progressively advanced submarine cabled observatories will provide unprecedented monitoring of the oceans, and the entrainment of a global community of users researchers, educators, policy makers and the public.","[Kelley, Deborah S.; Delaney, John R.; Cabled Array Team] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kelley, DS (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dskelley@uw.edu; jdelaney@uw.edu,,,,,,,27,12,12,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-1537-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,,10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761398,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761398,,,10,"Engineering, Ocean",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BH3QQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000399929002079,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wavelet transforms offer an effective framework to decompose spatial data into separate (and possibly orthogonal) scales and directions. Most wavelet-based spatial verification techniques have been developed or refined in the last decade and concentrate on assessing forecast performance (i.e. forecast skill or forecast error) on distinct physical scales. Particularly during the last 5 years, a significant growth in meteorological applications could be observed. However, a comparison with other scientific fields, such as feature detection, image fusion, texture analysis or facial and biometric recognition, shows that there is still a considerable, currently unused potential to derive useful diagnostic information. In order to tap the full potential of wavelet analysis, we review the state-of-the-art in one- and two-dimensional wavelet analysis and its application, with emphasis on spatial verification. We further use a technique developed for texture analysis in the context of high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts, which is able to assess the structural characteristics of the precipitation fields and allows efficient clustering of ensemble data.","[Weniger, Michael; Kapp, Florian; Friederichs, Petra] Univ Bonn, Inst Meteorol, Hugel 20, D-53121 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Weniger, M (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Meteorol, Hugel 20, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",mweniger@uni-bonn.de,"Friederichs, Petra/F-3344-2011","Friederichs, Petra/0000-0003-4566-572X",project High Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction HD(CP)2; German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [FK 01LK1209B],project High Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction HD(CP)2; German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We gratefully acknowledge financial funding by the project High Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction HD(CP)<SUP>2</SUP>, funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) under grant FK 01LK1209B.",,127,23,24,2,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

In conducting its economic activities, it turns out that there are many forms of ordinance in running it. This form of cultural-based economic activity has then shifted into a capitalist system with the entry of Dutch colonialists. This research study used a qualitative method, with the approach of a research literature study using journals, books and other scientific works related to the research focus. The results show that cultural-based economic activities in Indonesia are an economic form that is in accordance with the teachings of Islam, because it implements the rules to get the corresponding results. Therefore, it needs to be raised and re-applied massively in society. It is expected that the principle of mutual assistance in cultural-based economic activities can reduce the gap between the economic strata.

Because such an offline evaluation can be clouded by an overwhelming influence of the atmospheric forcing itself (relative to the imposed land surface physics) on model output, we also estimate runoff rates with a decades-old climatological relation devised by M.I. Budyko, a relation that depends solely on annual precipitation and net radiation. The LSMs and the estimates derived with Budyko's relation are found to have standard errors of the same order (roughly 100 mm/yr). Thus, we conclude that the complexities inherent in these state-of-the-art LSMs did not lead to increased accuracy in the simulated energy and water balances at the annual time scale. Proper LSM formulations are nevertheless recognized as essential for realistic land surface behavior at shorter (e.g., monthly or hourly) time scales, for which a simple Budyko-type equation would be in much greater error.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Climate & Radiat Branch, Atmospheres Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Tokyo; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Koster, RD (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",randal.koster@gsfc.nasa.gov,"Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012; Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010","Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383; Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678",,,,,17,14,14,1,4,METEOROLOGICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"C/O JAPAN METEOROLOGICAL AGENCY 1-3-4 OTE-MACHI, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100-0004, JAPAN",0026-1165,2186-9057,,J METEOROL SOC JPN,J.

The most striking weakness is the lax implementation of prescribed abatement measures, particularly concerning manure management, in most countries. Institutions of the EU should also be leveraged for achieving Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) goals. In contrast to the Helsinki Convention, the European Union has economic, political and legal mandates to further implementation and compliance. Equally important is the need for strengthening of local institutions, particularly Water Boards and independent agricultural advisory services in the eastern Baltic Sea Region countries. There is also an urgent need for implementation of voluntary land-use measures where EU funding available to farmers is more broadly and effectively used by providing it on the basis of estimated abatement performance, which can be realized through modelling. The enormous potential for funding performance-based schemes, manure management infrastructure and advisory services through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy are currently underutilized.","[Brady, Mark, V; Andersson, Anna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Dept Econ, Box 730, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Brady, Mark, V] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci CEC, Box 188, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Andersen, Mikael Skou] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Nordre Ringgade 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Kilis, Emils] Baltic Studies Ctr, Kokneses Prospekts 26-2, LV-1014 Riga, Latvia; [Saarela, Sanna-Riikka] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Thorsoe, Martin Hvarregaard] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Blichers Alle 20, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lund University; Aarhus University; Finnish Environment Institute; Aarhus University,"Brady, MV (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Dept Econ, Box 730, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Brady, MV (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci CEC, Box 188, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",mark.brady@slu.se; msa@envs.au.dk; anna.r.andersson@slu.se; emils.kilis@gmail.com; Sanna-Riikka.Saarela@ymparisto.fi; martinh.thorsoe@au.dk,"Andersen, Mikael Skou/AAN-1913-2021; Thorsøe, Martin/AAX-2256-2021; Brady, Mark/J-6313-2014","Andersen, Mikael Skou/0000-0003-2299-8134; Brady, Mark/0000-0001-9773-9722","BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development, FORMAS","BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development, FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This work resulted from the BONUS TOOLS2SEA project and was supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union and Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development, FORMAS.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A costed mathematical model of the impact of HIV and ART on teacher recruitment, mortality and absenteeism (Ed-SIDA) was run using best available data for 58 countries, and results aggregated by region. It was estimated that (1) The impact of HIV on teacher supply is sufficient to derail efforts to achieve EFA in several countries and universal access can mitigate this. (2) In SSA, the 2008 costs to education of HIV were about half of those estimated in 2002. Providing universal access for teachers in SSA is cost-effective on education returns alone and provides a return of $3.99 on the dollar. (3) The impacts on education in the hyperendemic countries in Southern Africa will continue to increase to 2015 from its 2008 level, already the highest in the world. (4) If treatment roll-out is successful, numbers of HIV positive teachers are set to increase in all the regions studied. Conclusions/Significance: The return on investing in care and support is also greater in those areas with highest impact. SSA requires increased investment in teacher support, testing and particularly ART if it is to achieve EFA.

The paper structured an assessment system consisted of five indexes (food production, gas adjusting, climate adjusting, hydrology adjusting, and waste treatment) on the basis of the classification of ecosystem and its services, used Gaodi Xie et al.'s method for valuing ecosystem service on the basis of experts' knowledge, and studied on the services' value change of different ecosystems of the Yunlong reservoir. The result showed that the three service values of gas adjustment, climate adjustment, and hydrological adjustment were formed into a core service value of the forest ecosystem of the protected area for water supply; under the premise of ensuring food production service value, waste disposal service value of farmland ecosystem occupied a main status; water area ecosystem focused on hydrological adjustment service and waste disposal service. The service value of food production was mainly contributed by the forest and farmland ecosystems; the other four adjustment service values were mainly contributed by forest ecosystem.","[Liu, Yang] Southwest Forestry Univ SWFU, Sch Landscape Architecture, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Shen, Dan] Southwest Forestry Univ SWFU, Art Sch, Kunming, Peoples R China",,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Southwest Forestry Univ SWFU, Sch Landscape Architecture, Kunming, Peoples R China.",yzly502@sina.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,3,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

Following a threefold increase of data (from 15,000 to over 47,000) in the global surface ocean DMS database over the last decade, new global monthly climatologies of surface ocean DMS concentration and sea-to-air emission flux are presented as updates of those constructed 10 years ago. Interpolation/extrapolation techniques were applied to project the discrete concentration data onto a first guess field based on Longhurst's biogeographic provinces. Further objective analysis allowed us to obtain the final monthly maps. The new climatology projects DMS concentrations typically in the range of 1-7 nM, with higher levels occurring in the high latitudes, and with a general trend toward increasing concentration in summer. The increased size and distribution of the observations in the DMS database have produced in the new climatology substantially lower DMS concentrations in the polar latitudes and generally higher DMS concentrations in regions that were severely undersampled 10 years ago, such as the southern Indian Ocean. Using the new DMS concentration climatology in conjunction with state-of-the-art parameterizations for the sea/air gas transfer velocity and climatological wind fields, we estimate that 28.1 (17.6-34.4) Tg of sulfur are transferred from the oceans into the atmosphere annually in the form of DMS. This represents a global emission increase of 17% with respect to the equivalent calculation using the previous climatology. This new DMS climatology represents a valuable tool for atmospheric chemistry, climate, and Earth System models.","[Lana, A.; Simo, R.; Ballabrera-Poy, J.] CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Bell, T.

AEMFCs have been considered the most promising succedaneum to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for addressing the cost issues associated with PEMFCs due to utilizing non-platinum group metals as electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions (such as Ag, Ni, and Co). Herein, we focus on a critical topic of AEMFCs--anion-exchange polyelectrolytes (AEPs)-which are essential materials for low-cost AEMFCs. Specifically, AEPs have been used as anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) and binders (or ionomers) in AEMFCs. Years of study have allowed AEMFCs to recently achieve unprecedented progress, specifically in terms of power density and durability. These properties are comparable to or higher thanPEMFCs due to the recent development of high performance AEPs. Currently, most AEPs focused on the application of AEMs, and the importance of ionomer research has not been widely recognized. Moreover, a comprehensive review involving a systematic performance comparison of the state-of-the-art AEMs and ionomers is still lacking, making future research on AEMFCs unclear. This review systematically and comprehensively summarizes the development of AEPs and highlights the importance of cationic species and polymer backbone structures on durability with an emphasis on the importance of ionomer research. We further describe the differences between AEMs and ionomers by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the state-of-the-art AEMs and ionomers to accurately guide future research on AEMFCs. We cover synthetic methods, degradation mechanisms, strategies to enhance performance, water transport behaviors, structure design criteria, and new challenges for AEMs and ionomers. This review is expected to expand further understanding of AEMs and ionomers and provide a future direction for designing AEMs and ionomers for future AEMFCs. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

However, the economic viability of microalgae cultivation and use is very limited in the current market condition. To overcome this barrier, a multi-product resource plan needs to be developed in order to improve the overall economics. The following work investigates the annual yield of Pleurochrysis carterae in terms of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and calcites in moderate climate zones of Western Australia. A raceway pond is considered for the cultivation of microalgae. Based on the results of the analysis, three scenarios are devised for the economic assessment. The study includes the extraction of bio-oil, generation of biogas from wastes, production of proteins and carbohydrates for animal feed and fishmeal, and the formation of coccoliths as a source of biomaterial to produce specialised ceramics, nano-materials, synthetic bones, and teeth. The analysis shows that the production of fishmeal from the protein and carbohydrates along with oil extraction and coccoliths as high-value calcite biomaterial is economically attractive. The yield can be considerably improved if the temperature of the media could be controlled.","[Rezvani, Sina; Kennedy, Christopher] Mandurah Innovat Informat & Infrastruct Inc, Suite 1,8 Donnelly Gardens, Dudley Pk, WA 6210, Australia; [Moheimani, Navid R.] Murdoch Univ, Algae R&D Ctr, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Moheimani, Navid R.] Murdoch Univ, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Harry Butler Inst, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Murdoch University; Murdoch University,"Rezvani, S (corresponding author), Mandurah Innovat Informat & Infrastruct Inc, Suite 1,8 Donnelly Gardens, Dudley Pk, WA 6210, Australia.",s.rezvani@iinet.net.au,"moheimani, navid/AAI-2225-2020","Moheimani, Navid/0000-0003-2310-4147",Murdoch University,Murdoch University,We thank Murdoch University for providing support and internal funds for this study.,,96,3,4,0,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-9264,,,ALGAL RES,Algal Res.,MAY,2019,,,,,,,101456,10.1016/j.algal.2019.101456,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.101456,,,12,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,HX0FX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000467066000034,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research aims at studying the effectiveness of strategies for reducing the urban heat island-associated effects in dense and old neighborhoods considering, in particular, green roofs, cool roofs, cool pavements, green areas and urban renewal actions. Computer simulation was selected as the major methodology in this research; ENVI-met software was used under different scenarios for a case study consisting in an old neighborhood in the city of Avola. The investigation focused on evaluating the efficacy of each strategy for a condition corresponding to a typical summer heat wave. The results highlight that the cool pavements allow relevant improvements at the height of 1.50 m, with a temperature decrease up 1.15 degrees C, whereas the other scenarios, given the relatively high density of the buildings, are able to improve outdoor conditions only at higher elevations. Reported results represent a guideline for the choice of UHI mitigation method that can help stakeholders involved in new urban assessment of old neighborhoods in Mediterranean climate.

A disaster governance paradigm is a comprehensive set of prevailing and institutionalized ideas that shape disaster plans and policies that eventually are implemented on-the-ground. Nepal has prepared various disaster plans and policies at the national, provincial and local level, but there are major gaps in disaster risk preparedness, with annual floods and landslides continuing to be responsible for the loss of lives and heavy infrastructure damages. In this article, we show how disaster governance paradigms have evolved between 1982 and 2019, using policy document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key policy actors. The study found that four major disaster governance paradigms exist in Nepal - (1) response and recovery; (2) disaster risk reduction and management; (3) integrated climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction; and (4) federalized disaster risk reduction. The results of this study show that multiple state and non-state actors such as key government ministries, NGOs, INGOs and other civil society actors are competing over resources and there is an ongoing administrative struggle for promoting different disaster governance paradigms. There has been a push from various civil society actors to prioritize disaster risk reduction in Nepal.

The production and its message about the urgency of halting climate change has since accrued additional layers of meaning, given the disaster of the Deepwater Horizon oil-rig explosion and spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Addressing the shifting historical and political frame of reference that has surrounded the production at three different times, I analyze the production's use of psychogeography to render critical thinking into physicality through a self-motivated, multi-sensory engagement with the cityscape that generates a visceral response.

Driven by a combination of breakthroughs in DNA isolation techniques, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics, ancient genome-scale data for a rapidly growing variety of taxa are now available, allowing researchers to directly observe demographic and evolutionary processes over time. However, the vast majority of paleogenomic studies still focus on human or animal remains. In this article, we make the case for a vast untapped resource of ancient plant material that is ideally suited for paleogenomic analyses: plant remains, such as needles, leaves, wood, seeds, or fruits, that are deposited in natural archives, such as lake sediments, permafrost, or even ice caves. Such plant remains are commonly found in large numbers and in stratigraphic sequence through time and have so far been used primarily to reconstruct past local species presences and abundances. However, they are also unique repositories of genetic information with the potential to revolutionize the fields of ecology and evolution by directly studying microevolutionary processes over time. Here, we give an overview of the current state-of-the-art, address important challenges, and highlight new research avenues to inspire future research.","[Schworer, Christoph; Leunda, Maria] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Schworer, Christoph; Leunda, Maria] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Leunda, Maria; Gugerli, Felix; Sperisen, Christoph] WSL Swiss Fed Res Inst, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Alvarez, Nadir] Nat Hist Museum Geneva, CH-1208 Geneva, Switzerland; [Alvarez, Nadir] Univ Geneva, Dept Genet & Evolut, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland","University of Bern; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Geneva","Schworer, C (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.;Schworer, C (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",christoph.schwoerer@ips.unibe.ch,"; Alvarez, Nadir/B-4318-2010","Sperisen, Christoph/0000-0003-1241-5636; Leunda, Maria/0000-0002-9186-3121; Alvarez, Nadir/0000-0002-0729-166X",Swiss Forest Lab [SFL-19 P4]; Federal Office for the Environment FOEN; Swiss National Science Foundation within the project HOLOGENE [SNF- 200021_188472],Swiss Forest Lab; Federal Office for the Environment FOEN; Swiss National Science Foundation within the project HOLOGENE(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This project was supported by the Swiss Forest Lab (research grant SFL-19 P4) and by the Federal Office for the Environment FOEN, as well as the Swiss National Science Foundation within the project HOLOGENE (grant no.

It has previously been shown that precipitation can initiate a transition from the closed-to the open-cellular state, but that the boundary layer cannot maintain this open-cell state without a resupply of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Potential sources of CCN include wind-driven production of sea salt from the ocean, nucleation from the gas phase, and entrainment from the free troposphere. In order to investigate CCN sources in the marine boundary layer and their role in supplying new particles, we have coupled in detail chemical, aerosol, and cloud processes in the WRF/Chem model, and added state-of-the-art representations of sea salt emissions and aerosol nucleation. We conduct numerical simulations of the marine boundary layer in the transition from a closed-to an open-cell state. Results are compared with observations in the Southeast Pacific boundary layer during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx). The transition from the closed-to the open-cell state generates conditions that are conducive to nucleation by forming a cloud-scavenged, ultra-clean layer below the inversion base. Open cell updrafts loft dimethyl sulfide from the ocean surface into the ultra-clean layer, where it is oxidized during daytime to SO2 and subsequently to H2SO4. Low H2SO4 condensation sink values in the ultra-clean layer allow H2SO4 to rise to concentrations at which aerosol nucleation produces new aerosol in significant numbers. The existence of the ultra-clean layer is confirmed by observations. We find that the observed DMS flux from the ocean in the VOCALS-REx region can support a nucleation source of aerosol in open cells that exceeds sea salt emissions in terms of the number of particles produced. The freshly nucleated, nanometer-sized aerosol particles need, however, time to grow to sizes large enough to act as CCN. In contrast, mechanical production of particles from the ocean surface by near-surface winds provides a steady source of larger particles that are effective CCN at a rate exceeding a threshold for maintenance of open-cell circulation. Entrainment of aerosol from the free troposphere contributes significantly to boundary layer aerosol for the considered VOCALS-REx case, but less than sea salt aerosol emissions.","[Kazil, J.; Feingold, G.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kazil, J.; Feingold, G.] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Div Chem Sci, Boulder, CO USA; [Wang, H.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Clarke, A.

J,"Sychova, O",,,,"Sychova, O.",,,Modern Trends of Festival process in Crimea,NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD,,,Russian,Article,,,,,,festival; festival process; Crimea; sociocultural environment,,"The article is devoted to presentation of different festivals held in Crimea. It recognizes that latter decades are marked with intensification of festival process in Ukraine which is stipulated by many factors including step-by-step transformation of sociocultural environment. The indicated process is taking place both in the capital of the state and particular regions. Important place among last-mentioned takes Autonomous Republic of Crimea, polyethnic region possessing a number of particularities formed due to interaction of historical, ethnocultural, geographical etc factors. These particularities have definitely affected nature of festival events taking place within the territory of peninsula. Particular festivals within the territory of Crimea have taken its interpretation in articles of different genres, among them academic papers. Crimea regional particularities in relation to its cultural development were presented, as well (works by A. Chergeiev, L. Shylova, O. latskov). But an attempt to distinguish modern festival process is made for the first time. It is recognized that ancient history of peninsula contains chapters related to early culture of Scythians, Goths, Huns, Ugrians, later descendants from Mediterranean - Greeks, Genoeses. Crimean cities and villages bear the impress of their previous status. For instance, Solkhat (now Old Crimea) was in the times of the Golden Horde which included the peninsula in those days the capital of Crimean Ulus, its territorial subdivision. Bakhchysarai was the capital of Crimean Khanate, the state that existed during the 14th - 18th centuries. Genoese medieval settlements grew into modern Crimean territorial subdivisions - cities of Feodosiia and Sudak (former Kafa and Soldaiia or Sougdeiia), Inkerman (former Kalamita), Balaklava (former Chembalo). The number of historic monuments of different periods is so large that sometimes Crimea is called an open-air museum. An important part in formation of sociocultural environment of the peninsula is played by its polyethnic population structure: nowadays it is inhabited by Russians, Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, as well as Karaites, Greeks, Armenians etc. Every Crimean nationality has its rich and unique cultural traditions. Another specific Crimean feature is its geographic location which determines the region as a resort. Localities of autonomous republic are mostly villages along with small towns and towns (except for Sevastopol, Simferopol and Kerch). Arts festivals and competitions in small towns and towns in Ukraine have their specific nature which we have already covered in previous articles stressing both value of these events for localities in question and the fact they make it possible for participants and guests to experience historical-cultural particularities of the venue. Indicated factors directly affect such an important component of art life of society that arts festivals represent in present-day world; this deals with essential characteristics of the latter. The article analyzes specific festivals. It is indicated that Bospor Agons International Ancient Arts Festival that took place in Kerch for fifteen times already is joined with ancient history. The event in which artists from Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Kazakhstan etc. participate involves musical, literary, theater, visual and cinematographic components. In town of Old Crimea Crimea World Republic Festival of National Cultures has been held from 2012. Besides, at the beginning of July Surb Khach Armenian Arts Festival devoted to holiday Vardavar (Transfiguration) which is one of the main holidays of the Armenian church for the fourth time will be held here. Pilgrimage festival holding is based in Surb Khach, monastery of the 14th century. Popularity of Silk Road International Festival of Ethnic Cultures taking place in Sudak is increasing, as well. Crimea climate conditions make it possible to widely use practice of holding Open Air festivals. The biggest Ukrainian festival of this kind is Koktebel Jazz Festival founded in 2003. The scale indicator of festival actions is that in anniversary tenth Koktebel Jazz Festival (2012) more than 300 musicians of fifteen countries of the world took part. Since 1995 the most famous in post-Soviet space Kazantip Republic electronic music festival (other names are Orange Republic, Republic Z, KaZantip) is held in Crimea. The venue is always different: first it was Shcholkine town, then location nearby Sudak and since 2001 it is Popovka village not far from Evpatoriia town. In festivals arrangement tourist opportunities of the whole region and its particular cities are used. As an example we can take Oriental Gate. ArtField-Crimea International Arts Festival taking place in Bakhchysarai town at the beginning of October. Providers determine the event as excursion festival. Tourism factor is also efficient in arrangement of numerous festivals-competitions for children and young people held in resort towns from spring through autumn: Yalta vacations, Near the Black Sea, Ukraine is a saint family', Art paints, Stars of Tavrida, KupalaCrimeaFest, Summer melodies, Star planet etc. In the arrangement of festivals and competitions held in Crimea unique capabilities of the region are used and this contributes to beneficiation of sociocultural environment of Ukraine integrally.",,,,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,NATL ACAD MANAGERIAL STAFF CULTURE & ARTS,KYIV,"VUL LAVRSKA, 9, KORPUS 15, KYIV, 01015, UKRAINE",2226-3209,2409-0506,,NATL ACAD MANAG STA,Natl.

Different scenarios were considered, including PCM used as a suspended ceiling without supporting ceiling plates, as well as PCM covered with ceiling plates. The preliminary result shows that a significant cooling effect could be achieved when using 17 m(2) of uncovered PCM directly exposed to the occupied zone.

Previous research studies have extensively studied the problem of height estimation from aerial images based on stereo or multiview image matching. These methods require two or more images from different perspectives to reconstruct 3-D coordinates with camera information provided. In this letter, we deal with the ambiguous and unsolved problem of height estimation from a single aerial image. Driven by the great success of deep learning, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), some research studies have proposed to estimate height information from a single aerial image by training a deep CNN model with large-scale annotated data sets. These methods treat height estimation as a regression problem and directly use an encoder-decoder network to regress the height values. In this letter, we propose to divide height values into spacing-increasing intervals and transform the regression problem into an ordinal regression problem, using an ordinal loss for network training. To enable multiscale feature extraction, we further incorporate an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to extract features from multiple dilated convolution layers. After that, a postprocessing technique is designed to transform the predicted height map of each patch into a seamless height map. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Vaihingen and Potsdam data sets. Experimental results demonstrate significantly better performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods.","[Li, Xiang; Fang, Yi] NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Multimedia & Visual Comp Lab, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Li, Xiang; Fang, Yi] NYU Tandon, NYU Multimedia & Visual Comp Lab, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Wang, Mingyang] New York Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Fang, Y (corresponding author), NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Multimedia & Visual Comp Lab, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",yfang@nyu.edu,"Li, Xiang/AAC-4866-2019","Li, Xiang/0000-0002-9946-7000; Fang, Yi/0000-0001-9427-3883","Ecological Quality Meteorological Monitoring and Evaluation, Mountain Flood Geological Disaster Prevention Meteorological Guarantee Project 2020, Zhejiang Province Climate Center","Ecological Quality Meteorological Monitoring and Evaluation, Mountain Flood Geological Disaster Prevention Meteorological Guarantee Project 2020, Zhejiang Province Climate Center","This work was supported by the Ecological Quality Meteorological Monitoring and Evaluation, Mountain Flood Geological Disaster Prevention Meteorological Guarantee Project 2020, Zhejiang Province Climate Center.",,22,9,9,10,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

It is derived with a simple water balance model (SWBM) forced with precipitation, temperature and net radiation. The SWBM dataset extends over the period 1984-2013 with a daily time step and 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution. We employ a novel calibration approach, in which we consider 300 random parameter sets chosen from an observation-based range. Using several independent validation datasets representing soil moisture ( or terrestrial water content), ET and streamflow, we identify the best performing parameter set and hence the new dataset. To illustrate its usefulness, the SWBM dataset is compared against several state-of-the-art datasets (ERA-Interim/Land, MERRA-Land, GLDAS-2-Noah, simulations of the Community Land Model Version 4), using all validation datasets as reference. For soil moisture dynamics it outperforms the benchmarks. Therefore the SWBM soil moisture dataset constitutes a reasonable alternative to sparse measurements, little validated model results, or proxy data such as precipitation indices. Also in terms of runoff the SWBM dataset performs well, whereas the evaluation of the SWBMET dataset is overall satisfactory, but the dynamics are less well captured for this variable. This highlights the limitations of the dataset, as it is based on a simple model that uses uniform parameter values. Hence some processes impacting ET dynamics may not be captured, and quality issues may occur in regions with complex terrain. Even though the SWBM is well calibrated, it cannot replace more sophisticated models; but as their calibration is a complex task the present dataset may serve as a benchmark in future. In addition we investigate the sources of skill of the SWBM dataset and find that the parameter set has a similar impact on the simple model results as the choice of the forcing dataset. The newly derived SWBM dataset is of relevance for a range of applications given the deficit of available land datasets.","[Orth, Rene; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Orth, R (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rene.orth@env.ethz.ch,"Orth, Rene/AAG-7034-2021; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Orth, Rene/0000-0002-9853-921X",EU-FP7 EUCLEIA project; ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project; EU-FP7 DROUGHT-RSPI project,EU-FP7 EUCLEIA project; ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project; EU-FP7 DROUGHT-RSPI project,"We acknowledge the E-OBS dataset established by the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES (http://ensembles-eu.metoffice.com (accessed on 01 April 2014)) and the data providers in the ECA&D project (http://www.ecad.eu (accessed on 01 April 2014)) for sharing precipitation and temperature data and the NASA/GEWEX SRB project (http://gewex-srb.larc.nasa.gov/ (accessed on 28 March 2014)) as well as the NASA CERES experiment (http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/index.php (accessed on 01 April 2014)) for sharing radiation data.

The disclosed assessment was carried out over the past decade (i.e., 2010-2019) with a 3-h temporal resolution for the case of Ankara through two WMO meteorological stations to compare both local urban and peri-urban environmental conditions. The study recognised extreme annual variability of human physiological stress (PS) during the different seasons as a result of the biometeorological processing of the singular variables, which in the case of average PET for both stations, varied by up to 75 degrees C between the winter and summer for the same annual dataset (2012). In addition, all EBMs indicated higher heat stress within the city centre that were conducive of both urban extreme heatwaves and very hot days during the summer months, with extreme heat stress levels lasting for longer than a week with PET values reaching a maximum of 48 degrees C. Similar cold extremes were found for the winter months, with PET values reaching - 30 degrees C, and average PS levels varying lower in the case of the peri-urban station.

This is the largest standardized crop model inter-comparison under different levels of N supply to date. The models were calibrated using data from 2002 and 2008, of which 2008 included six N rates ranging from 0 to 150 kg N/ha. Calibration data consisted of weather, soil, phenology, leaf area index (LAI) and yield observations. The models were then tested against new data for 2009 and their performance was assessed and compared with both the two calibration years and the test year. For the calibration period, root mean square error between measurements and simulated grain dry matter yields ranged from 170 to 870 kg/ha. During the test year 2009, most models failed to accurately reproduce the observed low yield without N fertilizer as well as the steep yield response to N applications. The multi-model predictions were closer to observations than most single-model predictions, but multi-model mean could not correct systematic errors in model simulations. Variation in soil N mineralization and LAI development due to differences in weather not captured by the models most likely was the main reason for their unsatisfactory performance. This suggests the need for model improvement in soil N mineralization as a function of soil temperature and moisture. Furthermore, specific weather event impacts such as low temperatures after emergence in 2009, tending to enhance tillering, and a high precipitation event just before harvest in 2008, causing possible yield penalties, were not captured by any of the models compared in the current study.","[Salo, T.

Sustainable parks like the High Line claim to provide economic, ecological, and equity benefits associated with the 3 Es of sustainability. Our research on the development of New York City's High Line suggests that while the High Line meets the economic piece of the sustainability triad with its promise of generating growth, its success in terms of the ecological dimension of sustainability is unclear. More troubling is the High Line's neglect of the social equity component of the discourse of sustainability. Our work brings together several key arguments in the critical literature on urban sustainability to examine how structural constraints associated with creating post-industrial ecological spaces in a climate of neoliberal urbanization play out in the paradigmatic case of the High Line.","[Lang, Steven] CUNY LaGuardia Community Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Rothenberg, Julia] CUNY Queensborough Community Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Lang, S (corresponding author), LaGuardia Community Coll, 31-10 Thomson Ave, Long Isl City, NY 11101 USA.",slang@lagcc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,56,53,54,9,88,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

Although in this contest extensive green roofs are reported to be very effective and sustainable systems, the fact that the main agents of this systems are living organisms have generated doubts, especially in locations where the development of plants and vegetation can be greatly affected by climate. This study aims to investigate the thermal performances of a 2000 m(2) particular proprietary extensive green roof system, located on the city of Lleida (Spain), classified as Dry Mediterranean Continental climate. First, plant cover and floristic composition analysis were carried out to evaluate the dynamic of the plant layer over the surface. Then, according to the result of the botanic analysis, summer and winter study in terms of spatial and temporal factors were conducted focussing on the substrate layer, evapotranspiration effect and comparing the different behaviour of the system in low (10%) and high (80%) plant cover conditions. In this extensive green roof, the results showed temporal and spatial changes in floristic composition, with a stable cover of Sedum sp between 20 and 40 %, and a peak of colonizing species in spring and early summer. The increase in vegetation cover appears to have few effects on the above nearby roof environment because of the low moisture level in the substrate layer so that the cooling effect provided by the evapotranspiration does not take place. In addition, the increased presence of vegetation canopy may induce a limitation in substrate night cooling whereas serves as good shield for solar radiation during the day. Finally, the study also reveals the importance of the spatial factor in extensive green roofs, which can lead to not negligible variations on the thermal performance, as well as the floristic composition.

This approach to temperature reconstruction relies on the strong relationship between air and lake surface water temperature and the distribution of individual chironomid taxa (species, species groups, genera) that has been observed in different climate regions (arctic, subarctic, temperate and tropical) in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere. A major complicating factor for the use of chironomids for palaeoclimate reconstruction which increases the uncertainty associated with chironomid-based temperature estimates is that the exact nature of the mechanism responsible for the strong relationship between temperature and chironomid assemblages in lakes remains uncertain. While a number of authors have provided state of the art overviews of fossil chironomid palaeoecology and the use of chironomids for temperature reconstruction, few have focused on examining the ecological basis for this approach. Here, we review the nature of the relationship between chironomids and temperature based on the available ecological evidence. After discussing many of the surveys describing the distribution of chironomid taxa in lake surface sediments in relation to temperature, we also examine evidence from laboratory and field studies exploring the effects of temperature on chironomid physiology, life cycles and behaviour. We show that, even though a direct influence of water temperature on chironomid development, growth and survival is well described, chironomid palaeoclimatology is presently faced with the paradoxical situation that the relationship between chironomid distribution and temperature seems strongest in relatively deep, thermally stratified lakes in temperate and subarctic regions in which the benthic chironomid fauna lives largely decoupled from the direct influence of air and surface water temperature. This finding suggests that indirect effects of temperature on physical and chemical characteristics of lakes play an important role in determining the distribution of lake-living chironomid larvae. However, we also demonstrate that no single indirect mechanism has been identified that can explain the strong relationship between chironomid distribution and temperature in all regions and datasets presently available. This observation contrasts with the previously published hypothesis that climatic effects on lake nutrient status and productivity may be largely responsible for the apparent correlation between chironomid assemblage distribution and temperature. We conclude our review by summarizing the implications of our findings for chironomid-based palaeoclimatology and by pointing towards further avenues of research necessary to improve our mechanistic understanding of the chironomid-temperature relationship.","[Eggermont, Hilde] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Eggermont, Hilde] State Ghent Univ, Limnol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Heiri, Oliver] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Heiri, Oliver] Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands",Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; Ghent University; University of Bern; Utrecht University,"Eggermont, H (corresponding author), Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",hilde.eggermont@naturalsciences.be; oliver.heiri@ips.unibe.ch,"Heiri, Oliver/A-2403-2008","Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835",Belgian Federal Science Policy of Belgium (Action 1-project); European Research Council (ERC) [239858],Belgian Federal Science Policy of Belgium (Action 1-project); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"We would like to thank our (chironomid) colleagues who were willing to share their data for this study: E.

This is partly because of the limited local understanding of the causes of forest cover changes (FCC) and how these causes relate to development. In this study, we use Colombia as a model to contribute to the understanding of the links between the causes of FCC in conflict-affected countries and policies aimed at achieving sustainable development by targeting the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectors. Specifically, we reviewed studies reporting on causes of FCC from 1995 to 2019 to build a state-of-the-art review. We then identified relevant public policies targeting AFOLU sectors and used them as a proxy for development. Finally, we discussed the links between these public policies and FCC. From the reviewed literature, it is clear that research on FCC in Colombia has focused on understanding the causes of forest cover losses while disregarding forest cover gains. Although cattle ranching and agriculture dominate the literature as proximate causes of deforestation and policy and institutional factors as underlying causes of deforestation, the relative importance of proximate and underlying causes of FCC in Colombia has changed over time. The main categories of policies that have been linked to FCC deal with conflict and post-conflict issues, coca eradication and, more recently, the implementation of the peace agreement. Another set of policies frequently mentioned are those related to productive activities. In Colombia, these policies' effects on forests will depend on how the state will regulate extractive activities in a post-conflict scenario. Therefore, it is imperative to review and update policies to tackle FCC, mainly deforestation, to successfully achieve sustainability targets in Colombia.","[Vanegas-Cubillos, M.; Sylvester, J.; Villarino, E.; Perez-Marulanda, L.; Ganzenmueller, R.; Castro-Nunez, A.] Alliance Biovers Int, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali, Colombia; [Villarino, E.; Perez-Marulanda, L.] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ganzenmueller, R.] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Loehr, K.; Bonatti, M.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Muncheberg, Germany; [Loehr, K.] Humboldt Univ, Urban Plant Ecophysiol, Berlin, Germany; [Bonatti, M.] Humboldt Univ, Agr Econ, Berlin, Germany",University of Copenhagen; University of Munich; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Castro-Nunez, A (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira, Cali 763537, Colombia.",Augusto.Castro@cgiar.org,,"Villarino, Ma.

Though illegal logging has continued, frames about Brazil's forest policy and management have changed since that time. While until 2010 the successful implementation of forest policies and the resulting decline in deforestation rates were there for all to see and appreciate, the increase in the deforestation rate since then has become the focus of international criticism. With the help of a structured review of international scientific literature, newspaper articles, and programmes initiated by non-governmental organizations' (NGO) and international organizations' (10), this paper aims to analyse the frames of illegal logging and its governance responses in Brazil since 2012. The review is guided by the framework of diagnostic (What is the problem? Who is to blame?) and prognostic framing (proposed policy and governance solutions). The main findings revealed a master frame of environmental justice that combines injustice toward indigenous people with the victimization of forest and environment at large. Embedded in this master frame, specific frames that follow the institutional logic of the single policy discourses have been identified. Finally, the results show a strong national focus of governance with continued emphasis on command and control instruments.","[Kleinschmit, Daniela; Ferraz Ziegert, Rafaella; Walther, Laura] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Kleinschmit, D (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany.",daniela.kleinschmit@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,,,"Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","The article processing charge was funded by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art and the University of Freiburg in the funding programme Open Access Publishing.",,77,2,2,1,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

In its aftermath, images of the devastating Kuwaiti oil fields' fires were frequently described as visions of apocalypse, conjuring a posthuman world. Some Gulf War photographs depicting oil damage, among which those taken by Steve McCurry, Bruno Barbey and Sebastiao Salgado, feature animals from soiled sea birds to horses and camels irretrievably lost in the polluted desert. This article, by focusing notably on three photographs by Salgado as published in his 2016 book Kuwait: a Desert on Fire, proposes a close observation of those easily overlooked pictures, to question the hegemonic understanding of the Gulf War as a war without bodies (Sekula). On the contrary, using notably the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, I will argue that the animals' bodies, and specifically their liminal character akin to ghosts and zombies, convey the damage wreaked by this war, not in terms of battle casualties, but rather of its wider environmental damage. The belated publication of Salgado's Kuwait: a Desert on Fire and the relationship of that timing with the evolution of the visual representation of climate change will thus be examined.","[Payet, Erica] Courtauld Inst Art, London, England",University of London Courtauld Institute of Art,"Payet, E (corresponding author), Courtauld Inst Art, London, England.",,,,"Consortium for the Humanities and the Arts South-East England (CHASE), an AHRC funded Doctoral Training Partnership","Consortium for the Humanities and the Arts South-East England (CHASE), an AHRC funded Doctoral Training Partnership","This research was supported by the Consortium for the Humanities and the Arts South-East England (CHASE), an AHRC funded Doctoral Training Partnership.",,56,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-4517,1751-4525,,PHOTOGR CULT,Photogr.

The proposed parameterization follows the mass flux approach with several closures, for equilibrium and nonequilibrium convection, and includes scale and aerosol aware functionalities. Recently, we extended the scheme to a trimodal spectral size distribution of allowed convective plumes to simulate the transition among shallow, congestus, and deep convection regimes. In addition, the inclusion of a new closure for nonequilibrium convection resulted in a substantial gain of realism in the model representation of the diurnal cycle of convection over the land. We demonstrated the scale-dependence functionality with a cascade of global-scale simulations from a nominal horizontal resolution of 50 km down to 6 km. The ability to realistically simulate the diurnal cycle of precipitation over various regions of the earth was verified against several remote sensing-derived intradiurnal precipitation estimates. We extended the model performance evaluation for weather-scale applications by bringing together some available operational short-range weather forecast models and global atmospheric reanalyses.

Seagrass meadows are known to stabilise coastal sediments, recycle nutrients, and provide nursery grounds and food sources for fishes and megafauna. However. nearly 30% of seagrass habitats have been lost worldwide because of global climate change and sustained negative pressure from coastal developments. as well as eutrophication and dredging. This global decline and ongoing threat from climate change have weakened their capacity to support coastal productivity. This alarming decline highlights a global urgency for the implementation of effective seagrass management strategies to prevent their decline. Until now. the physiological indicators used to monitor seagrass health, including seagrass species composition_ above ground biomass, and spatial coverage, have failed to provide any insights into the intensity of environmental stress at the physiological and/or molecular level, which has led to their decline. Therefore. seagrass restoration efforts require highly accurate and novel tools for monitoring seagrass health and effective management strategies. In the era of systems biology, omics (transcriptomics, proteomics. and metabolomics) and their integration have shown promise in the identification of biomarkers of phenotypic plasticity of an organism under specific environmental conditions. Recently, with the influx of genomic information regarding seagrasses, omics have emerged as a new frontier in seagrass research and have deepened our understanding of their adaptation and underlying tolerance mechanisms to environmental stresses. This review article provides a state-of-art on seagrass' omics and discusses their potential to discover stress biomarkers, and thereby aid in developing robust diagnostic tools for monitoring seagrass' health and their management for protection and conservation. We discuss how omics platforms are advancing in technology, such as whole-genome shotgun, RNA-seq, 2-DE, and multidimensional GC- and MS-based platforms, which helps in developing high-throughput protocols for possible implementation in seagrass research This article further discusses how such innovations can provide knowledge on: (1) Molecular adaptation and acclimatisation mechanisms in seagrass responses to light, salinity, thermal, carbon dioxide, eutrophication, and heavy metal concentration, (2) their genetic diversity and evolution, and (3) seagrass reproduction and development. Moreover, we discuss the organelle, such as the chloroplast, based omics frontier to explore its potential in seagrass research to better understand the biological processes at the organelle level and how it may help determine the role of different organelles in providing tolerance against various environmental stresses. Lastly. we discuss the do's and don'ts of the experimental designs, methodological procedures, and analytical tools learned from higher plant studies to facilitate multi-omics studies and data integration in seagrass research. Creating an online user friendly database sourced from multi-omics studies and a suite of tools for analysis will attract seagrass molecular biologists and ecologists working on seagrass ecology, restoration. development, and evolution, and will improve the molecular horizons of seagrass research.","[Li, Linglan; Jiang, Zhijian; Fang, Yang; He, Jialu; Liu, Songlin; Wu, Yunchao; Huang, Xiaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Marine Bioresources & Ecol, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China; [Li, Linglan; Jiang, Zhijian; Fang, Yang; He, Jialu; Huang, Xiaoping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhijian; Liu, Songlin; Wu, Yunchao; Huang, Xiaoping] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou 511458, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhijian; Liu, Songlin; Wu, Yunchao; Huang, Xiaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad South China Sea Ecol & Environm Engn, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Jiang, ZJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Marine Bioresources & Ecol, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZJ (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou 511458, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad South China Sea Ecol & Environm Engn, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.",jiangzj1982@scsio.ac.cn,"Liu, Songlin/CAG-5973-2022",,,,,,69,0,0,8,20,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

The separation of hydrocarbon mixtures containing aromatic and aliphatic compounds is highly relevant, and the use of bio-based solvents for this separation was studied using the model system of methylcyclohexane and toluene. Additionally, the use of bio-based solvents for the difficult olefin/paraffin separation was studied using the model system ofn-heptane and 1-heptene. From all of the bio-based solvents studied, Cyrene (TM) showed the highest relative volatility in the methylcyclohexane-toluene system. At compositions up to 40 wt% of methylcyclohexane in the hydrocarbon mixture, with a relative volatility of 3.17 +/- 0.16 at 1000 mbar, the selectivity was comparable with the state-of-the-art industrial solvent Sulfolane (TM). At higher methylcyclohexane fractions, Cyrene (TM) outperforms Sulfolane (TM), resulting in a 43% reduction of the minimum reflux ratio, which is an excellent measure of energy efficiency. With regard to the relative volatility ofn-heptane over 1-heptene, Cyrene (TM) also induces an increase in the relative volatility, but not as much as the industrial benchmarkn-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). A relative volatility of 1.20 was measured at a solvent-to-feed ratio of 3 (mass basis), which can be further increased by the addition of extra Cyrene (TM). This leads to the prospect that Cyrene (TM) may be used for extractive distillation in olefin/paraffin separations, replacing NMP which is subject to severe environmental restrictions by the REACH agreement due to toxicity.","[Brouwer, Thomas; Schuur, Boelo] Univ Twente, Fac Sci & Technol, Proc & Catalysis Engn Cluster, Sustainable Proc Technol Grp, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Schuur, B (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Sci & Technol, Proc & Catalysis Engn Cluster, Sustainable Proc Technol Grp, Enschede, Netherlands.",b.schuur@utwente.nl,,,ISPT (Institute for Sustainable Process Technology) project [TEEI314006/BL-20-07]; Topsector Energy by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,ISPT (Institute for Sustainable Process Technology) project; Topsector Energy by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,"This has been an ISPT (Institute for Sustainable Process Technology) project (TEEI314006/BL-20-07), co-funded by the Topsector Energy by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.",,60,17,17,1,18,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,21-Aug,2020,16,,,,5369,5375,,10.1039/d0gc01769h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc01769h,,,7,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,NC1AD,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,12/21/22,WOS:000560944400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Information contributed by the palynological and anthracological studies indicates that this transition was marked by a steady expansion of broadleaf woodland and a reduction in herbaceous-shrub communities. Archaeofaunal studies reveal continuity in subsistence strategies throughout the sequence. This was based on specialisation in hunting red deer, fishing, and gathering molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderm species on rocky shores. The difference between the Azilian and Mesolithic occupations lies in the replacement of some marine invertebrate species and the decrease in limpet sizes. The abiotic evidence is characterised by a lithic assemblage with allochthonous flint types, which has been interpreted as continuity of the raw material procurement strategies inherited from the Magdalenian.","[Alvarez-Fernandez, Esteban; Becares, Julian; Llave, Carlos; Martin-Jarque, Sergio; Portero, Rodrigo] Univ Salamanca, Fac Geog & Hist, GIR PREHUSAL, Dpto Prehist Ha Antigua & Arqueol, C Cerrada Serranos S-N, Salamanca 37002, Spain; [Alvarez-Fernandez, Esteban; Becares, Julian; Jorda Pardo, Jesus F.; Alvarez-Alonso, David; Barrera-Mellado, Inmaculada; Cubas, Miriam; Fernandez-Gomez, Maria-Jose; Martin-Jarque, Sergio; Portero, Rodrigo] Univ Salamanca, Grp Invest Reconocido PREHUSAL, Salamanca, Spain; [Jorda Pardo, Jesus F.] UNED, Fac Geog & Hist, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, Lab Estudios Paleolit, Paseo Senda Rey 7, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Agirre-Uribesalgo, Amaia] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Filosofia & Lletres, Dept Prehist, Edifici B, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Alvarez-Alonso, David] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Geog & Hist, Dpto Prehist Ha Antigua & Arqueol, C Prof Aranguren S-N,Edificio B,Ciudad Univ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Aparicio, Ma Teresa] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Barrera-Mellado, Inmaculada; Fernandez-Gomez, Maria-Jose] Univ Salamanca, Fac Med, Dpto Estadist, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Carral, Pilar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dpto Geol & Geoquim, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Carriol, Rene-Pierre] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Hist Terre, Case Postale 38,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Cubas, Miriam] Univ Oviedo, C Amparo Pedregal S-N, E-33011 Oviedo, Spain; [Cueto, Marian; Teira, Luis C.; Arias, Pablo] Univ Cantabria Gobierno Cantabria Santander, Inst Int Invest Prehist Cantabria, Ave Castros S-N, Santander 39005, Spain; [Elorza, Mikelo] Soc Ciencias Aranzadi, Zorroagagaina 11, Donostia San Sebastian 20014, Spain; [Douka, Katerina] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Pk Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Douka, Katerina] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Kahlaische Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Gabriel, Sonia] UNIARQ, CIBIO InBIO, Lab Arqueociencias DGPC LARC, Direcao Geral Patrimonio Cultural, Calcada Mirante Ajuda 10A, P-1300418 Lisbon, Portugal; [Garcia-Ibaibarriaga, Naroa; Iriarte-Chiapusso, Maria-Jose] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Letras, Dpto Geog Prehist & Arqueol, C Tomas & Valiente S-N, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Iriarte-Chiapusso, Maria-Jose] Bilbao Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Basque Fdn Sci, IKERBASQUE, C Tomas & Valiente S-N, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Maestro, Adolfo] Inst Geol & Minero Espana, Dept Invest & Recursos Geol, Calle Calera 1, E-28760 Madrid, Spain; [Suarez-Bilbao, Aitziber] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Ciencia & Tecnol, Dpto Estratig & Paleontol, Apartado 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain; [Tarrino, Andoni] CENIEH, Paseo Sierra de Atapuerca 3, Burgos 09002, Spain; [Uzquiano, Paloma] UNED, Dpto Prehist, C Mediodia Grande 17, Madrid 28005, Spain",University of Salamanca; University of Salamanca; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN); University of Salamanca; Autonomous University of Madrid; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); University of Oviedo; Universidad de Cantabria; Instituto Internacional de Investigaciones Prehistoricas de Cantabria (IIIPC); University of Oxford; University of Basque Country; Basque Foundation for Science; University of Basque Country; Centro Nacional de Investigacion de La Evolucion Humana (CENIEH); Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Alvarez-Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Geog & Hist, GIR PREHUSAL, Dpto Prehist Ha Antigua & Arqueol, C Cerrada Serranos S-N, Salamanca 37002, Spain.;Alvarez-Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Grp Invest Reconocido PREHUSAL, Salamanca, Spain.",epanik@usal.es,"Álvarez-Alonso, David/D-1188-2016; Maestro, Adolfo/ABG-7268-2021; Jordá, Jesús F.

On the basis of observed daily surface air temperature across Canada for 1957-2007, this study found that more than 86% of the total killing-frost events occur in April-May and exhibit consistent variability over south-central Canada, the country's major agricultural region. To quantify the KFF year-to-year variations, a simple index is defined as the mean KFF of the 187 temperature stations in south-central Canada. The KFF variability is basically dominated by two components: the decadal component with a peak periodicity around 11 yr and the interannual component of 2.5-3.8 yr. A statistical method called partial least squares (PLS) regression is utilized to uncover principal sea surface temperature (SST) modes in the winter preceding the KFF anomalies. It is found that most of the leading SST modes resemble patterns of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and/or the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). This indicates that ENSO and the PDO might be two dominant factors for the KFF variability. From a 41-yr training period (1957-97), a PLS seasonal prediction model is established, and 1-month-lead real-time forecasts are performed for the validation period of 1998-2007. A promising skill level is obtained. For the KFF variability, the prediction skill of the PLS model is comparable to or even better than the newly developed Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS), which is a state-of-the-art global coupled dynamical system.","[Wu, Zhiwei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhiwei; Lin, Hai] Environm Canada, Atmospher Numer Weather Predict Res Sect, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Li, Yun] CSIRO, Math Informat & Stat, Perth, WA, Australia; [Tang, Youmin] Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2L 5P2, Canada",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Northern British Columbia,"Wu, ZW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wzw.lasg@gmail.com,"Li, Yun/E-8569-2010; Li, Yun/ABZ-6481-2022","Li, Yun/0000-0001-9925-7372; Li, Yun/0000-0001-9925-7372; Lin, Hai/0000-0003-4353-0426",Sustainable Agriculture Environment Systems (SAGES) research initiative of Agriculture and Afri-Food Canada through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Fellowship Program; National Basic Research Program 973'' [2013CB430202]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Indian Ocean Climate Initiative,Sustainable Agriculture Environment Systems (SAGES) research initiative of Agriculture and Afri-Food Canada through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Fellowship Program; National Basic Research Program 973''(National Basic Research Program of China); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Indian Ocean Climate Initiative,"Zhiwei Wu is supported by the Sustainable Agriculture Environment Systems (SAGES) research initiative of Agriculture and Afri-Food Canada through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Fellowship Program, the National Basic Research Program 973'' (Grant 2013CB430202), and a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

Here we explore the possibilities of this approach using a case study in the tropical Andes. First, we evaluate to what extent the standard JULES land cover configurations can simulate the hydrological response of dominant soil and land cover types of the region. Next, we adjust the soil water retention parameters on a regional basis using experimental soil data from representative sites. We find that the adjusted parameters result in substantial alteration for the flow partition. Such parameterizations may increase the configurations to implement JULES for a larger variety of land cover types and assess soil disturbance's potential impact more precisely.","[Chou, Hsi-Kai; Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.; Moulds, Simon; Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Chou, Hsi-Kai] Cardiff Univ, Hydroenvironm Res Ctr, Sch Engn, Cardiff, Wales; [Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.] Forest Trends, Washington, DC USA; [Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.; Buytaert, Wouter] Reg Initiat Hydrol Monitoring Andean Ecosyst iMHE, Lima, Peru; [Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F.] ATUK Consultoria Estrateg, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England",Imperial College London; Cardiff University; Imperial College London,"Chou, HK (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England.",ChouH2@cardiff.ac.uk,"Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F./H-8323-2019; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022","Ochoa-Tocachi, Boris F./0000-0002-4990-8429; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Moulds, Simon/0000-0002-7297-482X; Chou, Hsi-Kai/0000-0002-0010-8148","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K010239/1, NE/I004017/1]; Taiwan Top University Strategic Alliance PhD Scholarships -Imperial PhD Scholarships of the Ministry of Education, Taiwan; Imperial College President's PhD Scholarship; Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP (NERC) [NE/L002515/1]","Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Taiwan Top University Strategic Alliance PhD Scholarships -Imperial PhD Scholarships of the Ministry of Education, Taiwan; Imperial College President's PhD Scholarship; Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP (NERC)","This work was supported by Natural Environment Research Council: NE/K010239/1 and NE/I004017/1.

The advent and applications of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in the field of reservoir operation have led to significant advances in our capacity to improve the planning and management of complex reservoir systems. This study reports a review of the applications of animal-inspired EAs to reservoir operation optimization selected among a large number of available papers in this area of research. The animal-inspired EAs herein identified concern algorithms that mimic biologic traits of animal (wild) species. Among the animal-inspired EAs ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), artificial bee colony (ABC), honey bee mating optimization (HBMO), firefly algorithm (FA), cuckoo search (CS) and the bat algorithm (BA) are the best-known ones selected for this review. This paper presents a brief description of the algorithmic characteristics and various employed improved versions or varieties thereof of each of the stated EAs. Furthermore, the differences between the proposed animal-inspired EAs and their improved versions are identified by comparing the performance of the implemented animal-inspired EAs in the reviewed literature. PSO and its varieties have the largest number of reported applications. Our comparison results revealed that constrained, discrete and randomized varieties of the animal-inspired EAs outperformed unconstrained, continuous and deterministic varieties, respectively because of larger feasible search space, better solution quality and shorter computational time. Moreover, all the animal-inspired EAs outperformed traditional methods of reservoir optimization, such as nonlinear programming (NLP) and dynamic programming (DP).","[Jahandideh-Tehrani, Mahsa] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Bozorg-Haddad, Omid] Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran; [Loaiciga, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Griffith University; University of Tehran; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Bozorg-Haddad, O (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran.",OBHaddad@ut.ac.ir,"Tehrani, Mahsa Jahandideh/L-4847-2019; Bozorg-Haddad, Omid/F-5710-2015","Tehrani, Mahsa Jahandideh/0000-0003-1763-2023; Bozorg-Haddad, Omid/0000-0001-6607-9581",Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF),Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF),The authors thank Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF) for its financial support of this research.,,110,17,17,6,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1747-6585,1747-6593,,WATER ENVIRON J,Water Environ.

The use of storage systems enables the decoupling of energy demand and supply and to consider dynamic constraints in the control of the systems. The resulting optimization problem is very challenging to solve with the state-of-the-art rule-based-control (RBC) approach. Model Predictive Control (MPC) on the other hand allows a nearly optimal operation but comes with expensive modeling efforts and high computational costs. These drawbacks are contrasted by promising results from the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL can be model-free, is highly adaptive and learns a policy by interacting with the controlled system. However, the literature also addresses a number of questions, to be answered before RL for BACS can be realized. One is the slow convergence of the training process, which makes the application of a pre-training strategy necessary. Therefore, we design and compare different pre-training work-flows for a real-world energy system, in a demand response scenario. We apply a data-driven approach, covering all aspects from raw monitoring data to the trained algorithm. The considered energy system consists of two compression chillers and an ice storage. The objective of the control task is to charge and discharge the storage with respect to dynamic constraints. We use machine learning models of the energy system to train and evaluate a state-of-the-art RL algorithm (DQN) under five different pre training strategies. We compare, online and offline training and initialization of the RL controller together with a guiding RBC. We demonstrate that offline training with a guiding RBC provides stable learning and a RL controller that always outperforms this guiding RBC. Unguided exploration on the other hand leads to higher accumulated cost savings. Based on our findings, we derive recommendations for practical application and future research questions.

The lower cryptotephra layer, THP-TII5, is correlated with the P-11 Pantellerian eruption dated to similar to 128-131 ka. This cryptotephra postdates a thick sequence of combustion layers that show a complex vegetation succession quite similar to that of the last deglaciation succession in the cave. Two other cryptotephras, THP-TII10 and THP-TII12, are correlated with the Nisyros Upper Pumice and the Pantellerian Y6/Green Tuff, dated to >50 ka and 45.7 ka, respectively. This sequence confirms the position of the Nisyros Upper tephra, below the Pantellerian Green Tuff, in the volcanic event stratigraphy of the Mediterranean. Moreover, these two upper cryptotephras bracket an extended combustion layer with interstadial vegetation characteristics that may be coincident with the complex Greenland Interstadial 13-14. On the basis of this new chronology it can be deduced that the intensity of occupation and presence or absence of humans in the cave were closely related to climatic changes. In addition, a remarkable similarity in the pattern of occupational intensity during the last two deglaciations can be suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

UDDSketch provides accuracy guarantees covering the full range of quantiles independently of the input distribution and greatly improves the accuracy with regard to DDSketch. In this paper we show how to compress and fuse two or more data streams (or datasets) by leveraging the mergeability of the UDDSketch data summaries. In general, two summaries on two data streams are said to be mergeable if there exists an algorithm that allows combining the two summaries into a single one related to the union of the two datasets, simultaneously preserving the error and size guarantees. The property of mergeability of a sketch enables the parallel and distributed processing of big volume data streams that can be compressed and fused by means of such mergeable data structures. Among the applications strictly related to accurate tracking of quantiles, requiring parallel and/or distributed processing we recall here estimating the latency of a web site, database query optimizers and the need of succinctly summarizing the distribution of values occurring over a sensor network. We prove that UDDSketch is fully mergeable and introduce PUDDSketch, a parallel version of UDDSketch suitable for message-passing based architectures. We formally prove its correctness and compare it to a parallel version of DDSketch, showing through extensive experimental results that our parallel algorithm almost always outperforms the parallel DDSketch algorithm with regard to the overall accuracy in determining the quantiles.

WET is a completely modularized aquatic ecosystem model developed in the syntax of the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM), which enables coupling to multiple physical models ranging from zero to three dimensions, and is based on the FABM-PCLake model. The WET model has been extensively modularized, empowering users with flexibility of food web configurations, and incorporates model features from other state-of-the-art models, with new options for nitrogen fixation and vertical migration. With the new structure, features and flexible customization options, WET is suitable in a wide range of aquatic ecosystem applications. We demonstrate these new features and their impacts on model behavior for a temperate lake for which a model calibration of the FABM-PCLake model was previously published and discuss the benefits of the new model.","[Schnedler-Meyer, Nicolas Azana] Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann; Hu, Fenjuan Rose Schmidt; Bolding, Karsten; Nielsen, Anders; Trolle, Dennis] Aarhus Univ, Dept Ecosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann; Bolding, Karsten; Nielsen, Anders; Trolle, Dennis] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bolding, Karsten] Bolding & Bruggeman ApS, Strandgyden 25, DK-5466 Asperup, Denmark","Technical University of Denmark; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Schnedler-Meyer, NA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Silkeborg, Denmark.",niaz@aqua.dtu.dk,,"Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201; Bolding, Karsten/0000-0001-8465-3196",Danish Council for Independent Research; EU JPI Climate initiative; EU JPI Water initiative; Danish EPA; Poul Due Jensen Foundation; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research,Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); EU JPI Climate initiative; EU JPI Water initiative; Danish EPA; Poul Due Jensen Foundation; Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research,"This development has been supported by the CASHFISH project funded by the Danish Council for Independent Research, the WATExR project funded through the EU JPI Climate initiative, the PROGNOS project funded through the EU JPI Water initiative, the project Mechanistic Models for Water Action Planning funded by the Danish EPA, and the Lake Stewardship Project supported by the Poul Due Jensen Foundation.

The most common way of retrieving rainfall is by addressing the problem top-down by inverting the atmospheric signals reflected or radiated by atmospheric hydrometeors. However, most applications are interested in how much water reaches the ground, a problem that is notoriously difficult to solve from a top-down perspective. In this study, a novel bottom-up approach is proposed that, by doing hydrology backward, uses variations in soil moisture (SM) sensed by microwave satellite sensors to infer preceding rainfall amounts. In other words, the soil is used as a natural rain gauge. Three different satellite SM data sets from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), and the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis are used to obtain three new daily global rainfall products. The  First Guess Daily product of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) is employed as main benchmark in the validation period 2010-2011 for determining the continuous and categorical performance of the SM-derived rainfall products by considering the 5 day accumulated values. The real-time version of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis product, i.e., the TRMM-3B42RT, is adopted as a state-of-the-art satellite rainfall product. The SM-derived rainfall products show good Pearson correlation values (R) with the GPCC data set, mainly in areas where SM retrievals are found to be accurate. The global median R values (in the latitude band +/- 50 degrees) are equal to 0.54, 0.28, and 0.31 for ASCAT-, AMSR-E-, and SMOS-derived products, respectively. For comparison, the median R for the TRMM-3B42RT product is equal to 0.53. Interestingly, the SM-derived products are found to outperform TRMM-3B42RT in terms of average global root-mean-square error statistics and in terms of detection of rainfall events. The regions for which the SM-derived products perform very well are Australia, Spain, South and North Africa, India, China, the Eastern part of South America, and the central part of the United States. The SM-derived products are found to estimate accurately the rainfall accumulated over a 5 day period, an aspect particularly important for their use for hydrological applications, and that address the difficulties of estimating light rainfall from TRMM-3B42RT.","[Brocca, Luca; Ciabatta, Luca; Massari, Christian; Moramarco, Tommaso] CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Perugia, Italy; [Hahn, Sebastian; Hasenauer, Stefan; Kidd, Richard; Dorigo, Wouter; Wagner, Wolfgang] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Levizzani, Vincenzo] CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Technische Universitat Wien; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR),"Brocca, L (corresponding author), CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Perugia, Italy.",luca.brocca@irpi.cnr.it,"Moramarco, Tommaso/E-6726-2011; Wagner, Wolfgang/AAC-5507-2019; Ciabatta, Luca/AAW-1812-2020; Dorigo, Wouter A/C-7794-2014; Levizzani, Vincenzo/A-9070-2013; Massari, Christian/H-5037-2019; Brocca, Luca/F-2854-2010","Wagner, Wolfgang/0000-0001-7704-6857; Ciabatta, Luca/0000-0003-4600-6320; Dorigo, Wouter A/0000-0001-8054-7572; Levizzani, Vincenzo/0000-0002-7620-5235; Massari, Christian/0000-0003-0983-1276; Brocca, Luca/0000-0002-9080-260X; Moramarco, Tommaso/0000-0002-9870-1694",ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (ESA/ESRIN) [4000104814/11/I-NB]; EUMETSAT through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF); European Commission through the FP7 Project eartH2Observe,ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (ESA/ESRIN); EUMETSAT through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF); European Commission through the FP7 Project eartH2Observe,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (ESA/ESRIN contract 4000104814/11/I-NB, http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/), EUMETSAT through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) (http://hsaf.meteoam.it/), and the European Commission through the FP7 Project eartH2Observe.

To address these issues, resilience thinking has attracted the attention of a wide range of stakeholders. However, despite considerable attention to this concept and its frequent usage, resilience remains ambiguous with diverse interpretations in policy discussions and academic debates about cities. Since such vague interpretations would lead to difficulties in theory and practice, the present study aims to clarify some of these concepts by providing a comprehensive review focused on resilience features and comparing different perspectives regarding urban resilience. The study results showed that the main reason behind such ambiguities is that resilience has undergone fundamental changes since its inception, and recent approaches to resilience are generally based on the non-equilibrium model of resilience. There are three main dimensions, including systems, agents, and institutions, as well as three main approaches to urban resilience, including recovery, adaptation, and transformation. This study's conceptual framework of urban resilience provides scholars and policymakers with a more transparent and comprehensive picture of urban resilience and helps them make better-informed decisions.","[Amirzadeh, Melika] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, 24 Arghavan Alley,Laleh St, Tehran, Iran; [Sobhaninia, Saeideh] Clemson Univ, Planning Design, 119 Cleveirvine Ave, Greenville, SC 29607 USA; [Sobhaninia, Saeideh] Clemson Univ, Built Environm Dept, 119 Cleveirvine Ave, Greenville, SC 29607 USA; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Hiroshima 7398511, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Hiroshima 7398511, Japan",Clemson University; Clemson University; Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University,"Amirzadeh, M (corresponding author), Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, 24 Arghavan Alley,Laleh St, Tehran, Iran.",melika.amirzadeh@gmail.com,"Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613; Sobhaninia, Saeideh/0000-0003-1425-3060; Amirzadeh, Melika/0000-0002-5223-818X",,,,,135,9,9,37,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Path-based and rule-based approaches are limited by their exclusive use of knowledge graphs as background knowledge, and embedding-based approaches suffer from low accuracy scores on current fact-checking tasks. We propose a hybrid approach-dubbed HybridFC-that exploits the diversity of existing categories of fact-checking approaches within an ensemble learning setting to achieve a significantly better prediction performance.

Radiocarbon dating of these relatively well-preserved materials indicates an unexpectedly old age of ca. 45,000 BP or older. In order to identify the biogenic nature of these deposits and to reconstruct the palaeo-environment at the time of their formation, micromorphological, palaeobotanical, and biomarker analyses were carried out. All data indicate that the organic deposit and the pellets were produced by different species. The presence of a novel biomarker, which only occurs in animal urine (hippuric acid), contributed to the conclusion that the organic deposit most likely represents the remains of a rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) latrine, whereas the pellets stem from small bovids. Plant macroremains from the pellets indicate that the animals browsed in the more vegetated areas, presumably near the Nile, although the general environment was probably mainly arid and open. Combined with the dates, this suggests that the pellets date to MIS 3 or 4. Our results demonstrate the great potential of an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Quaternary coprolite deposits, allowing for more adequate and more complete interpretation.

They are also deficient in simulating the observed seasonal variations of circulation and precipitation averaged over the monsoon region. To improve these simulations, the National Centers for Environmental prediction regional Era Model is nested in the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies COLA) GCM. The Eta Model is a gridpoint model with a horizontal resolution of 80 km and 38 layers in the vertical. The Eta Model domain (30 degrees-140 degrees E, 30 degrees S-50 degrees N) covers the Asian monsoon region, which includes the Indian, Chinese, and Southeast Asian monsoons. The COLA GCM is a sigma coordinate spectral model with rhomboidal truncation at 40 waves and 18 vertical Levels. The Eta Model is nested in the GCM such that its lateral boundary conditions and initial conditions are derived from the GCM simulations. The nested model is used to simulate the summer monsoons of 1987, an EI Nino year, and 1988, a La Nina year, prescribing the seasonally varying sea surface temperature of the respective years. The model was integrated from mid-April to the end of September. Three separate runs were made for each year with atmospheric initial conditions for 14, 15, and 16 April, respectively. The ensemble means of the three simulations for 1988 were calculated for the GCM and the Eta Model. Comparison of the results with observations shows that the amplitude and phase of the mean monsoon circulation and precipitation patterns, as well as the seasonal variations of areally averaged circulation parameters and precipitation, simulated by the Eta Model are closer to observations than the GCM simulations. The Era Model simulation for 1987 showed deficient summer rainfall in northern and peninsular India and the Indonesian region, and enhanced rainfall in southeast China, Burma, and the sub-Himalayan region compared to the 1988 simulations. These results are in agreement with observations. The phase and amplitude of the variability in the 2 yr simulated by the Era Model were closer to observations than the GCM simulations over both India and southeast China. Variability in the simulations due to changes in the initial conditions was smaller in the Era Model than in the GCM.","UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT METEOROL, COLLEGE PK, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,,,,,,,,,48,82,82,0,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Here, the aging duration of a vanadium precursor solution, vanadyl acetylacetonate in methanol, is identified as a factor that profoundly affects reproducibility. Substantial changes in structural, optical, and electrical properties of BVO films are observed upon varying aging time of vanadium precursor solutions, which subsequently impacts photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation and sulfite oxidation reactions. With the optimum number of aging days (3 d), some deficiency of oxygen is observed, which is accompanied by an increase in carrier concentration and a reduced charge transfer resistance in the PEC device, which produces the highest PEC performance that is comparable to the state-of-the-art undoped BVO photoanodes. The findings point to the importance of understanding solution chemistry and demonstrate that utilization of the understanding of fine adjustment of the composition of BVO films can produce highly reproducible and efficient BiVO4 photoanodes.","[Byun, Segi] Korea Inst Energy & Res KIER, Energy Mat Lab, Daejeon 34129, South Korea; [Byun, Segi; Jung, Gihun; Shin, Byungha] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Shi, Yuanyuan] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Shi, Yuanyuan] Guangdong Technion Israel Inst Technol, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, 241 Daxue Rd, Jinping Dist 515063, Shantou, Peoples R China; [Lanza, Mario] Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nanosci & Technol, Inst Funct Nano & Soft Mat, 199 Ren Ai Rd, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China",Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Guangdong Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Soochow University - China,"Shin, YH (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.;Lanza, M (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nanosci & Technol, Inst Funct Nano & Soft Mat, 199 Ren Ai Rd, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.",byungha@kaist.ac.kr; mario.lanza@gtiit.edu.cn,"Lanza, Mario/GLV-3473-2022; Lanza, Mario/AAE-3986-2019; Byun, Segi/C-7977-2018","Lanza, Mario/0000-0003-4756-8632; Lanza, Mario/0000-0003-4756-8632; Byun, Segi/0000-0001-6413-5658","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2016M1A2A2936757]; NRF of Korea - Korea government [2017M2A2A6A01071012]","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); NRF of Korea - Korea government(National Research Foundation of Korea)","S.B. and G.J. contributed equally to this work.

In the present study, the efficiency of a Direct Contact MD (DCMD) configuration with hydrophobic and oleophobic commercially available membranes was examined, aiming to reject the main petrochemical pollutants such as acetate, propionate, and phenol. The influence of the feed and distillate temperatures, cross-flow velocity and pH on the flux and quality of the obtained distillate was further studied in a systematic way. The highest overall rejection efficiency of acetate, propionate, and phenol of approximately > 97% was obtained with the oleophobic membrane at pH similar to 13. The rejection of phenol was mainly influenced by pH, as this impacts its dissociation and thus its volatility. Moreover, to calculate the rejection of the components a novel mathematical method for lab-scale experiments was developed. This method is based on (dynamic) mass balances and was shown to be superior to state-of-the-art methods, which can greatly overestimate rejection. The method is independent of the experimental time and avoids the dilution effect of the initial water in the distillate vessel. The findings underline the importance of correct calculation of rejection in MD, to obtain results valuable for practical application.","[Veleva, I.; Vanoppen, M.; Hitsov, I.; Phukan, R.; Wyseure, L.; Dejaeger, K.; Cornelissen, E.

Recent progress in forecasting of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) provides the possibility of skilful seasonal predictions of Baltic Sea ice conditions. In this paper we use a state-of-the-art forecast system to assess the predictability of the Baltic Sea annual maximum ice extent (MIE). We find a useful level of skill in retrospective forecasts initialized as early as the beginning of November. The forecast system can explain as much as 30% of the observed variability in MIE over the period 1993-2012. This skill is derived from the predictability of the NAO by using statistical relationships between the NAO and MIE in observations, while explicit simulations of sea ice have a less predictive skill. This result supports the idea that the NAO represents the main source of seasonal predictability for Northern Europe.","[Karpechko, Alexey Yu; Vainio, Jouni; Gregow, Hilppa] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Peterson, K.

Affordable acid and base treatments enabled the controlled generation of an auxiliary network of intracrystalline mesopores within commercial zeolites of different frameworks, among which the FAU topology is identified as superior. As the micropore structure of the zeolite can be preserved, the unique shape selectivity is retained while improved mass transport in the hierarchical crystals leads to a 7-fold increased activity and a 3-fold prolonged lifetime before thermal regeneration is necessary. The linear correlation between the MDA yield and the product of the Bronsted acidity and the external surface area emphasizes the need to balance acid site and pore quality in the design of an optimal catalyst. Hierarchical USY zeolites outperform the state-of-the-art delaminated zeolites and mesoporous aluminosilicates.

Here we present delta O-18, delta C-13, layer-bounding surfaces, layer-specific width, mineralogy, and distribution of macroholes from Stalagmite MA3 from Anjohibe Cave to provide a detailed understanding of the paleoenvironmental changes in northwestern Madagascar between 370 CE and 1300 CE. The stable isotope records of Stalagmite MA3 are compared with stable isotope records of Stalagmites ANJ94-5 and MA2. Detailed examination of the proxies suggests three distinct intervals of changes. (1) Prior to 795 CE, changes in vegetation seem to have responded to changes in monsoonal rainfall linked to the relative position of the ITCZ. The period between ca. 755 CE and 795 was the driest, and the Stalagmite MA3 record is consistent with sediment records (pollen and lithology) from Lake Mitsinjo, northwestern Madagascar, and with sediment records (fossil pollen and charcoal) from Sainte Luce, southeastern Madagascar. (2) Between 795 CE and 870, the environmental conditions became more favorable, when vegetation recovered from the driest interval. The new conditions must have been suitable for community development in the region as suggested by archaeological evidence around Lake Mitsinjo and the Boeny region, and the establishment of the stone town of Mahilaka. (3) After 870 CE, a gradational change in plant communities from C-3 to C-4 marks the record until around 1130 CE, after which vegetation was dominated by C-4 plants. This change cannot be explained by climate alone, as there is no clear relationship in the climate-sensitive proxies. Instead, it could have been caused by Tavy, a variety of swidden agriculture practiced in the region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Voarintsoa, Ny Riavo G.; Railsback, L.

Ozone forecasts have improved significantly due to the assimilation of ozone into global numerical weather prediction models. The affects of aerosols on UV radiation are increasingly better understood. Parameterization of other factors affecting the UV radiation reaching the surface (albedo and elevation) have been increasingly studied and their affects better known.

Predictability mainly originates from persistence or advection of sea-ice anomalies, interactions with the ocean and atmosphere and changes in radiative forcing. After estimating the inherent potential predictability limit with state-of-the-art models, current sea-ice forecast systems are described, together with their performance.

However, two vascular plant species (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) have been able to colonize this hostile environment. Although it has been proposed that C. quitensis possesses tolerance mechanisms and adaptations allowing survival and growth under such stressful conditions, the underlying molecular/transcriptional mechanisms are currently unknown. Furthermore, the impact of global warming on the endophytic and epiphytic organisms associated with C. quitensis remains unclear. Here, a metatranscriptomic approach was used to determine the effect of an in situ simulated global warming scenario on C. quitensis plants. We found a large number of differentially expressed genes successfully annotated (2,997), suggesting that climate change modulates the metatranscriptome of C. quitensis plants and associated endophytes and epiphytes. Interestingly, 50.5% and 26.8% of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, are from non-plant species (putative endophytic and epiphytic organisms, such as fungi). Interestingly, Gene Ontology analysis pointed out several biological processes differentially enriched in non-plant microorganisms associated with C. quitensis grown in a simulated global warming scenario. Taken together, these results suggest that climatic drivers are shaping plant-microorganism interactions, and that endophytes/epiphytes may play crucial roles in plant adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.

In order to reach the next step towards automated driving it is necessary to implement fault diagnosis systems together with suitable mitigation solutions in automotive perception sensors. This is a crucial prerequisite, since the quality of an automated driving function strongly depends on the reliability of the perception data, especially under adverse conditions. This publication presents a systematic review on faults and suitable detection and recovery methods for automotive perception sensors and suggests a corresponding classification schema. A systematic literature analysis has been performed with focus on lidar in order to review the state-of-the-art and identify promising research opportunities. Faults related to adverse weather conditions have been studied the most, but often without providing suitable recovery methods. Issues related to sensor attachment and mechanical damage of the sensor cover were studied very little and provide opportunities for future research. Algorithms, which use the data stream of a single sensor, proofed to be a viable solution for both fault detection and recovery.","[Goelles, Thomas; Schlager, Birgit; Muckenhuber, Stefan] VIRTUAL VEHICLE Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21a, A-8010 Graz, Austria",,"Goelles, T (corresponding author), VIRTUAL VEHICLE Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21a, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",thomas.goelles@v2c2.at; Birgit.Schlager@v2c2.at; Stefan.Muckenhuber@v2c2.at,,"Muckenhuber, Stefan/0000-0003-1920-8437; Schlager, Birgit/0000-0003-3290-5333; Goelles, Thomas/0000-0002-3925-6260",COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),"This research received financial support within the COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK), the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), the Province of Styria (Dept. 12) and the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG).",,111,16,16,12,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUL,2020,13,,,,,,3662,10.3390/s20133662,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20133662,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,MQ9HU,32629897,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000553202400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In most emerging markets, the building sector is among the sectors increasing most rapidly; and has seen the uptake of building energy efficiency assessment worldwide. In this study a weighting system is developed to form the basis of building energy efficiency assessment tool for Ghana. In achieving this a Delphi-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework is presented to analyse building energy indicators. The framework consists of three main steps. Firstly, the identification of various indicators. Secondly the Delphi method is applied and an indicator list of 21 is determined. In the third step, an analytical hierarchy process model has been conducted and the expert Delphi method has been used to obtain weighted list of these identified indicators from professionals and highly informed local experts from government, academic and industry. Results from the AHP revealed that building design and energy efficiency of building facilities are of top priority to the Ghanaian built environment. It is argued that the development of the weighting system brings about a new appreciation of climate influence on the built environment and its corresponding effect on building energy efficiency measurement. The customized weighting system does not eliminate the socio-economic environment of the region in question but provides the recognition of variables necessary for effective measurement of building energy efficiency.

The Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) project was initiated by the international marine carbon science community in 2007 with the aim of providing a comprehensive, publicly available, regularly updated, global data set of marine surface CO2, which had been subject to quality control (QC). Many additional CO2 data, not yet made public via the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), were retrieved from data originators, public websites and other data centres. All data were put in a uniform format following a strict protocol. Quality control was carried out according to clearly defined criteria. Regional specialists performed the quality control, using state-of-the-art web-based tools, specially developed for accomplishing this global team effort. SOCAT version 1.5 was made public in September 2011 and holds 6.3 million quality controlled surface CO2 data points from the global oceans and coastal seas, spanning four decades (1968-2007). Three types of data products are available: individual cruise files, a merged complete data set and gridded products. With the rapid expansion of marine CO2 data collection and the importance of quantifying net global oceanic CO2 uptake and its changes, sustained data synthesis and data access are priorities.","[Pfeil, B.; Olsen, A.; Heinze, C.; Johannessen, T.; Lauvset, S.

A Decision-Analytic Assessment,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BOUNDARY-LAYER; HURRICANES; INTENSITY; CLIMATE; MODEL,"Recent dramatic increases in damages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) and improved understanding of TC physics have led DHS to fund research on intentional hurricane modification. We present a decision analytic assessment of whether it is potentially cost-effective to attempt to lower the wind speed of TCs approaching South Florida by reducing sea surface temperatures with wind-wave pumps. Using historical data on hurricanes approaching South Florida, we develop prior probabilities of how storms might evolve. The effects of modification are estimated using a modern TC model. The FEMA HAZUS-MH MR3 damage model and census data on the value of property at risk are used to estimate expected economic losses. We compare wind damages after storm modification with damages after implementing hardening strategies protecting buildings. We find that if it were feasible and properly implemented, modification could reduce net losses from an intense storm more than hardening structures. However, hardening provides fail safe protection for average storms that might not be achieved if the only option were modification. The effect of natural variability is larger than that of either strategy. Damage from storm surge is modest in the scenario studied but might be abated by modification.","[Klima, Kelly; Morgan, M.

We present percentiles of both types and their superposition for varying precipitation accumulation timescales. In some temperature ranges, large-scale, convective and total precipitation percentiles follow increases with temperature at rates higher than that of the saturation humidity increase of the atmosphere of roughly 7% per degree Kelvin - as given by the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation. However, the increase in total precipitation is found to be due to the transition between the corresponding percentiles of the large-scale and convective types, rather than their individual sections of steep increase. Furthermore, convective precipitation displays a leveling-off towards higher temperatures. This poses further challenges to reconcile arguments brought forward elsewhere - namely those suggesting convective precipitation as the driver of the super-CC increase - with the present observational data.

These allow heritage operators and researchers to achieve a two-fold accomplishment: (a) improvement and innovation in diagnostic techniques for the definition of parameters relevant for the safeguard of artefacts, as constituent materials, execution techniques and states of conservation, by exploiting miniaturized equipment for effective non-invasive in situ measurements; (b) innovation in remotely sensed measurements, exploiting passive and active sensors located on board of satellite or aerial platforms, that allow for obtaining qualitative and quantitative information on environment, climate and urban landscape. The great potentiality of non- invasive physico-chemical analyses and of innovative sensing technologies both in heritage management prior to a disaster, and in assessing and monitoring of damages after a calamitous event is presented. The improved performances offered by non-invasive in situ measurements and space optical (drones and satellites) and radar sensors, pave the way for new applications in heritage resilience, setting innovative operational approaches, as well as evaluations and protocols for risk mitigation.

Members of at least six distinct groups are now recognized, including notosuchids, sphagesaurids, candidodontids, peirosaurids, trematochampsids, and baurusuchids. These mostly terrestrial crocodyliforms potentially developed ecological strategies that allowed them to live in a hot and arid climate during the Cretaceous. A new genus and species of Baurusuchidae, Campinasuchus dinizi gen. et sp. nov., is established on the basis of several partial skulls and skeletons from the Turonian-Santonian Adamantina Formation. This taxon is notable for its relatively short, anteriorly tapering snout, marked maxillary heterodonty with third maxillary and fourth dentary teeth extremely enlarged relative to other teeth, and the presence of a large anteroposterior depression on each palatine between the palatal fenestrae. The presence of yet another crocodyliform from the Adamantina Formation reinforces the idea that aridity, or maybe a seasonally warm and dry climate alternating with periods of higher rainfall, drove the diversification of terrestrial crocodyliforms throughout the Late Cretaceous.","[Carvalho, Ismar De Souza] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Geol, CCMN IGEO, Ilha Fundao, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Antunes Teixeira, Vicente De Paula; Da Fonseca Ferraz, Mara Lucia; Borges Ribeiro, Luiz Carlos; Martinelli, Agustin Guillermo; Macedo Neto, Francisco; Cunha, Gabriel Cardoso; Cunha, Isabella Cardoso; Ferraz, Patricia Fonseca] Univ Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Ctr Pesquisas Paleontol LI Price, BR-38025180 Uberaba, MG, Brazil; [Sertich, Joseph J.

Deep learning algorithms have recently been shown to be capable of captioning natural photos. However, doing a similar thing for medical data, is difficult due to the variety in reports written by different radiologists with fluctuating levels of knowledge and experience. Current methods for automatic report generation tend to merely copy one of the training samples in the created report. To tackle this issue, we propose variational topic inference, a probabilistic approach for automatic chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic latent variable model where a latent variable defines a single topic. The topics are inferred in a conditional variational inference framework by aligning vision and language modalities in a latent space, with each topic governing the generation of one sentence in the report. We further adopt a visual attention module that enables the model to attend to different locations in the image while generating the descriptions. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmarks, namely Indiana U. Chest X-rays and MIMIC-CXR. The results demonstrate that our proposed variational topic inference method can generate reports with novel sentence structure, rather than mere copies of reports used in training, while still achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard language generation criteria.","[Najdenkoska, Ivona; Zhen, Xiantong; Worring, Marcel] Univ Amsterdam, Sci Pk 904, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zhen, Xiantong; Shao, Ling] Incept Inst Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",University of Amsterdam,"Najdenkoska, I (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sci Pk 904, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",i.najdenkoska@uva.nl,,"Najdenkoska, Ivona/0000-0001-6852-0609",Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence; University of Amsterdam; Top consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs) from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence; University of Amsterdam; Top consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs) from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,"This work is financially supported by the Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, the University of Amsterdam and the allowance Top consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs) from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.",,63,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1361-8415,1361-8423,,MED IMAGE ANAL,Med.

This method does not account for the seasonality of flood drivers and their mutual dependence. In this article, we include the impact of these two factors in a computationally efficient probabilistic framework for flood risk calculation, using Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) as a case study. HCMC can be flooded subannually by high tide, rainfall, and storm surge events or a combination thereof during the monsoon or tropical cyclones. Using long gauge observations, we stochastically model 10,000 years of rainfall and sea level events based on their monthly distributions, dependence structure and cooccurrence rate. The impact from each stochastic event is then obtained from a damage function built from selected rainfall and sea level combinations, leading to an expected annual damage (EAD) of $1.02 B (95th annual damage percentile of $2.15 B). We find no dependence for most months and large differences in expected damage across months ($36-166 M) driven by the seasonality of rainfall and sea levels. Excluding monthly variability leads to a serious underestimation of the EAD by 72-83%. This is because high-probability flood events, which can happen multiple times during the year and are properly captured by our framework, contribute the most to the EAD. This application illustrates the potential of our framework and advocates for the inclusion of flood drivers' dynamics in coastal risk assessments.","[Couasnon, A.; Scussolini, P.; Eilander, D.; Muis, S.; Keesom, J.; Dullaart, J.; Ward, P.

MCP - which is a Bayesian Inversion approach - was originally developed for predictive uncertainty estimates of water level and discharge to support real-time flood forecasting. It is applied here for the first time to precipitation to provide its probability distribution conditional on multiple satellite precipitation estimates derived from TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis real-time product v.7.0 (3B42RT) and the soil moisture-based rainfall product SM2RAIN-CCI. In MCP, 3B42RT and SM2RAIN-CCI represent a priori information (predictors) about the true precipitation (predictand) and are used to provide its real-time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the Bayes theorem. MCP is tested across Italy during a 6-year period (2010-2015) at daily/0.25 deg temporal/spatial scale. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides rainfall estimates that are superior to both 3B42RT (as well as its successor IMERG-early run) and SM2RAIN-CCI in terms of both median bias, random errors and categorical scores. The study confirms that satellite soil moisture-derived rainfall can provide valuable information for improving state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products, thus making them more attractive for water resource management and large scale flood forecasting applications.","[Massari, Christian; Barbetta, Silvia; Brocca, Luca; Ciabatta, Luca; Camici, Stefania; Moramarco, Tommaso] CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Perugia, Italy; [Maggioni, Viviana] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Coccia, Gabriele] RED, Via Giuseppe Frank 38, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Todini, Ezio] Italian Hydrol Soc, Piazza Porta San Donato, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); George Mason University,"Massari, C (corresponding author), CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Perugia, Italy.",christian.massari@irpi.cnr.it,"Ciabatta, Luca/AAW-1812-2020; Moramarco, Tommaso/E-6726-2011; Massari, Christian/H-5037-2019; Brocca, Luca/F-2854-2010; Barbetta, Silvia/AAW-2721-2020","Ciabatta, Luca/0000-0003-4600-6320; Massari, Christian/0000-0003-0983-1276; Brocca, Luca/0000-0002-9080-260X; Barbetta, Silvia/0000-0002-3221-3209; Maggioni, Viviana/0000-0003-0753-3179; Moramarco, Tommaso/0000-0002-9870-1694; CAMICI, STEFANIA/0000-0002-5149-5395",European Space Agency ESA [4000114738/15/I-SBo]; ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) [400011226/14/INB],European Space Agency ESA(European Space Agency); ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI),"This work is supported by the European Space Agency ESA (contract 4000114738/15/I-SBo) project SMOS + Rainfall Land II and by the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI, http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/, contract no. 400011226/14/INB).

Vulnerability analysis is based on a Leopold matrix, which models the relationship between major hazards and pathologies in order to evaluate coastal influence and the risks for the conservation of cultural heritage. The quantitative matrix allows for a cause-effect analysis to be conducted for the main scenarios, related to the state of conservation. These relationships are a key step in risk assessment and treatment strategies. Major hazards have been identified by different public bodies and agencies to provide information about the probability and intensity of these variables in the vulnerability matrix. The combination of vulnerability index assessment, which depends on intrinsic variables and environmental scenarios, and knowledge of the main hazards in Havana and Cadiz, has provided useful tools to conduct risk assessments for cultural heritage conservation in coastal environments, where climate conditions, geomorphology and social issues are the main hazards, while vulnerability is associated with conservation plans. These tools provide information thatwill enable decision-makers in different coastal environments to prioritize strategies for cultural heritage preservation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This development is due to growing interest from a diverse set of stakeholders, such as air quality regulatory bodies, aviation and military authorities, solar energy plant managers, climate services providers, and health professionals. Owing to the complexity of atmospheric aerosol processes and their sensitivity to the underlying meteorological conditions, the prediction of aerosol particle concentrations and properties in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) framework faces a number of challenges. The modeling of numerous aerosol-related parameters increases computational expense. Errors in aerosol prediction concern all processes involved in the aerosol life cycle including (a) errors on the source terms (for both anthropogenic and natural emissions), (b) errors directly dependent on the meteorology (e.g., mixing, transport, scavenging by precipitation), and (c) errors related to aerosol chemistry (e.g., nucleation, gas-aerosol partitioning, chemical transformation and growth, hygroscopicity). Finally, there are fundamental uncertainties and significant processing overhead in the diverse observations used for verification and assimilation within these systems. Indeed, a significant component of aerosol forecast development consists in streamlining aerosol-related observations and reducing the most important errors through model development and data assimilation. Aerosol particle observations from satellite- and ground-based platforms have been crucial to guide model development of the recent years and have been made more readily available for model evaluation and assimilation. However, for the sustainability of the aerosol particle prediction activities around the globe, it is crucial that quality aerosol observations continue to be made available from different platforms (space, near surface, and aircraft) and freely shared. This paper reviews current requirements for aerosol observations in the context of the operational activities carried out at various global and regional centers. While some of the requirements are equally applicable to aerosol-climate, the focus here is on global operational prediction of aerosol properties such as mass concentrations and optical parameters. It is also recognized that the term requirements is loosely used here given the diversity in global aerosol observing systems and that utilized data are typically not from operational sources. Most operational models are based on bulk schemes that do not predict the size distribution of the aerosol particles. Others are based on a mix of bin and bulk schemes with limited capability of simulating the size information. However the next generation of aerosol operational models will output both mass and number density concentration to provide a more complete description of the aerosol population. A brief overview of the state of the art is provided with an introduction on the importance of aerosol prediction activities. The criteria on which the requirements for aerosol observations are based are also outlined. Assimilation and evaluation aspects are discussed from the perspective of the user requirements.","[Benedetti, Angela; Di Giuseppe, Francesca; Flemming, Johannes] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England;

Two previous phases of widespread hypoxia, coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; 8-4 ka before present; BP) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 2-0.8 ka BP), have been identified. Relatively little is known about bottom water redox conditions in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea during the Holocene, however. Here we studied the geochemical composition of a sediment sequence from a currently seasonally hypoxic site in the Danish coastal zone, the Little Belt, retrieved during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 347 (Site M0059). The base of the studied sediment sequence consists of clays low in organic carbon (C-org), molybdenum (Mo) and iron sulfides (Fe-sulfides), and rich in iron oxides (Fe-oxides), indicative of a well-oxygenated, oligotrophic (glacial) meltwater lake. An erosional unconformity separates the glacial lake sediments from sediments that are rich in C-org. The absence of Mo, in combination with high C-org/S values, indicates that these sediments were deposited in a highly productive, well-oxygenated freshwater lake. The transition to modern brackish/marine conditions was very rapid, and subsequent continuous sequestration of Mo in the sediment and high ratios of reactive iron (Fe-HR) over total Fe (Fe-TOT) suggest (seasonal) hypoxia occurred over the last similar to 8 ka. Maxima in sediment Core, Mo and Fe-HR/Fe-TOT ratios during the HTM and MCA suggest that the hypoxia intensified. Our results demonstrate that the Little Belt is naturally susceptible to the development of seasonal hypoxia. While periods of climatic warming led to increased deoxygenation of bottom waters, high nutrient availability in combination with density stratification were likely the main drivers of hypoxia in this part of the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea during the Holocene.","[van Helmond, Niels A.

The simulations yield marked changes in the cold halocline and the Arctic Atlantic layer. Increased precipitation yields a warming of the Atlantic layer, which primarily is an advective signal, propagated through the St. Anna Trough, reflecting air-sea heat flux changes over the Barents Sea. As the freshwater supply is increased, the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre is weakened and a greater proportion of the Arctic Ocean freshwater is exported via the Fram Strait, with nearly compensating export decreases through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The corresponding reorganization of the freshwater pool appears to be controlled by advective processes, rather than by the local changes in the surface freshwater flux. A simple conceptual model of the Arctic Ocean, based on a geostrophically controlled discharge of the low-salinity water, is introduced and compared with the simulations. Key predictions of the conceptual model are that the halocline depth should decrease with increasing freshwater input and that the Arctic Ocean freshwater storage should increase proportionally to the square root of the freshwater input, which are in broad qualitative agreement with the sensitivity experiments. However, the model-simulated rate of increase of the freshwater storage is weaker, indicating that effects related to wind forcing and rerouting of the freshwater-transport pathways play an important role for the dynamics of the Arctic Ocean freshwater storage.","[Pemberton, P.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Oceanog Res Unit, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nilsson, J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Stockholm University,"Pemberton, P (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Oceanog Res Unit, Gothenburg, Sweden.",per.pemberton@smhi.se,,,"project Advanced Simulation of Arctic climate change and impact on Northern regions (ADSIMNOR) - Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [214-2009-389]; Swedish National Space Board; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (via SWERUS-C3 program); Bolin Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University","project Advanced Simulation of Arctic climate change and impact on Northern regions (ADSIMNOR) - Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS); Swedish National Space Board; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (via SWERUS-C3 program); Bolin Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University","All the data, the model setup, and the analyzing scripts used in this study are available through the corresponding author by e-mail at per.pemberton@smhi.se.

The Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases (STOMP) numerical simulator was used to predict multifluid flow and reactive transport of methane through the covers, where representative soil properties, cover thickness, and placement conditions were applied. Simulated cumulative methane emissions were two orders of magnitude greater from the alternative cover than the conventional cover. Mechanistic explanations were provided for the observed behavior.

More and more devices, such as heat pumps and solar collectors will enable a sustainable and distributed generation of heat. Centralized climate management systems are challenged by this development. Multi agent solutions which have been shown to optimize cost and energy efficiency in electricity grids have been proposed in the past to deal with this. A solution based on electronic market principles called HeatMatcher has been designed and tested in simulation mode and was next tested in an installation for floor heating of an apartment building. A centralized climate management system could also control the heating system. By varying the control for several consecutive days between both systems at identical spells of weather for different types of seasons a comparison could be made between the operation and energy efficiency of both systems. It is shown that the multi-agent system is able to control the installation in a stable way and gives priority to sustainable generation of supply to the benefit of the overall installation.

But Belgian conservative Catholics also had a powerful social mission. From the Congolese escapade up to L'Oreille cassee [Tintin and the Broken Ear], Tintin is combating the same proponents of Anglo-American cosmopolitan capitalism.

There is a statistically significant time-lagged association between spring PMM and the August-October US and Caribbean landfalling TCs. Specifically, the positive (negative) spring PMM events tend to be followed by fewer (more) TCs affecting the coastal US (especially over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida) and the Caribbean Islands. This lagged association is mainly caused by the lagged impacts of PMM on the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the subsequent impacts of ENSO on TC frequency and landfalls. Positive (negative) PMM events are largely followed by El Nio (La Nia) events, which lead to less (more) TC geneses close to the US coast (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea); this also leads to easterly (westerly) steering flow in the vicinity of the US and Caribbean coast, which is unfavorable (favorable) to TC landfall across the Gulf of Mexico, Florida and Caribbean Islands.

If the butterfly's caterpillars receive 16 h of light per day, the resulting butterfly hatches a few weeks later with blackish wings. However, if caterpillars receive less than 15.5 h of daylight, many overwinter as pupae. In the following spring, butterflies have orange wings. Overwintering and wing color are decided by hormones. If a certain hormone is released in the first days after the caterpillar has become a pupa, no overwintering takes place, and the wings are black. If this hormone is released later, overwintering occurs, and the wings are orange. Different genes are activated to make either of those two options happen. They guide what happens during overwintering and how long it lasts but also how the butterfly looks once it hatches. We do not yet fully understand how the caterpillars count the amount of light they receive and how this information leads to the differences described above. In addition, the butterfly's whole body and its immune system are different in the two color types. Here we discuss how the butterfly probably makes these changes happen and which role the environment plays. The European map butterfly Araschnia levana is a well-known example of seasonal polyphenism. Spring and summer imagoes exhibit distinct morphological phenotypes. Key environmental factors responsible for the expression of different morphs are day length and temperature. Larval exposure to light for more than 16 h per day entails direct development and results in the adult f. prorsa summer phenotype. Less than 15.5 h per day increasingly promotes diapause and the adult f. levana spring phenotype. The phenotype depends on the timing of the release of 20-hydroxyecdysone in pupae. Release within the first days after pupation potentially inhibits the default levana-gene-expression-profile because pre-pupae destined for diapause or subitaneous development have unique transcriptomic programs. Moreover, multiple microRNAs and their targets are differentially regulated during the larval and pupal stages, and candidates for diapause maintenance, duration, and phenotype determination have been identified. However, the complete pathway from photoreception to timekeeping and diapause or subitaneous development remains unclear. Beside the wing polyphenism, the hormonal and epigenetic modifications of the two phenotypes also include differences in biomechanical design and immunocompetence. Here, we discuss research on the physiological and molecular basis of polyphenism in A. levana, including hormonal control, epigenetic regulation, and the effect of ecological parameters on developmental fate.","[Baudach, Arne] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Insect Biotechnol, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Vilcinskas, Andreas] Fraunhofer Inst Mol Biol & Appl Ecol, Dept Bioresources, Ohlebergsweg 12, D-35392 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Vilcinskas, A (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Mol Biol & Appl Ecol, Dept Bioresources, Ohlebergsweg 12, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",arnebaudach@gmail.com; Andreas.Vilcinskas@agratuni-giessen.de,,"Vilcinskas, Andreas/0000-0001-8276-4968","excellence initiative of the Hessen Ministry of Science, Higher Education and Art (HMWK)","excellence initiative of the Hessen Ministry of Science, Higher Education and Art (HMWK)","This work was funded by the excellence initiative of the Hessen Ministry of Science, Higher Education and Art (HMWK) supporting the LOEWE Centre for Insect Biotechnology and Bioresources.",,59,1,1,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,APR,2021,4,,,,,,325,10.3390/insects12040325,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12040325,,,14,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,RR4HF,33917601,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000643060700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Further, the Ladakh region has in the past decade gained attention of geoscientists interested to understand the Holocene climate variability and its effect(s) on the region's geomorphology, flora, and fauna (including humans) as being positioned within the transitional zone of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the Westerlies. In the present article, we reassess the available records on climatic variation(s) for the past five millennia in this important region. Our reappraisal of the previously available palaeoclimatic reconstructions from sediment records viz. Tsokar, Tso-moriri, Pulu (north and south), Upshi, and Pensila allowed us to demarcate four broad climatic zones -Temporal-cultural Phase 1 [cold and arid; 5 to similar to 2.5 ka (terminal Neolithic to early Historical)], Temporal-cultural Phase 2 [moderately cold and arid; 2.5 to similar to 1.5 ka (early Historical to later Historical)], Temporal-cultural Phase 3 [warm and wet; 1.5 to similar to 0.9 ka (later Historical continued)], and Temporal-cultural Phase 4 [cold and arid; 0.9 ka onwards (early Medieval period)] since the past five millennia. In addition, the known archaeological records (petroglyphs and other artifacts) from Ladakh in a chronological, palaeoenvironmental, and palaeoecological context also support prevalence of an arid climate from 0.9 ka to present in the region. Further, considering nonexistence or absolute rarity of research on Holocene coprolites (palaeofeces) from India, a first detailed record on coprolites (represented by four morphotypes linked to Lagomorphs, Chiropterans, and Aves) from a cave site (Rumtse), Ladakh Himalaya is presented herein that corroborates our findings on prevalence of cold and arid climate. Finally, the Ladakh region certainly holds potential for recovery of ichnofossils (particularly coprolites), associated faunal remains and other archaeological features (e.g., petroglyphs) from the Holocene interval. Thus, future archaeological endeavors can become quite instrumental in furthering our knowledge to understand any change(s) in the dietary pattern(s) within individual faunal groups (including humans) and their surrounding ecology linked to change(s) in the climate of the Ladakh sector.","[Phartiyal, Binita; Kapur, Vivesh V.; Nag, Debarati; Sharma, Anupam] Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India",Department of Science & Technology (India); Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP),"Phartiyal, B (corresponding author), Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",binita_phartiyal@bsip.res.in,"; KAPUR, VIVESH V/AAR-9262-2021","Phartiyal, Binita/0000-0003-3086-8735; KAPUR, VIVESH V/0000-0001-6542-5964","Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, India [BSIP/RDCC/23/2020-21]; Science and Engineering Research Board [CRG/2019/002204]","Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, India; Science and Engineering Research Board","This work was performed under the auspices of Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, India (BSIP/RDCC/23/202021) .

We simulated two dust storms over West Africa in March 2006 and in June 2007. Simulations with and without coupling of the actual dust concentration with the radiative fluxes and the thermodynamics were carried out for each case. The model results for the 2006 case were compared with observations of the AMMA campaign. At the surface the shortwave radiative effect of mineral dust can be described by a linear relation between the changes in net surface radiation and the aerosol optical depth (AOD). For an AOD at 450 nm of 1 the average shortwave radiation reduction amounts -140 W m(-2) during noon. The longwave radiative effect of mineral dust is nonlinear, with an average increase of +70 W m(-2) for an AOD (450 nm) of 1. At the top of the atmosphere the effect of the dust layer with an AOD of 1 on radiative fluxes is not as significant as at the surface. It is slightly positive for the shortwave and approximately 26 W m(-2) for the longwave radiation. The height range and the extension of the dust layer determine the effect of dust particles on the 2 m temperature. When the dust layer is attached to the surface and lasts for several days it leads to an increase of the surface temperature even during daytime. In case of an elevated dust layer there is a decrease in 2 m temperature of up to 4 K during noon. It is shown, that the temperature changes caused by mineral dust may result in horizontal temperature gradients which also modify near surface winds. Since surface wind thresholds decide the uptake of dust from the surface, a feedback on total emission fluxes is established. The coupled model provides an increase in the total emission fluxes of dust particles by about 16% during the dust storm in March 2006 and 25% during the dust episode in June 2007.","[Stanelle, T.; Vogel, B.; Vogel, H.; Baeumer, D.; Kottmeier, C.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Vogel, B (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",bernhard.vogel@kit.edu,"Vogel, Heike/A-3196-2013; Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013","Kottmeier, Christoph/0000-0002-2196-2052; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165",European Community,European Community(European Commission),"Based on a French initiative, AMMA was built by an international scientific group and is currently funded by a large number of agencies, especially from France, UK, US and Africa.

Employing whole scrap tires (WSTs) and low-processed scrap tires (LPSTs, i.e. scrap tires that have not been processed by industrial machineries) as a repurposed construction material is a high-value recovery option that requires less resources and energy than recycling. Researchers and practitioners around the world have been able to develop a significant number of innovative and promising WST and LPST applications, particularly for disaster risk reduction (DRR) projects and in vulnerable communities with limited resources. This paper provides a literature review of the current state of the art for the use of WST and LPST in civil engineering applications (CEAs) within the context of DRR. Four main categories of CEAs have been identified according to the primary function of the scrap tire applications presented: earth retaining structures, seismic retrofitting applications, load bearing elements, and drainage systems. The available studies have been organized, classified and discussed in order to take stock of a heterogeneous field of research and highlight areas where further research is needed.

However, they cannot handle the ever-changing clinical environment, bringing newly annotated medical data from different sources. To exploit the incoming streams of data, these models would benefit largely from sequentially learning from new samples, without forgetting the previously obtained knowledge. In this paper we introduce LifeLonger, a benchmark for continual disease classification on the MedMNIST collection, by applying existing state-of-the-art continual learning methods. In particular, we consider three continual learning scenarios, namely, task and class incremental learning and the newly defined cross-domain incremental learning. Task and class incremental learning of diseases address the issue of classifying new samples without re-training the models from scratch, while cross-domain incremental learning addresses the issue of dealing with datasets originating from different institutions while retaining the previously obtained knowledge. We perform a thorough analysis of the performance and examine how the well-known challenges of continual learning, such as the catastrophic forgetting exhibit themselves in this setting. The encouraging results demonstrate that continual learning has a major potential to advance disease classification and to produce a more robust and efficient learning framework for clinical settings.

For Davids this fear is explored in the veiled women's bodies that echo an experience often misheard or misunderstood. Her text recognises the complexity of gender and race, and their evocative merging in a climate that seeks to neutralise and negate them. Dealing with cultural and religious identity after 9/11, the play is interested in what impact this global event has on local women and we are confronted with the deconstruction of monolithic and homogenous experiences. In response to these ideas, this article investigates what restrictions are presented by essentialism in the text and the potential impact this may have on performances of individual and collective selves for 'Coloured' women within contemporary South African theatre. It explores, more importantly, the alternative approaches offered by the play in conceptualising these women's identities.","[Cloete, Nicola] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Sch Arts, Div Dramat Art, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Cloete, N (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Sch Arts, Div Dramat Art, Johannesburg, South Africa.",nicola.cloete@wits.ac.za,,"Cloete, Nicola/0000-0003-1185-3693",,,,,13,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1013-7548,2163-7660,,S AFR THEATRE J,S.

These reasons, which determine an individual to travel, summarizes the types of mobility with a purpose of building the program for one's leisure time and the touristic motivation as a form of psychological and social manifestation. We can therefore state that leisure time and touristic activities are more and more detached from the periods which rhymed the alternation between seasons, between holiday and work, between day and night.(Bota A., 2006). Purpose of Study: This study has been initiated in Romania staring from the research undertaken regarding the same theme in the United States of America (1979), Greece (1999). The number of subjects surveyed was made of 100 students (men and women). Research Methods: Bibliographic study method; Observation method; Enquiry method (dialogue, questionnaire, etc.); Pedagogical experiment method; Statistical-mathematical method; Graphical method. Findings: The following research started from the hypothesis that there is a new touristic culture structuring, in which game activities are intertwined, and the symbols of leisure time (holidays, travels, sports, arts, cultural aspects) are combined and penetrate one's social consciousness, offering new identities. Conclusions: The study permitted the verification of the hypothesis. Tourism, sports tourism, leisure time activities, determine the apparition and the development of social connections, it contributes to the development of an understanding and peaceful climate, it activates people's financial possibilities and leisure time, enlarging enriching their cultural horizon. Furthermore, it contributes to one's health regeneration, work capacity, at improving one's knowledge, at the satisfaction of spiritual motivation, and at the creation of an understanding and peaceful climate between the peoples.

In recent decades, great advances have been made in estimating GPP and many global GPP datasets have been published. These datasets are based on observations from optical remote sensing, are upscaled from in situ measurements, or rely on process-based models. Although these approaches are well established within the scientific community, datasets nevertheless differ significantly. Here, we introduce the new VODCA2GPP dataset, which utilizes microwave remote sensing estimates of vegetation optical depth (VOD) to estimate GPP at the global scale for the period 1988-2020. VODCA2GPP applies a previously developed carbon-sink-driven approach (Teubner et al., 2019, 2021) to estimate GPP from the Vegetation Optical Depth Climate Archive (Moesinger et al., 2020; Zotta et al., 2022), which merges VOD observations from multiple sensors into one long-running, coherent data record. VODCA2GPP was trained and evaluated against FLUXNET in situ observations of GPP and compared against largely independent state-ofthe-art GPP datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), FLUXCOM, and the TRENDY-v7 process-based model ensemble. The site-level evaluation with FLUXNET GPP indicates an overall robust performance of VODCA2GPP with only a small bias and good temporal agreement. The comparisons with MODIS, FLUXCOM, and TRENDY-v7 show that VODCA2GPP exhibits very similar spatial patterns across all biomes but with a consistent positive bias. In terms of temporal dynamics, a high agreement was found for regions outside the humid tropics, with median correlations around 0.75. Concerning anomalies from the long-term climatology, VODCA2GPP correlates well with MODIS and TRENDY-v7 (Pearson's r 0.53 and 0.61) but less well with FLUXCOM (Pearson's r 0.29). A trend analysis for the period 1988-2019 did not exhibit a significant trend in VODCA2GPP at the global scale but rather suggests regionally different long-term changes in GPP. For the shorter overlapping observation period (2003-2015) of VODCA2GPP, MODIS, and the TRENDY-v7 ensemble, significant increases in global GPP were found. VODCA2GPP can complement existing GPP products and is a valuable dataset for the assessment of large-scale and long-term changes in GPP for global vegetation and carbon cycle studies. The VODCA2GPP dataset is available at the TU Data Repository of TUWien (https://doi.org/10.48436/1k7aj-bdz35, Wild et al., 2021).","[Wild, Benjamin; Teubner, Irene; Moesinger, Leander; Zotta, Ruxandra-Maria; Dorigo, Wouter] TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Wiedner Hauptstr 8, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Teubner, Irene] Zent Anstalt Meteorol & Geodynam ZAMG, Hohe Warte 38, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Forkel, Matthias] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Environm Remote Sensing Grp, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [van der Schalie, Robin] VanderSat, Wilhelminastr 43A, NL-2011 VK Haarlem, Netherlands; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England",Technische Universitat Wien; Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Exeter,"Wild, B (corresponding author), TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Wiedner Hauptstr 8, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",benjamin.wild@tuwien.ac.at,"; Dorigo, Wouter/C-7794-2014","Mosinger, Leander/0000-0002-6813-5812; Teubner, Irene E./0000-0001-7916-5593; Wild, Benjamin/0000-0002-0769-3415; Dorigo, Wouter/0000-0001-8054-7572; Forkel, Matthias/0000-0003-0363-9697",Technische Universitat Wien,Technische Universitat Wien,This research has been supported by the Technische Universitat Wien (Wissenschaftspreis 2015 awarded to Wouter Dorigo).,,75,3,3,22,32,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

To address this matter, we have applied a state-of-the-art life cycle assessment (LCA) to an energy self-sufficient WWTP in Strass (Austria), its supply chain and the valorization of its 'products': produced electricity out of biogas from sludge digestion and the associated stabilized digestate, applied as agricultural fertilizer. Prominent aspects of our study are: a holistic environmental impact assessment, measurement of greenhouse gas emissions (including N2O), and accounting for infrastructure, replacement of conventional fertilizers and toxicity of metals present in the stabilized digestate. Additionally, the environmental sustainability improvement by implementing one-stage partial nitritation/anammox (e.g. DEMON (R)) and co-digestion was also assessed. DEMON on the digesters reject water leads to a considerable saving of natural resources compared to nitritiation/denitritation (about 33% of the life cycle resource input), this through the lowering of sludge consumption for N-removal, and thus increasing electricity production via a higher sludge excess. However, its N2O emission could be restrained through further optimization as it represents a large share (30-66%) of the plants damaging effect on human health, this through climate change. The co-substrate addition to the digester resulted in no significant improvement of the digestion process but induced net electricity generation. If respective amounts of conventional fertilizers are replaced, the land application of the stabilized digestate is environmentally friendly through prevention of natural resource consumption and diversity loss, but possibly not regarding human health impact due the presence of toxic heavy metals, mainly Zn, in the digestate. The outcomes show that the complete life cycle results in a prevention of resource extraction from nature and a potential mitigation of diversity loss (though for some impact categories no quantification of associated diversity loss is possible) but it also leads to a damaging effect on human health, mainly via climate change and heavy metal toxicity. Since it is for now impossible to aggregate the impact to these different aspects in a sound manner, it is not yet possible to consider in this case the studied system as environmentally friendly. Generally, the field of LCA needs further development to present a better and single outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the highly contested development of seawater desalination for municipal water supply in the San Diego metropolitan region as an analytical entry point, the paper excavates divergent water-energy politics emerging in California. Two underlying paradigm shifts of water governance are identified. First, supply diversification represents an attempt to increase reliability through the development of multiple decentralised water sources. Second, the notion of a loading order is being promoted by certain groups as a way of prioritising different water source options according to sustainability criteria, including energy footprint. Drawing on the concept of the socio-ecological fix, the paper argues that seawater desalination - as a technological adaptation to water stress - occupies a paradoxical position, being consistent with diversification, but representing a water-energy trade-off inconsistent with the loading order. This has resulted, the paper suggests, in a polarised debate between desalination and wastewater recycling as alternative climate-independent sources of freshwater. As such, the disputes over desalination in San Diego are understood to be a crucible for broader politics of resource governance transitions.","[Williams, Joe] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England",Durham University,"Williams, J (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England.",joseph.g.williams@durham.ac.uk,,"Williams, Joe/0000-0003-2125-8951",,,,,84,8,8,1,16,WATER ALTERNATIVES ASSOC,MONTPELLIER,"VILLA D ASSAS, 457 AVENUE DU PERE SOULAS, MONTPELLIER, 34090, FRANCE",1965-0175,,,WATER ALTERN,Water Altern.,OCT,2018,3,,SI,,847,865,,,,,,19,Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GW1BK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000446604400020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ability to track and quantify volcanic emissions in space and time with unprecedented fidelity opens the door to integration with geophysical measurements, allowing breakthroughs in our understanding of the physical processes driving volcanic activity. In May 2013 a European Science Foundation funded Plume Imaging workshop was conducted in StrombolUtaly, with the objective of bringing the ground-based volcanic plume imaging community together in order to examine the state of the art, and move towards a 'best-practice' for volcanic ash and gas imaging techniques. A particular focus was the development of SO2 imaging systems, or SO2 cameras, with six teams deploying and testing various designs of ultraviolet and infrared-based imaging systems capable of imagining SO2. One conclusion of the workshop was that the term 'SO2 camera' should be applied to any SO2 imaging system, regardless of wavelength of radiation used. This Special Issue on Volcanic Plume Imaging is the direct result of the Stromboli workshop, and together the papers presented here represent the state of the art of ground-based volcano plume imaging science and technology. In this work, we examine in detail the volcanological applications of the SO2 camera, reviewing previous works and placing the new research contained in this Special Issue in context The development of the SO2 camera, and future developments extending imaging to other volcanic gases, is one of the most exciting and novel research frontiers in volcanology today.

To test these hypotheses, we developed a midden record from one likely refugium in north-eastern Baja California, Mexico. We also measured stomatal guard cell size in fossil leaves to further evaluate site-level individualistic responses of Larrea tridentata (creosote bush) ploidy races to climatic changes, including monsoonal history, over the late Quaternary. Location Sierra Juarez, Lower Colorado River Basin, north-eastern Baja California, Mexico. Methods Packrat (Neotoma) middens were collected from < 300 m elevation on the eastern piedmont of the Sierra Juarez. Plant macrofossils and pollen were analysed from 50 dated middens, including determination of Larrea tridentata ploidy races. Results Pleistocene middens dating back to > 55,000 cal. yr bp contained a mix of extralocal species characteristic of chaparral and pinyon-juniper-oak woodland, along with some modern desert elements. Many other desert taxa were absent during the Pleistocene, although most had arrived by the beginning of the Holocene 11,700 years ago. Main conclusions The assemblage of chaparral, woodland and select desert elements refutes the hypothesis that the Lower Colorado River Basin served as a late Pleistocene refugium for Sonoran Desert flora. The rapid arrival of most missing desert species by the early Holocene suggests they did not have far to migrate. They probably survived the last glacial period as smaller, disparate populations in dry microsites within chaparral and pinyon-juniper-oak woodlands. Diploid and tetraploid races of Larrea tridentata were present during the Pleistocene, but hexaploids did not appear until the mid-Holocene. This demonstrates that individualistic responses to climate involved genetic variants, in this case cytotypes, and not just species.","[Holmgren, Camille A.] SUNY Coll Buffalo, Dept Geog & Planning, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Betancourt, Julio L.] US Geol Survey, Reston, VA 20192 USA; [Cristina Penalba, M.] Univ Sonora, Dept Invest Cient & Tecnol, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico; [Delgadillo, Jose] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Zuravnsky, Kristin; Hunter, Kimberly L.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Salisbury, MD 21830 USA; [Rylander, Kate A.] US Geol Survey, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Weiss, Jeremy L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Buffalo State College; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Universidad de Sonora; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Arizona,"Holmgren, CA (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Buffalo, Dept Geog & Planning, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",holmgrca@buffalostate.edu,,,National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration Grant [8713-09],National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration Grant(National Geographic Society),"We acknowledge financial support from National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration Grant no. 8713-09.

A standard 1 degrees x 1 degrees atmospheric model intercomparison project experiment is carried out for the period 1979-2002, and the last 20 years of outputs are used for analysis. The same period from International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) is used as the observation for comparison purposes. The evaluations focus on TC activity at the global scale as well as in the three key regions of the northern Indian Ocean (NIO), western Pacific (WP) and northern Atlantic (NA). With respect to the simulated TC climatology, FAMIL2 shows notable ability in correctly reproducing the main characteristics of the genesis locations, tracks, and numbers of TC, particularly over the key regions of TC activity in the Northern Hemisphere; whereas, it underestimates the intensities of TC, as is the case with many state-of-the-art climate models operating at a medium resolution. On seasonal-to-interannual time scales, meanwhile, FAMIL2 successfully reproduces the seasonal cycles of TC numbers over the NIO and WP regions, the former being characterized by double TC peaks (in May and October) and the latter by a maximum peak season in August. However, the model only captures these features approximately. For the simulated interannual variability of TC activity, the correlation coefficients of 20-year TC numbers between FAMIL2 and IBTrACS are 0.22, 0.51 (95% confidence interval), and 0.49 (95% confidence interval) for the NIO, WP, and NA, respectively. We also examine the possible reasons behind the performance of FAMIL2 by investigating its subseasonal signs related to the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and convectively coupled equatorial waves. The TC genesis potential index is employed to investigate the possible impacts of the large-scale dynamic fields on the simulation of TC activity. Finally, the biases of simulated TC activity, as well as possible solutions for these biases, are discussed with respect to the horizontal resolution of the model. A TC forecasting case study is introduced as a first step in applying FAMIL2 to a TC forecasting system.","[Li, Jinxiao; Bao, Qing; Liu, Yimin; Wu, Guoxiong; Wang, Lei; He, Bian; Wang, Xiaocong; Li, Jiandong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinxiao; Bao, Qing; Liu, Yimin; He, Bian; Wang, Xiaocong] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinxiao; Liu, Yimin; Wu, Guoxiong; Wang, Lei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bao, Q; Liu, YM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Bao, Q; Liu, YM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liu, YM (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",baoqing@mail.iap.ac.cn; lym@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Bao, Qing/A-7765-2012; 何, 编/O-5907-2014","Bao, Qing/0000-0003-1719-6540; Li, Jinxiao/0000-0003-1724-0513; He, Bian/0000-0002-7290-2201","National Key Research and Development Program Global Change and Mitigation Project [2017YFA0604004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91737306, U1811464, 41675100, 91637312]",National Key Research and Development Program Global Change and Mitigation Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by funds from the National Key Research and Development Program Global Change and Mitigation Project (grant 2017YFA0604004) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 91737306, U1811464, 41675100, and 91637312).

The China's cement industry is the second largest energy consumer and key emitter of CO2 and air pollutants, which accounts for 7% of China's total energy consumption, 15% of CO2, and 14% of PM2.5, respectively. In this study, a state-of-the art modeling framework is developed that comprises a number of different methods and tools within the same platform (i.e. provincial energy conservation supply curves, the Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies, ArcGIS, the global chemistry Transport Model, version 5, and Health Impact Assessment) to assess the potential for energy savings and emission mitigation of CO2 and PM2.5, as well as the health impacts of pollution arising from China's cement industry. The results show significant heterogeneity across provinces in terms of the potential for PM2.5 emission reduction and PM2.5 concentration, as well as health impacts caused by PM2.5. Implementation of selected energy efficiency measures would decrease total PM2.5 emissions by 2% (range: 1-4%) in 2020 and 4% (range: 2-8%) by 2030, compared to the baseline scenario. The reduction potential of provincial annual PM2.5 concentrations range from 0.03% to 2.21% by 2030 respectively, when compared to the baseline scenario. 10,000 premature deaths are avoided by 2020 and 2030 respectively relative to baseline scenario. The provinces of Henan and Hubei account for 43% of total avoided premature deaths, followed by Chongqing (9%) and Shanxi (10%), respectively. If only considering the energy saving benefits, 37% of energy efficiency measures are not cost effective. However, the co-benefits (including energy saving, CO2 reduction, and health benefits) are about two times higher than the costs of energy efficiency measures. Hence, this study clearly demonstrates that simultaneous planning of energy and air quality policies creates a possibility of increasing economic efficiency in both policy areas.

As LT-PEFC membranes rely on the presence of water and high-temperature (HT-)PEFCs suffer from sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, alternative materials must be developed. Promising candidates are protic ionic liquids (PILs) immobilized in, e.g., a host polymer. PILs' properties, such as weak ion adsorption, high acidity of the proton-carrying ion, an excess of the anion precursor, and a high oxygen diffusivity and solubility, are favorable for achieving high ORR rates. Concepts proposed in the literature for incorporating PILs into MEA components are presented herein, and their utility for future IT-PEFCs is discussed.","[Wippermann, Klaus; Korte, Carsten] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Energy & Climate Res Electrochem Proc Engn IE, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Wippermann, K (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Energy & Climate Res Electrochem Proc Engn IE, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",k.wippermann@fz-juilich.de,,"Korte, Carsten/0000-0001-6574-6223",,,,,46,1,1,11,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2451-9103,,,CURR OPIN ELECTROCHE,Curr.

While previous studies have demonstrated that poleward moisture flux into the Arctic strengthens downward longwave radiation, less attention has been given to the impact of the accompanying increase in snowfall. Here, utilizing state-of-the-art sea ice models, we show that typical winter snowfall (snow water equivalent) anomalies of around 1.0 cm, accompanied by positive downward longwave radiation anomalies of similar to 5 W m22, can cause basinwide sea ice thinning by around 5 cm in the following spring over the Arctic seas in the Eurasian-Pacific seas. In extreme cases, this is followed by a shrinking of summer ice extent. In the winter of 2016/17, anomalously strong warm, moist air transport combined with similar to 2.5-cm increase in snowfall (snow water equivalent) decreased spring ice thickness by similar to 10 cm and decreased the following summer sea ice extent by 5%-30%. This study suggests that small changes in the pattern and volume of winter snowfall can strongly impact the sea ice thickness and extent in the following seasons.","[Lim, Won-Il; Seo, Kyong-Hwan] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan, South Korea; [Park, Hyo-Seok] Hanyang Univ, Dept Ocean Sci & Technol, Ansan, South Korea; [Stewart, Andrew L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Pusan National University; Hanyang University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Park, HS (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Ocean Sci & Technol, Ansan, South Korea.",hspark1@gmail.com,"Seo, Kyong-Hwan/GSD-2629-2022","Seo, Kyong-Hwan/0000-0001-6305-5488; Stewart, Andrew/0000-0001-5861-4070",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [2020R1A2C2010025]; U.S. National Science Foundation [OCE-1751386]; KMA Supercomputing Center,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); KMA Supercomputing Center,"This work is supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF; 2020R1A2C2010025) and the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant OCE-1751386.

The new dataset differs from its global counterparts in the additional assimilation of precipitation and radiances. This along with the use of a more comprehensive land surface model in generation of NARR offers the prospect of obtaining improved estimates of surface hydrologic and near-surface meteorological fields. NARR's representation of hydroclimate is used to weigh in on the authors' recent finding of the dominance of large-scale moisture flux convergence over evaporation in accounting for Great Plains precipitation variations. Evaporation estimates are notoriously uncertain and, while the NARR ones are not assured to be realistic, they are more constrained than those diagnosed before from inline and offline assessments. NARR's portrayal of warm-season hydroclimate variability corroborates the importance of remote water sources in generation of Great Plains precipitation variability and supports the authors' claim that some state-of-the-art atmosphere/land surface models vigorously recycle precipitation, erroneously, at least in context of Great Plains interannual variability.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a guideline for a thorough and standardized occupant-behavior model documentation. For that purpose, the literature screening for the existing occupant behavior models in building control was conducted, and the occupant behavior modeling processes were studied to extract practices and gaps for each of the following phases: problem state-ment, data collection, and preprocessing, model development, model evaluation, and model implementation. The literature screening pointed out that the current state-of-the-art on model documentation shows little uni-fication, which poses a particular burden for the model application and replication in field studies. In addition to the standardized model documentation, this work presented a model-evaluation schema that enabled bench-marking of different models in field settings as well as the recommendations on how OB models are integrated with the building system.","[Dong, Bing; Liu, Yapan] Syracuse Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 263 Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Markovic, Romana; Wagner, Andreas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Bldg Sci Grp, Englerstr 7, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Carlucci, Salvatore] Cyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Liguori, Antonio; van Treeck, Christoph] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E3D Inst Energy Efficiency & Sustainable Bldg, Mathieustr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Oleynikov, Dmitry] Katernberger Str 107, D-45327 Essen, Nordrhein Westf, Germany; [Azar, Elie] Khalifa Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Fajilla, Gianmarco; De Simone, Marilena] Univ Calabria, Dept Environm Engn, P Bucci 44A, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Drgona, Jan] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA USA; [Kim, Joyce] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Vellei, Marika] La Rochelle Univ, LaSIE, UMR CNRS 7356, La Rochelle, France; [Shamsaiee, Masood] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Bavaresco, Mateus] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Energy Efficiency Bldg, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Favero, Matteo] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Kjaergaard, Mikkel] Univ Southern Denmark, Maersk Mc Kinney Moller Inst, Odense, Denmark; [Osman, Mohamed; Dabirian, Sanam] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Frahm, Moritz] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Automat & Appl Informat, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Yan, Da; Kang, Xuyuan] Tsinghua Univ, Bldg Energy Res Ctr, Sch Architecture, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Syracuse University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; RWTH Aachen University; Khalifa University of Science & Technology; University of Calabria; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Waterloo; Iran University Science & Technology; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Southern Denmark; Concordia University - Canada; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Tsinghua University,"Dong, B (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 263 Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bidong@syr.edu,"Yan, Da/AAI-8879-2021; Kang, Xuyuan/AAF-2037-2019; Kjaergaard, Mikkel Baun/O-8092-2018","Yan, Da/0000-0003-2399-723X; Kang, Xuyuan/0000-0002-7809-8218; Kjaergaard, Mikkel Baun/0000-0001-5124-744X; Osman, Mohamed/0000-0001-6840-3189; Frahm, Moritz/0000-0001-7418-1615; Favero, Matteo/0000-0002-3853-2585","U.S. National Science Foundation [1949372]; German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) [03EN1002A, 03EN1002B, 03ETW016A]; Calabria Region Government [H21G18000170006]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [TR 892/4-1]","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK); Calabria Region Government; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Bing Dong and Yapan Liu would like to thank the support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (Award No. 1949372) .

Structural uncertainty arises when different retrieval methodologies are applied within the scientific community to the same satellite observations. Here, we address the issue of AMF structural uncertainty via a detailed comparison of AMF calculation methods that are structurally different between seven retrieval groups for measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We estimate the escalation of structural uncertainty in every sub-step of the AMF calculation process. This goes beyond the algorithm uncertainty estimates provided in state-of-the-art retrievals, which address the theoretical propagation of uncertainties for one particular retrieval algorithm only. We find that top-of-atmosphere reflectances simulated by four radiative transfer models (RTMs) (DAK, McArtim, SCIATRAN and VLIDORT) agree within 1.5 %. We find that different retrieval groups agree well in the calculations of altitude re-solved AMFs from different RTMs (to within 3%), and in the tropospheric AMFs (to within 6%) as long as identical ancillary data (surface albedo, terrain height, cloud parameters and trace gas profile) and cloud and aerosol correction procedures are being used. Structural uncertainty increases sharply when retrieval groups use their preference for ancillary data, cloud and aerosol correction. On average, we estimate the AMF structural uncertainty to be 42% over polluted regions and 31% over unpolluted regions, mostly driven by substantial differences in the a priori trace gas profiles, surface albedo and cloud parameters. Sensitivity studies for one particular algorithm indicate that different cloud correction approaches result in substantial AMF differences in polluted conditions (5 to 40% depending on cloud fraction and cloud pressure, and 11% on average) even for low cloud fractions (< 0.2) and the choice of aerosol correction introduces an average uncertainty of 50% for situations with high pollution and high aerosol loading. Our work shows that structural uncertainty in AMF calculations is significant and that it is mainly caused by the assumptions and choices made to represent the state of the atmosphere. In order to decide which approach and which ancillary data are best for AMF calculations, we call for well-designed validation exercises focusing on polluted conditions in which AMF structural uncertainty has the highest impact on NO2 and HCHO retrievals.","[Lorente, Alba; Boersma, K.

Nonetheless, the presence of paleoglacial landforms in low latitudes, especially those formed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), persists in different tropical regions. Chirripo National Park, in central-south Costa Rica, is one of these particular examples. The glacial and periglacial landscape in the park are located over 3000 m, with landforms such as aretes, glacial cirques, moraines, till deposits, and glacial lakes. We performed an integrated approach for the geoheritage inventory and geotourism management, crossing geomorphological and cultural information. A total of 14 geomorphosites were assessed and their management discussed. These geomorphosites achieved scientific scores between 0.5 (Valle Talari, Cerro Uran, and Cerro Terbi) and 0.88 (Cerro Chirripo and Los Crestones). The average scientific value of the geomorphosites is 0.75, since they are well preserved (0.75), rare (0.57) and representative (0.84) of the region's geomorphology. They also play an important role in the geographical history (0.62), as well as the significant use and management characteristics (0.8). Chirripo National Park has key importance both naturally and culturally for Costa Rica. Its geomorphosites assessment is of critical value for the Costa Rican Conservation Areas System in order to promote improved geotourism. Geoheritage mapping can offer more opportunities of transferring geoscience knowledge to a larger public and policy makers. Our study aims to improve and further the state of the art of tropical glacial geoheritage.","[Quesada-Roman, Adolfo] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climate Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Quesada-Roman, Adolfo] Univ Costa Rica, Dept Geog, San Pedro, Costa Rica; [Perez-Umana, Dennis] Coll Profess Geog, San Pedro, Costa Rica",University of Geneva; Universidad Costa Rica,"Quesada-Roman, A (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climate Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland.;Quesada-Roman, A (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Dept Geog, San Pedro, Costa Rica.",adolfo.quesada@gmail.com,"Mauerhofer, Lukas/AAJ-5146-2021; Quesada-Román, Adolfo/AAS-9376-2021","Perez-Umana, Dennis/0000-0002-0260-2473",,,,,83,12,12,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,24-Jun,2020,3,,,,,,58,10.1007/s12371-020-00485-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12371-020-00485-0,,,13,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,MB5DF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000542622400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the project is the production of high-quality biochar and a liquid energy carrier in a non-aqueous hydrocarbon-based pyrolysis system. Therefore, the pyrolytic degradation properties of wood and its building blocks glucose, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were investigated during liquid-phase pyrolysis conditions. The process was carried out in a semibatch reaction vessel under isothermal conditions at various temperatures between T = 350A degrees C and T = 390A degrees C. Process pressure was ambient. For optimum heat transfer, pyrolysis was carried out in a liquid heat carrier phase which provides sufficient heat capacity and high heat conductivity for isothermal operation. The interaction between heat carrier, biomass, and biomass products in the liquid and vapor phases was investigated. Liquid-phase pyrolysis is an exothermic process which produces 25-28% liquid CHO products. The heat of reaction is -864 A +/- 25 kJ/kg at T = 350A degrees C. To quantify products of biogenous and fossil origin, liquid products were analyzed by elemental analysis, gas chromatography, and accelerated mass spectroscopy.

The information of water content can help to improve atmospheric and climate models, and thus provide a better understanding of the past and present role of water and aqueous alteration on Mars. Mineral abundances can provide unique constraints on their formation environments and thus also on the geological and climate evolution of Mars.Aims. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art approach to derive the hydration state and mineral abundances over Gale crater on Mars, analysing hyperspectral visible/near-infrared data from the Observatoire pour la Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activite (OMEGA) instrument onboard Mars Express and from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.Methods. The Discrete Ordinate Transfer model was used to perform atmospheric and thermal correction of the OMEGA and CRISM hyperspectral data in order to derive the surface single scattering albedos (SSAs) at Gale crater, Mars. Water content was estimated using a linear relationship between the derived effective single-particle absorption thickness at 2.9 mu m from SSAs and the water weight percentage. Mineral abundances were retrieved by performing the linear spectral unmixing of SSAs from CRISM data. The results were compared with the ground-truth results returned from Curiosity rover.Results. The water content for most areas at Gale crater derived using the OMEGA data is around 2-3 water weight percent (water wt % hereafter), which is in agreement with that derived from the in situ measurements by Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. However, the sensitivity tests show that uncertainties exist due to the combination of several factors including modelling bias, instrumental issue, and different sensing techniques. The derived mineral abundances using the orbital data are not fully consistent with that derived by Curiosity, and the discrepancy may be due to a combination of dust cover, texture, and particle size effects, as well as the effectiveness of the quantitative model.Conclusions. The ground-truth data from Curiosity provide a critical calibration point for the quantitative method used in the orbital remote-sensing observations. Our analysis indicates that the method presented here has great potential for mapping the water content and mineral abundances on Mars, but caution must be taken when using these abundance results for geological interpretations.","[Liu, Yang; Liu, Zhenghao; Zou, Yongliao] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Space Sci Ctr, State Key Lab Space Weather, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Stachurski, Federico] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Liu, Zhenghao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Space Science Center, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Glasgow; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Space Sci Ctr, State Key Lab Space Weather, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei, Peoples R China.",yangliu@nssc.ac.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 41000000]; pre-research project on Civil Aerospace Technologies - China National Space Administration (CNSA) [D020101, D020102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11941001]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission [Z191100004319001, Z181100002918003]",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); pre-research project on Civil Aerospace Technologies - China National Space Administration (CNSA); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission(Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission),"We thank Mathieu Vincendon for his constructive comments that significantly improved the content and clarity of the manuscript.

The loss of performance and a reduced driving range in EVs usually happens within five to eight years of EVs' usage, depending on the driving style and frequency. With about 70 - 80% of remaining capacity, these repurposed discarded EVs batteries, commonly known as Second-Life Batteries (SLB), still have much life that could be used in less-demanding second-life applications such as stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS). Considering that the global growth of EVs' usage has been rising, the availability of SLB will soon be alarming. However, the recycling rate of the discarded EVs' batteries is not proportional to the penetration of EVs on the road. Hence, studying the potential applications for SLB is equally vital to the production of EVs as a green solution. The main contribution of this paper will be to review SLB that could be used as an ESS for various second-life applications with particular emphasis on power peak shaving for Commercial and Industrial (C&I) consumers. As the weather conditions prevailing in different countries affect the performance of SLB, it was realised that the study on the performance of SLB for peak power shaving application has yet to be done in tropical climates countries, specifically in South East Asia. In this paper, several research works are reviewed to understand the state-of-the-art related to SLB. Some of the demonstration projects related to SLB, such as the studies done in many countries, batteries type, and scope of the study, have been summarised. Furthermore, the principle of power peak shaving, state-of-the-art related to power peak shaving strategies, and its pro-and-con are discussed thoroughly. The economic impact and market potential of SLB as an ESS for power peak shaving applications are critically reviewed. Interestingly, it was found that the cost of a first-life battery is about 70% of the total ESS cost; adopting SLB not only addresses the environmental concern but also further reduces the total cost of an ESS. Nevertheless, there are some existing challenges for SLB and safety concerns regarding SLB which have been further discussed in the paper.","[Lee, Jia Woon; Haram, Mohammed Hussein Saleh Mohammed; Ramasamy, Gobbi; Thiagarajah, Siva Priya; Ngu, Eng Eng] Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn, Ctr Elect Energy & Automat CEEA, Cyberjaya, Selangor, Malaysia; [Lee, Yuen How] Light & Energy Solut Sdn Bhd, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia",Multimedia University,"Lee, JW (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn, Ctr Elect Energy & Automat CEEA, Cyberjaya, Selangor, Malaysia.",,,,"Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry Trust Account, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Malaysia","Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry Trust Account, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Malaysia","This work has been conducted partly in the framework of the Research Project titled Secondlife EV battery for Energy Storage System, which is funded by Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry Trust Account, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Malaysia.",,107,10,10,8,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-152X,,J ENERGY STORAGE,J.

It can also be developed though art and literature when considering the interdisciplinary nature of environmental education. Literary children's books, for example, can be an effective tool to develop students' environmental literacy. Even though MoNE suggested 100 classics for elementary and secondary education students to develop reading habits and to introduce the national and international classic works, a number of studies focussing on the implications of these classics on the educational process (policy and practice) and individual development of the students is limited. In this regard, the present study is one of the initial attempts to reveal the hidden and/or explicit effects of these classics on students' environmental literacy. Purpose of Study: The purpose of the study was to analyze the components of environmental literacy embedded in the classic works recommended by MoNE for Turkish elementary schools. Methods: For a detailed examination, the researchers randomly selected 10 classics from 63 well-known Turkish classic works for content analysis considering the framework of environmental literacy proposed by Simmons. Content analysis enables the researchers to examine what is or what is not in the selected written or visual document(s). The results reported the frequency and percentage of environmental literacy components embedded in the selected works. Findings and Results: The content analysis of these works revealed three types of main components (knowledge, affect and behavior) andseveral sub-components. Students' awareness of the natural environment and geographical pattern (morning-night and seasons-climate) was mostly emphasized in nearly all of the analyzed works. Students' affect and physical behaviors were relatively less emphasized. Conclusions and Recommendations: In the analyzed classics, environmental pollution, which is one of the main topics and emphases of Environmental Education (EE) was paid very little attention. Considering its interdisciplinary nature, EE should be infused in other subjects (i.e., art and literature) and various classroom activities taking place in humanity classes. In this regard, 100 classics suggested for the elementary and secondary school students can be used as a vehicle. This study was only realized with 10 selected classics out of 63 Turkish classics. Foreign classics were not included in the study. It is suggested to other researchers to conduct broader research with more classic works, including both national and international classics.","[Erdogan, Mehmet] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Educ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey; [Coskun, Eyyup] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Educ, Antakya, Turkey; [Usak, Muhammet] Zirve Univ, Fac Educ, Gaziantep, Turkey",Akdeniz University; Mustafa Kemal University; Zirve University,"Erdogan, M (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ, Fac Educ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",mmerdogan@gmail.com; ecoskun2002@yahoo.com; musaktr@gmail.com,"Usak, Muhammet/E-3176-2016; Erdogan, Mehmet/C-1269-2016","Usak, Muhammet/0000-0002-6537-9993; ",,,,,43,5,6,0,26,ANI YAYINCILIK,BAKANLIKLAR,"KIZILIRMAK SOK NO 10-A, BAKANLIKLAR, ANKARA 00000, TURKEY",1302-597X,2528-8911,,EURASIAN J EDUC RES,Eurasian J.

The fast integration version of a state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM), which shares the same physical and dynamical processes but with reduced horizontal resolution and increased time step, is usually developed. In this study, we configure a fast version of an atmospheric GCM (AGCM), the Grid Atmospheric Model of IAP/LASG (Institute of Atmospheric Physics/State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics), at low resolution (GAMIL-L, hereafter), and compare the simulation results with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and other data to examine its performance. GAMIL-L, which is derived from the original GAMIL, is a finite difference AGCM with 72 x 40 grids in longitude and latitude and 26 vertical levels. To validate the simulated climatology and variability, two runs were achieved. One was a 60-year control run with fixed climatological monthly sea surface temperature (SST) forcing, and the other was a 50-yr (1950-2000) integration with observational time-varying monthly SST forcing. Comparisons between these two cases and the reanalysis, including intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability are also presented. In addition, the differences between GAMIL-L and the original version of GAMIL are also investigated. The results show that GAMIL-L can capture most of the large-scale dynamical features of the atmosphere, especially in the tropics and mid latitudes, although a few deficiencies exist, such as the underestimated Hadley cell and thereby the weak strength of the Asia summer monsoon. However, the simulated mean states over high latitudes, especially over the polar regions, are not acceptable. Apart from dynamics, the thermodynamic features mainly depend upon the physical parameterization schemes. Since the physical package of GAMIL-L is exactly the same as the original high-resolution version of GAMIL, in which the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM2) physical package was used, there are only small differences between them in the precipitation and temperature fields. Because our goal is to develop a fast-running AGCM and employ it in the coupled climate system model of IAP/LASG for paleoclimate studies such as ENSO and Australia-Asia monsoon, particular attention has been paid to the model performances in the tropics. More model validations, such as those ran for the Southern Oscillation and South Asia monsoon, indicate that GAMIL-L is reasonably competent and valuable in this regard.","Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Wen, XY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",xywen@pku.edu.cn,"LI, Jian/E-3497-2018; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Wang, Bin/P-9121-2014; Wan, Hui/J-4701-2013; Wang, Bin/D-9724-2012","LI, Jian/0000-0001-7223-0022; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Wang, Bin/0000-0001-7374-3786; Wan, Hui/0000-0001-5294-4116; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-3133-7197",,,,,28,12,25,0,8,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

Typically microprocessors in current consumer devices and state-of-the-art data centers are cooled using relatively bulky air cooled heat sinks. The large size heat sinks are required due to the poor thermophysical properties of air. In order to compensate for the poor thermal properties of air, it is typical to use chillers to pre-cool the air below the ambient temperature before feeding it to the heat sinks. Operating the chillers requires additional power input thereby making the cooling process more expensive. The growing cooling demand of electronic components will, however, render these cooling techniques insufficient. Direct application of liquid-cooling on chip level using directly attached manifold microchannel heat sinks reduces conductive and convective resistances, resulting in the reduction of the thermal gradient needed to remove heat. Water is an inexpensive, nontoxic and widely available liquid coolant. Therefore, switching from air to water as coolant enables a much higher coolant inlet temperature without in any way compromising the cooling performance. In addition, it eliminates the need for chillers and allows the thermal energy to be reused. All these improvements lead to higher thermal efficiency and open up the possibility to perform electronic cooling with higher exergetic efficiency. The current work explores this concept using measurements and exergetic analyses of a manifold microchannel heat sink and a small scale, first of its kind, hot water cooled data center prototype. Through the measurements on the heat sink, it is demonstrated that the heat load in the state-of-the-art microprocessor chips can be removed using hot water with inlet temperature of 60 degrees C. Using hot water as coolant results in high coolant exergy content at the heat sink outlet. This facilitates recovering the energy typically wasted as heat in data centers, and can therefore result in data centers with minimal carbon footprint. The measurements on both the heat sink and the data center prototype strongly attest to this concept. Reuse strategies such as space heating and adsorption based refrigeration were tested as potential means to use the waste heat from data centers in different climates. Application-specific definitions of the value of waste heat were formulated as economic measures to evaluate potential benefits of various reuse strategies.","[Zimmermann, Severin; Tiwari, Manish K.; Poulikakos, Dimos] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",ETH Zurich,"Zimmermann, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",,"poulikakos, dimos/O-2853-2014; Tiwari, Manish K./F-2227-2011","poulikakos, dimos/0000-0001-5733-6478; Tiwari, Manish K./0000-0001-5143-6881",,,,,33,0,0,0,4,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4477-9,,,,2012,,,,,373,380,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BHC49,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000324956600046,View Full Record in Web of Science

Biotas in freshwater wetlands and floodplains, such as those in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB)-one of Australia's most impacted ecosystems, are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Here we present a comprehensive multilocus assessment of genetic variation in the threatened southern pygmy perch Nannoperca australis (578 individuals; 45 localities; microsatellite, allozyme and mitochondrial DNA datasets), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. We assess patterns of spatial structure and genetic diversity in populations spanning the highly fragmented MDB and test whether recent anthropogenic modification has disrupted range-wide connectivity. We detected strong and hierarchical population structure, very low genetic diversity and lack of contemporary gene flow across the MDB. In contrast, the apparent absence of pronounced or long-term phylogeographic structure suggests that observed population divergences generally do not reflect deeply historic natural fragmentation. Coalescent-based analyses supported this inference, revealing that divergence times between populations from the upper and lower MDB fall into the period of European settlement. It appears that the observed contemporary isolation of populations is partly explained by the severe modification of the MDB post-dating the onset of European settlement. Our integrated approach substantially improves the interpretation of how fragmentation impacts present-day biodiversity. It also provides novel contributions for risk-assessing management actions in the context of captive breeding and translocations of small freshwater fishes, a group of increasing global conservation concern.","[Cole, Theresa L.; Teske, Peter R.; Brauer, Chris J.; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Bedford, SA 5042, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.; Adams, Mark] South Australian Museum, Evolutionary Biol Unit, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, POB 4646, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia; [Unmack, Peter J.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol & Collaborat Res Network Murray Da, Bruce, ACT, Australia; [Teske, Peter R.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Zool, Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Adams, Mark] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Cole, Theresa L.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand",Flinders University South Australia; South Australian Museum; University of Canberra; University of Johannesburg; University of Adelaide; University of Otago,"Beheregaray, LB (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Bedford, SA 5042, Australia.",Luciano.Beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,"Beheregaray, Luciano/AAY-6384-2021; Unmack, Peter J./AAU-3023-2020; Beheregaray, Luciano B/A-8621-2008; Teske, Peter/B-1564-2019","Beheregaray, Luciano/0000-0003-0944-3003; Unmack, Peter J./0000-0003-1175-1152; Beheregaray, Luciano B/0000-0003-0944-3003; Teske, Peter/0000-0002-2838-7804; Hammer, Michael/0000-0002-0981-4647; Brauer, Chris/0000-0003-2968-5915; Cole, Theresa/0000-0002-0197-286X","Australian Research Council [LP100200409, FT130101068]; AJ & IM Naylon Honours scholarship",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); AJ & IM Naylon Honours scholarship,"We thank the many people who helped with fieldwork, and are grateful to Minami Sasaki and Jerald Johnson for laboratory assistance.

Intervention A whiteboard video tool was collaboratively developed by Rigolet youth, community members, the research team and key regional stakeholders to share public health recommendations for reducing the risk of AGI. The video debuted in Rigolet at a community event in August 2016 and was later provided online for community members and local and regional health departments. Interviews and focus group discussions were used to evaluate the ability of the video to communicate public health information to community members in Rigolet. Outcomes Community and government viewers reported that the whiteboard video was novel and engaging. Evaluation participants believed the video was suitable for promoting Inuit health because of the use of locally relevant visuals and narrative, which reflect Inuit art and storytelling traditions. Furthermore, participants indicated that the video co-development process was critical to ensuring community relevance of the video. Short-term outcome results suggest the video can reinforce health knowledge and potentially encourage behavioural change. Implications The results suggest this whiteboard video was an effective tool to share information and could increase intention to change behaviours to reduce the risk of AGI in Rigolet. While tools like the whiteboard video are gaining popularity, the participatory approach was used to develop the video, and its use in an Inuit context illustrates its innovation and novelty. This tool may be a useful health promotion tool among Indigenous communities in Canada.","[Saini, Manpreet; Roche, Steven; Papadopoulos, Andrew; Flowers, Charlie; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Roche, Steven] ACER Consulting Ltd, 103A-100 Stone Rd West, Guelph, ON N1G 5L3, Canada; [Markwick, Nicole] C4 Consulting, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Shiwak, Inez; Rigolet Inuit Community Govt] Rigolet Inuit Community Govt, Rigolet, NF A0P 1P0, Canada; [Wood, Michele] Nunatsiavut Govt, Dept Hlth & Social Dev, 200 Kelland Dr, Happy Valley Goose Bay, NF A0P 1C0, Canada; [Edge, Victoria L.] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, 160 Res Lane, Guelph, ON N1G 5B2, Canada; [Ford, James] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wright, Carlee; Harper, Sherilee L.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, 11405 87 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada",University of Guelph; Public Health Agency of Canada; University of Leeds; University of Alberta,"Saini, M (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Populat Med, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",sainim3@gmail.com,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Lwasa, Shuaib/E-8840-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Lwasa, Shuaib/0000-0003-4312-2836",Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health and Changing Environments; CIHR; SSHRC; NSERC; Arthur D.

However, rice yields remain relatively low, and large yield gaps exist. This Special Issue brings together agronomy research on rice-based farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and addresses three main, overarching questions: (1) what has been achieved in the past decades in terms of rice agronomy in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) what is the state-of-the-art regarding development of technologies and (3) what will be likely or required future directions? The broad topics included in this Special Issue are (1) yield trends and yield gap analyses, (2) soil & nutrient, water, weed and integrated crop management practices, (3) cropping systems, (4) genetic improvements, (5) crop simulation modeling, and (6) assessment of farmers' rice cultivation practices and the sustainability of these practices. The papers cover different sub-regions, from the Sahel to the highlands of Madagascar and three major rice growing environments (irrigated lowlands, rainfed lowlands, and rainfed uplands). In this paper we describe the major challenges in the rice production sector in sub-Saharan Africa and historical efforts on agronomy research, and we provide a short introduction and discussion on the papers presented in this Special Issue. This Special Issue arrives at six main recommendations. 1. There is a need to increase research and development efforts focusing on rainfed rice-based systems. 2. More attention needs to be paid to research on the farming system or landscape level, aimed at development of integrated cropping and farming systems and integrated agronomic solutions. 3. Current and future agronomic rice research should thematically center around sustainability, including judicious natural resources management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and conservation of biodiversity and environments. 4. To operationalize this, sustainability performance indicators need to be developed and used. 5. There is broad consensus regarding the need for more labor-saving technologies, including mechanization op-tions, provided these do not increase the ecological footprint of production systems. 6. Future rice agronomy research work should be interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary, to better address the myriad of challenges of smallholder farmers in Africa. Papers presented in this Special Issue should inform on the state-of-the art in rice agronomy in SSA, and on ways to sustainably enhance rice production and self-sufficiency in this region.","[Rodenburg, Jonne] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England; [Saito, Kazuki] Africa Rice Ctr AfricaRice, 01 BP 2551, Bouake 01, Cote Ivoire",University of Greenwich; CGIAR; Africa Rice Center,"Rodenburg, J (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England.",j.rodenburg@gre.ac.uk,"Rodenburg, Jonne/E-7015-2011","Rodenburg, Jonne/0000-0001-9059-9253",,,,,46,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

However, previous studies have focused on inorganic compounds and have not considered the potential effects of organic N sources. Here, we conducted a grassland experiment that included organic, inorganic N, and a mix of them at a ratio of 4:6, with two input rates, to study N inputs induced CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes, as well as the potential abiotic and biotic mechanisms driving the fluxes. We found that N compositions significantly affected fluxes each of the three GHGs. Greater organic N decreased the impacts of N addition on CO2 and N2O emissions, caused primarily by low rates of increase in substrates (soil available N) for production of CO2 and N2O resulting from high ammonia volatilization rather than changes in microbial activity. Also, greater organic N slightly stimulated CH4 uptake. Nitrogen composition effects on CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake were independent of N input rates and measurement dates, but N2O emissions showed stronger responses to inorganic N under high N addition and in June. These results suggest that future studies should consider the source of N to improve our prediction of future climate impact of N deposition, and that management of N fertilization can help mitigate GHG emissions.

Vegetation is proved to be effectively regulate microclimate. Living in Wuhan, residents have to suffer heat stress in summer and strong cold wind in winter simultaneously. It is necessary to dictate vegetation types and layout in residential area to get comfortable environment both in hot summer and cold winter. This study examined the vegetation influences of residential wind environment in hot and cold seasons by using the ENVI-met model V4. Field measurement validated the performance of ENVI-met model. The simulation was based on multi-story buildings representing the current primary form of residential area in Wuhan. 3 scenarios with three tree arrangements and 8 vegetation species were simulated. Height-to-distance ratio of trees (as Aspect ratio of trees, ART) was used to describe the tree distribution. Results showed that the impact of vegetation on both heat environment and ventilation depended on tree arrangement, LAI, crown width and tree height. The comparison of 3 tree distributions revealed that trees with an ART < 2 should be a priority to mitigate hot environments due to the large effects on PET reduction in summer. Evergreen species with an ART < 2 also effectively decreased wind speed in winter as well as blocked direct sunlight, resulting in negative effects on PET. Tall trees with a large LAI and canopy diameter should be a priority to improve the comfort of outdoor environments.","[Zhang, Li; Zhan, Qingming; Lan, Yuliang] Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, 8 Donghu South Road, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, 1Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li; Zhan, Qingming; Lan, Yuliang] Res Ctr Digital City, 8 Donghu South Rd, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li; Zhan, Qingming; Lan, Yuliang] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatiol Technol, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Huazhong Agricultural University,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Urban Design, 8 Donghu South Road, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhangli09@mail.hzau.edu.cn; qmzhan@whu.edu.cn; yulianglan@whu.edu.cn,"Zhan, Qingming/H-1553-2016","Zhan, Qingming/0000-0001-5619-6610",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51378399]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2014209020201],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51378399) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2014209020201).,,49,100,106,34,177,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

These consequences affect the rights of the local population, and favour global processes such as Climate Change. In light of this situation, numerous voices are calling for a slowdown in the growth of tourism. They are even calling for its degrowth. The strategy of the tourism sector has been to put forward discourses and actions aimed at preventing the application of limitations to its activity. This article focuses on an action promoted by the UNWTO: the aim to turn tourism into a human right. First, the text offers a critical analysis of what this idea is based on and the debate it has generated. It then investigates its motives. The work concludes that by legitimizing tourism as a supposed human right, it would allow the debate to centre on a conflict of rights (the right of the citizen as a tourist against the rights of the citizen as a resident of a territory or as a worker). Because a debate between rights always ends up in stalemate. This way, degrowth proposals in tourism would be neutralized.","[Gascon, Jordi] Univ Lleida, Dept Hist Art & Social Hist, Catalonia, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"Gascon, J (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, Dept Hist Art & Social Hist, Catalonia, Spain.",jordigascon@hahs.udl.cat,,"Gascon, Jordi/0000-0002-0947-614X",,,,,88,19,19,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Maintaining their high reliability constitutes a very important challenge, especially under the severely changing climate conditions. An overhead power line exposed to high ice and rime loads has been considered. Using the finite element method (FEM), mechanical reliability of the distribution infrastructure was examined under various atmospheric conditions. Loads under the stressful conditions of rime, ice and wind were determined for the weakest section of the 30 kV overhead line, which consisted of concrete poles and ACSR conductors. SAIDI and SAIFI reliability indices and costs were determined for several variants of object reconstruction. The results allowed for determination of a solution relying on relocating the cables of all lateral branches and main line ice protection, through a system based on a weather-coordinated increase of the electrical load. To verify the solution proposed, a field experiment was conducted. The experiment confirmed the effectiveness of the solution proposed that appears to be universal.

In Icelandic terrestrial soils the tephra record may cover the last 9000-10000 years, depending on deglaciation and ensuing sea level changes. In lacustrine sediments it may extend into the Lateglacial and in marine sediments the record is much longer. Explosive volcanic eruptions comprise a substantial part of Holocene volcanism in Iceland. The majority are explosive hydromagmatic basaltic eruptions due to the presence of ice and water in volcanic areas. Out of about 200 eruptions in the past I I centuries, verified by eruption products or trustworthy written accounts, some 130 left tephra layer as the only product and another 25 eruptions produced substantial tephra deposits in addition to lava flows. Four out of every five tephra layers were of basaltic composition. The great majority of explosive Holocene eruptions it? Iceland have taken place within the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ), partly because of its numerous central volcanoes and partly because ice caps cover substantial parts of the EVZ. The major producers of basaltic tephra are the Grimsvotn, Veioivotn. and Katla volcanic systems, with the highest eruption frequency in the Grimsvotn system. The largest explosive eruptions on these systems have uncompacted volumes of similar to 5 km(3) to >10 km(3), reaching VEI-index of 5 to 6. The major producer of silicic tephra is the Hekla central volcano. The largest Hekla tephra layers have uncompacted volumes of similar to 2 km(3) to >10 km(3) (Volcanic Explosive Index 5 and 6). In addition to applications in volcanology, tephra markers art, an invaluable dating toot in studies of environmental changes. The four largest Hekla tephra layers form the backbone of the Icelandic tephrochronology and art, also important mid- to late Holocene marker tephras on the shelf off North Iceland. The similar to 10350 year old Saksunarvatn tephra from the Grimsvotn system is an important early Holocene marker tephra on the sheaf off North and West Iceland. Among recent achievements of land-sea correlation of tephra layers is the detection of significant climate related changes in palaeoceanography through Holocene time indicating reconfiguration of the oceanic Polar Front separating cold Arctic and warmer Atlantic surface water masses north of Iceland.","[Larsen, Guorun; Eiriksson, Jon] Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Larsen, G (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",glare@raunvis.hi.is; jeir@hi.is,"Eiriksson, Jon/J-4262-2014","Eiriksson, Jon/0000-0001-5598-2417","RANNIS [9547 10097 981820098, 050261031]; RANNIS-JULES VERNE; HOLSMEER [EVK2-CT-2000-00060]; PACLIVA [EVK2 2001-00223]; EU; 6th Framework Programme [SUST DEV-2004-3.1.41]; Millennium project [017008-2]",RANNIS; RANNIS-JULES VERNE; HOLSMEER(European Commission); PACLIVA; EU(European Commission); 6th Framework Programme(European Commission); Millennium project,"This review contributes information compiled during various projects in which the authors have participated.

To this end, state-of-the-art computing architectures are leveraged against the extremely difficult problem of mathematically modeling and predicting the behavior of a variety of ocean climatological parameters. The problem at hand is the technology to store, retrieve, manipulate, and display these data has not kept pace with the computational technology. During the last five years, we have seen significant cost reductions associated with applying the status quo in visualization techniques to scientific data sets. This is due in large part to the computer gaming industry, driven by the huge profit margins associated with that market. The scientific community has benefited by these advances in low-cost architectures, but only as a by-product of its original intent, which is entertainment. Even so, these low-cost architectures are not designed to handle the scale of data sizes presented by the scientific community and serve only to make inadequate techniques cheaper to field and use. The Naval Oceanographic Office Major Shared Resource Center (NAVO MSRC) Visualization Center is challenged with providing its users state-of-the-art analysis environments for the interrogation of their increasingly large data sets. This paper deals with the data generated by the CWO community, all of whom work with large domains and high resolutions (either vertically, horizontally, or both) that all vary over time. This leads to very large data sets (rows x columns x layers x attribute per cell) for each time step and can challenge even the most powerful architectures when trying to extract or mine information from the raw data. As in most visualization applications, the model output deals with physical parameters that are invisible to the naked eye. This means effective methods of display are required for ocean circulation or currents, sea surface height, temperature, salinity, and so on. One analogy, which no doubt started the concept of data mining, is that the raw data represent a huge block of ore from which gold nuggets of valuable information (features) must be extracted or mined. This paper concerns the technical solutions that were built to solve the challenges described above, including algorithms, data descriptions, and formats.","USN, Oceanog Off, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39522 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy,"Gruzinskas, P (corresponding author), USN, Oceanog Off, 1002 Balch Blvd, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39522 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-7534-3,,,,2002,,,,,751,755,,,,,,5,"Acoustics; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Acoustics; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BW53J,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000182293200120,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we assess the severity and spatial extent of the extreme drought years 2005, 2010 and 2015/16 in the Amazon region and their impacts on the regional carbon cycle. As an indicator of drought stress in the Amazon rainforest, we use the widely applied maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD). Evaluating nine state-of-the-art precipitation datasets for the Amazon region, we find that the spatial extent of the drought in 2005 ranges from 2.2 to 3.0 (mean = 2.7) x 10(6) km(2) (37 %-51 % of the Amazon basin, mean = 45 %), where MCWD indicates at least moderate drought conditions (relative MCWD anomaly < 0 :5). In 2010, the affected area was about 16% larger, ranging from 3.0 up to 4.4 (mean = 3.6) x10(6) km(2) (51 %-74 %, mean = 61 %). In 2016, the mean area affected by drought stress was between 2005 and 2010 (mean D 3.2 x 10(6) km(2); 55% of the Amazon basin), but the general disagreement between datasets was larger, ranging from 2.4 up to 4.1 x 10(6) km(2) (40 %-69 %). In addition, we compare differences and similarities among datasets using the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) and a dry-season rainfall anomaly index (RAI). We find that scPDSI shows a stronger and RAI a much weaker drought impact in terms of extent and severity for the year 2016 compared to MCWD. We further investigate the impact of varying evapotranspiration on the drought indicators using two state-of-the-art evapotranspiration datasets. Generally, the variability in drought stress is most dependent on the drought indicator (60 %), followed by the choice of the precipitation dataset (20 %) and the evapotranspiration dataset (20 %). Using a fixed, constant evapotranspiration rate instead of variable evapotranspiration can lead to an overestimation of drought stress in the parts of Amazon basin that have a more pronounced dry season (for example in 2010). We highlight that even for well-known drought events the spatial extent and intensity can strongly depend upon the drought indicator and the data sources it is calculated with. Using only one data source and drought indicator has the potential danger of under- or overestimating drought stress in regions with high measurement uncertainty, such as the Amazon basin.","[Papastefanou, Phillip; Angelov, Zlatan; Rammig, Anja] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Zang, Christian S.] Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Dept Forestry, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [de Castro, Aline Anderson; Campos De Rezende, Luiz Felipe; Von Randow, Celso] Natl Inst Spatial Res, Earth Syst Sci Ctr, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Carlos Jimenez, Juan] Univ Valencia, GCU IPL, Valencia, Spain; [Ruscica, Romina C.; Sorensson, Anna A.; Vera, Carolina] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ruscica, Romina C.; Sorensson, Anna A.; Vera, Carolina] Univ Buenos Aires, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera CIMA, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ruscica, Romina C.; Sorensson, Anna A.; Vera, Carolina] UBA, Inst Franco Argentino Estudio Clima & Impactos, IRL IFAECI 3351, CNRS,IRD,CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sakschewski, Boris; Thonicke, Kirsten] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Leibniz Assoc, Telegrafenberg A31, Potsdam, Germany; [Viovy, Nicolas] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, LSCE, CEA, Saclay, France",Technical University of Munich; University of Valencia; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Papastefanou, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",papa@tum.de,"Ruscica, Romina/AAY-9900-2021","Ruscica, Romina/0000-0003-0127-9579; Thonicke, Kirsten/0000-0001-5283-4937; Castro, Aline Anderson de/0000-0003-0318-6536; Papastefanou, Phillip/0000-0002-4613-2565; Rezende, Luiz Felipe Campos de/0000-0003-2569-9797",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01LP1610A],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research has been supported by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (grant no. 01LP1610A).,,92,1,1,9,9,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,24-Aug,2022,16,,,,3843,3861,,10.5194/bg-19-3843-2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3843-2022,,,19,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,3Y3TA,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000843648000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is limited scholarly understanding about how these processes work as children age. The case of environmental behavior offers the opportunity to interrogate these processes. I use reflective interviews with 40 participants in the 2014 People's Climate March in New York to understand how the socialization of environmental behavior in childhood shapes their perceptions of the processes of identity formation related to participation in the environmental movement. I argue that environmental movement behavior is facilitated by the development of compatible identity standards during childhood. I find that four processes-nature experiences, witnessing degradation, parental modeling, and school experiences-influence participation in environmental movement behavior in adulthood. My results highlight varied ways that behavior in adulthood can be facilitated through the shaping of identity standards over the life course.

This continued supply and use, despite strong evidence of negative impacts, is not unique to chemicals management. In the field of climate change, the concept of lock-in has been used to explain the complex interactions among economic, social, technological, and political dynamics that reinforce global reliance on the extraction and use of fossil fuels. Learning from carbon lock-in phenomena, this Perspective explores the challenges of chemicals management from the perspective of lock-in through three case studies: paraquat, perfluoroodanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and asbestos. These case studies illustrate that most current chemicals management frameworks fail to address the concerns arising from this complex interplay by not involving all relevant stakeholder groups that are part of lock-in, from producers to consumers. This results in a relatively narrow consideration (e.g., only demand but not supply) of the effectiveness and consequences of regulations. We submit that to break lock-in and address the global threat of chemical pollution, current approaches to managing hazardous chemicals should be broadened to take a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing factors contributing to lock-in, notably both supply and demand on national and international scales.","[Blumenthal, Jonathan; Diamond, Miriam L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada; [Diamond, Miriam L.] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada; [Hoffmann, Matthew] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Hoffmann, Matthew] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON M5S 0A7, Canada; [Wang, Zhanyun] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Ecol Syst Design, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wang, Zhanyun] Empa Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Technol & Soc Lab, CH-9014 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Wang, ZY (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Ecol Syst Design, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.;Wang, ZY (corresponding author), Empa Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Technol & Soc Lab, CH-9014 St Gallen, Switzerland.",Zhanyun.wang@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Diamond, Miriam L/D-1770-2013","Diamond, Miriam L/0000-0001-6296-6431",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Studentship (Undergraduate) Grant through the University of Toronto [72062774],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Studentship (Undergraduate) Grant through the University of Toronto,"Support for J.B. was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Studentship (Under-graduate) Grant through the University of Toronto (UTEA, Funded Research No. 72062774) .

These issues can influence climate change and human health. Building facades can play a significant role in the air quality of the urban environment. Therefore, this study draws upon the ability of nature in controlling carbon dioxide to compare three types of bio-facades (i.e. Water facade, Green facade, and Microalgae facade) and to identify an appropriate one. For this purpose, we analyzed documents and scientific literature qualitatively. Then, we identified the aforementioned types of biological facades and selected the most optimal one through the comparison. Additionally, for this comparison, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed that resulted in achieving the higher scores by the microalgae facade among other bio-facades mentioned above. The major criteria considered for the AHP analysis included climatic, economic, architectural, environmental, and structural aspects of using the noted bio-facades in buildings. It should be emphasized that the environmental aspect was obtained as the most influential criterion among others.

While much emphasis has been placed on biological factors, particularly algal blooms, contributing to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, there has been little focus on the role of weather. For this study, we monitored water temperature and DO concentrations at sites in the western, central, and Sandusky basins in Lake Erie during June and July 2010-2012. We then compared trends in stratification and DO concentrations to weather patterns during that period. We found that during those three years, there was significant variation in weather patterns, particularly decreased ice coverage and increased storm events in 2012. These weather patterns corresponded to 2012 having the warmest water temperatures, some of the lowest DO concentrations, and a deeper and thinner hypolimnion (especially in the central basin) than the previous years. We found a relationship between weather and hypoxia, providing further evidence for why these basins are susceptible to low DO conditions during summer months. The role of weather in hypoxia is another indication that the lake is vulnerable to effects of climate change and should be considered in management strategies.","[Perello, Melanie M.; Kane, Douglas D.; Golnick, Phoenix; Hughes, Maya C.; Thomas, Matt A.] Ohio State Univ, Franz Theodore Stone Lab, Put In Bay, OH 43456 USA; [Kane, Douglas D.] Defiance Coll, Nat Sci & Math Div, Defiance, OH 43512 USA; [Conroy, Joseph D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Limnol Lab, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Perello, Melanie M.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Golnick, Phoenix] Ohio Dept Transportat, 317 East Poe Rd, Bowling Green, OH 43402 USA; [Hughes, Maya C.] LOreal USA, 7080 New Buffington Rd, Florence, KY 41042 USA; [Conroy, Joseph D.] Ohio Dept Nat Resources, Inland Fisheries Res Unit, Div Wildlife, 10517 Canal Rd SE, Hebron, OH 43025 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Defiance College; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Ohio Department of Natural Resources,"Perello, MM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Franz Theodore Stone Lab, Put In Bay, OH 43456 USA.;Perello, MM (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",mperello@iupui.edu; dkane@defiance.edu; phoenix.golnick@dot.ohio.gov; mxhughes@us.loreal.com; thomas.347@osu.edu; joseph.conroy@dnr.state.oh.us,"Conroy, Joseph David/C-4463-2008; Kane, Douglas D./H-4345-2019","Conroy, Joseph David/0000-0002-9561-7294; Perello, Melanie/0000-0003-2517-3947",Friends of Stone Laboratory (FOSL) through the Ohio State University,Friends of Stone Laboratory (FOSL) through the Ohio State University,"We thank F.

As part of a multiyear investigation into the impacts of wildfires on permafrost, we have collected in situ measurements of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) response of the active layer and permafrost in a variety of soil conditions, types, and saturations. In this paper, we summarize the NMR data and present quantitative relationships between active layer and permafrost liquid water content and pore sizes and show the efficacy of borehole NMR (bNMR) to permafrost studies.

Various factors have facilitated the switch from conventional fuel-based vehicles to EVs, such as electricity currently being cheaper than conventional fuels, lower cost of maintenance, the government provided subsidies and better safety since they have a lower centre of gravity. A significant component of EVs is the battery. The market leader of the same is Li-ion batteries in view of their excellent advantages in terms of longevity, low maintenance cost, and high power to weight ratio. However, Li-ion batteries have a higher initial cost due to the raw materials used in the production, high carbon footprint generated due to mining of raw materials required, a limited range of operating conditions that need to be maintained and humanitarian concerns associated with Cobalt mining. Due to these factors, there is a need to come up with alternatives for Li-ion batteries. In this work, a comprehensive energy and cost analysis is carried out on integrating the emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies with state-of-the-art battery alternatives in EVs, thus targeting lower carbon footprint levels. On the same lines, the analysis takes into consideration numerous external factors such as location, climate, and photovoltaic efficiency of various PV modules. Our results indicate that third-generation photovoltaics holds tremendous economic potential and provide a good return on their investment to consumers around the globe.

We analyze solar observations acquired over a 3 yr period during the decline of Carrington Cycle 24 to test models of RV variation of Sun-like stars. A purpose-built solar telescope at the High Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) provides disk-integrated solar spectra, from which we extract RVs and log R'(HK). The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provides disk-resolved images of magnetic activity. The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) provides near-continuous solar photometry, analogous to a Kepler light curve. We verify that the SORCE photometry and HARPS-N log R'(HK) correlate strongly with the SDO-derived magnetic filling factor, while the HARPS-N RV variations do not. To explain this discrepancy, we test existing models of RV variations. We estimate the contributions of the suppression of convective blueshift and the rotational imbalance due to brightness inhomogeneities to the observed HARPS-N RVs. We investigate the time variation of these contributions over several rotation periods, and how these contributions depend on the area of active regions. We find that magnetic active regions smaller than 60 Mm(2) do not significantly suppress convective blueshift. Our area-dependent model reduces the amplitude of activity-induced RV variations by a factor of two. The present study highlights the need to identify a proxy that correlates specifically with large, bright magnetic regions on the surfaces of exoplanet-hosting stars.","[Milbourne, T.

The life in the garden of Eden as well as outside it is depicted by Dolezal in the mode of an idyll, in the narrative and semi-dramatic (dialogue) form, which reflects human desire for a peaceful, non-conflicting and balanced being. Dolezal's idyll lies in the optimistic and positive concept of the world. By using the conventional biblical as well as non-biblical emblems (rivers, trees, flora, fauna and pleasant climate, natural resouces) the garden of Eden is presented as a lovely place (locus amoenus). In this carefully and efficiently organized space, full of beauty, Adam and Eve lead a harmonious life. Despite the fact they leave the paradise and face a radical change trading peaceful and carefree lives for hard and arduous work and pain, Dolezal's narration does not lose its idyllic tone. He lists the consequences of their sin which separated the ancestors from God, however, he considers the, new world to be better: God let the sin happen in order to show the, beauty of infinite virtues. The sin brought about numberless benefits: new social and political structures, various occupations, the possibility of education and art, technological progress. While in the first part Dolezal speaks of the world which the reader could never see, the depicted earthly world is to a great extent dependent on the space and time in which the author lived himself.","[Brtanova, Erika] Trnavskej Univ, Filozof Fak, Katedra Dejin & Teor Umenia, Hornopotocna 23, Trnava 91700, Slovakia",University of Trnava,"Brtanova, E (corresponding author), Trnavskej Univ, Filozof Fak, Katedra Dejin & Teor Umenia, Hornopotocna 23, Trnava 91700, Slovakia.",erika.brtanova@truni.sk,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,0,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST SLOVAK LITERATURE",BRATISLAVA,"KONVENTNA 13, BRATISLAVA, 81364, SLOVAKIA",0037-6973,,,SLOV LIT,Slov.

Our initial implementation primarily focuses on a rural city in Bihar, a state which experiences erratic rainfall behavior. We start with simpler models based on time-series analysis and linear regression, ultimately combining them using a novel look back-window method. The initial results are promising and comparable with the state-of-the-art methods published in this domain. It is conjectured that atmospheric pressure and winds are highly correlated to rainfall, and we are trying to obtain data for the same to use in our model. In addition, we wish to extend the work to predict droughts as well. Observing and analyzing the changes in the crop yield based on the precipitation is also something we intend to do. India is so powerless against environmental change is on the grounds that it is a vast nation with numerous living in destitution, deficient base, and is subjected to unpredictable rainstorm, flooding, rising ocean levels, and higher temperatures. The rainstorm season is essential to the Indian economy in light of the fact that numerous Indians are agrarian. Thusly India's rainstorm will radically influence the destiny of the agrarian segment and the general population dependant on it. Environmental change is going to keep on creating whimsical extremes all through the storm season. Readiness for climate inconsistencies achieved by environmental change is along these lines key to ensure the lives of the Indian individuals and the development of the Indian economy.","[Lakshmaiah, K.] JNTUH, Hyderabad, Andhra Prades, India; [Krishna, Murali S.] SVCE, Dept CSE, Tirupati, Andhra Prades, India; [Reddy, Eswara B.] JNTUA Coll Engn, Dept CSE, Kalikiri, India",Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Hyderabad; Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Anantapur; JNTUA College of Engineering Anantapur,"Lakshmaiah, K (corresponding author), JNTUH, Hyderabad, Andhra Prades, India.",klakshmaiah78@gmail.com; muralikrishna.s@svcolleges.edu.in; eswarcsejntua@gmail.com,"B, Eswara reddy/AAB-9640-2020",,,,,,5,1,1,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-4697-3,,,,2016,,,,,233,237,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BH9YR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000404444000047,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, the performance of a state-of-the-art single-column boundary layer model is evaluated with observations from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99) field experiment. Very high model resolution in the atmosphere and the soil is utilized to represent three different stable boundary layer archetypes, namely, a fully turbulent night, an intermittently turbulent night, and a radiative night with hardly any turbulence (all at clear skies). Each archetype represents a different class of atmospheric stability. In the current model, the atmosphere is fully coupled to a vegetation layer and the underlying soil. In addition, stability functions (local scaling) are utilized based on in situ observations. Overall it is found that the vertical structure, the surface fluxes (apart from the intermittent character) and the surface temperature in the stable boundary layer can be satisfactorily modeled for a broad stability range (at a local scale) with the current understanding of the physics of the stable boundary layer. This can also be achieved by the use of a rather detailed coupling between the atmosphere and the underlying soil and vegetation, together with high resolution in both the atmosphere and the soil. This is especially true for the very stable nights, when longwave radiative cooling is dominant. Both model outcome and observations show that in the latter case the soil heat flux is a dominant term of the surface energy budget.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Meteorol & Air Qual Grp, NL-6701 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Steeneveld, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Meteorol & Air Qual Grp, Duivendaal 2, NL-6701 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",Gert-Jan.Steeneveld@wur.nl,"Holtslag, Bert/HCH-1861-2022; Holtslag, Albert A.M./B-7842-2010; Steeneveld, Gert-Jan/B-2816-2010","Holtslag, Albert A.M./0000-0003-0995-2481; Steeneveld, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-5922-8179",,,,,87,92,94,1,18,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-4928,1520-0469,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

Based on the characteristics analysis of the five materials, it can be concluded that biochar can comprehensively improve the road performance of asphalt and its mixtures, and has the potential of runoff purification; bio-oil can soften asphalt and improve its low-temperature performance, but has negative effects on high-temperature performance; lignin increases the asphalt ageing resistance and can be used as a regenerant, and will improve the overall performance of asphalt mixtures if combined with other modifiers; wood ash can increase subgrade bearing capacity and bring significant environmental benefits; nanocellulose improves the strength of cement mortar, but there is a lack of research on its effects on performance of pavement materials and the interaction mechanism; the lifecycle environmental and economic assessment of woody biomass-modified road materials is not comprehensive. Moreover, prospects were also summarized to show the opportunities for future study, such as the establishment of a database for biomass. This review provides useful insights for the utilization of woody biomass as road materials to achieve waste management and sustainable development.","[Zhang, Xue; Li, Hui; Liu, Jiawen] Tongji Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Minist Educ, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Harvey, John T.; Butt, Ali A.] Univ Calif Davis, Pavement Res Ctr, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Jia, Ming] Tongji Univ, Urban Mobil Inst, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China",Tongji University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Tongji University,"Li, H (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Minist Educ, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.",hli@tongji.edu.cn,"Butt, Ali Azhar/J-6116-2015","Butt, Ali Azhar/0000-0002-4270-8993",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1600100]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [22120210027],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB1600100), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 22120210027).",,112,1,1,17,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",,2631-4428,,TRANSP SAFETY ENV,Transp.

The Brazilian bee fauna has been surveyed intensively since the late 1960s, but the state-of-the-art of this research topic has not been explored in detail. Our main goal is to analyze the scientific literature through a systematic review of Brazilian bee surveys, describing (i) spatial sampling gaps; (ii) preferred sampling frequency and methods; (iii) species identification and vouchering practices; (iv) gender participation; and (v) how the studies are distributed among scientific journals. Our review includes 213 published studies, of which half targeted the entire bee fauna (Apoidea: Apidae sensu lato) while the other half targeted the orchid bees (Euglossini). Sampling sites are predominant in eastern Brazil, particularly within the Atlantic Forest. Hand netting bees for 1 year long was the most frequent sampling protocol to capture bees. Taxonomic identification and voucher deposition practices were mentioned in most of the papers. Men and women published almost the same number of papers, but women were less frequent as lead or senior authors and appeared less as prolific researchers. Most papers were published in a few Brazilian journals. We highlight that surveys in understudied areas are needed, especially in Amazon. Monitoring bees in previously surveyed locations is also encouraged to investigate temporal changes in bee assemblages, such as population declines, impacts of land-use changes, and effects of climate change.","[Pereira, Felipe Walter; Goncalves, Rodrigo Barbosa] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, Lab Abelhas, Setor Ciencias Biol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Ramos, Kelli dos Santos] Univ Sao Paulo, Museu Zool, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Pereira, FW (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, Lab Abelhas, Setor Ciencias Biol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",felip3walter@gmail.com,,"Walter Pereira, Felipe/0000-0002-0888-8804",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico -Brazil (CNPq) [400580/2018-7],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico -Brazil (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"We thank Prof. Dr. Gabriel A.

Renewable technologies represent a key option to meet the greenhouse energy demands. Agrivoltaics has recently emerged as a strategy to combine farming activity and power generation through photovoltaics (PV). However, PV systems retrofitting needs to consider the interactions with the existing greenhouse structure, as well as the energy requirements of the equipment for climate control. The influences of PV shading on agronomic parameters have also to be carefully considered. Firstly, this review examines the response of plants to the light and the fundamental aspects of greenhouse facilities. Then, the state-of-the-art of PV systems applied to greenhouses is thoroughly analysed. Simulation studies and experimental works are examined to highlight the effects of PV technologies and module arrangements on energy production and plant growth. Particular attention is devoted to new PV technologies, i.e. organic, dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells, because of their semi-transparency and flexibility, allowing the easy integration of PV modules into existing or newly conceived greenhouse structures. The review has highlighted that the new PV technologies have an enormous potential due to the possibility of tuning their spectral features according to the characteristics of plants and to the capability of optimizing the use of solar energy into high-tech greenhouses. Shading through these innovative systems has also demonstrated to create a suitable atmosphere for crop growth especially in hot and tropical regions.","[La Notte, Luca; Giordano, Lorena; Puglisi, Giovanni] Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Energy & Sustainable Econ Dev ENEA, Energy Efficiency Unit Dept, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [La Notte, Luca; Calabro, Emanuele; Bedini, Roberto; Reale, Andrea] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Elect Engn, CHOSE Ctr Hybrid & Organ Solar Energy, Via Politecn 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Colla, Giuseppe] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr & Forest Sci DAFNE, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Tuscia University,"La Notte, L (corresponding author), Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Energy & Sustainable Econ Dev ENEA, Energy Efficiency Unit Dept, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy.;La Notte, L; Reale, A (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Elect Engn, CHOSE Ctr Hybrid & Organ Solar Energy, Via Politecn 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",luca.lanotte@enea.it; reale@ing.uniroma2.it,"Giordano, Lorena/CAF-7769-2022; La Notte, Luca/L-2729-2019","Giordano, Lorena/0000-0002-3097-686X; La Notte, Luca/0000-0001-9234-5804; Calabro, Emanuele/0000-0002-9627-1176","Lazio Region project COPPER - Progetto di Gruppo di Ricerca finanziato ai sensi della L.R.

Deep saline aquifers are the most accessible geological locations for safe CO2 sequestration, where CO2 can be securely trapped mostly by structural and capillary trapping mechanisms. The efficiency of both mechanisms is governed by multiphase flow characteristics that are heavily dependent on interfacial tension (IFT) between the gaseous and aqueous phases. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven study on the interfacial tension of pure and impure gas-brine mixtures within saline aquifers. We carefully collect 2517 experimental data, upon which we develop seven machine-learning based models for predicting the IFT. These include, namely, four differently optimized multilayer perceptron models, a radial basis function neural network, a least squares support vector machine, and a group method of data handling-type neural network. The three most accurate intelligent models are subsequently incorporated into a state-of-the-art committee machine intelligent system. We use a pseudo (average) critical temperature variable to capture the gas phase impurities while developing a general-in-purpose predictive tool for any gas mixture. We comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and statistical validity of our models, and demonstrate their robustness relative to major empirical correlations currently in use. The analyses reveal the non-trivial behavior of IFT against various parameters. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gas and brine impurities on the storage capacity of saline aquifers at various in-situ conditions.","[Amooie, Mohammad Amin] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hemmati-Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein] Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Dept Petr Engn, Kerman, Iran; [Karan, Kunal; Husein, Maen M.] Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Soltanian, Mohamad Reza] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Dabir, Bahram] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Dabir, Bahram] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Petr Engn, Tehran, Iran",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK); University of Calgary; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Amirkabir University of Technology; Amirkabir University of Technology,"Hemmati-Sarapardeh, A (corresponding author), Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Dept Petr Engn, Kerman, Iran.;Husein, MM (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Calgary, AB, Canada.",hemmati@uk.ac.ir; mhusein@ucalgary.ca,"Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein Hemmati/M-5047-2019","Sarapardeh, Abdolhossein Hemmati/0000-0002-5889-150X; Soltanian, Reza/0000-0002-5126-0668",,,,,121,21,21,8,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-5836,1878-0148,,INT J GREENH GAS CON,Int.

Political gridlock has destroyed Washington's ability to create sensible policy for reforming the medical marketplace, creating chaos for providers. Fortunately, chaos creates opportunity. The idea of creating one's future has never been more relevant and necessary. Materials and Methods: Predicting the science of extrapolating future values from historical data is not a valid method for looking ahead when causal relationships that explained change in the past are themselves being redefined (the current situation). Forecasting the art of estimating probabilities of possibilities is the appropriate method for anticipating futures when causality is being redefined. With its focus on identifying, a range of possibilities, forecasting identifies many different outcomes that are simultaneously possible for radiology. Results: Health care's new climate is being shaped by four defining trends: 1) revolution in biological science that is shifting caregivers' mission from acute care to disease management; 2) proliferation of information and communications technologies that are transforming the way care is delivered; 3) end of economic growth in the medical marketplace that is reshaping demand for care; and 4) political dysfunction that forces caregivers and their business partners to develop successful futures on their own. Conclusions: Radiology 3.0 is nicely aligned with the transformational trends. Staying focused on implementing Radiology 3.0 is supported as the optimal strategy for creating the profession's futures. Diagnostic convergence, establishing a unified diagnostic science with laboratory medicine, is proposed as a Complementary initiative.","[Bauer, Jeffrey C.] Qaelum, Leuven, Belgium",,"Bauer, JC (corresponding author), 1137 Minocqua Crescent, Madison, WI 53705 USA.;Bauer, JC (corresponding author), Qaelum, Leuven, Belgium.",jeffreycbauer@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1546-1440,,,J AM COLL RADIOL,J.

One of such data analysis task in dynamic environment is to design an incremental classifier for decision making and consequently updating the knowledge base of the overall system. Classifier construction depicts extraction of interesting patterns from the large repository of data and predicts the future trends based on the existing patterns. The time complexity of the classification system increases gradually and the system becomes inefficient while it is learned repeatedly for adding new group of data with the existing one in a certain interval of time. Without learning the same classifier for the whole data, if the knowledge of old data extracted by the classifier is used together with the new group of data to design the updated classifier, called incremental classifier, then time complexity reduces drastically. In the paper, the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization technique and Association Rule Mining are used to design an incremental rule based classification system. The incremental classifier is suitable to apply on rice disease dataset for disease prediction as the characteristics of rice diseases change in time due to change of climate, biological, and geographical factors. The proposed method has been applied on both simulated rice disease dataset and benchmark datasets and the classification accuracy is measured and compared with various state of the art classification algorithms. The method is also evaluated based on some statistical measures and statistical test is done to establish its significance and effectiveness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The major interest covers heat, air and moisture simulation of wind-driven rain-(WDR) exposed multi-story timber-based building envelopes (over their entire cross-section). While available moisture-safety concepts are often rule based with limited performance-oriented parts and are limited to small-scale housing, further exploration involves exposure of tall facades. State-of-the-art research compiles WDR examinations and available field and laboratory data as well as monitoring and simulation results. That is followed by evaluations of simulation methods at a best practice wall cross-section with the aim of examining the sensitivity and uncertainty of different parameters in relation to outdoor climate. This approach is chosen to discern the complex relations between exposure and vulnerability and the number of different facade detailing. The findings hold a categorization model of facade cross-sections that is used for risk analysis to describe moisture impact and reaction of functional layer groups. Furthermore, all WDR models and measured data show a high level of uncertainty and simulation results are strongly dependent on that input. An additional consideration of deficiencies and WDR penetration into the core layer of the facade shows only vague results of moisture accumulation. Under these circumstances failure modes of structural members are hard to determine. Therefore, this research is ongoing with a focus on more suitable exposure parameters and calibration of simulation methods for tall timber facades.","[Ott, Stephan; Tietze, Andrea; Winter, Stefan] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Chair Timber Struct & Bldg Construct, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Ott, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Chair Timber Struct & Bldg Construct, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",ott@tum.de,"Ott, Stephan/N-6862-2016; Ott, Stephan/S-2121-2019","Ott, Stephan/0000-0002-6760-869X; Ott, Stephan/0000-0002-6760-869X",,,,,24,5,5,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-0272,1748-0280,,WOOD MATER SCI ENG,Wood Mater.

This zonal sharpness is notable because atmospheric disturbances smaller than the planetary scale can interact with the planetary-scale Walker circulation through this branch. This zonal sharpness is also imprinted on a unique zonal discontinuity of the tropical rain belt above Northeast Africa. Therefore, we refer to this narrow downward branch as the Wall, investigate its climatology and interannual variability, and aim at determining its reason for existence. The strongest season of the lower tropospheric Wall in boreal summer is sustained by horizontal cold advection associated with the Asian Summer Monsoon, whereas another peak in boreal spring is explained by the seasonal migration of zonal winds. Two weak phases of the Wall correspond to two rainy seasons at the Eastern Horn of Africa, which are not reproduced well by the state-of-the-art global climate models. Experiments using a convection-permitting atmospheric model show that vertical mixing forced by mountain waves in East Africa is necessary for sustaining the Wall. After flattening the East African topography, zonal discontinuity of the tropical rain belt disappears. As for interannual variability, one standard deviation variability of vertical motions at the Wall is associated with one degree of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific, and the relationship is strongest in boreal autumn. Nevertheless, total variance is explained more by sea surface temperature in the tropical Indian Ocean.","[Kohyama, Tsubasa] Ochanomizu Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Suematsu, Tamaki] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Miura, Hiroaki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Takasuka, Daisuke] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Ochanomizu University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Kohyama, T (corresponding author), Ochanomizu Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",tsubasa@is.ocha.ac.jp,"Kohyama, Tsubasa/Q-6214-2017","Kohyama, Tsubasa/0000-0002-5606-2062; Suematsu, Tamaki/0000-0002-9146-4710; Takasuka, Daisuke/0000-0002-9321-6403","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)-Kakenhi [19K23460, 20K14554]; JSPS-Kakenhi [16J07769, 20H05730, 21K13991, 16H04048, 20H05729, 20J00605, 20H05728]; University of Tokyo through the HPCI System Research Project [hp210085]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)-Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS-Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); University of Tokyo through the HPCI System Research Project","T.

To compete with current vapor compression cycle refrigerators, the thermoelectric performance of materials needs to be improved. However, improving thermoelectric performance is challenging because of the trade-off relationship between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that decreasing conductivity effective mass by engineering the shape of the Fermi surface pocket (non-parabolicity factor) can decouple electrical conductivity from the Seebeck coefficient. The effect of engineering the non-parabolicity factor was shown by calculating the electronic transport properties of a state-of-the-art Bi-Sb-Te ingot via two-band model with varying non-parabolicity. The power factor (the product of the Seebeck coefficient squared and electrical conductivity) was calculated to be improved because of enhanced electrical conductivity, with an approximately constant Seebeck coefficient, using a non-parabolicity factor other than unity. Engineering the non-parabolicity factor to achieve lighter conductivity effective mass can improve the electronic transport properties of thermoelectric materials because it only improves electrical conductivity without decreasing the Seebeck coefficient (which is directly proportional to the band mass of a single Fermi surface pocket and not to the conductivity effective mass). Theoretically, it is demonstrated that a thermoelectric figure-of-merit zT higher than 1.3 can be achieved with a Bi-Sb-Te ingot if the non-parabolicity factor is engineered to be 0.2. Engineering the non-parabolicity factor is another effective band engineering approach, similar to band convergence, to achieve an effective improvement in power factor.","[Kim, Sang-il] Univ Seoul, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea; [Lim, Jong-Chan; Yang, Heesun; Kim, Hyun-Sik] Hongik Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 04066, South Korea",University of Seoul; Hongik University,"Yang, H; Kim, HS (corresponding author), Hongik Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 04066, South Korea.",hyang@hongik.ac.kr; hyunsik.kim@hongik.ac.kr,,"Kim, Hyun-Sik/0000-0001-8934-4042","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2015R1A6A1A03031833, NRF-2019R1C1C1005632]",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,"This work was financially supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by Ministry of Education (No. 2015R1A6A1A03031833, and NRF-2019R1C1C1005632).",,19,0,0,2,14,KOREAN INST METALS MATERIALS,SEOUL,"KIM BLDG 6TH FLOOR, SEOCHO-DAERO 56 GIL 38, SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL 137-881, SOUTH KOREA",1738-8228,,,KOREAN J MET MATER,Korean J.

Using the 1951-2012 TC best track dataset released by the Shanghai Typhoon Institute of the Chinese Meteorological Administration, the tracks of TCs landfalling over the Chinese coast were classified into three clusters through an FMM. Several climate indices were analysed using the CART algorithm for the three clusters. The prediction model built by CART for summer track frequency was based on a random sampling of the data for 46 years (about 75% of the total years) as the training set with a training accuracy of 100% (Cluster-1), 89.96% (Cluster-2) and 100% (Cluster-3). Data for the remaining 16 years (about 25%) were used for testing with a prediction accuracy of 87.5% (Cluster-1), 62.5% (Cluster-2) and 68.75% (Cluster-3). This study focuses on Cluster-1 of summer TCs landfalling over China for its high frequency, strong intensity, severe impacts and long lifespan. Furthermore, it suggests that the FMM algorithm is effective for track classification of TCs landing over China. In addition, the CART algorithm, which was used to build the prediction model of Cluster-1 for the classification of track frequency, showed high accuracy and its results can be explained and understood easily. It provides a novel framework for forecasting the frequency of TCs landfalling over China.","[Geng, Huantong; Shi, Dawei; Zhang, Wei; Huang, Chao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Dawei] Meteorol Bur Lianyungang City, Meteorol Observ, Lianyungang, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Geng, HT (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, 219 Ningliu Rd, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",htgeng@nuist.edu.cn,"Zhang, Wei/L-5743-2015; Zhang, Wei/J-3155-2019","Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-8134-6908; Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-8134-6908","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41201045, 41430427]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20151458]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province),"This work was sponsored jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 41201045, 41430427) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (grant no.

A combined simulation-optimization framework is employed to develop these models. One of the main barriers in the widespread application of these models for real-world cases is their large computational burden. Recent advances in efficient computational approaches and robust optimization methods can crack this barrier. This study surveys the scientific basis of CGM to provide an overview on this subject and reviews the-state-of-the-art to clarify recent developments and to outline ideas for improving the computational performance. Key details are presented on the performance and choice of possible robust tools such as efficient evolutionary algorithms (EAs), surrogate models, and parallel processing techniques. Then, the potential challenges remaining in this context are scrutinized, demonstrating open fields for further research, which include issues related to advances in simulating and optimizing phases such as introducing new robust algorithms and considering multi-objective purposes, implementing novel and high-performance tools, considering global concerns (e.g. climate change impacts), enhancing the existing models to fit the real world, and taking into account the complexities of real-world applications (e.g. uncertainties in the modeling parameters, and data acquisition). Finally, the outcomes of the systematic review are applied to solve a real-world CGM problem in Iran, to quantitatively examine the performance of combined implementation of some of the suggested tools. It is revealed that the required computational time is considerably reduced by as much as three orders of magnitude when correct combinations of robust EAs, surrogate model, and parallelization technique are utilized.","[Ketabchi, Hamed; Ataie-Ashtiani, Behzad] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran",Sharif University of Technology,"Ketabchi, H (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, POB 11155-9313, Tehran, Iran.",hketabchi@alum.sharif.edu; ataie@sharif.edu,"Ataie-Ashtiani, Behzad/AAM-7707-2021; Ketabchi, Hamed/AAW-5109-2021; Ashtiani, Behzad Ataie/AAM-7567-2021","Ataie-Ashtiani, Behzad/0000-0002-1339-3734; Ketabchi, Hamed/0000-0003-4643-1415; ",,,,,157,64,64,2,91,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1431-2174,1435-0157,,HYDROGEOL J,Hydrogeol.

This paper investigates environmental impacts of micro cogeneration by carrying out a detailed life cycle assessment and an analysis of local air quality impacts of micro cogeneration systems. Most micro cogeneration systems are superior, as far as the reduction of GHG emissions is concerned, not only to average electricity and heat supply, but also to state-of-the art separate production of electricity in gas power plants and heat in condensing boilers. The GHG advantages of micro cogeneration plants are comparable to district heating with CHP. Under the assumption that gas condensing boilers are the competing heat-supply technology, all technologies are within a very narrow range. Looking at the GHG reduction potential on the level of a supply object (e.g. a single-family house) by modeling the operation with a CHP optimization tool, the achievable mitigation potential is somewhat lower, because the micro cogeneration systems do not supply the whole energy demand. Here, fuel cells offer the advantage of a higher power-to-heat ratio. Environmental impacts other than those related to climate and resource protection relate more specifically to technology. in addition to investigating the emissions side, analysis of the air quality situation of a residential area supplied by reciprocating engines was carried out. The analysis shows that for the selected conditions, the additional emission of NO, due to the engines do not create severe additional environmental impacts. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a more accurate estimation of CO2 on wood products is proposed, taking into account not only the volume but the useful life of those products. In order to estimate this carbon uptake and sequestration, innovation in forestry reveals new technologies and methodologies such as forest inventory using LiDAR technology or advanced modelling techniques. Besides, a new accountability and legal framework is added to review the state of the art of this particular issue.

Therefore, sustainable desalination/purification of salty/contaminated water for human uses is particularly relevant. Membrane distillation is an emerging hybrid thermal-membrane technology with the potential to overcome the drawbacks of conventional desalination by a synergic exploitation of the water-energy nexus. Although membrane distillation is considered a green technology, efficient heat management remains a critical concern affecting the cost of the process and hindering its viability at large scale. A multidisciplinary approach that involves materials chemistry, physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials and polymer science is required to solve this problem. The combination of solar energy with membrane distillation is considered a potentially feasible low-cost approach for providing high-quality freshwater with a low carbon footprint. In particular, recent discoveries about efficient light-to-heat conversion in nanomaterials have opened unprecedented perspectives for the implementation of sunlight-based renewable energy in membrane distillation. The integration of nanofillers enabling photothermal effects into membranes has been demonstrated to be able to significantly enhance the energy efficiency without impacting on economic costs. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the state of the art, the opportunities, open challenges and pitfalls of the emerging field of solar-driven membrane distillation. We also assess the peculiar physicochemical properties and synthesis scalability of photothermal materials, as well as the strategies for their integration into polymeric nanocomposite membranes enabling efficient light-to-heat conversion and freshwater.","[Santoro, Sergio; Avci, Ahmet H.; Curcio, Efrem] Univ Calabria, Dept Environm & Chem Engn, Cubo 44 A,Via Pietro Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Politano, Antonio] Univ Laquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Via Vetoio, I-67100 Laquila, AQ, Italy",University of Calabria; University of L'Aquila,"Curcio, E (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Environm & Chem Engn, Cubo 44 A,Via Pietro Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.;Politano, A (corresponding author), Univ Laquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Via Vetoio, I-67100 Laquila, AQ, Italy.",antonio.politano@univaq.it; efrem.curcio@unical.it,,"Santoro, Sergio/0000-0001-7687-0780",European Commission [407],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"Sergio Santoro acknowledges the European Commission for the financial support activated under the PON ``Research and Innovation'' 2014-2020, Action I.2 ``Researchers' Mobility'', Notice D.

The city is thereby characterized in terms of air quality related data, such as climatology, atmospheric emissions and air pollutant concentrations. From this assessment, different NBS were selected according to city aspirations. The WRF-Chem model was applied for baseline and NBS scenarios over the study area with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km and an hourly time resolution for August 2013. The baseline scenario (without NBS) was validated by comparing the model results with monitored data retrieved from the European air quality monitoring database, showing an adequate model performance. The scenario simulations (with NBS) were performed by changing the land use in the model setup, and results were compared with the baseline scenario. Reductions in hourly temperature values of approximately 1 degrees C and reductions in pollutant concentrations, namely nitrogen dioxide (NO2), of approximately 10% were estimated after the application of the NBS in the Eindhoven study area. These results are particularly important to support public planners and decision-makers in understanding the effects and importance of NBS in their planning for more sustainable and resilient cities.","[Ascenso, Ana; Augusto, Bruno; Silveira, Carlos; Rafael, Sandra; Coelho, Silvia; Monteiro, Alexandra; Ferreira, Joana; Menezes, Isilda; Roebeling, Peter; Miranda, Ana I.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Roebeling, Peter] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Econ Res, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Universidade de Aveiro; Wageningen University & Research,"Ascenso, A (corresponding author), Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",ascenso.a@ua.pt,"Coelho, Silvia C.

It also supports additional industries by providing high quality oil and protein in the form of cottonseed cake. Currently, there is an urgent need to increase lint yield, fiber quality, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses due to rising pressure from a global population and possible supply shortages from the effects of erratic climate changes. Classic plant breeding and transgenic strategies need more genetic breakthroughs to support the increasing pressure for fiber quantity and quality. A potential for rapid increases in crop improvement is in various state-of-the-art gene editing technologies. Genetic research in simple micro-organisms revealed novel enzymes involved in natural sequence editing in cells, and they were successfully applied to gene editing in model plants through a system called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9). This and other enzymatic systems are heralded as providing numerous possibilities for creating genetic variation for crop breeders. However, gene editing in agriculture is most effective when focused on achieving transmissible changes by inducing targeted mutations in genes involved in yield or quality attributes. The newly emerged CRISPR-Cas tools should accelerate future research in cotton breeding because they can be utilized efficiently for gene editing without the need for foreign gene insertion.

The focus is on the 'golden sample' case study for this type of analysis based on observations collected during the deployment of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's (ARM) mobile facility AMF2 at Hyytiala, Finland, during the Biogenic Aerosols - Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign. The presented analysis of the height evolution of the radar Doppler spectra is a state-of-the-art retrieval with profiling cloud radars in SLW layers beyond the traditional use of spectral moments. Dynamical effects are considered by following the particle population evolution along slanted tracks that are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud under wind shear conditions. In the SLW layer, the identified liquid peak is used as an air motion tracer to correct the Doppler spectra for vertical air motion and the ice peak is used to study the radar profiles of rimed particles. A 1-D steady-state bin microphysical model is constrained using the SLW and air motion profiles and cloud top radar observations. The observed radar moment profiles of the rimed snow can be simulated reasonably well by the model, but not without making several assumptions about the ice particle concentration and the relative role of deposition and aggregation. This suggests that in situ observations of key ice properties are needed to complement the profiling radar observations before process-oriented studies can effectively evaluate ice microphysical parameterizations.","[Kalesse, Heike; Szyrmer, Wanda; Kneifel, Stefan; Kollias, Pavlos] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Luke, Edward] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Kalesse, Heike] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Kneifel, Stefan] Univ Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Kollias, Pavlos] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",McGill University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); University of Cologne; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Kalesse, H (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Kalesse, H (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany.",kalesse@tropos.de,"Kneifel, Stefan/A-2044-2015; Kalesse, Heike/N-7166-2019; Kollias, Pavlos/N-3987-2019","Kneifel, Stefan/0000-0003-2220-2968; Kalesse, Heike/0000-0001-6699-7040; Kollias, Pavlos/0000-0002-5984-7869; Luke, Edward/0000-0002-1606-0046",Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric System Research (ASR) program through the ASR radar science grant; DFG project COMPoSE [GZ: KA 4162/1-1]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric System Research (ASR) program through the ASR radar science grant; DFG project COMPoSE; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The authors thank the entire BAECC-SNEX science team, the AMF2 team, and the SMEAR II staff for data acquisition and analysis, as well as Dimitri Moisseev for discussion of in situ observational results.

With the imminent threats posed by global climate change to crop production and the ever increasing and more sophisticated demands of agricultural products, crop improvement efforts have to be more powerful and precise in developing new crop varieties. Nutrition security is integral to food security. Induced mutations are significant as novel mutations are being isolated for enhanced nutrition quality of crop plants. Induced mutations can help to regenerate and restore the variability, which has been lost in the process of adaptation to various stresses or adaptations during the course of evolution. Mutagenesis is an important tool in crop improvement and is free of the regulatory restrictions imposed on genetically modified organisms. The forward genetic approach enables the identification of improved or novel phenotypes that can be exploited in conventional breeding programmes. Powerful reverse genetic strategies that allow the detection of induced point mutations in individuals of the mutagenized populations can address the major challenge of linking sequence information to the biological function of genes and can also identify novel variation for plant breeding. The availability of genomics information in the public domain coupled with recent advances in molecular and cellular biology techniques have paved the way for transforming old mutation techniques into state of the art technology for both crop improvement and basic genomics research. This chapter briefly discusses recent advances in the detection of mutants and the potential of mutagenesis for crop improvement.","[Chaudhary, A.; Chaudhary, S.] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Tehri Garhwal 249199, Uttarakhand, India",Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture Technology,"Chaudhary, A (corresponding author), GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Hill Campus, Tehri Garhwal 249199, Uttarakhand, India.",sanjali.deep@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,1,2,0,23,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-796-7; 978-90-8686-244-3,,,,2014,,,,,233,251,,10.3920/978-90-8686-796-7_11,http://dx.doi.org/10.3920/978-90-8686-796-7_11,10.3920/978-90-8686-796-7,,19,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity,BB4TF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000343318100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the control CO2 emissions from these sources by capture and storage should be extremely important to minimize CO2 contribution to climate change without stifling economic and technological development. There are three main approaches to capturing the CO2 produced: precombustion, oxyfuel combustion and postcombustion. Of these, postcombustion treatment is the most suitable option for retrofitting in existing fuel powered plants without major modifications. The current state-of-the-art of post-combustion technologies for CO2 capture are amine based methods, though it is known the hight energy penalty of these processes, so that in the past decade new alternatives has been explored, as ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs can be defined as salts whose melting point is below 100 degrees C. There are about 10(18) possible structures for ionic liquids, which allows by selecting components (anion or cation) adjust their properties to the required application. The ILs have interesting properties such as high thermal stability, wide temperature liquid range, almost null vapor pressure, good solubility of CO2 and tunable properties through an adequate combination of ions (task specific fluids). Recently several studies have used hydrophilic ionic liquids based on organic anions such as acetate and phenolate, which appear to interact chemically with CO2 allowing high CO2 capture at atmospheric pressures. This contribution tries to give an overview about the use of ionic liquids for CO2 capture and major future strategies to optimize their use.","[Gimeno, M. P.; Mayoral, M. C.; Andres, J.

These have shown clear differences in the seasonal and long term performance and stability. These studies are reviewed, with particular emphasis on performances in climates typical of the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to general module engineering factors that result in a loss of performance in all modules some types of solar cells, such as those made from thin film amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), also suffer specific losses in performance due to fundamental material changes, such as photodegradation or the Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE). A field evaluation of the long term performance of state-of-the-art crystalline and amorphous silicon photovoltaic modules in Australian conditions is currently being undertaken at Murdoch University. The initial results from this monitoring program are reported. This paper also reports on laboratory and field studies being undertaken on the nature of the Staebler-Wronski effect in amorphous silicon solar cells and how the stability of these cells is affected by different operating conditions. Based on a mechanism for the SCVE in a-Si:H solar cells developed as a result of our research we propose a number of possible ways to reduce the Staebler-Wronski effect in a-Si:H solar cells.","Murdoch Univ, Div Sci & Engn, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Murdoch University,"Lund, CP (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Div Sci & Engn, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MURDOCH UNIV,MURDOCH,"MURDOCH, WA 6150, AUSTRALIA",,,0-86905-695-6,,,,1999,,,,,391,397,,,,,,7,Energy & Fuels,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels,BP05P,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000083971000070,View Full Record in Web of Science

The burning of coal releases vast amounts of toxic COx greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere that bear an undesirable environmental impact. The ongoing offshore oil exploration activities; the infrastructure for oil extraction, production, and transportation; and the inevitable oil spills cause severe damage to the environment and huge loss of sea life, flora, and fauna. Recent awareness of the environmental issues and the worldwide climate change spurred public interest in clean and environmentally friendly green energy generation. Solar energy is an abundant and inexhaustible resource that can meet much of the worlds' energy needs and, thus, has been in the focus of scientific attention for many years. Yet, converting solar energy into usable electric power is a formidable engineering and economical challenge. The recent environmental awareness triggered governments and private companies around the world to encourage further research and capital investment into the development and deployment of efficient and cost-effective solar technologies. This review reports on advances in the technological approaches that can be employed to convert sunlight to electricity. This article presents a short survey of the state-of-the-art architectures of photovoltaic arrays and a review of the concepts and strategies of their associated electronic power processors for solar energy generation.

Such studies can play an important role in the development of shared visions of the future: creating powerful expectations of the potential of emerging technologies and mobilising resources necessary for their realisation. This paper reviews the hydrogen futures literature, using a six-fold typology to map the state of the art of scenario construction. The paper then explores the expectations embodied in the literature, through the 'answers' it provides to questions about the future of hydrogen. What are the drivers, barriers and challenges facing the development of a hydrogen economy? What are the key technological building blocks required? In what kinds of futures does hydrogen become important? What does a hydrogen economy look like, how and when does it evolve, and what does it achieve? The literature describes a diverse range of possible futures, from decentralised systems based upon small-scale renewables, through to centralised systems reliant on nuclear energy or carbon-sequestration. There is a broad consensus that the hydrogen economy emerges only slowly, if at all, under 'Business as Usual' scenarios. Rapid transitions to hydrogen occur only under conditions of strong governmental support combined with, or as a result of, major 'discontinuities' such as shifts in society's environmental values, 'game changing' technological breakthroughs, or rapid increases in the oil price or speed and intensity of climate change.

Among the important parameters to be derived from AIRS observations are atmospheric temperature profiles with an average accuracy of 1 K in 1 kilometer (km) layers in the troposphere and surface temperatures with an average accuracy of 0.5 K. The AIRS measurement technique is based on very sensitive passive infrared (IR) remote sensing using a precisely calibrated, high resolution grating spectrometer operating in the 3.7 mu m to 15.4 mu m region. The instrument concept uses passively cooled multi-aperture eschelle array spectrometer approach in combination with advanced state-of-the-art focal plane and cryogenic refrigerator technology to achieve unparalleled performance capability in a practical long life configuration.

In this sense, two-dimensional (2D) materials appear as one of highly attractive routes for the development of efficient sensing devices due, in particular, to the interesting blend of their superlative properties. For instance, graphene (Gr) and graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4 (g-CN) have specifically attracted great attention in several domains of sensing applications owing to their excellent electronic and physical-chemical properties. Despite the high potential they offer in the development and fabrication of high-performance gas-sensing devices, an exhaustive comparison between Gr and g-CN is not well established yet regarding their electronic properties and their sensing performances such as sensitivity and selectivity. Hence, this work aims at providing a state-of-the-art overview of the latest experimental advances in the fabrication, characterization, development, and implementation of these 2D materials in gas-sensing applications. Then, the reported results are compared to our numerical simulations using density functional theory carried out on the interactions of Gr and g-CN with some selected hazardous gases' molecules such as NO2, CO2, and HF. Our findings conform with the superior performances of the g-CN regarding HF detection, while both g-CN and Gr show comparable detection performances for the remaining considered gases. This allows suggesting an outlook regarding the future use of these 2D materials as high-performance gas sensors.","[Kotbi, Ahmed; Lejeune, Michael; Jouiad, Mustapha] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Lab Phys Condensed Matter, F-80039 Amiens, France; [Kotbi, Ahmed; Ressami, El Mostafa; Lakssir, Brahim] Moroccan Fdn Adv Sci Innovat & Res, Rabat 10100, Morocco; [Imran, Mohammed; Rahaman, Ariful] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kaja, Khaled] Lab Natl Metrol & Essais LNE, 29 Ave Roger Hannequin, F-78197 Trappes, France",Picardie Universites; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Moroccan Foundation for Advanced Science Innovation & Research (MASCIR); Vellore Institute of Technology; Laboratoire National de Metrologie et d'Essais (LNE),"Jouiad, M (corresponding author), Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Lab Phys Condensed Matter, F-80039 Amiens, France.",ahmed.kotbi@u-picardie.fr; imranbinomer@gmail.com; khaled.kaja@lne.fr; arif2rk@gmail.com; m.ressami@mascir.ma; michael.lejeune@u-picardie.fr; b.lakssir@mascir.ma; mustapha.jouiad@u-picardie.fr,,"KOTBI, Ahmed/0000-0003-0999-8439; Jouiad, Mustapha/0000-0002-7587-1500",MAScIR 2D-HF-Detect [240004055],MAScIR 2D-HF-Detect,THis research was funded by a seed grant provided by MAScIR 2D-HF-Detect #240004055.,,139,5,5,12,20,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9503,1687-9511,,J NANOTECHNOL,J.

Recent advancements on 2D nanomaterials (2DM) open a new pathway for addressing the grand challenge of water treatment owing to their unique structures and superior properties. Emerging 2D nanostructures such as graphene, MoS2, MXene, h-BN, g-C3N4, and black phosphorus have demonstrated an unprecedented surface-to-volume ratio, which promises ultralow material use, ultrafast processing time, and ultrahigh treatment efficiency for water cleaning/monitoring. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art account on engineered 2D nanomaterials and their applications in emerging water technologies, involving separation, adsorption, photocatalysis, and pollutant detection. The fundamental design strategies of 2DM are discussed with emphasis on their physicochemical properties, underlying mechanism and targeted applications in different scenarios. This review concludes with a perspective on the pressing challenges and emerging opportunities in 2DM-enabled wastewater treatment and water-quality monitoring. This review can help to elaborate the structure-processing-property relationship of 2DM, and aims to guide the design of next-generation 2DM systems for the development of selective, multifunctional, programmable, and even intelligent water technologies. The global significance of clean water for future generations sheds new light and much inspiration in this rising field to enhance the efficiency and affordability of water treatment and secure a global water supply in a growing portion of the world.","[Zeng, Minxiang; Chen, Mingfeng; Lei, Shijun; Cheng, Zhengdong] Texas A&M Univ, Artie McFerrin Dept Chem Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Huang, Dali; Cheng, Zhengdong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zhang, Xuan; Wang, Ling] Tianjin Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zhengdong] Texas A&M Univ, Mary Kay OConnor Proc Safety Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Cheng, Zhengdong] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Dept Chem Engn, POB 23874, Doha, Qatar",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Tianjin University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Qatar Foundation (QF); Texas A&M University Qatar,"Zeng, MX; Cheng, ZD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Artie McFerrin Dept Chem Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Cheng, ZD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Wang, L (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.;Cheng, ZD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Mary Kay OConnor Proc Safety Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Cheng, ZD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Dept Chem Engn, POB 23874, Doha, Qatar.",glennzeng@tamu.edu; lwang17@tju.edu.cn; zcheng@tamu.edu,"; Zeng, Minxiang/O-5037-2018","Huang, Dali/0000-0002-9477-3041; Zeng, Minxiang/0000-0002-3513-9200",Texas A&M Water Seed Grant [TEES-163024]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51973155],Texas A&M Water Seed Grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from Texas A&M Water Seed Grant (TEES-163024).

In an industry growth currently supported by subsidies, cost-efficient battery plant sizes are vital for the establishment of a self-sustaining industry and a transition into a long-term climate-neutral society. For optimal plant sizing, no consensus has yet been achieved in the battery literature and a detailed analysis of economies of scale is unavailable. To close this gap, a process-based cost modeling approach is taken that reflects the determinants of economies of scale. In state-of-the-art, minimum viable plant sizes are demonstrated to be below 2 GWh year(-1) but may exceed 15 GWh year(-1) in the future. This study finds that economies of scale are related to the capacity of the roll-to-roll processes in electrode manufacturing and can be maximized if the respective equipment operates at its capacity limit. This capacity depends on materials, cell design and roll-to-roll process parameters. Since these parameters improve over time, increased plant sizes will become necessary to achieve cost-efficient production levels. Required plant investments are found to decrease on a per GWh basis, whereas significantly increased funds will become necessary to reach efficient plant sizes in the future. Finally, implications are presented that support future battery cost reductions and a self-sustaining market breakthrough of battery-powered products.","[Mauler, Lukas; Duffner, Fabian; Leker, Jens] Univ Munster, Dept Chem & Pharm IfbM, Inst Business Adm, D-48148 Munster, Germany; [Mauler, Lukas; Duffner, Fabian] Porsche Consulting GmbH, D-74321 Bietigheim Bissingen, Germany; [Leker, Jens] Helmholtz Inst Munster HIMS, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Mauler, L (corresponding author), Leonardo Campus 1, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",lmauler@uni-muenster.de,,"Mauler, Lukas/0000-0003-0697-4992",,,,,70,28,27,4,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

Among numerous species of fungi, some are pathogenic, and humans have battled since the dawn of organized agriculture to reduce production losses. With the arrival of fungicides many gains have been made in this struggle. However, though fungicides have greatly contributed to substantial increase in agricultural productivity, their over usage has led to both health and environmental repercussions. They remain cornerstone of the agriculture industry, however, development of safer formulations to champion sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture is of great importance, especially in face of a growing global population, climate change and increasing fungal resistance to existing compounds. Scope and approach: The aim of this review is to present the state of the art in fungicides formulations developed for agrochemistry, also describing recent improvements in their safety, with special focus on fungicides used most against the ten most important fungal pathogens. Key findings and conclusions: The major focus in the field remains to be the improvement of the overall performance of the fungicide formulations. The research trends are also moving towards developing more eco-friendly formulations. However, there are still very few studies assessing nanoformulations toxicity and environmental impact. For example, there is still a limited body of research on the holistic assessment of nanoformulation shells' fate in soil and in the environment after release, as well as redistribution within plants after absorption, with no studies on human or environmental exposure.","[Tleuova, Aiym B.; Talluri, V.

This work, along with Situacion del arte en la era tecnologica - published by Rest in 1961 in Revista de la Universidad de Buenos Aires - are considered by the argentine historiography of communication and culture studies as moments precursors. According to this retrospective reading, the essays Rest promoted the emergence of an area of specialized knowledge: exposed the question of the links between art, culture and social history, putting in perspective the division between massive, high and popular culture that characterized the approach to literary criticism and sociology of the period and made available a series of readings and authors who will become some years later required references to deploy the question. In this article, in opposition to certain anachronism - this read retrospectively a disciplinary history from the perspective of a subsequent configuration, emphasizing the individual task of a precursor - we propose to put this inaugural moment at the crossroads of a collective movement and a series of institutional spaces and broader discursive formations. Indeed, in the essays of Jaime Rest the question for of mass culture status was linked to the question about the effects of the emergence of the masses in national life (read: the emergence of peronism) and was produced and circulated in formation and institutional spaces marked by the developmentalism climate of ideas and the academic reformism that ruled the university from 1956.",,,,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,INST EUROPEO COMUNICACION & DESARROLLO,SEVILLA,"INST EUROPEO COMUNICACION & DESARROLLO, SEVILLA, 00000, SPAIN",1696-2079,2255-5919,,REDES COM,Redes com,,2014,10,,,,185,209,,10.15213/redes.n10.p185,http://dx.doi.org/10.15213/redes.n10.p185,,,25,Communication,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Communication,VB7NK,,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000417058700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

These dates embrace times of strong climatic oscillation, beginning with very rigorous environmental conditions (stage GS2) and ending with a temperate climate (Allerod); over this period, extreme events such as Heinrich event 1 occurred. However, little information is available that would allow the environments through which human groups moved during the Late last Glacial of the Iberian interior to be characterised. The La Pena de Estebanvela site is something of an exception in that its archaeological features allow the reconstruction of the surrounding environment, and provide information on how natural resources may have been used. The faunal remains represented at this site reflect changes in palaeoecology over time. Taphonomic analysis of recovered macromammals and lagomorphs shows that these animals were brought to the site, butchered and consumed. The available data on seasonality fix the occupation of levels I-III from the spring to the autumn. Certain types of wood were collected for use as firewood. Other elements found in the record (personal ornaments, mobiliary art and raw materials) provide evidence that the people that occupied the site moved over a more extensive territory.

In order to maximize the energy yield (EY) and reduce the cost of generated electricity, light management concepts are of key importance for this technology. This numerical study provides a systematic EY analysis, evaluating and predicting the improvement in the EY of perovskite/silicon (Si) two-terminal (2T) PV modules employing micron-scale random pyramids at the front and/or rear surface of the PV module. The 2T tandem PV module architectures comprise an optically thick encapsulant and a module front cover glass with an anti-reflection coating. The EY is studied at various locations in the USA with different climate zones. For a perovskite top solar cell with a bandgap of around 1.72 eV, the perovskite/Si 2T tandem PV modules with textured front and rear surfaces yield the highest relative enhancement in EY of around 26-28% compared to that of a state-of-the-art crystalline Si single-junction reference. The relative enhancement in the EY of planar and rear side textured perovskite/Si 2T tandem PV modules is lower (planar: 12-14% and rear side textured: 19-22%). Finally, the EY of the textured perovskite/Si tandem PV module is investigated with respect to the bandgap of the perovskite top solar cell. Overall, this study highlights the great promise of perovskite/Si 2T tandem PV modules under realistic irradiation conditions and emphasizes the importance of light management textures for maximizing the EY of this technology.","[Lehr, Jonathan; Lemmer, Uli; Richards, Bryce S.; Paetzold, Ulrich W.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Light Technol Inst, Engesserstr 13, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Langenhorst, Malte; Schmager, Raphael; Lemmer, Uli; Richards, Bryce S.; Paetzold, Ulrich W.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Microstruct Technol, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Kirner, Simon; Case, Chris] Oxford Photovolta, Unit 7-8 Oxford Ind Pk,Mead Rd, Oxford OX5 1QU, England",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Lehr, J (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Light Technol Inst, Engesserstr 13, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.;Paetzold, UW (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Microstruct Technol, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",Jonathan.Lehr@kit.edu; Ulrich.Paetzold@kit.edu,"Richards, Bryce S/L-5512-2014; Paetzold, Ulrich Wilhelm/J-7339-2016; Lemmer, Uli/F-8257-2012; Paetzold, Ulrich Wilhelm/Y-1495-2019","Richards, Bryce S/0000-0001-5469-048X; Paetzold, Ulrich Wilhelm/0000-0002-1557-8361; Lemmer, Uli/0000-0001-9892-329X; Paetzold, Ulrich Wilhelm/0000-0002-1557-8361","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (PRINTPERO, PEROSOL); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Association (Recruitment Initiative of Prof. B.S.

Urban residents face higher health risks because urban heat islands exacerbate HW conditions. One strategy to mitigate negative impacts of urban thermal stress is the installation of green roofs (GRs) given their evaporative cooling effect. However, the effectiveness of GRs and the mechanisms by which they have an effect at the scale of entire cities are still largely unknown. The Greater Beijing Region is modeled for a HW scenario with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a state-of-the-art urban canopy model (Princeton Urban Canopy Model) to examine the effectiveness of GRs. The results suggest that GR would decrease near-surface air temperature (Delta T2(max) = 2.5 K) and wind speed (Delta UV10(max) = 1.0 m s(-1)) but increase atmospheric humidity (Delta Q2(max) = 1.3 g kg(-1)). GRs are simulated to lessen the overall thermal stress as indicated by apparent temperature (Delta AT2(max) (=) 1.7 degrees C). The modifications by GRs scale almost linearly with the fraction of the surface they cover. Investigation of the surface-atmosphere interactions indicates that GRs with plentiful soil moisture dissipate more of the surface energy as latent heat flux and subsequently inhibit the development of the daytime planetary boundary layer (PBL). This causes the atmospheric heating through entrainment at the PBL top to be decreased.

They are often located in areas of high disturbance and can vary significantly in the area of free space provided for settlement of marine organisms. Whilst correlation between the amount of free space available and recruitment success has been shown in populations of several marine benthic organisms, there has been relatively little focus on invasive species, a group with the potential to reproduce in vast numbers and colonise habitats rapidly. Invasion success following different scales of disturbance was examined in the invasive acorn barnacle, Austrominius modestus, on a unique art installation located in Liverpool Bay. Population growth and recruitment success were examined by comparing recruitment rates within disturbance clearings of 4 different sizes and by contrasting population development with early recruitment rates over a 10 week period. Disturbed areas were rapidly recolonised and monocultures of A. modestus formed within 6 weeks. The size of patch created during disturbance had no effect on the rate of recruitment, while a linear relationship between recruit density and patch size was observed. Density-dependent processes mediated initial high recruitment resulting in population stability after 8-10 weeks, but densities continued to greatly exceed those reported in natural habitats. Given that artificial structures are likely to continue to proliferate in light of climate change projections, free-space is likely to become more available more frequently in the future supporting the expansion of fast-colonising species.","[Bracewell, Sally A.; Robinson, Leonie A.; Knights, Antony M.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Firth, Louise B.] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Ryan Inst, Galway, Ireland",University of Liverpool; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Bracewell, SA (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",s.bracewell@student.unsw.edu.au,,"Knights, Antony/0000-0002-0916-3469",Esmee Fairbairn Foundation grant via the URBANE project (Urban Research on Biodiversity on Artificial and Natural coastal Environments),Esmee Fairbairn Foundation grant via the URBANE project (Urban Research on Biodiversity on Artificial and Natural coastal Environments),"The completion of MRes by Sally Bracewell was supported by an Esmee Fairbairn Foundation grant via the URBANE project (Urban Research on Biodiversity on Artificial and Natural coastal Environments).

For the hitherto published releases of the GOCE time-wise (TIM) and GOCE space-wise gravity field series-two of the official ESA products-the energy conservation method has been adopted to exploit GPS-based satellite-to-satellite tracking information. On the other hand, gravity field recovery from data collected by the CHAllenging Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite showed the energy conservation principle to be a sub-optimal choice. For this reason, we propose to estimate the low-frequency part of the gravity field by the point-wise solution of Newton's equation of motion, also known as the acceleration approach. This approach balances the gravitational vector with satellite accelerations, and hence is characterized by (second-order) numerical differentiation of the kinematic orbit. In order to apply the method to GOCE, we present tailored processing strategies with regard to low-pass filtering, variance-covariance information handling, and robust parameter estimation. By comparison of our GIWF solutions (initials GI for Geodatisches Institut and IWF for Institut fur WeltraumForschung) and the GOCE-TIM estimates with a state-of-the-art gravity field solution derived from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), we conclude that the acceleration approach is better suited for GOCE-only gravity field determination as opposed to the energy conservation method.

Design/methodology/approach - The project shown in the paper will: collect statistical data on state-of-the-art in libraries, as well as public and academic library staff opinions on evaluation activities in their libraries; define dimensions of effectiveness that will differentiate academic and public libraries; show differences in views between library management and staff; and encourage more positive attitude of library staff toward evaluation activities. Findings - The paper finds that the possible obstacles to creating a positive climate for performance measurement in the Croatian library and information science community might be, among other things: insufficient number of staff, inexperience and lack of skills needed for data collection and processing, lack of motivation, fear of being made redundant, etc. This project will hopefully help uncover all the weak spots of Croatian library community. However, certain problems are anticipated in getting Croatian librarians to express their real opinions. Practical implications - The project is considered of utmost importance for the Croatian LIS community because it will not only describe the present situation, but it will also draw attention to evaluation topics preparing librarians by the means of a set of workshops and an evaluation manual designed especially for Croatian library community for systematic and dedicated work on measurement and improvement of library services. Originality/value - The paper shows that this is the first project of its type in Croatia.","[Petr, Kornelija] J J Strossmayer Univ, Osijek, Croatia",,"Petr, K (corresponding author), J J Strossmayer Univ, Osijek, Croatia.",kpetr@ffos.hr,"Balog, Kornelija Petr/Y-3714-2019; Balog, Kornelija Petr/C-1749-2013","Balog, Kornelija Petr/0000-0002-4970-9446; Balog, Kornelija Petr/0000-0002-4970-9446",,,,,15,3,3,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-8047,1758-6925,,PERFORM MEAS METR,Perform.

The physical co-location of these sensors and the positional correlation of their detection results has created a state-of-the-art multisensor fusion platform for real time detection of mines. Government testing of this system in both arid and temperate climates has produced a wealth of data for post processing and performance analysis. In addition to providing real-time detection and marking, the system performs sufficient data storage as to allow subsequent playback of test data, with modified operational parameters and/or alternative integrating techniques (software), thereby extending the value of the system as a testbed. The result is a laboratory tool using real-world data for algorithmic development. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the test results along with some analytical insights into the performance of the integrating elements of the system, including navigation, elementary sensor fusion, and confirmed sensor detection, plus an initial evaluation of the ability of the correlation procedure to reduce false alarms, and characterize targets as to type (metal vs. non-metal). In addition, we now have a platform and a baseline for development and evaluation of more sophisticated fusion techniques.

However, these meteorological products need past and/or near-real-time observational data and cannot predict the future. Here, we use an atmospheric component with tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (CAM6-Chem) of the state-of-the-art global climate model CESM2, adding new species of mercury and simulating atmospheric mercury cycling. Our results show that the newly developed online model is able to simulate the observed spatial distribution of total gaseous mercury (TGM) in both polluted and non-polluted regions with high correlation coefficients in eastern Asia (r = 0.67) and North America (r = 0.57). The calculated lifetime of TGM against deposition is 5.3 months and reproduces the observed interhemispheric gradient of TGM with a peak value at northern mid-latitudes. Our model reproduces the observed spatial distribution of Hg-II wet deposition over North America (r = 0.80) and captures the magnitude of maximum in the Florida Peninsula. The simulated wet deposition fluxes in eastern Asia present a spatial distribution pattern of low in the northwest and high in the southeast. The online model is in line with the observed seasonal variations of TGM at northern mid-latitudes as well as the Southern Hemisphere, which shows lower amplitude. We further go into the factors that affect the seasonal variations of atmospheric mercury and find that both Hg-0 dry deposition and Hg-II dry/wet depositions contribute to it.","[Zhang, Peng; Zhang, Yanxu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Zhang, YX (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhangyx@nju.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0606803]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974092]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [0207-14380168]; Frontiers Science Center for Critical Earth Material Cycling,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Frontiers Science Center for Critical Earth Material Cycling,"This research has been supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2019YFA0606803), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71974092), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant no. 0207-14380168), Frontiers Science Center for Critical Earth Material Cycling.",,79,1,1,8,9,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

However, quantifying and mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of ET across a large area is still a challenge, which limits our understanding of how a given ecosystem functions under a changing climate. This also poses a challenge to water managers, farmers, and ranchers who often rely on accurate estimates of ET to make important irrigation and management decisions. Over the last three decades, remote sensing-based ET modeling tools have played a significant role in managing water resources and understanding land-atmosphere interactions. However, several challenges, including limited applicability under all conditions, scarcity of calibration and validation datasets, and spectral and spatiotemporal constraints of available satellite sensors, exist in the current state-of-the-art remote sensing-based ET models and products. The special issue on Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration II  was launched to attract studies focusing on recent advances in remote sensing-based ET models to help address some of these challenges and find novel ways of applying and/or integrating remotely sensed ET products with other datasets to answer key questions related to water and environmental sustainability. The 13 articles published in this special issue cover a wide range of topics ranging from field- to global-scale analysis, individual model to multi-model evaluation, single sensor to multi-sensor fusion, and highlight recent advances and applications of remote sensing-based ET modeling tools and products.","[Bhattarai, Nishan] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wagle, Pradeep] USDA ARS, Grazinglands Res Lab, El Reno, OK 73036 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Bhattarai, N (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",nbhattar@umich.edu; pradeep.wagle@usda.gov,"Bhattarai, Nishan/B-7793-2015; Wagle, Pradeep/A-4432-2015","Bhattarai, Nishan/0000-0003-2749-3549; Wagle, Pradeep/0000-0001-7444-0461",,,,,25,5,5,9,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,NOV,2021,21,,,,,,4260,10.3390/rs13214260,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13214260,,,5,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,XA3CK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000720529300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, I swing on the rapid changes and innovations that the World that we live in is experiencing, and analyze them with respect to the challenges that these pose to the field of risk assessment. Digitalization brings opportunities but with it comes also the complexity of cyber-phyiscal systems. Climate change and extreme natural events are increasingly threatening our infrastructures; terrorist and malevolent threats are posing severe concerns for the security of our systems and lives. These sources of hazard are extremely uncertain and, thus, difficult to describe and model quantitatively. Some research and development directions that are emerging are presented and discussed, also considering the ever increasing computational capabilities and data availability. These include the use of simulation for accident scenario identification and exploration, the extension of risk assessment into the framework of resilience and business continuity, the reliance on data for dynamic and condition monitoring-based risk assessment, the safety and security assessment of cyber-physical systems. The paper is not a research work and not exactly a review or a state of the art work, but rather it offers a lookout on risk assessment, open to consideration and discussion, as it cannot pretend to give an absolute point of view nor to be complete in the issues addressed (and the related literature referenced to).","[Zio, E.] Univ Paris Saclay, Cent Supelec, Fdn Elect France EDF, Chaire Syst Sci & Energy Challenge,Lab Genie Ind, Paris, France; [Zio, E.] Politecn Milan, Energy Dept, Milan, Italy",Electricite de France (EDF); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Zio, E (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Cent Supelec, Fdn Elect France EDF, Chaire Syst Sci & Energy Challenge,Lab Genie Ind, Paris, France.;Zio, E (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Energy Dept, Milan, Italy.",enrico.zio@polimi.it,,,,,,,235,133,136,10,151,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8320,1879-0836,,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,Reliab.

Because of the inherent complexity of the MTO reaction, tuning the physicochemical properties of the ZSM-5 zeolite (including nature, position, and strength/density of the acid sites and the effect of metals/non-metals on the acidity, porosity, crystal size, and degree of crystallinity via impregnation/ion exchange) is extremely challenging. Therefore, the state-of-the-art relationship between the physicochemical properties of the ZSM-5 zeolite and its performance in the MTO process is analyzed, which could improve the understanding of the crucial role of ZSM-5 zeolite properties. In addition, hierarchical hybrid/composite zeolite materials, which have recently attracted significant attention, are evaluated. Owing to the existence of both meso- and microporosity, these hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites could facilitate molecular transport while preserving the intrinsic catalytic properties of the zeolites. This review summarizes the recent advancements in the synthesis and modification of ZSM-5-zeolite-based catalysts for achieving the desired reactivity and selectivity of light olefins. In addition, both the practical and potential future applications of MTO chemistry are evaluated. From a broader perspective, we believe that this review article could aid in the development of new or upgraded ZSM-5-zeolite-based catalysts for the MTO process. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The chemical conversion of CO2 to substitute natural gas (SNG) in the presence of renewable hydrogen is one of the most promising solutions by a well-known process called CO2 methanation. There have been comprehensive efforts in developing effective and efficient CO2 methanation catalytic systems. However, the choice of competitive and stable catalysts is still a monumental obstruction and a great challenge towards the commercialization and industrialization of CO2 methanation. It is necessary to emphasize the critical understandings of intrinsic and extrinsic interactions of catalyst components (active metal, support, promoter, etc.) for enhanced catalytic performance and stability during CO2 methanation. This study reviews the up-to-date developments on CO2 methanation catalysts and the optimal synergistic relationship between active metals, support, and promoters during the catalytic activity. The existing catalysts and their novel properties for enhanced CO2 methanation were elucidated using the state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical techniques. The selection of an appropriate synthesis method, catalytic activity for CO2 methanation, deactivation of the catalysts, and reaction mechanisms studies, have been explicitly compared and explained. Therefore, future efforts should be directed towards the sustainable developments of catalytic configurations for successful industrial applications of CO2 utilization to SNG using CO2 methanation.

A thin layer of YSZ was deposited on top of anode substrates for SOFC. The substrate comprises the warm-pressed anode itself, which supports the complete cell, and an anode functional layer deposited by vacuum slip casting, which is in direct contact with the electrolyte. From previous experiments it is known that non-assisted reactive DC magnetron sputtering produces layers with rather high leak-rate even when depositing at high temperatures. Residual pores on the substrates' surfaces are responsible for the incomplete coverage by the thin electrolyte and are detrimental to the cell's performance. In the present paper, the effect of increasing bias power applied to the substrate is studied. A clear improvement of the layer morphology and gas-tightness can be observed with increasing bias power. SOFC single cell-tests show art improved performance with regard to standard wet-ceramic processing routes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Within the project, overflow, overtopping and breaching in-situ tests are carried out in the Hedwige and Prosper polder, while numerical models are set up to improve technical analysis of testing results. This paper describes blind predictions of water depth and flow velocity on the slope of a levee during an overflow event, before the test is conducted, using a range of different state-of-the-art numerical models. This model predictions were performed by several Polder2C's project partners. All models considered the same levee geometry, roughness of the grass cover layer and upstream boundary conditions and the models were not calibrated afterwards. The aim of the comparison is to identify best numerical tools to predict flow patterns for different hydraulic loading conditions, since it determines the erosion process, which is to be analyzed as a second step. Homogeneous results have been found with the different deployed models, with some spread partially linked to numerical uncertainties, and calculation methods. The next steps are calibrating of the numerical models (e.g. the roughness of the grass cover layer) and modelling of the erosion process under the calculated hydraulic loading conditions. This will lead to a better understanding of erosion processes under overflow conditions. The test data will be made publicly available, to make it accessible for people outside the project as well.","[Rikkert, Stephanus J.

However, there is no consensus about the significance of the human-induced ET change across river basins due to the uncertainties from the estimations of both observed and natural ET at a large scale. In this study, the human influence on ET is estimated over seven large river basins in the East Asian monsoon region during 2003-2019, where the actual ET estimations based on the water budget method using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On terrestrial water storage change and the natural ET estimations based on land surface modeling are compared. The state-of-the-art global reanalyses and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model are validated against naturalized runoff from the water resources bulletins, and the VIC model is found to outperform global reanalysis data over most southern river basins. Compared with the selected natural ET model data that has a good performance of naturalized runoff, the annual mean human-induced ET in the East Asian monsoon region is estimated to range from 38 +/- 28 to 100 +/- 76 mm/year (8 +/- 6% to 12 +/- 9% of the total ET) during 2003-2019. The reservoir evaporation contributes to 5-18% of the human-induced ET change especially over the Huai river basin. Our results reveal that human-induced ET change is more significant over northern semiarid basins than southern humid basins.","[Liu, Huatong; Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Miao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Yuan, X (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",xyuan@nuist.edu.cn,"Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011","Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875105]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20211540],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Distinguished Young Scholars,"This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0606002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41875105), and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province for Distinguished Young Scholars (BK20211540).

The roof's energy performance is essential to net-zero-energy homes in Canada. However, measures to increase the EPRR should not jeopardize the structural integrity of the roofing assembly nor lead to unhealthy conditions within the building and its envelope due to unwanted side effects. The development of building codes to ensure EPRR thus requires a holistic approach to assure that residential buildings are energy efficient, moisture safe, and durable. This review systematically documents the state of the art on the topic of EPRR for Canadian buildings. Air tightness, attic ventilation, and insulation requirement are the three factors that mainly influence the EPRR. This review contributes in three ways: 1. Existing code specifications from the applicable North American building and energy codes are scrutinized for the above three factors. 2. Extraction of existing knowledge is expanded via a review of North American standards, guidelines, and association practice manuals. 3. Tabulation of the experimental studies carried out in cold climate countries on these three key factors. With this systematic approach, the missing links are identified for the long-term or future research opportunities in each of the three key factors. For the immediate implementation, with this holistic approach, a list of code change recommendations is drafted for possible inclusion in the Canadian building and energy codes.

Although hyperspectral remote sensing provides significant opportunities in the assessment of land cover, the applications of such data are limited in the snow-covered alpine regions. A major issue with hyperspectral data is the larger dimensionality. Feature selection methods are often used to derive the most informative subset of bands from the hyperspectral data. In this study, a band selection technique is proposed which utilizes the mutual information (MI) between hyperspectral bands and a reference band. The first principal component of the hyperspectral data is selected as the reference band. Two variants of this approach are proposed involving preclustering of bands using: (1) the k-means and (2) the fuzzy k-means algorithms. The MI is derived from weighted entropy of the hyperspectral band and the reference band. The weights are computed from the cluster distance ratio and the cluster membership function for the k-means and fuzzy k-means algorithm, respectively. The selected bands were classified using random forest classifier. The proposed methods are evaluated with four datasets, two Hyperion datasets corresponding to the geographical locations of Dhundi and Solang in India, corresponding to snow covered terrain and two benchmark AVIRIS datasets of Indian Pines and Salinas. The average classification accuracy (0.995 and 0.721 for Dhundi and Solang datasets, respectively) for the proposed approach were observed to be better as compared with those from other state of the art techniques.","[Varade, Divyesh; Dikshit, Onkar] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Maurya, Ajay K.] Reg Meterol Ctr, Indian Meteorol Dept, Gauhati, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; India Meteorological Department (IMD),"Varade, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.",varadi@iitk.ac.in,"VARADE, Divyesh/I-4111-2019","VARADE, Divyesh/0000-0003-0283-8387; MAURYA, AJAY/0000-0003-0855-3868", [1396];  [1398],; ,The authors thank Dr. Gulab Singh and JAXA for providing ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data under project no. 1396 and 1398.

We review the state-of-the art knowledge concerning the WG from an interdisciplinary perspective, uncovering critical aspects needed to understand this system's role in shaping the future evolution of oceanic heat and carbon uptake over the next decades. The main limitations in our knowledge are related to the conditions in this extreme and remote environment, where the polar night, very low air temperatures, and presence of sea ice year-round hamper field and remotely sensed measurements. We highlight the importance of winter and under-ice conditions in the southern WG, the role that new technology will play to overcome present-day sampling limitations, the importance of the WG connectivity to the low-latitude oceans and atmosphere, and the expected intensification of the WG circulation as the westerly winds intensify. Greater international cooperation is needed to define key sampling locations that can be visited by any research vessel in the region. Existing transects sampled since the 1980s along the Prime Meridian and along an East-West section at similar to 62 degrees S should be maintained with regularity to provide answers to the relevant questions. This approach will provide long-term data to determine trends and will improve representation of processes for regional, Antarctic-wide, and global modeling efforts-thereby enhancing predictions of the WG in global ocean circulation and climate.","[Vernet, M.; Mazloff, M.; Verdy, A.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Geibert, W.; Hoppema, M.; Haas, C.; Hellmer, H.

There is a need to add intelligence at all levels in the grid, acting over various time horizons. Predicting the behavior of the energy system is crucial to mitigate potential uncertainties. An accurate energy prediction at the customer level will reflect directly in efficiency improvements in the whole system. However, prediction of building energy consumption is complex due to many influencing factors, such as climate, performance of thermal systems, and occupancy patterns. Therefore, current state-of-the-art methods are not able to confine the uncertainty at the building level due to the many fluctuations in influencing variables. As an evolution of artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction methods, deep learning techniques are expected to increase the prediction accuracy by allowing higher levels of abstraction. In this paper, we investigate two newly developed stochastic models for time series prediction of energy consumption, namely Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) and Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM). The assessment is made on a benchmark dataset consisting of almost four years of one minute resolution electric power consumption data collected from an individual residential customer. The results show that for the energy prediction problem solved here, FCRBM outperforms ANN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CRBM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the prediction skills and the associations with ENSO teleconnections of these systems, long-term seasonal hindcast data sets for 28 years (1983-2010) were investigated. Observational data indicated that the ENSO-EAWM connection strengthened in a recent period (1997-2010; r = -0.84) compared with that in an earlier period (1983-1996; r = -0.44). For the recent period, a practical level of prediction skill for the EAWM index was retained by CFSv2 and GEOS-5 for the lead time of 2 months or longer, with these models showing a realistic ENSO-EAWM relationship throughout the Western Pacific Warm Pool with east-west dipole anomalies of precipitation induced by ENSO. The prediction skill of the other models was poor, even for lead times of zero to 1 month, with weak ENSO-EAWM relationships and errant north-south dipole anomalies of precipitation associated with ENSO. A large model spread was also found consistently in the CMIP5 AMIP and the Historical simulations by 14 models of the spatial pattern of equatorial Pacific precipitation anomalies associated with ENSO and the effect on the ENSO-EAWM relationship. Based on this study, the accurate prediction of EAWM should be linked with a realistic representation of the convection response in the equatorial Pacific by ENSO and the teleconnection to EAWM.","[Kang, Daehyun; Lee, Myong-In] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Lee, MI (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",milee@unist.ac.kr,"Kang, Daehyun/AAC-9961-2020; Lee, Myong-In/F-3578-2010","Lee, Myong-In/0000-0001-8983-8624; Kang, Daehyun/0000-0003-3284-1245",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 2016-6010]; Fostering Core Leaders of the Future Basic Science Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014H1A8A1022342],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); Fostering Core Leaders of the Future Basic Science Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This study was supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant KMIPA 2016-6010.

The changes in the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) patterns have important implications on the heavy rainfall activity due to significant alterations in the spatial distribution of existing land -surface properties. Hence, in order to make region (like Kodagu) more climate resilient; it is utmost important to construct a novel coupled framework for hydro-meteorological prediction to assess the impact of changing LULC (degradation of forest cover owing to urban expansion) on extreme rainfall events. Only a well-calibrated, validated, and optimized coupled high-resolution hydrological-atmospheric modelling system can be one of the best tools to study such complex problems. Thus in the present study, we have enhanced the forecasting capability of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by coupling with a physically based, fully distributed, WRF-Hydro. The evaluation of the proposed model configurations (stand-alone and coupled mode) is done with respect to two LULC datasets (USGS, 1992: less urbanized scenario and ISRO, 2017: more urbanized scenario) to explore the underlying causes and hydrological responses behind the 2018 Kodagu flood event. The simulations have been contended with both the stand-alone and coupled WRF/WRF-hydro models with different LULC datasets and a comparative evaluation have been carried out. The simulated vari-ables (rainfall, runoff, surface fluxes, and peak stream discharge) are evaluated and compared with observation to assess the impact of changing LULC pattern during the flood event.","[Sarkar, Sumana; Himesh, S.] CSIR Fourth Paradigm Inst, Wind Tunnel Rd, Bangalore 560037, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Fourth Paradigm Institute (CSIR 4PI),"Sarkar, S (corresponding author), CSIR Fourth Paradigm Inst, Wind Tunnel Rd, Bangalore 560037, India.",sarksumana@gmail.com; himesh@csir4pi.in,,,"CSIR, Government of India [31/66 (0007) /2019-EMR-I, 331096/2K18/1]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); United States National Science Foundation","CSIR, Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is supported and funded by CSIR, Government of India (grant no.31/66 (0007) /2019-EMR-I dated 28-03-2019, ack. no. 331096/2K18/1) .

In addition to its clean property, hydrogen exhibits a higher efficiency for fuel cell applications compared to heat engines. Although hydrogen is one of the most common elements on Earth, it is not readily available in its elemental form in nature, indicating that it is a secondary energy source that requires the processing of hydrocarbons or water. Currently, hydrogen is predominantly produced using fossil fuels (96%), and the large-scale production of hydrogen from natural gas has already been commercialized. However, the increasing demand for on-site/distributed power generation systems has necessitated the development of a smallscale hydrogen production process. This scale-down induces a decrease in thermal efficiency and an increase in processing capacity, which compels the development of an integrated and harmonized technology. Studies are being conducted on compact reformers in this regard. The core unit processes of compact reformer include steam reforming of methane (SRM), water-gas shift (WGS), and preferential CO oxidation (PROX), with each process requiring the development of customized catalysts. This review introduces the basic thermodynamics and kinetics of these core unit processes, details their various issues, and provides a guide regarding current research trends on the development of customized catalysts for the unit processes of SRM, WGS, and PROX in compact reformers. State of the art for compact reformers are also introduced, showing that there are only several types of commercial compact reformers yet compared to their importance.","[Lee, Yeol-Lim; Roh, Hyun-Seog] Yonsei Univ, Dept Environm Engn, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Gangwon 26493, South Korea; [Lee, Kyubock] Chungnam Natl Univ, Grad Sch Energy Sci & Technol, 99 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34134, South Korea; [Ko, Chang Hyun] Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Chem Engn, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea",Yonsei University; Chungnam National University; Chonnam National University,"Roh, HS (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Environm Engn, 1 Yonseidae Gil, Gangwon 26493, South Korea.;Lee, K (corresponding author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Grad Sch Energy Sci & Technol, 99 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34134, South Korea.;Ko, CH (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Chem Engn, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.",kyubock.lee@cnu.ac.kr; chko@jnu.ac.kr; chko@jnu.ac.kr,,"Roh, Hyun-Seog/0000-0002-5064-2314",Korea Institute of Energy Research [B7-2424]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1C1C2005231],Korea Institute of Energy Research; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was conducted under the framework of research and development program of the Korea Institute of Energy Research (B7-2424) .

However, this work has been handicapped by a lack of state-of-the-art investigations of the targeted shale. Specifically, there is a need for an improved understanding of the role that paleoenvironmental aspects of the basin played in the organic enrichment of these deposits. The present study provides the insights into the paleoenvironmental and depositional history of various of shales of the Es-1 Member of Paleogene Shahejie Formation, Qikou Sag, Bohai Basin, and addresses the controlling factors of organic matter (OM) accumulation and preservation in these deposits based on petrographic characteristics, organic geochemistry, and major and trace elements data. Our results suggest that the organic-enriched Es-1 oil shale is a desirable exploration target, especially felsic and mixed shale. The felsic shale, mixed shale, dolostone and carbonate shale accumulated under relatively humid climatic conditions but in saline lacustrine environment. Climate, salinity, and redox conditions appear to have varied at least three times during the depositional history of the studied interval. Paleoenvironmental conditions favored stable productivity levels and only a modest supply of elastic detritus sediment resulting in a diminished rate of deposition. Felsic and mixed shale deposits that have the greatest source potential accumulated under more humid atmospheric and oxygen-depleted environmental conditions than dolostone and carbonate shale. The present study suggests infers that organic carbon content of the Es-1 oil shale was controlled principally by salinity and secondarily by primary productivity and redox conditions.","[Wu, Zhuoya] China Natl Petr Corp, Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xianzheng; Pu, Xiugang; Han, Wenzhong; Zhang, Wei] PetroChina Dagang Oilfield Co, Tianjin 300280, Peoples R China; [Wang, Enze] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lash, Gary] SUNY Coll Fredonia, Dept Geosci, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA; [Feng, Yue] China Univ Geosci, Sch Energy Resource, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China National Petroleum Corporation; China National Petroleum Corporation; Peking University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Fredonia; China University of Geosciences,"Zhao, XZ (corresponding author), PetroChina Dagang Oilfield Co, Tianjin 300280, Peoples R China.;Wang, EZ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wuzhuoya@petrochina.com.cn; xzzhao@petrochina.com.cn; wangez@stu.pku.edu.cn; Puxgang@petrochina.com.cn; Gary.Lash@fredonia.edu,,"Wu, Zhuoya/0000-0002-3885-0989",PetroChina Co Ltd.

The agricultural technique of short rotation coppice (SRC) has gained relevance to ease the pressure of the demand for wood from forests. Previous studies have implemented the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate such systems' potential environmental impacts. These studies present different outcomes, though a general pattern on the potential benefit of SRC is observed. The variation of relevant methodological options, such as goal and scope, system boundary, functional unit, reference system, data source, characterization models, and impact categories assessed can significantly affect the results. A consequence of this discrepancy is its effect on results' interpretation, making the absolute comparison of case studies challenging and hindering the understanding of the potential impacts of SRC LCAs in support of developing a sustainable bioeconomy. Therefore, the current research attempts to understand the methodological implementation of LCA in assessing SRC value chains. Through literature research, studies are analyzed based on the four LCA phases. One of the results of this study shows how most of the articles focus on assessing the impact category related to climate change, while other environmental issues that are particularly relevant for agricultural woody biomass systems are seldomly evaluated. By discussing the state of the art of SRC LCA, this review paper attempts to suggest improvements that will allow future LCA studies to reach a more comprehensive understanding of the overall environmental impact of SRC systems.","[Perdomo E., E.

Allele frequency trajectories over the few last generations contain rich information about the selection history of populations, which cannot be obtained from classical selection scan approaches based on present time data only. Here we apply a new statistical approach taking advantage of genomic time series and a state of the art statistic (nSL) based on present time data to disentangle both old and recent signatures of selection in the Asturiana de los Valles cattle breed. This local Spanish originally multipurpose breed native to Asturias has been selected for beef production over the last few generations. With the use of SNP chip and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, we detect candidate regions under selection reflecting the effort of breeders to produce economically valuable beef individuals, e.g., by improving carcass and meat traits with genes such as MSTN, FLRT2, CRABP2, ZNF215, RBPMS2, OAZ2, or ZNF609, while maintaining the ability to thrive under a semi-intensive production system, with the selection of immune (GIMAP7, GIMAP4, GIMAP8, and TICAM1) or olfactory receptor (OR2D2, OR2D3, OR10A4, and 0R6A2) genes. This kind of information will allow us to take advantage of the invaluable resources provided by gene bank collections from local less competitive breeds, enabling the livestock industry to exploit the different mechanisms fine-tuned by natural and human-driven selection on different populations to improve productivity.","[Boitard, Simon; Paris, Cyriel; Servin, Bertrand] Univ Toulouse, GenPhySE, INRA, INPT,INP ENVT, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Sevane, Natalia; Dunner, Susana] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet, Dept Anim Prod, Madrid, Spain; [Bazi-Kabbaj, Kenza] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, GABI, Jouy En Josas, France; [Bazi-Kabbaj, Kenza] INRA, SIGENAE, Jouy En Josas, France",INRAE; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Complutense University of Madrid; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Dunner, S (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet, Dept Anim Prod, Madrid, Spain.",dunner@ucm.es,"Sevane, Natalia/R-1920-2018","Sevane, Natalia/0000-0003-4766-6291; bazi-kabbaj, kenza/0000-0002-4319-5616",European Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme IMAGE project (Innovative Management of Genetic Resources H2020) [677353],European Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme IMAGE project (Innovative Management of Genetic Resources H2020),The project was funded by the European Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme IMAGE project (Innovative Management of Genetic Resources H2020: 677353).,,38,4,4,3,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.

It is necessary to predict high-accuracy ionospheric peak parameters for single frequency receivers. In this study, the state-of-the-art artificial neural network (ANN) technique optimized by the genetic algorithm is used to develop global ionospheric models for predicting foF2 and hmF2. The models are based on long-term multiple measurements including ionospheric peak frequency model (GIPFM) and global ionospheric peak height model (GIPHM). Predictions of the GIPFM and GIPHM are compared with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model in 2009 and 2013 respectively. This comparison shows that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of GIPFM are 0.82 MHz and 0.71 MHz in 2013 and 2009, respectively. This result is about 20%-35% lower than that of IRI. Additionally, the corresponding hmF2 median errors of GIPHM are 20% to 30% smaller than that of IRI. Furthermore, the ANN models present a good capability to capture the global or regional ionospheric spatial-temporal characteristics, e.g., the equatorial ionization anomaly and Weddell Sea anomaly. The study shows that the ANN-based model has a better agreement to reference value than the IRI model, not only along the Greenwich meridian, but also on a global scale. The approach proposed in this study has the potential to be a new three-dimensional electron density model combined with the inclusion of the upcoming Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC-2) data.","[Li, Wang; Zhao, Dongsheng; Zhang, Kefei] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Spatial Informat, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Wang; He, Changyong; Hu, Andong; Zhang, Kefei] RMIT Univ, SPACE Res Ctr, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [He, Changyong] ENSG, Cite Descartes, IGN, Champs Sur Marne, Marne La Vallee 77455, France; [Hu, Andong] CWI, Multiscale Grp, Sci Pk 123, Amsterdam 1098 XG, Netherlands",China University of Mining & Technology; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Zhang, KF (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Spatial Informat, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhang, KF (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, SPACE Res Ctr, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",liwang@cumt.edu.cn; dszhao@cumt.edu.cn; changyong.he@ign.fr; andong@cwi.nl; profkzhang@cumt.edu.cn,,"Li, Wang/0000-0001-6526-1509",National Natural Science Foundations of China [41730109]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (Surveying and Mapping); Jiangsu Dual Creative Talents; Jiangsu Dual Creative Teams Programme Projects awarded in 2017,National Natural Science Foundations of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (Surveying and Mapping); Jiangsu Dual Creative Talents; Jiangsu Dual Creative Teams Programme Projects awarded in 2017,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundations of China, grant number 41730109, the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (Surveying and Mapping) and the Jiangsu Dual Creative Talents and Jiangsu Dual Creative Teams Programme Projects awarded in 2017.",,37,8,8,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAR,2020,5,,,,,,866,10.3390/rs12050866,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12050866,,,17,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,LL4XB,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000531559300121,View Full Record in Web of Science

For example, the timings of plant life cycle events are very sensitive to weather conditions and are often used to assess the impacts of changes in weather and climate. Likewise, understanding crop phenology can have a large impact on agricultural strategies. To study phenology using remote sensing data, the timings of annual phenological events must be estimated from noisy time series that may have many missing values. Many current state-of-the-art methods consist of smoothing time series and estimating events as features of smoothed curves. A shortcoming of many of these methods is that they do not easily handle missing values and require imputation as a preprocessing step. In addition, while some currently used methods may be extendable to allow for temporal uncertainty quantification, uncertainty intervals are not usually provided with phenological event estimates. We propose methodology utilizing Bayesian dynamic linear models to estimate the timing of key phenological events from remote sensing data with uncertainty intervals. We illustrate the methodology on weekly vegetation index data from 2003 to 2007 over a region of southern India, focusing on estimating the timing of start of season and peak of greenness. Additionally, we present methods utilizing the Bayesian formulation and MCMC simulation of the model to estimate the probability that more than one growing season occurred in a given year.

This paper first considers four forces surrounding change and urban fragmentation: technology and the culture of compliance; connections between ecological literacy and sustainability; the uncertain ethics of public life, the relationship between education and place. Decision-making and management models such as ''muddling through'' and ''groping along'' are also examined as implementation techniques which others have used. A brief summary of the City of Vancouver context introduces the Urban Landscape Task Force and its report Greenways Public Ways. The mandate was to discover what the public valued in the urban landscape and to recommend ways to manage, protect, and enhance it. After a public process, research and deliberations, the Task Force noted a serious neglect of the public realm and all its attendant issues, and recommended 15 Essential Actions to the City Council. Barriers to implementing these public ideas in the political and bureaucratic climate of a land-poor but landscape-rich city are identified: the culture of conformity and compliance; the lost art of public conversation; political or bureaucratic fear of change and the unknown; lack of a sustainable vision for the city; public service overload; lost identity with public places; visual and ecological illiteracy; participation overkill; a lack of ''real'' examples. The conclusions are drawn from the Urban Landscape Task Force experience, and six strategies are suggested to implement public ideas: (1) reviving citizenship; (2) building partnerships; (3) making big moves; (4) making small moves and trial offerings; (5) modelling after nature and beauty; (6) educating for community-based literacy.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM,VANCOUVER,BC V6T 1Z4,CANADA; UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,SCH ARCHITECTURE,VANCOUVER,BC V6T 1Z4,CANADA",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,,,"Lobo, Diele/I-9106-2012",,,,,,31,9,9,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

In this regard, phosphorus (P) is a model nutrient that possesses the negative traits of depletion (will be exhausted in the next 100 years) and environmental degradation (causes eutrophication and climate change), and this has prompted the scientific community to search for options to solve P-related problems. To date, P recovery in the form of struvite from wastewater is one viable solution suggested by many scholars. Struvite can be recovered either in the form of NH4-struvite (MgNH4PO4 & BULL;6H2O) or K-struvite (MgKPO4 & BULL;6H2O). From struvite, K (MgKPO4 & BULL;6H2O) and N (MgNH4PO4 & BULL;6H2O) are important nutri-ents for plant growth, but N is more abundant in the environment than K (the soil's most limited nutrient), which requires a systematic approach during P recovery. Although K-struvite recovery is a promising approach, in-formation related to its crystallization is deficient. Here, we present the general concept of P recovery as struvite and details about K-struvite, such as the source of nutrients, factors (pH, molar ratio, supersaturation, temper-ature, and seeding), advantages (environmental, economic, and social), disadvantages (heavy metals, pathogenic organisms, and antibiotic resistance genes), and challenges (scale-up and acceptance). Overall, this study pro-vides insights into state-of-the-art K-struvite recovery from wastewater as a potential slow-release fertilizer that can be used as a macronutrient (P-K-Mg) source for plants as commercial grade-fertilizers.","[Yesigat, Asamin; Worku, Abebe; Bae, Wookeun] Addis Ababa Sci & Technol Univ, Coll Biol & Chem Engn, Dept Environm Engn, 16417, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Addisu] Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Mekonnen, Addisu] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Microbial Cellular & Mol Biol, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Feyisa, Gudina Legese] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Gatew, Shetie; Guadie, Awoke] Arba Minch Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Arba Minch, Ethiopia; [Han, Jing-Long; Liu, Wenzong; Wang, Aijie] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenzong; Wang, Aijie; Guadie, Awoke] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Key Lab Environm Biotechnol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",Addis Ababa University; University of Calgary; Addis Ababa University; Addis Ababa University; Arba Minch University; Harbin Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Guadie, A (corresponding author), Arba Minch Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Arba Minch, Ethiopia.;Wang, AJ; Guadie, A (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Key Lab Environm Biotechnol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",ajwang@rcees.ac.cn; awokeg@yahoo.com,"Liu, Wenzong/HGA-0862-2022; Mekonnen, Addisu/U-6087-2018","Liu, Wenzong/0000-0002-1331-6480; Mekonnen, Addisu/0000-0001-8403-1071; Guadie, Awoke/0000-0003-2753-4216",Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019PE0033],Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This work was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences- President?s International Fellowship Initiative (2019PE0033) .,,166,0,0,25,25,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

Traditional methods of measuring and quantifying emissions utilize chamber methods, bagging individual equipment, or require the release of a tracer gas. Advanced leak detection techniques have been developed over the past few years, utilizing technologies, such as optical gas imaging, mobile surveyors equipped with sensitive cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS), and manned aircraft and satellite approaches. More recently, sUAS-based approaches have been developed to provide, in some ways, cheaper alternatives that also offer sensing advantages to traditional methods, including not being constrained to roadways and being able to access class G airspace (0-400 ft) where manned aviation cannot travel. This work looks at reviewing methods of quantifying methane emissions that can be, or are, carried out using small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) as well as traditional methods to provide a clear comparison for future practitioners. This includes the current limitations, capabilities, assumptions, and survey details. The suggested technique for LDAQ depends on the desired accuracy and is a function of the survey time and survey distance. Based on the complexity and precision, the most promising sUAS methods are the near-field Gaussian plume inversion (NGI) and the vertical flux plane (VFP), which have comparable accuracy to those found in conventional state-of-the-art methods.","[Hollenbeck, Derek; Zulevic, Demitrius; Chen, Yangquan] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Mech Engn, Mech Embedded Syst & Automat MESA Lab, Merced, CA 95343 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Chen, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Dept Mech Engn, Mech Embedded Syst & Automat MESA Lab, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",dhollenbeck@ucmerced.edu; dzulevic@ucmerced.edu; ychen53@ucmerced.edu,"Chen, YangQuan/A-2301-2008","Chen, YangQuan/0000-0002-7422-5988; Zulevic, Demitrius/0000-0003-4735-6082; Hollenbeck, Derek/0000-0002-4782-1370",,,,,195,4,4,12,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-446X,,DRONES-BASEL,Drones-Basel,DEC,2021,4,,,,,,117,10.3390/drones5040117,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/drones5040117,,,42,Remote Sensing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Remote Sensing,XY0LQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000736675800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only two space-borne L-band sensors are currently operating: SMOS, launched end of 2009 and thus providing now a 10-year global data set and SMAP, launched beginning of 2015. This study provides a state-of-the-art scientific overview of the SMOS-IC retrieval data set based on the SMOS L-band observations. This SMOS product aims at improved performance and independence of auxiliary data, key features for robust applications. The SMOS-IC product includes both a soil moisture (SM) and a L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) data set which are currently at the basis of several studies evaluating the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on aboveground carbon stocks. Since the release of the first version, the algorithm has been significantly changed in support to key applications, but no document is available to report these changes. This paper fills this gap by analyzing key science questions related to the product development, reviewing application results and presenting an extensive description of the last version of the product (version 2) considering changes in comparison to the previous version (V105). For the future it is planned to merge the SMOS and SMAP L-VOD data sets to ensure L-VOD data continuity in the event of failure of one of the space-borne SMOS or SMAP sensors.","[Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Li, Xiaojun; Frappart, Frederic; Liu, Xiangzhuo; Wang, Mengjia; Le Masson, Erwan; Moisy, Christophe] INRAE, UMR ISPA 1391, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Frappart, Frederic] Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales LEGOS, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Fan, Lei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Al-Yaari, Amen] Sorbonne Univ, UMR METIS 7619, Case 105,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [De Lannoy, Gabrielle] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Wang, Mengjia] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",INRAE; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; KU Leuven; Beijing Normal University,"Wigneron, JP; Li, XJ (corresponding author), INRAE, UMR ISPA 1391, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.",jean-pierre.wigneron@inrae.fr; xiaojun.li@inrae.fr,"Al-Yaari, Amen/B-1444-2016; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/ABD-9939-2021","Al-Yaari, Amen/0000-0001-7530-6088; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/0000-0001-5345-3618; Li, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3831-4852; LIU, Xiangzhuo/0000-0002-1690-7083; Frappart, Frederic/0000-0002-4661-8274","SMOS project of the TOSCA Programme from CNES, France (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales); China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201804910838]","SMOS project of the TOSCA Programme from CNES, France (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council)","This work was supported by the SMOS project of the TOSCA Programme from CNES, France (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) and Xiaojun Li was sponsored by China Scholarship Council (CSC; 201804910838).

The Guadalquivir River Basin Case in Spain,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,,,English,Review,,,,,,Public participation; Drought; Water scarcity; Drought management plan; Guadalquivir River; Spain,,"In an ever-growing environment of uncertainty, complex interactions and climate extremes, the effective implementation of Public Participation (PP) into water management is sought as a key step to address water challenges and achieve holistic solutions. This requirement was already set out in the EU Water Framework Directive (Art. 14) 20 years ago. However, is PP successfully implemented in water management decisions, practices and policies nowadays? The literature review has revealed that there are few recent and detailed studies that assess this issue at the river basin scale. The aim of this paper is to contribute towards building evidence base on this topic. The learnings could be applied during the current consultation and development of the 3(rd) cycle River Basin Management Plans across EU. This study presents the complex and paradigmatic case of the Guadalquivir River Basin (GRB) in southern Spain. This work evaluates the real influence of PP on the most recent (2018) GRB Drought Management Plan (DMP) and draws important conclusions and recommendations in this regard. The findings showed that PP had, actually, negligible influence on shaping the final (2018) GRB DMP. In fact, there was a very limited incorporation of the local knowledge and experience received from participants, highlighting the absence of a truly inclusive participation strategy. In contrast to this, PP should proactively involve all interested parties at an early stage when there are still opportunities to alter the strategy. This could bring significant benefits such as taking more ownership and responsibility by water users.","[Hervas-Gamez, Carmen] Univ Granada, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, Dept Struct Mech & Hydraul Engn, C Dr Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18001 Granada, Spain; [Delgado-Ramos, Fernando] Univ Granada, ETSICCP, Inst Water Res, C Dr Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18001 Granada, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada,"Hervas-Gamez, C (corresponding author), Univ Granada, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, Dept Struct Mech & Hydraul Engn, C Dr Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18001 Granada, Spain.",karmina.doctorado@gmail.com; fdelgado@ugr.es,"Hervás-Gámez, Carmen/O-3797-2019","Hervás-Gámez, Carmen/0000-0002-1664-0753",,,,,13,5,5,2,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

In this paper we demonstrate how a Bayesian network-based decision support model can be used to summarize a large body of research and model projections about potential management alternatives and climate scenarios for the Baltic Sea. We demonstrate how this type of a model can act as an emulator and ensemble, integrating disciplines such as climatology, biogeochemistry, marine and fisheries ecology as well as economics. Further, Bayesian network models include and present the uncertainty related to the predictions, allowing evaluation of the uncertainties, precautionary management, and the explicit consideration of acceptable risk levels. The Baltic Sea example also shows that the two biogeochemical models frequently used in future projections give considerably different predictions. Further, inclusion of parameter uncertainty of the food web model increased uncertainty in the outcomes and reduced the predicted manageability of the system. The model allows simultaneous evaluation of environmental and economic goals, while illustrating the uncertainty of predictions, providing a more holistic view of the management problem.

Ammonia, being one of the most promising media for hydrogen storage, is regarded as an ideal carbonfree energy carrier. Moreover, ammonia exhibits critical superiority in long-distance transportation and storage, which are the essential bottlenecks yet to be solved for hydrogen. Furthermore, the electrochemical synthesis of 'green ammonia' from renewable energy and its efficient utilization to generate electricity can be well integrated with reversible solid oxide cell (R-SOC), which is a promising technology that provides a potential route to decarbonize a number of applications dependent on fossil fuels. For electrochemical ammonia synthesis using both solid oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) and proton ceramic electrolytic cell (PCEC), the state-of-the-art ammonia production rate can reach 8-9 x 10-9 mol s- 1 cm- 2 at temperatures as low as 400 degrees C. For direct ammonia conversion using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and proton ceramic fuel cell (PCFC), the best power density reported is comparable to that of the hydrogen fuel cells, reaching >1.2 W/cm2. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest advances in both aspects: electrochemical ammonia synthesis (also known as electrochemical Haber-Bosch Process) and direct ammonia fuel cells. The process mechanisms of two major types of electrochemical routes based on oxygen ion conductor and proton conductor have been reviewed, with a discussion on material development and stability issues.","[Wang, Bin; Li, Tao; Gong, Feng; Xiao, Rui] Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, MOE Key Lab Energy Thermal Convers & Control, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Chem & Energy Engn FCEE, Dept Energy Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Southeast University - China; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Li, T; Xiao, R (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, MOE Key Lab Energy Thermal Convers & Control, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",tao-li10@seu.edu.cn; ruixiao@seu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20210252]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [buctrc202115],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20210252) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. buctrc202115) .,,126,4,4,140,140,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3820,1873-7188,,FUEL PROCESS TECHNOL,Fuel Process.

These problems result in rapid development of precision agriculture as a management strategy, taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies. In precision agriculture, Variable Rate Application (VRA) technology is focused on the automated application of materials (such as fertilizers, herbicides, and irrigation water) to a given crop field. It involves different approaches, including sensor-based systems for monitoring and assessment of crop status and field environmental conditions. For operational success of VRA reliable data is needed to indicate the variety of processes taking place in the farm field. In the present research, we present spectral signature data for the status of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) development in different growth stages. Spectral signatures vary depending on environmental conditions and related effects for the agroecosystems such as drought stress, crop diseases, and crop nutrient deficiencies. The generated spectral signature profiles are based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data, acquired in three consecutive growing seasons, distinguished with different ecological conditions. Spectral vegetation indices, indirectly representing the manifestation of biophysical processes and drought stress are calculated for each profile. Field climatic data is used for differentiation of the ecological conditions and validation of the results. The present research supports the creation of spectral library and can be used to create machine learning algorithms for monitoring of winter wheat status and application of variable rate technology.","[Avetisyan, Daniela] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Space Res & Technol Inst, Acad G Bonchev Str Bl 1, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Cvetanova, Galya] Agricultural Acad, Agr Expt Stn Lom, Belogradchischko Schose Str 1, Lom 3600, Bulgaria",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Avetisyan, D (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Space Res & Technol Inst, Acad G Bonchev Str Bl 1, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",davetisyan@space.bas.bg,,,Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science [577 / 17.08.2018],Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science,This work was supported by the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science under the National Research Programme Young scientists and postdoctoral students approved by DCM # 577 / 17.08.2018,,37,0,0,2,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-4557-8; 978-1-5106-4556-1,PROC SPIE,,,2021,,,,,,,118561A,10.1117/12.2599674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2599674,,,10,"Agricultural Engineering; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Optics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics,BT1CH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000796431900032,View Full Record in Web of Science

A state-of-the-art phase averaged spectral wave model, MIKE 21 Spectral Wave, in association with the wave-structure interaction software tool WAMIT, has been employed to study the impact of energy extraction by large arrays of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) on the wave height alteration in the neighbourhood of WEC arrays. Two generic types of WEC, one representing surface attenuators (deployed in deep water) and other representing Oscillating Wave Surge Converters (deployed in shallow waters) are used for numerical modelling. The power extraction performance of the WECs are initially modelled using WAMIT and validated with data from literature. As MIKE 21 SW has limited ability in modelling complete dynamics of a moving structure, each WEC has been modelled as a generic structure but with appropriate reflection, transmission and energy absorption properties derived from WAMIT, and this methodology is found to have worked well. In total there are 198 attenuators and 120 Oscillating Wave Surge Converters are constructed within the numerical model at potential energy locations in Orkney Waters, and the wave-WECs array interactions for the year 2010 have been simulated. The results suggest that the wave farm will have an impact on the wave climate immediately in the lee of the array, although the magnitude of these effects decreases monotonically with distance from the farm.

So far, field campaigns heavily equipped with aerosol mass spectrometers have been carried out mainly in large conurbations and in areas directly affected by their outflow, whereas lesser efforts have been dedicated to continental areas characterised by a less dense urbanisation. We present here the results obtained at a background site in the Po Valley, Italy, in summer 2009. For the first time in Europe, six state-of-the-art spectrometric techniques were used in parallel: aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS), two aerosol mass spectrometers (high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer HR-ToF-AMS and soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer - SP-AMS), thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography (TAG), chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS) and (offline) proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that, under high-pressure conditions, atmospheric stratification at night and early morning hours led to the accumulation of aerosols produced by anthropogenic sources distributed over the Po Valley plain. Such aerosols include primary components such as black carbon (BC), secondary semivolatile compounds such as ammonium nitrate and amines and a class of monocarboxylic acids which correspond to the AMS cooking organic aerosol (COA) already identified in urban areas. In daytime, the entrainment of aged air masses in the mixing layer is responsible for the accumulation of low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA) and also for the recycling of non-volatile primary species such as black carbon. According to organic aerosol source apportionment, anthropogenic aerosols accumulating in the lower layers overnight accounted for 38% of organic aerosol mass on average, another 21% was accounted for by aerosols recirculated in residual layers but still originating in northern Italy, while a substantial fraction (41 %) was due to the most aged aerosols imported from transalpine areas. The different meteorological regimes also affected the BC mixing state: in periods of enhanced stagnation and recirculation of pollutants, the number fraction of the BC-containing particles determined by ATOFMS was 75% of the total, while in the days of enhanced ventilation of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), such fraction was significantly lower (50 %) because of the relative greater influence of non-BC-containing aerosol local sources in the Po Valley. Overall, a full internal mixing between BC and the non-refractory aerosol chemical components was not observed during the experiment in this environment.","[Decesari, S.; Paglione, M.; Facchini, M.

Modeling the halocline, however, remains a challenge in current state-of-the-art coupled ocean sea ice models including those that participated in the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. In this study, we successfully reproduce a cold halocline in the Canada Basin by implementing a subgrid-scale brine rejection parameterization in an ocean general circulation model. The brine rejection scheme improves the solution by redistributing surface salts rejected during sea ice formation to their neutral buoyancy depths. The depths are based on salt plume physics and published laboratory and numerical experiments. Compared with hydrographic data from 1993 to 2004, distribution of most of the rejected salt to the bottom of the mixed layer seems to yield the lowest model-data misfits. We also show that the model's mixed layer depth is sensitive to the background diffusivity nu used in the k-profile parameterization vertical mixing scheme. A background diffusivity of 10(-6) m(2)/s in combination with brine rejection scheme described herein yield the best simulation of the Arctic halocline.","[Nguyen, A.

These phenomena have reignited interest in using a range of industrial waste products to make geopolymer composites and alkali activated binders, with the goal of reducing the use of regular Portland cement in building construction. One of these toxic radioactive waste substances is red mud (RM), which is produced as a byproduct of Bayer's aluminium (Al) production process. The objective of this study is to undertake a state-of-the-art review of the literature on the usage of red mud and fly ash (FA) in the production of red mud-fly ash geopolymer composites (RM-FAGPC). The environmental and economic implications, physical and chemical characteristics, manufacturing, distribution, categorization, and prospective uses of red mud are all discussed. Furthermore, current advances in the use of red mud and FA for geopolymer synthesis in terms of physical, mechanical, durability, and microstructure characteristics are highlighted. Furthermore, this research aims to design a path toward a realistic valorisation that considers both actual and perceived problems, including leaching, radioactivity, and the life cycle evaluation of red mud geopolymer composites (RM-GPC). The potential usage of RM-FAGPC manufacturing highlights the need for more research into the combination and proportion of these two raw materials with other cement-based materials, which might lead to novel, cost-effective, and energy-saving construction processes and products. It is also suggested that investigative efforts be focused on ecological, economic, and life cycle analyses.","[Qaidi, Shaker M.

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-Follow-On (GRACE-FO) is a dual-satellite mission. Each satellite carries platform magnetometers which are used for navigation and attitude control, they are subject to noise and artificial disturbance signals. Calibrating these magnetometers, thus removing artificial magnetic disturbances, will yield datasets that have a valuable impact for modeling the variability of the Earth's magnetic field with higher spatiotemporal coverage. In this work we propose a new method, modeling the calibration of the magnetic data with machine learning methods. Therefore, neural networks are employed and adjusted to specific challenges of satellite missions. One of the challenges includes an intrinsic time shift in the data of this mission. We propose an interpolation neuron that generates data while finding an arbitrary time shift in the data, thus co-estimating the model and the time shift. Additionally, sample weights have been added to counteract the partial lack of ground truth, recovering the extrapolation possibilities of the neural network at high latitudes. Evaluation experiments have shown promising results, achieving a meaningful calibration that still maintains external natural magnetic phenomena signals while lowering the overall residual by 23.8% on average compared to current state-of-the-art methods. For the two satellites the mean absolute error is 8.43nT, respectively 8.62nT on average over the mission duration. The resulting calibrated dataset will be published and made available together with this publication.","[Styp-Rekowski, Kevin; Kao, Odej] Tech Univ Berlin, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Stolle, Claudia; Michaelis, Ingo] GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Styp-Rekowski, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",styp-rekowski@tu-berlin.de,,"Styp-Rekowski, Kevin/0000-0001-8267-521X; Michaelis, Ingo/0000-0001-9741-4063",,,,,22,1,1,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2639-1589,,978-1-6654-3902-2,IEEE INT CONF BIG DA,,,2021,,,,,5283,5290,,10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671977,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT1RU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000800559505048,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the impact of such measurements to constrain modelled O-3 distributions within global assimilation systems is not yet unequivocal. A new tropospheric O-3 reanalysis is computed for the year 2010 by means of assimilating measurements from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) within the MOdele pour la Chimie A Grande Echelle (MOCAGE) chemical transport model. The objective is to evaluate the impact of recent methodological improvements of the data assimilation scheme on the O-3 distribution. The new O-3 reanalysis (named IASI-r) and its precursor (IASI-a) have been validated against ozonesondes, and compared to independent estimations of tropospheric O-3 and to results from two state-of-the-art products based on detailed tropospheric chemistry (the Goddard Earth Observing System with a coupled chemistry-climate model, GEOS-CCM, and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, CAMS, reanalysis). The main difference between IASI-r and IASI-a concerns the treatment of IASI observations, with radiances being assimilated directly in IASI-r instead of intermediate Level 2 O-3 retrievals. IASI-r is found to correct major issues with IASI-a, such as the neutral or negative impact of IASI assimilation in the extra-tropics and the presence of residual biases in the tropics. IASI-r also compares relatively well to the CAMS reanalysis, which is based on a more comprehensive chemical mechanism and the assimilation of several ultraviolet (UV) and microwave measurements.","[Emili, Emanuele; El Aabaribaoune, Mohammad] Univ Toulouse Cerfacs, CECI, CNRS, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Emili, E (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse Cerfacs, CECI, CNRS, Toulouse, France.",emili@cerfacs.fr,,,Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (TOSCA IASI),Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (TOSCA IASI),This research has been supported by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (TOSCA IASI).,,47,0,0,0,1,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

This has led to the resurrection of vegetal concrete building materials using biomass, which have the added benefits of carbon sequestration apart from low embodied energy and renewability. Vegetal concretes are made up of an organic or inorganic binder, and biomass originating from agro-forestry industries such as rice husk, straw bale, hemp, kenaf, cork, and so on. Hemp concrete, a variety of vegetal concrete has been widely researched and is arguably one of the most researched building materials in current times. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of hemp concrete research, with a view to identifying research gaps that shall guide future research for its implementation in the fast-growing green buildings industry. The reviewed aspects of hemp concrete include properties of hemp relevant to construction, binder characteristics, mechanical properties, durability, hygric and thermal properties, environmental credentials, manufacturing processes, and current applications. Several research gaps with regards to the hydraulicity of the binder, strength and durability, and fire resistance of hemp concrete were identified. It was also established that hemp concrete has very low embodied carbon and embodied energy, making it ideal for green building applications. The paper ends with a discussion outlining the need and direction for future research on improving the manufacturing processes and mechanical performance of hemp concrete for wider adoption by the construction industry.

Geomagnetic reversals are regarded as excellent age constraints because they are global events and independent from climatic conditions. However, spatial variations of timing and internal dynamics of reversals may limit their precision. Our 1.2 Ma high-resolution (similar to 25 cm/kyr) sediment record from Lake Ohrid is promising to precisely depict the Matuyama-Brunhes (MB) reversal and the Jaramillo subchron. Two generations of diagenetic ferrimagnetic minerals are present in glacial intervals of the Lake Ohrid record. Early diagenetic greigite acquired a quasi synsedimentary chemical magnetization, while a late diagenetic greigite formation, triggered by the upward diffusion of H2S-rich waters, obscures the polarity record at the top of the Jaramillo. Interglacial intervals are unaffected by greigite formation, likely due to low iron concentrations. Based on an orbitally tuned age model with tephrostratigraphic markers, the base of Jaramillo can be precisely dated to 1072.4 ka, and the MB reversal to 778.5 ka. Both polarity reversals occurred very rapidly in our record, lasting 2.3 and 1 kyr, respectively. Our results reveal that the dipole component of the Earth's magnetic field fell below the nondipole components only for a short duration in the Mediterranean region. The comparison of the timing of the MB boundary across different archives implies that the onset of the reversal provides a more synchronous age marker compared to often used midpoint ages.","[Just, J.] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany; [Sagnotti, L.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Rome, Italy; [Nowaczyk, N.

It is most abundant in the troposphere at low altitudes, due to evaporation at the ocean surface, with maximum values of around 6 g/kg. The amount of water vapor reaches a minimum at tropopause level and increases again in the middle atmosphere through oxidation of methane and vertical transport. Water vapor has both positive and negative effects on global warming, and we need to study how it works on climate change by monitoring water vapor concentration in the middle atmosphere. In this paper, we focus on the 22 GHz ground-based radiometer called SWARA (Seoul Water vapor Radiometer) which has been operated at Sookmyung women's university in Seoul, Korea since Oct. 2006. It is a joint project of the University of Bern, Switzerland, and the Sookmyung Women's University of Seoul, South Korea. The SWARA receives 22.235 GHz emitted from water vapor spontaneously and converts down to 1.5 GHz with +/-0.5 GHz band width in 61 kHz resolution. To represent 22.235 GHz water vapor spectrum precisely, we need some calibration methods because the signal shows very weak intensity in similar to 0.1 K on the ground. For SWARA, we have used the balancing and the tipping curve methods for a calibration. To retrieve the water vapor profile, we have applied ARTS and Qpack software. In this paper, we will present the calibration methods and water vapor variation over Seoul for the last 4 years.","[Ka, Soohyun; Oh, Jung Jin] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Reaserch Inst Global Environm, 52 Hyochangwon Gil, Seoul 140742, South Korea; [de Wachter, Evelyn; Kaempfer, Niklaus] Univ Bern, Inst Appl Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Sookmyung Women's University; University of Bern,"Ka, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Reaserch Inst Global Environm, 52 Hyochangwon Gil, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",jjinoh@sookmyung.ac.kr,,"De Wachter, Evelyn/0000-0002-3464-5961",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-8389-8,PROC SPIE,,,2010,,,,,,,78590K,10.1117/12.869501,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.869501,,,7,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Remote Sensing; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Remote Sensing; Optics,BTO86,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000287654300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

This survey can be an eye-opener for researchers as its diverse applications of HDNNs in present scenario shows an intelligent way to mimic human brain without creating a complex neuronal architecture having large number of layers. HDNN's urgency is evident because in science many quantities are measured not by single values for each of them but a group of values defines 1 single unit as: signal has two values: amplitude and phase. The deficiency in present literature on the questions allied with HDNN application looks like sluggish down research focal point and growth in the area. Hence, there exists a call for state-of-the-art addressing high-dimensional problems in neural networks. The study equips readers with a lucid acquaintance of the existing and novel inclination in HDNN replicas. A lot of applications of HDNNs in various disciplines like: healthcare, climate, security, speech recognition, computer vision, music signal processing, production, stock, science, etc. are covered here to confirm advancement in HDNNs. Study divulges that HDNNs is prevalently known as: CVNN, QVNN, 3D VVNN, and OVNN. This paper also reveals that HDNNs have outperformed real valued neural networks in terms of resource utilization, training data set requirement, and accuracy of results.

Upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) has already demonstrated to be a viable alternative to standard polysilicon in terms of cost and quality. This study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of UMG obtained by the FerroSolar process. Moreover, it shows the environmental impacts of PV modules and electricity generation based on this material. For this, an exhaustive review of the life cycle inventory (LO) of PV value chain, from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) down to electricity generation, has been carried out updating inputs for all processes. The Balance of System (BoS) has also been updated with current state of the art data for a fixed open ground large PV site (100 MWpk). Two different electricity mixes, with low and high carbon intensities, have been considered. The results reveal that for PV electricity generation using UMG-Si instead of polysilicon leads to an overall reduction of Climate change (CC) emissions of over 20%, along with an improvement of the Energy Payback Time (EPBT) of 25%, achieving significantly low values, 12 gCO(2eq)/kWh(e) and 0.52 years, respectively. Moreover, it is shown that UMG silicon feedstock is not the main contributor to the carbon and energy footprint of the produced electricity, leaving the first place to PV module manufacturing.

As the climate changes and urban populations grow, the number of people around the world at risk of surface water flooding is increasing. Although it may not be possible to prevent such flooding, reliable and timely flood forecasts can help improve preparedness and recovery. Unlike riverine and coastal flooding where forecasting methods are well established, surface water flood forecasting presents a unique challenge due to the high uncertainties around predicting the location, timing, and impact of what are typically localized events. Over the past 5 years, there has been rapid development of convection-permitting numerical weather prediction models, ensemble forecasting, and computational ability. It is now theoretically feasible to develop operational surface water forecasting systems. This paper identifies three approaches to surface water forecasting utilizing state-of-the-art meteorological forecasts: empirical-based scenarios, hydrological forecasts linked to presimulated impact scenarios, and real-time hydrodynamic simulation. Reviewing operational examples of each approach provides an opportunity to learn from international best practice to develop targeted, impact-based, surface water forecasts to support informed decision-making. Although the emergence of new meteorological and hydrological forecasting capabilities is promising, there remains a scientific limit to the predictability of convective rainfall. To overcome this challenge, we suggest that a rethink of the established role of flood forecasting is needed, alongside the development of interdisciplinary solutions for communicating uncertainty and making the best use of all available data to increase preparedness.

Personalised, actionable advice can give people tips on which actions they can take to reduce residential energy usage, such as lowering the thermostat temperature. For this advice to be relevant it is important to understand the quantitative impact of thermostat setpoints on daily gas usage for each individual household. In this article, this impact is estimated by comparing three machine learning approaches. Linear regression, deep learning and gradient boosting machine are applied to a multi-dimensional time series dataset for 300 Dutch households. The three approaches are compared based on three metrics: root mean square error (RMSE), explainability and scalability. The results of the best model (gradient boosting machine) are explained using a technique called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This interpretation method can quantify the contribution of all inputs, among which thermostat setpoints, to the daily gas usage prediction of the model for different individual households. This article adds to the current state of the art by focusing on the impact of influenceable thermostat setpoints, as opposed to less actionable factors such as house size, insulation status of the house and weather. By applying SHAP, the personal impact and differences between individual households are estimated, in contrast to only learning trends. Moreover, a machine learning model, trained on a representative dataset, is applicable at scale to other households for estimating a personal, quantified impact of setpoint choices.","[Liu, Jueming; van der Vlist, Rik; Verseput, Ellissa] Eneco Groep NV, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Liu, J (corresponding author), Eneco Groep NV, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",jueming.liu@eneco.com; rik.vandervlist@eneco.com; ellissa.verseput@eneco.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,4,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2643-2978,,978-1-7281-5730-6,IEEE INT CONF INDUST,,,2021,,,,,1261,1266,,10.1109/ICIT46573.2021.9453677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIT46573.2021.9453677,,,6,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS1DQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000687856000194,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model includes a continuous delivery scheme based on building blocks for constructing software pipelines from the edge to the cloud. It also includes a data preparation scheme based on parallel patterns for establishing, in an efficient manner, controls over the production and consumption of IoT data. This scheme adds data properties such as cost-efficiency storage, security, and reliability, which are useful to avoid alterations in data and repudiation situations as well as to mitigate risks still arisen in the cloud such as confidentiality violations and service outages. An overlay structure, including planes such as pub/sub, control, and preservation, integrates the proposed schemes into software pipelines. The proposed model was developed in both prototype and simulator of software pipelines. Case studies were conducted based on pipeline services deployed from the edge, passing from the fog to the cloud for processing and managing real climate data repositories, which were produced by three different data sensor sources, such as ground stations deployed on Mexico and Spain, as well as small distributed IoT devices. Information sharing patterns for end-users to retrieve raw and/or processed IoT data were also studied. The experimental evaluation revealed the feasibility of using continuous delivery scheme to create dataflows from the edge to the cloud, the efficacy of the overlay structure to create information sharing patterns, as well as the efficiency of data preparation schemes and parallel patterns to improve the end-user service experience in comparison with traditional state-of-the-art solutions.","[Sanchez-Gallegos, Dante D.; Carrizales-Espinoza, Diana; Reyes-Anastacio, Hugo G.; Gonzalez-Compean, J.

AGB estimation based on remote sensing is an effective method for regional scale. In this study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-1A data and China's National Forest Continuous Inventory data in combination with three algorithms, either the linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), or the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to estimate biomass of the subtropical forests in Hunan Province, China. XGBoost is a scalable tree boosting system that is widely used by data scientists and provides state-of-the-art results for many problems. It can process an entire dataset with billions of examples using a minimal amount of computational resources through the particular way of cache access patterns, data compression, and data fragmentation. The results include: (1) The combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A images as predictor variables in the XGBoost model provided the best AGB estimation. (2) In contrast to the LR method, the F-test results indicated that a significant improvement in AGB estimation was achieved with the RF and XGBoost algorithms. (3) The effect of parameter optimization was found to be more significant on XGBoost than on RF. (4) The XGBoost model is an effective method for AGB estimation and can reduce the problems of overestimation and underestimation.

Geddes appears to have been the first person in Britain to adopt the term landscape architect to denote a profession in the American sense as someone who dealt with city planning, civic design and parks systems. This profession seemed to encompass his wide ranging interests, providing a suitable vehicle for his transdisciplinary approaches, but which he later transferred to that of town and regional planning. His approach to understanding landscapes was to study towns and regions from a cultural, ecological and economic perspective in a systematic way of survey, analysis and design. Geddes's methods were gradually adopted by the landscape architecture profession, and purely Beaux Arts-architectural approaches phased out. By tracing contemporary references, this paper highlights key individuals who helped to promote his ideas in the landscape architecture profession then and now, and shows how his enduring influence and longstanding impact have to do with the systematic approach and methods he set forth. Today similar approaches are being promoted by other professions, but with a different perspective, and suggests that rather than various disciplines setting up silos, trying to defend their territories, with climate change and food security looming it is timely to promote more integrated approaches. This is well in line with Geddes's ideas who not only encouraged interdisciplinarity, but also warned against inadvertent specialisation.","[Woudstra, Jan] Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Woudstra, J (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.woudstra@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,3,3,2,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

At the end of this writing, researchers have concluded that the indigenous form of region, which has a small urban spaces and enclosed, dense urban texture and the buildings joined together, the direction of the Sun, and earth accidents are the determinant factors in the building settlement, the main thoroughfares and alleys, built parallel to the ground level line with low width, and has influences, such as the expansion of the overall profile of the city, as well as the lack of penetration of cold in the building, and also affects their life style. Also based on the obtained results, the components of the current architectural indigenous form of the region can influence on sustainable architecture and optimal energy saving.","[Kaykhosravi, Himan] Iranmehr Univ, Qorveh, Iran; [Farshchian, Amirhossein] Tabriz Islamic Art Univ, Sch Architecture, Architecture, Tabriz, Iran",,"Kaykhosravi, H (corresponding author), Iranmehr Univ, Qorveh, Iran.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS,SEOUL,"DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1738-7906,,,INT J COMPUT SCI NET,Int.

These theories are cause and effect of cities that are built under these names, supported by global agreements and networks that follow their development. This study aims to identify the principles that from the various theories contribute to the construction of the contemporary city, the objective being to identify and define the principles that sustain the contemporary city, separating them from the actors and interests that could be taking over one or another concept and aligning itself with the valuation of the city as a product at the service of the Society as a whole. A review of the state of the art is made, with a bibliometric exploratory phase supported by the Vosviewer software and another qualitative phase reviewing (29) articles published in the journals with the greatest impact according to Scimago rank. The results show that many principles overlap, while some components less treated at a general level should be strengthened, revealing the possibility of channeling and joining forces.

To date, observations of ecosystem-scale methane (CH4) fluxes in forests are currently lacking in the global CH4 budget. The environmental factors controlling CH4 flux dynamics remain poorly understood at the ecosystem scale. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art eddy covariance technique to continuously measure the CH4 flux from 2016 to 2018 in a subtropical forest of Zhejiang Province in China, quantify the annual CH4 budget and investigate its control factors. We found that the total annual CH4 budget was 1.15 +/- 0.28 similar to 4.79 +/- 0.49 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) for 2017-2018. The daily CH4 flux reached an emission peak of 0.145 g m(-2) d(-1) during winter and an uptake peak of -0.142 g m(-2) d(-1) in summer. During the whole study period, the studied forest region acted as a CH4 source (78.65%) during winter and a sink (21.35%) in summer. Soil temperature had a negative relationship (p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.344) with CH4 flux but had a positive relationship with soil moisture (p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.348). Our results showed that soil temperature and moisture were the most important factors controlling the ecosystem-scale CH4 flux dynamics of subtropical forests in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve in Zhejiang Province, China. Subtropical forest ecosystems in China acted as a net source of methane emissions from 2016 to 2018, providing positive feedback to global climate warming.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Zhihao; Lv, Jianhua; Peng, Changhui] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Ctr Ecol Forecasting & Global Change, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Hong] Chongqing Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Song, Xinzhang; Li, Quan] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hong] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec Montreal, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Northwest A&F University - China; Chongqing University; Zhejiang A&F University; Nanjing University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Peng, CH (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Ctr Ecol Forecasting & Global Change, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Peng, CH (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",2016060224@nwafu.edu.cn; lihom@cqu.edu.cn; zhihaoliu@nwafu.edu.cn; 2018060235@nwafu.edu.cn; songxinzhang@gmail.com; 2017060240@nwafu.edu.cn; jianghong@nju.edu.cn; peng.changhui@uqam.ca,"Chen, Huai/AAI-1024-2020","Chen, Huai/0000-0001-7650-289X; Song, Xinzhang/0000-0003-2434-7466; Peng, Changhui/0000-0003-2037-8097",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC050020],National Key R&D Program of China,"This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China, grant number: 2016YFC050020.",,95,0,0,15,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,SEP,2021,9,,,,,,975,10.3390/land10090975,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10090975,,,15,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UV6BN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000699561400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current state-of-the-art for evaluating asphalt mixtures for use on projects relies on either single-mechanism laboratory conditioning such as oxidation in AASHTO R30, or test methods that cannot accumulate combined effects such as indirect tensile strength in AASHTO T283. This article evaluated hundreds of laboratory-conditioned and field-aged specimens in a hot and no-freeze climate to demonstrate a laboratory conditioning protocol that was able to simulate at least 4 years of field aging, whereas conventional single-mechanism protocols were not. Temperature and moisture conditions within asphalt mixtures were measured over time and used as part of the assessment. The conditioning protocol that showed the most promise consisted of combined exposure to oxidation, moisture, and freeze-thaw mechanisms. The specific combined-effects conditioning protocol used here was 5 days of oxidation at 85 degrees C, 14 days of moisture while submerged in 64 degrees C water, and one freeze-thaw cycle. Other combined-effects protocols could be more suitable for other environments or situations; the main point of this article is that inclusion of oxidation, moisture, and freeze-thaw conditioning into one protocol is promising. The environmental conditions and mechanical property test data presented here suggest the asphalt industry needs to be harsher on mixes during laboratory evaluations, and that combined environmental effects conditioning should be given implementation consideration.","[Bazuhair, Rabeea W.] Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Howard, Isaac L.] Mississippi State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Middleton, Alex] Mississippi Dept Transportat, Jackson, MS USA; [Jordan, Walter S., III] Paragon Tech Serv Inc, Richland, MS USA; [Cox, Ben C.] US Army, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr ERDC, Vicksburg, MS USA",Umm Al Qura University; Mississippi State University; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC),"Howard, IL (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",ilhoward@cee.msstate.edu,,"Bazuhair, Rabeea/0000-0002-1355-9052",,,,,44,2,2,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

The decarbonization of an automotive factory requires a holistic and systemic understanding of all ecologically-relevant resource flows, the implementation of adequate mitigation solutions and a life-cycle thinking in planning and operation. The application of a life cycle perspective on a factory has merely been conceptual, which imposes the need for a the development of an adequate systemic understanding, a quantified analysis and the identification of challenges associated with decarbonization. A Life Cycle Assessment has been conducted to quantify the life cycle of a state-of-the-art automotive factory (for the first time), identify decarbonization challenges and provide a differentiated analysis as a basis for planning and decision-making in practice. The applied case study provided various insights: (i) the use stage represents the most GWP-intensive life cycle stage; (ii) efficiency, substitutional and compensation approaches are necessary to achieve a full decarbonization; (iii) use stage-related mitigation is not sufficient to achieve a low-pathway (iv) decarbonization requires the interplay of planners, operators and suppliers of process material, machinery and construction and (vi) electric vehicle production increases the GWP-intensity of the production.

A recent trend has been to downsize and turbocharge automotive spark-ignited engines coupled with direct fuel injection to improve engine efficiency while maintaining vehicle performance. In-line with recent trends in state-of-the-art engine technology, the focus of this study is lean and EGR dilute combustion in a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine. The lean and dilute operating limits are defined by combustion stability typically in terms of COV IMEP so experiments were carried out on an automotive size single-cylinder research engine to characterize combustion stability. From a 20,000 cycle sequence analysis, lean operating conditions exhibit binary high-to low-IMEP cycle sequences. This may be because the cycle-to-cycle feedback mechanisms are physically limited to one or two cycles. Longer sequences are observed with EGR likely because the EGR loop introduces a much longer transient feedback mechanism. Results from a sensitivity study with induced variability show that COV IMEP is far less sensitive to ignition perturbation than to injection perturbation while the sensitivity is similar in terms of efficiency. This is true for both lean and EGR dilute operation; however, one difference that stands out with EGR is the sensitivity of COV IMEP to ignition perturbation. Increased sensitivity to ignition perturbation is likely the result of longer ignition delay which is critical for early flame kernel development.","[Matthias, Nicholas; Wallner, Thomas; Scarcelli, Riccardo] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 South Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Wallner, T (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 South Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA.",twallner@anl.gov,,,"DOE's Vehicle Technologies Program, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory [DE-AC0206CH11357]","DOE's Vehicle Technologies Program, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research is funded by DOE's Vehicle Technologies Program, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

To address this question, seeds of 140 maternal families of Brassica rapa were generated from collections made before (1997) and after (2004) a natural drought. These seeds were planted in the glasshouse and grown under low-water and high-water conditions. Post-drought lines flowered earlier than pre-drought lines, showing an evolutionary shift to earlier flowering. There was significant genetic variation and genotype by environment (G x E) interactions in flowering time, indicating genetic variation in plasticity in this trait. Plants that flowered earlier had fewer leaf nodes and lower instantaneous (A/g) and integrated (delta 13C) water use efficiency than late-flowering plants. These results suggest that B. rapa plants escape drought through early flowering rather than avoid drought through increased water use efficiency. The mechanism of this response appears to be high transpiration and inefficient water use, leading to rapid development. These findings demonstrate a trade-off between drought avoidance and escape, and indicate that, in this system, where drought acts to shorten the growing season, selection for drought escape through earlier flowering is more important than phenotypic plasticity.","Fordham Univ, Dept Biol, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Fordham University,"Franks, SJ (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Dept Biol, 160 Larkin Hall,441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",franks@fordham.edu,,,Fordham University,Fordham University,"I thank Chris Herman, Esther Ko, Phong Le, Angelene Ng, Karo Torosian and many other students for help with data collection.

The applications of those geospatial technologies are expected to enable better mitigation of, and adaptation to, the disastrous impact of natural hazards. The description of risks may particularly benefit from the integrated use of new algorithms and monitoring techniques. The ability of new tools to carry out intensive analyses over huge datasets makes it possible to perform future risk assessments, keeping abreast of temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

Here we discuss the methodology for producing these annual LUH2-GCB updates and extensions which incorporate annual wood harvest data updates from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations for dataset years after 2015 and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) gridded cropland and grazing area data updates (based on annual FAO cropland and grazing area data updates) for dataset years after 2012, along with extrapolations to the current year due to a lag of 1 or more years in the FAO data releases. The resulting updated LUH2-GCB datasets have provided global, annual gridded land-use and land-use-change data relating to agricultural expansion, deforestation, wood harvesting, shifting cultivation, regrowth and afforestation, crop rotations, and pasture management and are used by both bookkeeping models and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) for the GCB. For GCB 2019, a more significant update to LUH2 was produced, LUH2-GCB2019 (https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1851, Chini et al., 2020b), to take advantage of new data inputs that corrected cropland and grazing areas in the globally important region of Brazil as far back as 1950. From 1951 to 2012 the LUH2-GCB2019 dataset begins to diverge from the version of LUH2 used for the World Climate Research Programme's CMIP6, with peak differences in Brazil in the year 2000 for grazing land (difference of 100 000 km(2)) and in the year 2009 for cropland (difference of 77 000 km(2)), along with significant sub-national reorganization of agricultural land-use patterns within Brazil. The LUH2-GCB2019 dataset provides the base for future LUH2-GCB updates, including the recent LUH2-GCB2020 dataset, and presents a starting point for operationalizing the creation of these datasets to reduce time lags due to the multiple input dataset and model latencies.","[Chini, Louise; Hurtt, George; Sahajpal, Ritvik; Ma, Lei] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Frolking, Steve] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Goldewijk, Kees Klein] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England; [Ott, Lesley; Poulter, Benjamin] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Ganzenmueller, Raphael; Pongratz, Julia] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Goldewijk, Kees Klein] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pongratz, Julia] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Exeter; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Munich; Utrecht University; Max Planck Society,"Chini, L (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",lchini@umd.edu,"Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Hurtt, George/A-8450-2012; Frolking, Steve/ABF-9046-2021; Klein Goldewijk, Kees/L-5567-2013; ma, lei/GQI-3505-2022","Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; Hurtt, George/0000-0001-7278-202X; Frolking, Steve/0000-0001-6414-5004; Klein Goldewijk, Kees/0000-0003-2714-7507; Ganzenmuller, Raphael/0000-0002-2337-0915","NASA [80NSSC17K0348, 80NSSC17K0710, 80NSSC21K1059]; European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (VERIFY) [776810]; Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (VERIFY); Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","Financial support for this work was received from NASA (grant nos. 80NSSC17K0348 (NASA-IDS), 80NSSC17K0710 (NASA-CMS), and 80NSSC21K1059 (NASACMS)).

When oxygen (O-2) is reduced along with CO2 at the cathode of an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrochemical cell, carbonate and bicarbonate are formed which are transported through electrolyte by migration from the cathode to the anode where they are oxidized back to CO2 and O-2. This behavior makes AEM-based devices scientifically interesting CO2 separation devices or electrochemical CO2 pumps. Electrochemical CO2 separation is a promising alternative to the state-of-the-art solvent-based methods because the cells operate at low temperatures and scale with surface area, not volume, suggesting that the industrial electrochemical systems could be more compact than amine sorption technologies. In this work, we investigate the impact of the CO2 separator cell potential on the CO2 flux, carbonate transport mechanism, and process costs. The applied electrical current and CO2 flux showed a strong correlation that was both stable and reversible. The dominant anion transport pathway, carbonate versus bicarbonate, undergoes a shift from carbonate to mixed carbonate/bicarbonate with increased potential. A preliminary techno-economic analysis shows that despite the limitations of present cells, there is a clear pathway to meet the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 and 2035 targets for power plant retrofit CO2 capture systems through materials and systems-level advances.","[Rigdon, William A.; Omasta, Travis J.; Lewis, Connor; Mustain, William E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Rigdon, William A.; Omasta, Travis J.; Lewis, Connor; Mustain, William E.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Clean Energy Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Hickner, Michael A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Varcoe, John R.] Univ Surrey, Dept Chem, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Renner, Julie N.; Ayers, Kathy E.] Proton OnSite, Wallingford, CT 60492 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of Surrey,"Mustain, WE (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Mustain, WE (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Clean Energy Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",mustain@engr.uconn.edu,"Varcoe, John/E-5754-2011","Varcoe, John/0000-0001-9898-0235; Mustain, William/0000-0001-7804-6410; Renner, Julie/0000-0002-6140-4346; Rigdon, William/0000-0003-2810-8614","U.S. DOE Early Career Program [DE-SC0010531]; United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) [2011521]; EPSRC [EP/1004882/1]; EPSRC [EP/I004882/1, EP/M005933/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I004882/1, EP/M005933/1] Funding Source: researchfish",U.S. DOE Early Career Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The cell assembly and performance work in Professor Mustain's lab were supported by the U.S. DOE Early Career Program through Award No. DE-SC0010531.

Data availability may be increased by record extension methods. In the paper, we investigate the use of at neural networks (ANNs) fed with reanalysis wind data to extend an observed time series of significant wave heights. In particular, six-hourly 10 in a.s.l. u- and v-wind speed data of the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I (NRA1) project are used to perform an extension of observed significant wave height series back to 1948 at the same time resolution. Wind for input is considered at several NRA1 grid-points and at several time lags as well, and the influence of the distance of input points and of the number of lags is analyzed to derive best-performing models, conceptually taking into account wind fetch and duration. Applications are conducted for buoys of the Italian Sea Monitoring Network of different climatic features, for which more than 15 years of observations are available. Results of the ANNs are compared to those of state-of-the-art wave reanalyses NOAA WAVEWATCH III/CFSR and ERA-Interim, and indicate that model performs slightly better than the former, which in turn outperforms the latter. The computational times for model training on a common workstation are typically of few hours, so the proposed method is potentially appealing to engineering practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This estimate is derived from a set of 28,000 CO2 mole fraction observations in the global atmosphere that are fed into a state-of-the-art data assimilation system for CO2 called CarbonTracker. By design, the surface fluxes produced in CarbonTracker are consistent with the recent history Of CO2 in the atmosphere and provide constraints on the net carbon flux independent from national inventories derived from accounting efforts. We find the North American terrestrial biosphere to have absorbed -0.65 PgC/yr (1 petagram = 10(15) g; negative signs are used for carbon sinks) averaged over the period studied, partly offsetting the estimated 1.85 PgC/yr release by fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing. Uncertainty on this estimate is derived from a set of sensitivity experiments and places the sink within a range of -0.4 to -1.0 PgC/yr. The estimated sink is located mainly in the deciduous forests along the East Coast (32%) and the boreal coniferous forests (22%). Terrestrial uptake fell to -0.32 PgC/yr during the large-scale drought of 2002, suggesting sensitivity of the contemporary carbon sinks to climate extremes. CarbonTracker results are in excellent agreement with a wide collection of carbon inventories that form the basis of the first North American State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR), to be released in 2007.

Apart from that, many other applications like autonomous driving or disaster management can benefit. However, the quality of the segmentation highly depends on the amount and quality of annotated training data and the applied segmentation method. This paper gives an overview and compares state-of-the-art PC segmentation methods including both 2D, 3D and combined approaches. Furthermore, current annotation tools and methods are evaluated regarding the accuracy, the number of classes, and time effort. Moreover, current strategies and methods to extend training data with augmented or synthetic data are listed and assessed. Besides, we present a concept for a specific segmentation task based on a trade-off of the previously listed methods. The task includes the segmentation and partial annotation of colourized PC data of two urban areas in Freiburg Germany, acquired from a driven and flying platform.

A promising way to addressing these issues is by developing and using water quality models. Many of these models have been developed in recent years to facilitate the management of SNs. Given the proliferation of different water quality models and the promise they have shown, it is timely to assess the state-of-the-art in this field, to identify potential challenges and suggest future research directions. In this review, model types, modeled quality parameters, modeling purpose, data availability, type of case studies and model performance evaluation are critically analyzed and discussed based on a review of 110 papers published between 2010 and 2019. The review identified that applications of empirical and kinetic models dominate those of data-driven models for addressing water quality issues. The majority of models are developed for prediction and process understanding using experimental or field sampled data. While many models have been applied to real problems, the corresponding prediction accuracies are overall moderate or, in some cases, low, especially when dealing with larger SNs. The review also identified the most common issues associated with water quality modeling of SNs and based on these proposed several future research directions. These include the identification of appropriate data resolutions for the development of different SN models, the need and opportunity to develop hybrid SN models and the improvement of SN model transferability.","[Jia, Yueyi; Zheng, Feifei] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Anzhong Bldg,Zijingang Campus,A501, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Maier, Holger R.; Creaco, Enrico] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Ostfeld, Avi] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Creaco, Enrico] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Architettura, Via Ferrata 3, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Savic, Dragan] KWR Water Res Inst, Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Savic, Dragan; Kapelan, Zoran] Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, North Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Savic, Dragan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Bangi, Malaysia; [Langeveld, Jeroen] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands; [Kapelan, Zoran] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Water Management, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Zhejiang University; University of Adelaide; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; University of Pavia; University of Exeter; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Zheng, FF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Anzhong Bldg,Zijingang Campus,A501, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.",yueyi@zju.edu.cn; feifeizheng@zju.edu.cn; holger.maier@adelaide.edu.au; ostfeld@technion.ac.il; enrico.creaco@unipv.it; Dragan.Savic@kwrwater.nl; J.G.Langeveld@tudelft.nl; z.kapelan@tudelft.nl,"Savic, Dragan A/G-2071-2012; Maier, Holger R/B-9639-2008","Savic, Dragan A/0000-0001-9567-9041; Maier, Holger R/0000-0002-0277-6887; Creaco, Enrico/0000-0003-4422-2417","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51922096]; Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China [LR19E080003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China","This work is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51922096) , and Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China (LR19E080003) .",,174,14,14,35,132,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0043-1354,1879-2448,,WATER RES,Water Res.,1-Sep,2021,,,,,,,117419,10.1016/j.watres.2021.117419,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117419,,,19,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UJ3YQ,34274902,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000691225300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Different from the green roofs, a rooftop farming has a leaf area index (LAI) variable during all the year because the vegetable crops growing cycle repeats sometimes along the year. The contribution of this paper is to bring this discussion to the art state. The method uses computer simulation as a research strategy using the software Energy Plus. The research method was developed in 3 steps. In the first one, a literature review was performed in order to search data from 18 vegetable crops and 3 substrates. One of these data was the LAI, which in the second research step was simulated considering 5 different possibilities (LAI constant all the year; LAI observing monthly the growing cycle; Average LAI considering the growing cycle; crop rotation with average monthly LAI; and LAI defined each ten days considering the crop growing cycle). The results demonstrated that: a) the simplified LAI found in the literature considering the rooftop farming simulations are defined as constant; b) using LAI constant all the year can overestimate until 7% the energy use intensity (EUI) in buildings for the climate in the South of Brazil. c) Thus, in order to simulate the performance of buildings with rooftop farming it is important to develop a data base of the vegetable crop considering the LAI variation along the cycles, and also the number of cycles during the year.

Futures studies may affect the anticipation and speculation of future and emerging technologies. In this paper, biofuels futures are explored based on a critical evaluation of the literature to draw the state-of-the-art for the future-oriented biofuel research. A six-fold typology mapping from two main futures studies methodologies is used. (i) descriptive scenarios, forecasts, and statistical scenarios as descriptive methods; (ii) madmaps, visions, and backcasts as prescriptive methods. The expectations embodied in the literature are then explored through deriving research challenges about the future of biofuels: (1) the main motives and driving forces in a biofuel era; (2) the main obstacles or difficulties confronting a biofuel era; (3) the plausibility and importance of each of different scenarios; (4) key technological breakthroughs for the bioeconomy; (5) details about development, maturity and flourish; (6) biofuel era's significant achievement. The literature explains a wide range of plausible futures, from centralized systems related to technological breakthroughs to decentralized systems based on small-scale renewable. Fundamental technological elements are uncovered, and a plausible biofuel economy is drawn along with the necessary pathway to reach it. The review shows a general agreement that a biofuel economy would develop gradually, and a prompt shift to biofuels would require powerful governmental support coupled with significant disruptions such as changes in environmental principles of countries, technology breakthroughs, higher oil prices, and urgency of climate change.","[Alizadeh, Reza; Soltanisehat, Leili] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Lund, Peter D.] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Espoo, Finland",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Aalto University,"Alizadeh, R (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",reza.alizadeh@ou.edu,"Alizadeh, Reza/V-9942-2017; Lund, Peter D/E-7563-2012","Alizadeh, Reza/0000-0002-7705-8943; Lund, Peter D/0000-0002-4819-3847",,,,,204,47,49,4,49,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

The Black Lives Matter Movement, the Flint water crisis, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the various marches on Washington, among others, demonstrate the clear links between humans, nonhuman nature, and justice/equality. Now, then, is a critical moment for the field of environmental studies and sciences to evaluate how we look outward at the topics we study and look inward at how we conduct our ourselves and our work. Environmental studies and sciences (ESS) purportedly brings a transdisciplinary/multidisciplinary approach to research by linking the arts, humanities, social, and physical sciences in pursuit of more just socioecological outcomes. However, a cursory reflection on the field suggests continued disciplinary divisions that sort the nonhuman and human world into more-or-less distinct and sometimes problematically immutable categories. Further, manuscript discussion sections typically mix in issues of justice and equality ad hoc, rather than explicitly building them into research design and practice. In this article, we argue that feminist theory, and in particular theories of intersectionality, can critique and strengthen the ESS agenda by reforming current practice. Specifically, we draw on intersectionality to reframe how we organize the work we do (looking inward) and how we ask research questions (looking outward). We then use this theoretical framework to suggest how intersectional diversity can inform our future research programs, making the field more poised to meet the complex challenges of global environmental change.","[Lloro-Bidart, Teresa] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Finewood, Michael H.] Pace Univ, New York, NY 10038 USA",California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona; Pace University,"Lloro-Bidart, T (corresponding author), Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",tllorobidart@cpp.edu; finewood@gmail.com,,"Lloro-Bidart, Teresa/0000-0002-2196-1818",,,,,91,14,14,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The increased speed of glacier changes observed in the past few years requires a more frequent update of the glacier inventories than in the past; however, the high human supervision required by the state-of-the-art techniques is discouraging their systematic application over large areas. This article proposes a novel approach to exploit the large volume of data provided by Copernicus Sentinel missions for detecting glacier outlines, including debris-covered glaciers. In detail, our method exploits the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 multitemporal images to build a composite image representing the glacier conditions during the yearly maximum ablation period. The Sentinel-2 multispectral images are classified with a support vector machine and composed to a mosaic that represents the information of the maximum glacier ablation. At the same time, the Sentinel-1 time series are exploited to build a multitemporal coherence composite that represents all the snow-covered and glaciated areas together with all the moving surfaces. This information is used together with the Sentinal-2 composite to detect the debris-covered part of the glaciers. The proposed method was tested in the Central East Alps and presented an overall accuracy of 92% with respect to a reference inventory over South Tyrol and an agreement of 90% with respect to the latest glacier inventory of the Alps from Sentinel-2.

As part of the design course Environmentally Friendly Housing Architecture, inspired by, among others, the design of the New European Bauhaus and the former Bauhaus art school, both of which are compared in the first part of this article, we identify a number of new, assessed design indicators related to the achievement of the above objectives, in line with the trend of sustainable architecture. The indicators are divided into four main categories: energy, environment, indoor climate, and society, where, for example, the environmental category includes the following criteria: embodied energy (MJ/m(2)), embodied carbon footprint (CO(2)eq/m(2)), use of rainwater and gray water (% of demand), use of mains water (% of demand), local production of vegetables and fruit (% of demand). During the design process, changes were made to achieve better indicators, and the final designs were described using radar charts.

Most of them are caused by humans, while only 10-15% occur naturally due to the climate change. The hotter weather dries out forests and plants, making them more prone to fire. The frontline wildfire defense has fully utilized satellite imagery to monitor, map, and control the fire spread and damage. However, there are three major challenges of using traditional satellite data: (1) the spatial resolution, (2) the temporal resolution, and (3) the downlink and analyzing data on the ground. In recent technology, the satellites are developed into small-size CubeSats that supporting the resolution issues. By exploiting the deep learning (DL) technique, the CubeSat can become sufficiently intelligent to detect wildfire events. This paper discusses a potential approach for implementing a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) onboard a CubeSat to sense wildfire. The DL model has been tested on the Camera Controller Board (CCB) embedded with Raspberry Pi Compute Module (RPi CM3+), that interfacing with the imaging mission of a 6U CubeSat named KITSUNE. In addition, the space environment test of radiation Total Ionizing Dose (TID) with functional tests of the board has been discussed.

Microalgae can biofix CO2 10 to 15 times faster than plants and convert algal biomass to products of interest, such as biofuels. Thus, this study presents a protocol that demonstrates the potential synergies of microalgae cultivation with a natural gas power plant situated in the southwestern United States in a hot semi-arid climate. State-of-the-art technologies are used to enhance carbon capture and utilization via the green algal species Chlorella sorokiniana, which can be further processed into biofuel. We describe a protocol involving a semi-automated open raceway pond and discuss the results of its performance when it was tested at the Tucson Electric Power plant, in Tucson, Arizona. Flue gas was used as the main carbon source to control pH, and Chlorella sorokiniana was cultivated. An optimized medium was used to grow the algae. The amount of CO2 added to the system as a function of time was closely monitored. Additionally, other physicochemical factors affecting algal growth rate, biomass productivity, and carbon fixation were monitored, including optical density, dissolved oxygen (DO), electroconductivity (EC), and air and pond temperatures. The results indicate that a microalgae yield of up to 0.385 g/L ash-free dry weight is attainable, with a lipid content of 24%. Leveraging synergistic opportunities between CO2 emitters and algal farmers can provide the resources required to increase carbon capture while supporting the sustainable production of algal biofuels and bioproducts.","[Acedo, Margarita; Ogden, Kimberly L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Gonzalez Cena, Juan R.; Ogden, Kimberly L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Biosyst Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Kiehlbaugh, Kasi M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Biomed Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Ogden, KL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Ogden, KL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Biosyst Engn, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",ogden@arizona.edu,,"Kiehlbaugh, Kasi/0000-0001-6137-0791","Regional Algal Feedstock Testbed project, U.S. Department of Energy [DE-EE0006269]","Regional Algal Feedstock Testbed project, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported through the Regional Algal Feedstock Testbed project, U.S. Department of Energy DE-EE0006269.

Especially office spaces have to provide a high comfort for the occupants while at the same time the building operation should require as little energy as possible. Moreover, an upcoming topic in building automation is a fast reaction to user feedback. The traditional design of a room temperature controller focuses solely on a good rejection of input disturbances such as variations of occupancy and solar radiation. Since the transfer functions of the user feedback and the input disturbances to the room temperature differ, a fast reaction to user feedback requires rethinking the design of a room temperature controller. Altogether, there is a desire to use modern controllers for room temperature control. To ensure indoor comfort, the room temperature has to be kept within a certain interval. In this paper, the internal model control method is extended such that the controlled variable is kept in the tube defined by this temperature interval. The main idea is to compute an admissible tube for the planned trajectory. This results in an interval for the control input, which provides a degree of freedom. This is used to minimize the energy consumption. For the implementation in reality, the proposed controller is discretized in time. To ensure a good disturbance attenuation, the controller is combined with a Kalman Filter. The closed-loop behavior of the developed controller is validated in a real building and compared with a state-of-the-art controller.

Method: A review was undertaken of the English-speaking literature on the potential for emerging viral threats to human health in Australia, the future implications of virus ecology, climate change and population movement and the implications for blood transfusion. Results: Published data confirm that Australia's blood supply is among the safest in the world for currently screened viral pathogens as a result of rigorous surveillance, donor selection and state-of-the-art processing and laboratory testing. However, Australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the Ross River, Barmah Forrest, Kunjin, Japanese Encephalitis, Murray Valley Encephalitis and dengue viruses. Of these, dengue is currently of most concern to blood safety because; it can cause fatalities, there are regular seasonal outbreaks in Northern Australia and, in contrast to other viruses mentioned above an overseas case of transfusion transmission has already been documented. Notably, despite the lack of a suitable dengue screening test the ARCBS already implements supplementary measures to protect the blood supply during outbreaks. Conclusion: Current interventions have proven extremely effective in minimising transfusion transmission in Australia of recognised viral pathogens. The threat posed by emerging viral pathogens to the safety of blood transfusion emphasises the need for global collaboration and consideration of further intervention strategies on a country by country basis including options such as nucleic acid testing and pathogen reduction technologies.","[Dunstan, Robert A.] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Biomed Sci, Western Australian Biomed Res Inst AB CRC Emergin, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Seed, Clive R.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Red Cross Blood Serv, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Seed, Clive R.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Surg, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",Curtin University; Australian Red Cross Blood Service; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Dunstan, RA (corresponding author), Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Biomed Sci, Western Australian Biomed Res Inst AB CRC Emergin, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",r.dunstan@curtin.edu.au,,"Seed, Clive/0000-0002-0234-4507",,,,,43,26,27,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1326-0200,1753-6405,,AUST NZ J PUBL HEAL,Aust.

The annual cycle and timing of the reversal of the Somali Current differ depending on the location along the coast of northeastern Africa. A momentum budget analysis calculated from the model output shows that both annual Rossby waves and the life cycle of the Great Whirl impact the northern part of the Somali Current (roughly 5 degrees N to 10 degrees N). In particular, the nonlinear term is of leading order importance when the Great Whirl is present. This is in contrast to the leading-order geostrophic balance between 2 degrees N and 5 degrees N. South of 2 degrees N, equatorial dynamics prevail, and the nonlinear term is again important, and its reversal is strongly affected by the northward flowing East African Coastal Current. Alongshore wind forcing is influential at all latitudes, but only the transition in flow direction during boreal spring between 2 degrees N and 5 degrees N directly follows that of the wind. The Somali Current flows along the western boundary of northwest Africa in the Arabian Sea. Unlike other strong western boundary currents, the Somali Current reverses seasonally; its reversal has been attributed to the seasonally reversing Indian monsoon wind. The Somali Current is important for both regional climate and ecology and can potentially impact monsoon precipitation. Due to the difficulties in collecting observations due to piracy in the western Arabian Sea over the past decade, the scientific community has relied on numerical ocean models to enhance understanding of the behavior of this current. In this study, we use a global state-of-the-art numerical ocean model that resolves weather-scale features in the ocean, that is, mesoscale eddies, to understand Somali Current drivers and what controls its seasonal reversal. We find that in addition to the local wind, the Somali Current system is influenced by winds and oceanic phenomena distant from the region, which leads to different reversal times in different parts of the current. As a result, we identify three distinct regimes along the Somali Current and analyze their respective dynamics.","[Wang, He; McClean, Julie L.; Talley, Lynne D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yeager, Stephen] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Wang, H (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hew030@ucsd.edu,,"Talley, Lynne/0000-0003-1574-729X","Office of Naval Research [N00014-15-1-2189, N00014-15-1-2566]; DOE Office of Science grant [DE-SC0012778]; National Science Foundation; DOE BER grant",Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); DOE Office of Science grant(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE BER grant(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We would like to thank Jay McCreary and two other reviewers for their insightful comments on the paper.

Infrared [High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS)-12] and microwave [Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU)-18] measurements from the NOAA-17 satellite were used for this purpose. The agreement was assessed by comparing the satellite measurements against simulated measurements using collocated radiosonde profiles of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program undertaken at tropical and midlatitude sites. The Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) was used to simulate the satellite radiances. The comparisons have been done under clear-sky conditions, separately for daytime and nighttime soundings. Only Vaisala RS92 radiosonde sensors were used and an empirical correction (EC) was applied to the radiosonde measurements. The EC includes correction for mean calibration bias and for solar radiation error, and it removes radiosonde bias relative to three instruments of known accuracy. For the nighttime dataset, the EC significantly reduces the bias from 0.63 to -0.10 K in AMSU-18 and from 1.26 to 0.35 K in HIRS-12. The EC has an even greater impact on the daytime dataset with a bias reduction from 2.38 to 0.28 K in AMSU-18 and from 2.51 to 0.59 K in HIRS-12.

Moreover, there are a large number of features that have impact on the energy consumption of the residential load. Recently, deep learning algorithms are widely used for short-term load forecasting (STLF) of residential load. Although deep learning algorithms are capable of achieving promising results due to their ability in feature extraction, machine learning algorithms are also prone to obtain satisfactory results with lower complexity and easier implementation. Identifying the most dominant features which have the highest impact on residential load is a pragmatic measure to boost the accuracy of STLF. But deep learning algorithms use feature extraction, which leads to the loss of data interpretability due to transforming the data. This paper proposes to improve the accuracy of the individual residential STLF using an enhanced machine learning-based approach via a feature-engineering framework. To this end, various datasets and features such as historical load and climate features are collected. Afterward, correlation analysis and outlier detection via the k nearest neighbor algorithm are deployed to implement outlier detection. In the next stage, feature selection algorithms are used to identify the foremost dominant features.

Thus, the SWIR imaging channel is frequently used in multi-spectral imaging systems (MSIS) for long-range surveillance in combination with color and thermal imaging to improve the probability of correct operation in various day, night and climate conditions. Integration of deep-learning (DL)-based real-time object detection in MSIS enables an increase in efficient utilization for complex long-range surveillance solutions such as border or critical assets control. Unfortunately, a lack of datasets for DL-based object detection models training for the SWIR channel limits their performance. To overcome this, by using the MSIS setting we propose a new cross-spectral automatic data annotation methodology for SWIR channel training dataset creation, in which the visible-light channel provides a source for detecting object types and bounding boxes which are then transformed to the SWIR channel. A mathematical image transformation that overcomes differences between the SWIR and color channel and their image distortion effects for various magnifications are explained in detail. With the proposed cross-spectral methodology, the goal of the paper is to improve object detection in SWIR images captured in challenging outdoor scenes. Experimental tests for two object types (cars and persons) using a state-of-the-art YOLOX model demonstrate that retraining with the proposed automatic cross-spectrally created SWIR image dataset significantly improves average detection precision. We achieved excellent improvements in detection performance in various variants of the YOLOX model (nano, tiny and x).","[Pavlovic, Milos S.; Milanovic, Petar D.] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Bul Kralja Aleksandara 73, Belgrade 11120, Serbia; [Pavlovic, Milos S.; Milanovic, Petar D.; Stankovic, Milos S.; Peric, Dragana B.; Popadic, Ilija, V; Peric, Miroslav, V] Vlatacom Inst High Technol, Milutina Milankovica 5, Belgrade 11070, Serbia; [Stankovic, Milos S.] Singidunum Univ, Fac Tech Sci, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Pavlovic, MS (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Bul Kralja Aleksandara 73, Belgrade 11120, Serbia.;Pavlovic, MS (corresponding author), Vlatacom Inst High Technol, Milutina Milankovica 5, Belgrade 11070, Serbia.",milos.pavlovic@vlatacom.com; petar.milanovic@vlatacom.com; milos.stankovic@vlatacom.com; dragana.peric@vlatacom.com; ilija.popadic@vlatacom.com; miroslav.peric@vlatacom.com,,"Milanovic, Petar/0000-0003-3049-8105; Peric, Miroslav/0000-0002-7945-5571; Stankovic, Milos/0000-0001-9064-7059; Popadic, Ilija/0000-0002-5006-7786",Vlatacom Institute of High Technologies [157 VMSIS3_Advanced]; Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia [6524745 AI-DECIDE],Vlatacom Institute of High Technologies; Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia,"This research is funded by the Vlatacom Institute of High Technologies under project #157 VMSIS3_Advanced, and by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, Grant #6524745 AI-DECIDE.",,54,0,0,5,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2022,7,,,,,,2562,10.3390/s22072562,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22072562,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,0L2GH,35408177,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000781298000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the growth of human needs and an increase in the number of factors and the degree of negative impact on plants (changing unstable climate, including drought, decreased fertility, increased resistance of plant pathogens and pests to pesticides, cumulative effects of agrochemical load, etc.), there is a need for further development of research in the field of breeding and seed production. The development of these areas through the introduction of competitive domestic technologies based on the latest scientific achievements is the national interest of the state in the field of food security for the long term. Provision of Russian producers with high-quality domestic seeds of high reproduction for a number of crops is insufficient, which creates a threat to the country's food independence. An important factor in providing agricultural producers with domestic seeds is the development of the material and technical base of breeding and seed production, including state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment for seed preparation, since processing and preparation of seeds are today necessary conditions for improving the quality and competitiveness of domestic seed. The state and problems of the development of plant breeding and seed production, as well as the proportion of seed supply of domestic breeding are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach - Using qualitative methods and critical discourse analysis as a theory and method, surveys and interview data from teachers, administrators and parents, policy documents and other artifacts were analyzed and described to explain the sociopolitical climate. Findings - Using Fairclough (2015) and Gee's (2015) tools, the authors identified the discourses of deficiency, efficiency and gatekeeping in the data. Foucault's ideas about governmentality and regimes of truth are used to explain the ways teachers took up the policies and resisted them. Research limitations/implications - The authors argue that a new testing regime is on the move, and more unity and critique by elementary and secondary teachers and administrators will be important for restoring and sustaining quality literacy instruction and decision-making in all classrooms. Practical implications - Continued research is needed to understand how particular reading assessments exacerbate and perpetuate the ranking and sorting in schools and the loss and struggle children face when they are denied literacy experiences that validate their lives outside of school and give meaning and purpose to reading in school. Originality value - As the reality for secondary education language arts teachers begins to shift to a more restrictive curriculum, a loss of academic freedom and frequent testing, the authors see an opportunity for new professional alliances to form in support of a complex theory of literacy.","[Schmidt, Renita; Meyer, Heidi] Univ Iowa, Teaching & Learning, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Jacobs, Mary M.] Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Iowa; University of Auckland,"Schmidt, R (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Teaching & Learning, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",renita-schmidt@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,61,4,4,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1175-8708,,,ENGL TEACH-PRACT CRI,Eng.

AIRS, working in concert with complementary microwave instrumentation on EOS PM-I is designed to provide both new and more accurate data about the atmosphere, land and oceans for application to NASA climate studies and NOAA and DOD weather prediction. Among the important parameters to be derived from AIRS observations are atmospheric temperature profiles with an average accuracy of 1 K in 1 kilometer(km) layers in the troposphere, humidity profiles to 10% accuracy and surface temperatures with an average accuracy of 0.5 K. The AIRS measurement technique is based on passive IR remote sensing using a precisely calibrated, high spectral resolution grating spectrometer operating in the 3.7 - 15.4 mu m region. The instrument concept uses a passively cooled multi-aperture echelle array spectrometer approach in combination with advanced state of the art focal plane and cryogenic refrigerator technology to achieve unparalleled performance capability in a practical long life configuration. The AIRS instrument, which has been under development since 1991, has been fully integrated and has completed successfully a comprehensive performance verification program. Performance verification included thermal vacuum testing, environmental qualification and a full range of spatial, spectral and radiometric calibrations, which have demonstrated outstanding spectrometric performance.

The altitude-integrated enhancement (AIE) derived from the Arctic Carbon Atmospheric Profiles (Arctic-CAP) project demonstrates the utility of this bulk quantity for surface flux model evaluation. This bulk quantity leverages background mole fraction values from the middle free troposphere, is agnostic to uncertainties in boundary layer height, and can be derived from model estimates of mole fractions and vertical gradients. To demonstrate the utility of the bulk quantity, six airborne profiling surveys of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) throughout Alaska and northwestern Canada between April and November 2017 were completed as part of NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE). The Arctic-CAP sampling strategy involved acquiring vertical profiles of CO2, CH4, and CO from the surface to 5 km altitude at 25 sites around the ABoVE domain on a 4- to 6-week time interval. All ArcticCAP measurements were compared to a global simulation using the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) modeling system. Comparisons of the AIE bulk quantity from aircraft observations and GEOS simulations of atmospheric CO2, CH4, and CO highlight the fidelity of the modeled surface fluxes. The model-data comparison over the ABoVE domain reveals that while current state-of-the-art models and flux estimates are able to capture broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns in near-surface CO2 and CH4 concentrations, more work is needed to resolve fine-scale flux features that are captured in CO observations.","[Sweeney, Colm; Wolter, Sonja; McKain, Kathryn; Newberger, Tim; Hu, Lei] NOAA, Global Monitoring Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Chatterjee, Abhishek; Weir, Brad] Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD USA; [Chatterjee, Abhishek; Ott, Lesley; Poulter, Benjamin; Weir, Brad] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Dept Geol Sci, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Wolter, Sonja; McKain, Kathryn; Newberger, Tim; Hu, Lei] Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bogue, Robert; Miller, Charles E.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Conley, Stephen] Sci Aviat, Boulder, CO USA; [Schiferl, Luke; Zhang, Zhen] Columbia Univ, LDEO, New York, NY USA; [Zhang, Zhen] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bogue, Robert] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Columbia University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; McGill University,"Sweeney, C (corresponding author), NOAA, Global Monitoring Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",colm.sweeney@noaa.gov,"Sweeney, Colm/AAE-9291-2019; Poulter, Ben/ABB-5886-2021; Chatterjee, Abhishek/E-6296-2017","Poulter, Ben/0000-0002-9493-8600; Weir, Brad/0000-0001-6160-0577; MCKAIN, KATHRYN/0000-0002-8323-5758; Chatterjee, Abhishek/0000-0002-3680-0160","NASA [NNX17AC61A, NNX17AD69A]",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),This research has been supported by NASA (grant nos.

In this context, the establishment of effective treatment methods for wastewater has been critically important and urgent, since water pollution can take place on a very large scale (e.g., oceanic oil spills) and have massive impacts on ecosystems and human lives. Functional materials play a central role in the advancement of these technologies due to their highly tunable properties and functions. This article focuses on reviewing the recent progress in the application of various functional materials for wastewater treatment. Our literature survey is first concentrated on new modification methods and outcomes for a range of functional materials which have been actively investigated in recent years, including biofilm carriers, sand filters, biomass, biopolymers, and functional inorganic materials. Apart from the development of modified functional materials, our literature survey also covers the technological applications of superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic meshes, hybrid membranes, and reusable sponges in oil-water separation. These devices have gained significantly enhanced performance by using new functional materials as the key components (e.g., coating materials), and are therefore highly useful for treatment of oily wastewater, such as contaminated water collected from an oil spill site or oil-water emulsions resulting from industrial pollution.

Earthen construction materials, in particular, are considered sustainable due to their inherent characteristics of having low embodied and operational energies, fire resistance, and ease of recyclability. Despite these attributes, they have not been part of the mainstream construction due to their susceptibility to water-induced deterioration. Conventional soil improvement techniques are generally expensive, energy-intensive, and environmentally harmful. Recently, biostabilization has emerged as a sustainable alternative that can overcome some of the limitations of existing soil improvement methods. Enzyme-induced carbonate precipitation (EICP) is a particularly promising technique due to its ease of application and compatibility with different soil types. EICP exploits the urease enzyme as a catalyst to promote the hydrolysis of urea inside the pore water, which, in the presence of calcium ions, results in the precipitation of calcium carbonate. The purpose of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review of EICP stabilization, highlighting the potential application of this technique to field problems and identifying current research gaps. The paper discusses recent progress, focusing on the most important factors that govern the efficiency of the chemical reactions and the precipitation of a spatially homogenous carbonate phase. The paper also discusses other aspects of EICP stabilization, including the degree of ground improvement, the prediction of the pore structure of the treated soil by numerical simulations, and the remediation of potentially toxic EICP by-products.","[Saif, Ahsan; Cuccurullo, Alessia; Perlot, Celine] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, E2S UPPA, SIAME, F-64600 Anglet, France; [Gallipoli, Domenico; Bruno, Agostino Walter] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Chim & Ambientale, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Perlot, Celine] Inst Univ France IUF, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Genoa,"Saif, A (corresponding author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, E2S UPPA, SIAME, F-64600 Anglet, France.",ahsansaif66@gmail.com; alessia.cuccurullo@univ-pau.fr; domenico.gallipoli@unige.it; celine.perlot@univ-pau.fr; agostinowalter.bruno@unige.it,"Cuccurullo, Alessia/AAI-4937-2021; Saif, Ahsan/AAD-7488-2022; Gallipoli, Domenico/D-3741-2015","Saif, Ahsan/0000-0003-3468-4239; Gallipoli, Domenico/0000-0003-1576-0742; PERLOT, Celine/0000-0002-0031-1859",,,,,130,1,1,34,66,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,950,10.3390/ma15030950,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma15030950,,,30,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,YZ1ZA,35160900,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000755280400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The unit was developed and tested under the EU H2020 project MultiPACK, which has the main goal of assuring the market about the feasibility, reliability, and energy efficiency of CO2 integrated systems for heating and cooling and promoting a fast transition to low environmental impact solutions. Within the project, the confidence raising was performed by installation and monitoring of fully integrated state-of-the art CO2 systems in the Southern European Climate. With the aim of predicting the unit behaviour under variable load and boundary conditions, a dynamic model of the entire unit was developed with commercial software, considering actual components and the implemented control system and it was validated with experimental data, collected at the factory's lab before commissioning. The validation against experimental data collected during operation as a heat pump demonstrated a maximum percentage difference between the experimental and predicted value of gas-cooler heat flow rate equal to +5.0%. A preliminary comparison with the experimental data in chiller configuration is reported, however further development was required to achieve a satisfactory validation. Lastly, the numerical model was utilized to simulate a typical operation in heat pump configuration with the system coupled with a hot water tank storage for the production of domestic hot water and space heating; the model predicts higher COP when operating in domestic hot water operation due to the lower water inlet temperature.","[Artuso, Paolo; Rossetti, Antonio; Marinetti, Sergio; Minetto, Silvia] Natl Res Council CNR, Construct Technol Inst ITC, I-35127 Padua, Italy; [Tosato, Giacomo] Enex Srl, I-31038 Padernello, Italy; [Hafner, Armin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, 246 Kolbjorn Hejes Vei 1, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Banasiak, Krzysztof] SINTEF Energy Res, Kolbjorn Hejes Vei 1, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF,"Rossetti, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Construct Technol Inst ITC, I-35127 Padua, Italy.",paolo.artuso@itc.cnr.it; giacomo.tosato@enex.it; antonio.rossetti@itc.cnr.it; sergio.marinetti@itc.cnr.it; armin.hafner@ntnu.no; Krzysztof.Banasiak@sintef.no; silvia.minetto@itc.cnr.it,,,,,,,32,3,3,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,DEC,2021,24,,,,,,8238,10.3390/en14248238,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14248238,,,25,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,XZ7CG,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000737805500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result, energy systems around the world are undergoing a process of fundamental change and transformation that goes far beyond the technological dimension. While energy system models have been developed and used for several decades to support decision makers in governments and companies, these models usually focus on the techno-economic dimension, whereas they fall short in addressing and considering behavioural and societal aspects of decisions related to technology acceptance, adoption, and use. In fact, it is often the societal dimension that comes with the greatest challenges and barriers when it comes to making such a socio-technical transformation happen in reality. This paper therefore provides an overview of state-of-the-art energy system models on the one hand and research studying behavioural aspects in the energy sector on the other hand. We find that these are two well-developed fields of research but that they have not yet been integrated sufficiently well to provide answers to the many questions arising in the context of complex socio-technical transformation processes of energy systems. While some promising approaches integrating these two fields can be identified, the total number is very limited. Based on our findings, research gaps and potentials for improvement of both energy system models and behavioural studies are derived. We conclude that a stronger collaboration across disciplines is required.","[Huckebrink, David; Bertsch, Valentin] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Energy Syst & Energy Econ, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Bertsch, V (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Energy Syst & Energy Econ, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",david.huckebrink@ee.rub.de; valentin.bertsch@ee.rub.de,,"Bertsch, Valentin/0000-0001-9477-4805; Huckebrink, David/0000-0002-9173-6034",,,,,206,3,3,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2021,15,,,,,,4579,10.3390/en14154579,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14154579,,,26,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,TV7LB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000681899200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a new site-independent retrieval algorithm for LWP and IWV, relying on a single-frequency 89 GHz ground-based radiometer. A statistical approach is used based on a neural network, which is trained and tested on a synthetic dataset constructed from radiosonde profiles worldwide. In addition to 89 GHz brightness temperature, the input features include surface measurements of temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as geographical information and, when available, estimates of IWV and LWP from reanalysis data. An analysis of the algorithm is presented to assess its accuracy, the impact of the various input features, its sensitivity to radiometer calibration, and its stability across geographical locations. While 89 GHz brightness temperature is crucial to LWP retrieval, it only moderately contributes to IWV estimation, which is more constrained by the additional input features. The algorithm is shown to be quite robust, although its accuracy is inevitably lower than that obtained with state-of-the-art multi-channel radiometers, with a relative error of 18% for LWP (in cloudy cases with LWP > 30 g m(-2)) and 6.5% for IWV. The highest accuracy is obtained in midlatitude environments with a moderately moist climate, which are more represented in the training dataset. The new method is then implemented and evaluated on real data that were collected during a field deployment in Switzerland and during the ICE-POP 2018 campaign in South Korea.","[Billault-Roux, Anne-Claire; Berne, Alexis] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Remote Sensing Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Berne, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Remote Sensing Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.",alexis.berne@epfl.ch,,"Berne, Alexis/0000-0003-4977-1204; Billault-Roux, Anne-Claire/0000-0003-3673-8683",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ICE GENESIS) [824310],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ICE GENESIS),This research has been supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ICE GENESIS (grant no. 824310)).,,47,0,0,0,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1867-1381,1867-8548,,ATMOS MEAS TECH,Atmos.

Wicked problems associated with these global grand challenges are necessitating innovative, multidisciplinary thinking and multiscale, integrated solutions that are spurring the development of a new field-construction biotechnology. While the field of construction biotechnology spans multiple scales, this review highlights the promise and potential of nanoscale (<100 nm) biotechnological applications to civil engineering. While the field of nanotechnology has revolutionized other industries, applications of nanotechnology in civil engineering have remained limited due to techno-economic and environmental barriers. Biological production of functional nanoparticles (NPs), however, offers new economical routes to develop resilient, high-performance cementitious materials while simultaneously addressing critical needs related to wastewater treatment and resource recovery. Recent research has elucidated that biological production of NPs exhibit preferred-and genetically controllable-morphological characteristics that could tailor the structure-property relationships of civil engineering materials. The natural ability of microorganisms to immobilize heavy metals (eg, Hg, Cr, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ag)-and the programmability of microorganisms to do so via synthetic biology-as well as their ability to sequester greenhouse gases and neutralize volatile organic compounds affords civil engineers a grand opportunity to treat wastewater, recover rare earth elements, and minimize air pollution. In addition to featuring state-of-the-art research in the field, this review summarizes the opportunities and challenges of nanoscale biotechnology and proposes a roadmap of research for civil engineers of the 21st century.","[Chen, Xu; Charrier, Marimikel; Srubar, Wil V., III] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Srubar, Wil V., III] Univ Colorado, Mat Sci & Engn Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Srubar, WV (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Srubar, WV (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Mat Sci & Engn Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",wsrubar@colorado.edu,,"Charrier, Marimikel/0000-0003-4264-5985; Chen, Xu/0000-0002-6813-2849",Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy [DE-AR0001145]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [HR0011-17-2-0039]; University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,The work depicted was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (Award Number: DE-AR0001145) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Agreement HR0011-17-2-0039).

At the Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale of the Italian National Research Council (CNR-IMAA) an advanced atmospheric observatory, named CIAO, is operative. CIAO (CNR-IMAA Atmospheric Observatory) main scientific objective is the long term measurement for the climatology of aerosol and cloud properties. Its equipment addresses the state-of-the-art for the ground-based remote sensing of aerosol, water vapour and clouds including active and passive sensors, like lidars, ceilometers, radiometers, and a radar. This paper describes the CIAO infrastructure, its scientific activities as well as the observation strategy. The observation strategy is mainly organized in order to provide quality assured measurements for satellite validation and model evaluation and to fully exploit the synergy and integration of the active and passive sensors for the improvement of atmospheric profiling. Data quality is ensured both by the application of protocols and dedicated quality assurance programs mainly related to the projects and networks in which the infrastructure is involved. The paper also introduces examples of observations performed at CIAO and of the synergies and integration algorithms (using Raman lidar and microwave profiler data) developed and implemented at the observatory for the optimization and improvement of water vapour profiling. CIAO database represents an optimal basis to study the synergy between different sensors and to investigate aerosol-clouds interactions, and can give a significant contribution to the validation programs of the incoming new generation satellite missions.","[Madonna, F.; Amodeo, A.; Boselli, A.; Cornacchia, C.; Cuomo, V.; D'Amico, G.; Giunta, A.; Mona, L.; Pappalardo, G.] IMAA, CNR, I-85050 Potenza, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR),"Madonna, F (corresponding author), IMAA, CNR, I-85050 Potenza, Italy.",madonna@imaa.cnr.it,"Boselli, Antonella/C-9362-2015","BOSELLI, ANTONELLA/0000-0002-4996-7648; MADONNA, FABIO/0000-0001-7628-8870; MONA, LUCIA/0000-0003-4157-0838","ESA [21487/08/NL/HE]; ESRIN [21769/08/I-OL, 22202/09/I-EC]; European Commission [RICA 025991, FP6 FP6 - 2005 - Global - 4 - 036677]; Department of the Italian Civil Protection (DPC) [624]; European Union [EVK2-2000-00611]",ESA(European Space Agency); ESRIN(European Space Agency); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Department of the Italian Civil Protection (DPC); European Union(European Commission),"The authors acknowledge the ESA financial support under the ESTEC contract 21487/08/NL/HE, and the ESRIN contracts 21769/08/I-OL and 22202/09/I-EC.

In developing countries, however, sustainable development is more difficult due to financial and technological constraints. This study was undertaken to investigate how foreign direct investment and renewable energy utilization can support developing countries in achieving green development, and to identify the complex relationships among internal and external influencing factors. A state-of-the-art data envelopment analysis method, coupled with the global non-radial directional distance function and a meta-frontier Malmquist index, measures the green total factor productivity and efficiency of 77 developing countries. A causal network that reflects both long-term and immediate relationships between green development performance and impact factors was constructed by embedding Geweke causal decomposition into Granger causality test. The study found that most developing countries are at the stage of high green levels and slow development, with the lack of green development potential serving as a hidden problem hindering their green development. The power and emission reduction technologies, economic agglomeration effect and industrial restructuring that foreign direct investment brings are contributing to green development achievements of developing countries, among which infrastructure construction, renewable energy investment, employment rate, and research and development investment are important transmission channels. With both long-term and immediate causalities to the economy, energy and industry of the host country, foreign direct investment is a key node of the causality network. In addition to helping developing countries achieve green development transition, this study provides information on the investment propensity and selectivity of investing countries.","[Li, Fengyun; Zhang, Junxia; Li, Xingmei] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Li, XM (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",flash3wade@foxmail.com; shijiepingan2022@163.com; xingmeil@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71973043],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Thanks are due to the North China Electric Power University Library for providing detailed reference for our research, and this paper was support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71973043) .",,58,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

However, little is known about the role of these epigenetic processes in transcriptional regulation in other insects including mosquitoes, which are major disease vectors and a worldwide threat for human health. Some of these life-threatening diseases are malaria, which is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes; dengue fever, which is caused by an arbovirus mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti; and West Nile fever, which is caused by an arbovirus transmitted by Culex spp. In this contribution, we review what is known about chromatin-associated mechanisms and the 3D genome structure in various mosquito vectors, including Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex spp. We also discuss the similarities between epigenetic mechanisms in mosquitoes and the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, and advocate that the field could benefit from the cross-application of state-of-the-art functional genomic technologies that are well-developed in the fruit fly. Uncovering the mosquito regulatory genome can lead to the discovery of unique regulatory networks associated with the parasitic life-style of these insects. It is also critical to understand the molecular interactions between the vectors and the pathogens that they transmit, which could hold the key to major breakthroughs on the fight against mosquito-borne diseases. Finally, it is clear that epigenetic mechanisms controlling mosquito environmental plasticity and evolvability are also of utmost importance, particularly in the current context of globalization and climate change.","[Lezcano, Oscar M.; Sanchez-Polo, Miriam; Ruiz, Jose L.; Gomez-Diaz, Elena] CSIC, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra IPBLN, Granada, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra (IPBLN),"Ruiz, JL; Gomez-Diaz, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Parasitol & Biomed Lopez Neyra IPBLN, Granada, Spain.",joseluis.ruiz@csic.es; elena.gomez@csic.es,"Rodríguez, José Luis Ruiz/AAM-2823-2020","Rodríguez, José Luis Ruiz/0000-0003-1901-1888",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) [PID2019-111109RB-I00]; Severo Ochoa fellowship from MINECO [BES-2016-076276]; Ramon y Cajal grant from MINECO; CSIC Open Access Publication Support Initiative through its Unit of Information Resources for Research (URICI),Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Severo Ochoa fellowship from MINECO; Ramon y Cajal grant from MINECO; CSIC Open Access Publication Support Initiative through its Unit of Information Resources for Research (URICI),This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) grant to EG-D (PID2019-111109RB-I00).

Moreover, HESs can be cost effective in comparison with conventional power plants. This article reviews current methods for designing optimal HESs. The survey shows these systems are often developed on a medium scale in remote areas and stand-alone, but there is a global growing interest for larger scale deployments that are grid connected. Examples of HESs are PV-wind-battery and PV-diesel-battery. PV and wind energy sources are the most widely adopted. Diesel and batteries are often used but hydrogen is increasing as a clean energy carrier. The design of an efficient HES is challenging because HES models are nonlinear, non-convex, and composed of mixed-type variables that cannot be solved by traditional optimization methods. Alternatively, two types of approaches are typically used for designing optimal HESs: simulation-based optimization and metaheuristic optimization methods. Simulation-based optimization methods are limited in view of human intervention that makes them tedious, time consuming, and error prone. Metaheuristics are more efficient because they can handle automatically a range of complexities. In particular, multi-objective optimization (MOO) metaheuristics are the most appropriate for optimal HES because HES models involve multiple objectives at the same time such as cost, performance, supply/demand management, grid limitations, and so forth. This article shows that the energy research community has not fully utilized state-of-the-art MOO metaheuristics. More recent MOO metaheuristics could be used such as robust optimization and interactive optimization.","[Bourennani, F.; Rahnamayan, S.; Naterer, G.

This paper describes the data assimilation and modelling system which has been implemented for global monitoring of reactive gases in the troposphere and stratosphere. The MACC reactive gases system uses a coupling software to integrate the Model for Ozone And Related Tracers, version 3 (MOZART-3) chemistry transport model with the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The focus is placed on the tropospheric simulations with this MACC-IFS-MOZ model. The MACC reanalysis (20032010) and the forecasts performed in near real time (NRT) benefit from the multi-sensor approach for data assimilation of total columns, tropospheric columns and vertically resolved observations of ozone, CO and NO2. Daily biomass burning emissions are integrated in real time using the global fire assimilation system (GFAS) that was developed within MACC.

In fact, prayers schedule is scattered throughout five daily times, with a maximum use around noon times on Fridays only In addition, the number of mosques is increasing, due to population growth, and imposes high electrical load requirements on the public authorities in Kuwait This paper demonstrates and analyzes thermal behavior of a typical mosque in the state of Kuwait. An energy audit is performed using state of the art building energy simulation software (Visual DOE 4.1). The simulation tool is intended to analyze the thermal behavior of the audited mosques and is used to asses potential energy conservation opportunities for future mosque design in Kuwait. Data collection including drawings, site visits and total daily kWh monitoring are performed to carry out the simulation analysis It is found that an annual energy use savings up to 72% can be achieved through improvements of buildings envelope designs and operating strategies In addition, life cycle cost LCC analysis is performed to make economical assessment of the energy conservation measures that are evaluated in this study. It was found that a LCC saving around 40% can be achieved with a simple payback period of less than 4 years.","[Al Anzi, Adnan] Kuwait Univ, Dept Architecture, Kuwait, Kuwait",Kuwait University,"Al Anzi, A (corresponding author), Kuwait Univ, Dept Architecture, Kuwait, Kuwait.",,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,4,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4395-6,,,,2010,,,,,383,391,,,,,,9,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BRO59,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000283271300046,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current practice only allows to make observations in the mountain cryosphere using limited field studies; larger-scale and longer-term measurements are very difficult. To this extent we develop autonomous, wireless sensors that allow the collection, transmission and analysis of data online with reliable and high-quality measurement systems for extreme environmental conditions. The main goal of PermaSense is to provide long-term high-quality sensing in harsh environments, to obtain better quality data more effectively and make measurements that have previously been impossible. The system makes use of state-of-the-art ultra-low power wireless sensor nodes that can live off of a single battery for 3-5 years and survive the harsh environmental conditions in high-alpine regions. A base station is responsible of relaying data to a server using a long-haul wireless link, e.g. GSM/GPRS or WLAN with low latency on the order of seconds. Online data analysis allows to assess the state of a field site quickly and to adapt algorithms and analysis methods when necessary. We are currently operating sensor networks delivering online data on both the Jungfraujoch and the Matterhorn at 3500m a.s.l. In this paper we describe the technology currently used in PermaSense and explain how this can be adapted for other cases of environmental monitoring.","[Beutel, Jan; Keller, Matthias; Lim, Roman; Thiele, Lothar; Yuecel, Mustafa] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Comp Engn & Networks Lab, Zurich, Switzerland; [Beutel, Jan; Keller, Matthias; Lim, Roman; Thiele, Lothar; Yuecel, Mustafa] ETH, Comp Engn & Networks Lab, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gruber, Stephan; Gubler, Stefanie; Hasler, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Dept Geography, Phys Geography Div, Zurich, Switzerland; [Talzi, Igor; Tschudin, Christian] Univ Basel, Comp Sci Dept, Basel, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Basel,"Beutel, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Comp Engn & Networks Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.",beutel@tik.ee.ethz.ch,"Gruber, Stephan/E-3884-2010; Beutel, Jan/E-7987-2011","Gruber, Stephan/0000-0002-1079-1542; Beutel, Jan/0000-0003-0879-2455; Lim, Roman/0000-0003-2370-5591",NCCR-MICS; Swiss National Science Foundation [5005-67322]; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),NCCR-MICS(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),"The work presented was supported by NCCR-MICS, a center supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under grant number 5005-67322.

J,"Howard, RB",,,,"Howard, RB",,,Grow old along with me - A look at the new face of aging,POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In 1930, Maurice Ernest, researcher and medical historian, set out to find the secret to longevity.(5) He reviewed the biographies and medical records for a large number of the ''oldest of the old,'' dating back several hundred years, and came up with his own prescription for a long life: Eat frugally. Exercise and get plenty of fresh air. Choose a congenial occupation. Develop a placid or easygoing personality. Maintain a high level of personal hygiene. Drink wholesome liquids. Abstain from stimulants and sedatives. Get plenty of rest. Have a waste evacuation once a day. Live in a temperate climate. Enjoy a reasonable sex life. Get prompt medical attention in case of illness. Naive as it sounds, that proscription still seems to hold true today. Of course we need to add a few items, such as don't smoke, always wear seat belts, buy the safest cars, and fly the safest airlines. But even as the art and science of medicine move steadily toward solving more of the mysteries of aging, this prescription makes sense for many people. Woody Allen once again plays to our fantasies when he proclaims in the movie Sleeper, ''We will find that the true keys to health and longevity are hot fudge sundaes and smoking cigars.'' Sadly, we know these will never be the keys, but we might figure out how to bypass some aging mechanisms so we can indulge once in a while.

There is need to find an alternative refrigerant for air conditioning applications. This article presents the performance comparison for selected low GWP refrigerants commonly used by different air conditioner manufacturers. A baseline test was conducted on a 5.2 kW air conditioner originally designed for HCFC-22 in psychrometric lab as per Indian standard IS 1391 part 1. Simulation tool was tuned and validated against the experimental results within +/- 5% accuracy. Parametric analysis was done using IMST-ART tool for the best suitable configuration of compressor capacity, capillary tube, heat exchangers etc. for maximum energy efficiency. Simulation study concluded that the HFC-161 is an energy efficient and climate friendly alternative since it has zero ODP (ozone depletion potential) and ultra-low GWP of 12 except its flammability issue. European standard EN 378, specifies the limit of about 15 g/m3 for charging HFC-161 in the AC system. For HFC-161, the highest cooling capacity of 5.3 kW is achieved in case 4. The HFC-161 gave 27.2% higher EER compared to HCFC-22 system due to 26.47% lowered power consumption. Discharge temperature of HFC-161 is also lowered in the range of 70 degrees C to 82 degrees C compared to selected refrigerants. The required charge for HFC-161 was only 55% of HCFC-22.

The area-wide acquisition of structural parameters at high spatial resolution from state-of-the-art methods is, however, still cumbersome, since the time required for a single profile is a serious practical limitation. As a remedy we have developed a statistical model to extract three major snow structural parameters: density, correlation length, and specific surface area (SSA) solely from the SnowMicroPen (SMP), a high-resolution penetrometer, which allows a meter profile to be measured with millimeter resolution in less than 1 min. The model was calibrated by combining SMP data with 3-D microstructural data from microcomputed tomography which was used to reconstruct full-depth snow profiles from different snow climates (Alpine, Arctic, and Antarctic). Density, correlation length, and SSA were derived from the SMP with a mean relative error of 10.6%, 16.4%, and 23.1%, respectively. For validation, we compared the density and SSA derived from the SMP to traditional measurements and near-infrared profiles. We demonstrate the potential of our method by the retrieval of a two-dimensional stratigraphy at Kohnen Station, Antarctica, from a 46 m long SMP transect. The result clearly reveals past depositional and metamorphic events, and our findings show that the SMP can be used as an objective, high-resolution tool to retrieve essential snow structural parameters efficiently in the field.","[Proksch, Martin; Loewe, Henning; Schneebeli, Martin] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland; [Proksch, Martin] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Meteorol & Geophys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Innsbruck","Schneebeli, M (corresponding author), WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland.",schneebeli@slf.ch,"Schneebeli, Martin/B-1063-2008; Löwe, Henning/B-6279-2009","Schneebeli, Martin/0000-0003-2872-4409; Löwe, Henning/0000-0001-7515-6809; Proksch, Martin/0000-0002-7126-6290","NoSREx III in Sodankyla, Finland, ESA [22761/09/NL/FF/ef]; ESA's Networking/Partnering Initiative NPI [235-2012]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) project DOME A [ANR-07-BLAN-0125]; French polar research institute IPEV (EXPLORE project) [1052]","NoSREx III in Sodankyla, Finland, ESA; ESA's Networking/Partnering Initiative NPI; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) project DOME A(French National Research Agency (ANR)); French polar research institute IPEV (EXPLORE project)","The Arctic data were acquired during NoSREx III in Sodankyla, Finland, ESA contract 22761/09/NL/FF/ef.

Arguably, nonscientist local stakeholders have always played an important role in knowledge risk management and resilience building within a hydrological context, such as flood response and drought alleviation. However, rapidly developing information and communication technologies such as the Internet, smartphones, and social media have already demonstrated their sizeable potential to make knowledge creation more multidirectional, decentralized, diverse, and inclusive. Combined with technologies for robust and low-cost sensor networks, a 'citizen science' approach has recently emerged as a promising direction in the provision of extensive, real-time information for risk management. Such projects work best when there is community buy-in, when their purpose(s) are clearly defined at the outset, and when the motivations and skillsets of all participants and stakeholders are well understood. They have great potential to enhance knowledge creation, not only for data collection, but also for analysis or interpretation. In addition, they can serve as a means of educating and empowering communities and stakeholders that are bypassed by more traditional knowledge generation processes. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of citizen science within the context of hydrological risk reduction and resilience building. Particularly when embedded within a polycentric approach toward risk governance, we argue that citizen science could complement more traditional knowledge generation practices, and also enhance innovation, adaptation, multidirectional information provision, risk management, and local resilience building.

The quantitative evaluation of the trends of urban energy consumption and carbon emissions is a premise for achieving this goal. Therefore, from the perspective of urban expansion, this paper analyzes the complex relationship between the mutual interactions and feedback between urban population, land expansion, economic growth, energy structure and carbon emissions. STELLA simulation software is used to establish a system dynamics model of urban-level carbon emissions effects, and Changsha city is used for the case study. The simulated outputs of energy consumption and carbon emissions cover the period from 1949 to 2016. From 1949 to 2016, Changsha's total energy consumption and carbon emissions per capita have continuously grown. The total carbon emissions increased from 0.66 Mt-CO2 to 60.95 Mt-CO2, while the per capita carbon emissions increased from 1.73 t-CO2/10,000 people to 18.3 Mt-CO2/10,000 people. The analysis of the structure of carbon emissions shows that the industrial sector accounted for the largest proportion of emissions, but it had gradually dropped from between 60% and 70% to about 40%. The carbon emissions of residential and commercial services accounted for less than 25%, and the proportion of transportation carbon emissions fluctuated greatly in 2013 and 2016. From the perspective of carbon emissions effects, carbon emissions per unit of GDP had a clear downward trend, from 186.11 t-CO2/CNY10(4) to 1.33 t-CO2/CNY10(4), and carbon emissions per unit of land showed two inflection points: one in 1961 and the other in 1996. The general trend showed an increase first, followed by a decrease, then a stabilization. There is a certain linear correlation between the compactness of urban shape and the overall trend of carbon emissions intensity, while the urban shape index has no linear correlation with the growth rate of carbon emissions. The carbon emissions assessment model constructed in this paper can be used by other municipalities, and the assessment results can provide guidance for future energy planning and decision making.","[Liu, Luyun; Chen, Yuanyuan; Zhou, Xu] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Sch Landscape Architecture, Changsha 410004, Peoples R China; [Liu, Luyun; Zhou, Xu] Hunan Big Data Engn Technol Res Ctr Nat Protected, Changsha 410004, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yanli] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Art, Changsha 410076, Peoples R China; [Bedra, Komi Bernard] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China",Central South University of Forestry & Technology; Changsha University of Science & Technology; Central South University,"Tang, YL (corresponding author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Art, Changsha 410076, Peoples R China.",t20172369@csuft.edu.cn; 008207@stu.csust.edu.cn; 20201100304@csuft.edu.cn; t20080238@csuft.edu.cn; komibedra@csu.edu.cn,"Chen, Yuanyuan/GXG-2130-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31901363]; State Forestry Administration [21]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2021JJ31156]; cultivation of double first-class disciplines in Hunan Province [469]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Forestry Administration; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); cultivation of double first-class disciplines in Hunan Province","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 31901363, the Key Forestry Majors Identified by State Forestry Administration, grant number [2016] NO. 21, the cultivation of double first-class disciplines in Hunan Province, grant number [2018] NO. 469, and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China, grant number 2021JJ31156.",,42,2,2,52,62,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

With the convection parameterization no longer active, much uncertainty in the formulation of subgrid-scale processes moves to other areas such as the cloud microphysical, turbulence, and land surface parameterizations. The goal of this study is to investigate experiments with stochastically perturbed parameters (SPP) within a microphysics parameterization and the model's horizontal diffusion coefficients. To estimate the true uncertainty due to parameter uncertainty, the magnitudes of the perturbations are chosen as realistically as possible and not with a purposeful intent of maximal forecast impact as some prior work has done. Spatial inhomogeneities and temporal persistence are represented using a random perturbation pattern with spatial and temporal correlations. The impact on the distributions of various hydrometeors, precipitation characteristics, and solar and longwave radiation are quantified for a winter case and a summer case. In terms of upscale error growth, the impact is relatively small and consists primarily of triggering atmospheric instabilities in convectively unstable regions. In addition, small in situ changes with potentially large socioeconomic impacts are observed in the precipitation characteristics such as maximum hail size. Albeit the impact of introducing physically based parameter uncertainties within the bounds of aerosol uncertainties is small, their influence on the solar and longwave radiation balances may still have important implications for global model simulations of future climate scenarios.","[Thompson, Gregory; Berner, Judith; Frediani, Maria] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Otkin, Jason A.; Griffin, Sarah M.] Univ Wisconsin, Cooperat Inst Meteorol Satellite Studies, Madison, WI USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Thompson, G (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",gthompsn@ucar.edu,"Otkin, Jason/D-1737-2012","Otkin, Jason/0000-0003-4034-7845","National Science Foundation; NOAA Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI) [NA17OAR4590179, NA17OAR4590171]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI),"NCAR is sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

The GEM-Mars model currently includes 16 tracers for chemical composition and applies a fully online, interactive calculation of the photo- and gas phase chemistry of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O). These species largely control the chemical composition of the neutral Mars atmosphere through their photolysis products and their subsequent interactions. Water vapor undergoes a complex cycle on Mars as it is transported and interacts with ice reservoirs both at the planet's surface and at water ice clouds, which in turn provide radiative feedbacks. In the photochemical cycles involving CO2 and H2O, the abundances of 5 species have been reported by previous investigations with significant spatio-temporal coverage: CO2, H2O, CO, O-3 and H2O2. This paper presents the current status of the atmospheric chemistry simulations in GEM-Mars by comparing them to a selection of these observational datasets as well as to oxygen dayglow emission from O-2(a(1)Delta g). The results are consistent with previous model-data comparisons and illustrate that the water cycle and the photochemistry are well implemented in the model. In particular, the simulation of the key reservoir species H2O2 provides a good match to the available data. Model-data biases for ozone columns and oxygen airglow are related to the simulated water vapor vertical profile, as these species have important column contributions from vertical layers at the top of the hygropause.","[Daerden, F.; Neary, L.; Viscardy, S.] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron BIRA IASB, Brussels, Belgium; [Munoz, A.

The Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) and the World Meteorological Organization have set up stringent requirements for high-quality spectral Measurements of ultraviolet radiation. It is shown that two new instruments comply with these standards. One is the newly developed spectroradiometer of the Institute of Meteorology and Climatology, University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany. It is capable of covering the spectral range from the UV to the near-infrared (290-1050 nm) in a comparably fine resolution. One major aim is to deploy this instrument as a traveling NDSC spectroradiometer. The other new instrument is built for the U.S. National Science Foundation's UV Monitoring Network. It is designed to monitor UV and visible irradiance at high latitudes and covers a wavelength range from 280 to 600 nm. Data of both instruments show deviations of less than 5% for a wide range of atmospheric conditions compared to a NDSC spectroradiometer owned by the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory during the fifth North American Interagency Intercomparison for UV Spectroradiometers. Such deviations represent state-of-the-art instrumentation for conducting long-term measurements of solar UV radiation capable of detecting trends and supporting long-term measurements by traveling standards.

It is of the utmost importance that new models are developed to predict and map flood susceptibility with high accuracy, to support decision-makers and planners in designing more effective flood management strategies. The objective of this study is the development of a new method based on state-of-the-art machine learning and remote sensing, namely random forest (RF), dingo optimization algorithm, a weighted chimp optimization algorithm (WChOA), and particle swarm optimization to build flood susceptibility maps in the Nghe An province of Vietnam. The CyGNSS system was used to collect soil moisture data to integrate into the susceptibility model. A total of 1650 flood locations and 14 conditioning factors were used to construct the model. These data were divided at a ratio of 60/20/20 to train, validate, and test the model, respectively. In addition, various statistical indices, namely root-mean-square error, receiver operation characteristic, mean absolute error, and the coefficient of determination (R-2), were used to assess the performance of the model. The results for all the models were good, with an AUC value of + 0.9. The RF-WChOA model performed best, with an AUC value of 0.99.

India housing 30% of the Asian population is currently appraised as a region of CH4 source based on the inventories. To date, there have not been many reported efforts to estimate the regional CH4 emissions using direct measurements of boundary layer CH4 concentrations at multiple locations over India. Here, 2 years (2017-2018) of in situ CH4 observations from three distantly placed stations over the peninsular India is combined with state-of-the-art inversion using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model for the estimation of CH4 emission. This study updates CH4 emission over the peninsular India (land area south of 21.5 degrees N) as similar to 10.63 Terra gram (Tg) CH4 year which is 0.13 Tg CH4 year(-1), higher than the existing inventory-based emission. On seasonal scale, the changes from the existing CH4 emission inventories are 0.12, 0.05, 0.055 and 0.28 Tg CH4 year during winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively. Spatial distributions of seasonal variability of posterior emissions suggest an enhancement over the eastern region of peninsular India compared to the western part. The study with observations from three stations over the peninsular India provides an update on the inventory-based estimation of CH4 emissions and urges the importance of more observations over the Indian region for the accurate estimation of fluxes.","[Raju, Anjumol; Sijikumar, S.; Girach, I.

Case presentations arc often the most popular sessions at medical congresses and increasingly have moved to digital channels and social media. MedShr was developed to help doctors improve patient care: to empower doctors to use their own smartphones to share and discuss clinical cases, whilst protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. In this manuscript, we review the current climate of digital and social media networks used for clinical case discussion, and outline the importance of moving to a dedicated digital platform. We discuss the common drivers for digital case discussions which include multidisciplinary team groups, diagnostic doubt, new techniques, clinical equipoise and debate and case discussion amongst professionals from different training levels and specialties. One key observation is that if clinical guidelines and published evidence tell doctors what to do, case discussion shows them how to do it in terms of drugs, devices, procedures, techniques, and applying the evidence to individuals or patient groups. We explore how MedShr works and the range of features which promote professional compliance, protect privacy and enable case-based education. We also discuss example cases, case series and discussion themes from MedShr. In summary, the MedShr platform provides a trusted. secure environment for clinicians that uses state of the art social network technology to support case discussion whilst protecting patient privacy and confidentiality.","[Coles, Rachel A.; Goh, Samantha J.; Livingstone, Daniel] Hlth Educ England, Technol Enhanced Learning Dept, London, England; [Qasim, Asif] Kings Coll Hosp London, Dept Cardiol, London, England",King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital,"Coles, RA (corresponding author), MedShr, Centenary House,Palliser Rd, London W14 9EQ, England.",Rachel.coles@hee.nhs.uk,,"Qasim, Asif/0000-0003-2394-5819",,,,,45,2,2,0,3,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0026-4725,1827-1618,,MINERVA CARDIOANGIOL,Minerva Cardioangiol.,JUN,2020,3,,,,175,187,,10.23736/S0026-4725.20.05164-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4725.20.05164-6,,,13,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,MD9QN,32163243,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000544301000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Relationships, interconnectivity, and community are fundamental to these determinants. Understanding these determinants from the perspective of Indigenous youth is vital to identifying means of alleviating future inequities.MethodsIn 2016, fifteen Yellowknives Dene First Nation (YKDFN) youth in the Canadian Northwest Territories participated in the 'On-the-Land Health Leadership Camp'. Using a strength- and community-based participatory approach through an Indigenous research lens, the YKDFN Wellness Division and university researchers crafted the workshop to provide opportunities for youth to practice cultural skills, and to capture the youth's perspectives of health and health agency. Perspectives of a healthy community, health issues, and health priorities were collected from youth through sharing circles, PhotoVoice, mural art, and surveys.ResultsThe overall emerging theme was that a connection to the land is an imperative determinant of YKDFN health. Youth identified the importance of a relationship to land including practicing cultural skills, Elders passing on traditional knowledge, and surviving off the land. The youth framed future health research to include roles for youth and an on-the-land component that builds YKDFN culture, community relations, and traditional knowledge transfer. Youth felt that a symbiotic relationship between land, environment, and people is fundamental to building a healthy community.ConclusionOur research confirmed there is a direct and critical relationship between structural context and determinants of Indigenous Peoples' health, and that this should be incorporated into health research and interventions.","[Lines, Laurie-Ann] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Yellowknives Dene First Nation Wel] Yellowkn Dene First Nation Wellness Div, Yellowknive, NT, Canada; [Jardine, Cynthia G.] Univ Fraser Valley, Fac Hlth Sci, Hlth & Community, Chilliwack, BC, Canada",University of Alberta,"Jardine, CG (corresponding author), Univ Fraser Valley, Fac Hlth Sci, Hlth & Community, Chilliwack, BC, Canada.",cindy.jardine@ufv.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [IPH 143070]; Canadian Northern Studies Trust; Government of Canada Northern Scientific Training Program; University of Alberta Northern Research Award; CIHR,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Northern Studies Trust; Government of Canada Northern Scientific Training Program; University of Alberta Northern Research Award; CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grant Participatory Risk Communication: Indigenous Youth-Generated Messages for Community Health Promotion (IPH 143070).

This training approach allows to see and understand their evolution/impact for new approaches to the genesis of architectural/engineering artefacts, both from a configurative and structural point of view. On the other hand, if we consider the typical primitive/intuitive approaches of Representation, up to its rigorous elaborations based on a consistent knowledge of Optics and Geometry, it is possible to recognize the strong links between artistic experience, mathematical contribution and scientific elaboration. It is therefore possible to offer a broad overview of the state of the art relating to critical sector studies, conducted both in Italy and abroad, to underline: - how awareness in the multiple fields of Geometry is expressed in the methods and process of realization of architecture and engineering, from conception to its realization; - how Representation stands as a means between theory and construction. In this sense we focus on Topology and its genesis, as an area of Geometry that can be concretized in Structural Optimization, in order to verify the promising results that these procedures ensure in terms of reducing the use of material and design iterations, without neglecting the architectural/engineering quality, also in configurative terms.

While the technological development of wave energy converters is progressing rapidly, their environmental impacts are still largely unknown, which is a barrier that could hinder their deployment. This research contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a framework for quantifying and analysing the ecological risks of three technologies (oscillating water columns, oscillating wave surge converters, and wave turbines). Based on a literature review, expert consultation process, and the devel-opment of a web tool, the potential pressures and the ecosystem elements that might be affected during the life cycle of a generic wave farm (an array of wave energy converters) are investigated. The main pressures are found to be physical disturbance, physical loss, hydrological change, and noise. The ecosystem elements sustaining the largest number of pressures and, therefore, at higher ecological risk are fish and cephalopods species, and benthic and pelagic habitats. The ecological risk assessment framework is operationalized into a free-access web tool (https://aztidata.es/wec-era/) for the interactive assessment and visualisation of the pressures and ecological risks. The tool is intended to be used by managers, decision makers, scientists or promoters during the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment of wave energy projects. The novel approach presented in this work is more sophisticated than previous risk assessment matrices, enabling to better capture the complexity of the interactions between a wave farm and the environment.","[Galparsoro, I; Korta, M.; Borja, A.; Menchaca, I; Solaun, O.; Muxika, I; Bald, J.] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Marine Res Div, AZTI, Herrera Kaia Portualdea Z-G, Pasaia 20110, Spain; [Subirana, I] GIBER Enfermedades Cardiovasc CIBERCV, Madrid, Spain; [Subirana, I] Inst Hosp del Mar Invest Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Borja, A.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Iglesias, G.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Sch Engn & Architecture, Cork, Ireland; [Iglesias, G.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI, Cork, Ireland; [Iglesias, G.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",AZTI; Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM); Hospital del Mar; King Abdulaziz University; University College Cork; University College Cork; University of Plymouth,"Galparsoro, I (corresponding author), Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Marine Res Div, AZTI, Herrera Kaia Portualdea Z-G, Pasaia 20110, Spain.",igalparsoro@azti.es,"Galparsoro, Ibon/B-8386-2009; Muxika, Iñigo/B-8622-2009; Borja, Angel/I-3665-2018; BALD, JUAN/B-8513-2009","Galparsoro, Ibon/0000-0002-5031-525X; Muxika, Iñigo/0000-0002-9181-3781; Borja, Angel/0000-0003-1601-2025; BALD, JUAN/0000-0002-8549-8092","Wave Energy in Southern Europe (WESE) project; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the European Union [EASME/EMFF/2017/1.2.1.1/02/SI2.787640]; project New decision tools for maritime spatial planning of marine renewable energies in Gipuzkoa - Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa, Department of Economic Promotion, Rural Environment and Territorial Equilibrium","Wave Energy in Southern Europe (WESE) project; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the European Union; project New decision tools for maritime spatial planning of marine renewable energies in Gipuzkoa - Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa, Department of Economic Promotion, Rural Environment and Territorial Equilibrium","This research was supported by the Wave Energy in Southern Europe (WESE) project (Co-funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the European Union; Agreement number EASME/EMFF/2017/1.2.1.1/02/SI2.787640) and the project New decision tools for maritime spatial planning of marine renewable energies in Gipuzkoa, funded by the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa, Department of Economic Promotion, Rural Environment and Territorial Equilibrium under 2018 call for network program grants Gipuzkoa Science, Technology and Innovation.

Due to the relatively small size of these depressional wetlands and their occurrence under forest canopy cover, it is very challenging to map their inundation status based on existing remote sensing data and traditional classification approaches. In this study, we applied a state-of-the-art U-Net semantic segmentation network to map forested wetland inundation in the Delmarva area by integrating leaf-off WorldView-3 (WV3) multispectral data with fine spatial resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) intensity and topographic data, including a digital elevation model (DEM) and topographic wetness index (TWI). Wetland inundation labels generated from lidar intensity were used for model training and validation. The wetland inundation map results were also validated using field data, and compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and a random forest output from a previous study. Our results demonstrate that our deep learning model can accurately determine inundation status with an overall accuracy of 95% (Kappa = 0.90) compared to field data and high overlap (IoU = 70%) with lidar intensity-derived inundation labels. The integration of topographic metrics in deep learning models can improve the classification accuracy for depressional wetlands. This study highlights the great potential of deep learning models to improve the accuracy of wetland inundation maps through use of high-resolution optical and lidar remote sensing datasets.","[Du, Ling; McCarty, Gregory W.; Li, Xia; Lee, Sangchul] USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Zhang, Xin] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Comp Math & Digital Technol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Lang, Megan W.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Natl Wetlands Inventory, Falls Church, VA 22041 USA; [Vanderhoof, Melanie K.] US Geol Survey, Geosci & Environm Change Sci Ctr, DFC, POB 25046,MS980, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Huang, Chengquan; Zou, Zhenhua] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lee, Sangchul] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Manchester Metropolitan University; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"McCarty, GW (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",ling.du@usda.gov; greg.mccarty@usda.gov; x.zhang@mmu.ac.uk; megan_lang@fws.gov; mvanderhoof@usgs.gov; xia.li@usda.gov; cqhuang@umd.edu; slee1224@umd.edu; zhzou@umd.edu,"Zou, Zhenhua/O-7003-2017","Zou, Zhenhua/0000-0002-1682-0893; Zhang, Xin/0000-0001-7844-593X; Vanderhoof, Melanie/0000-0002-0101-5533; Du, Ling/0000-0002-2628-9557",U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service; Wetland Component of the National Conservation Effects Assessment Project; U.S. Fish andWildlife Service (USFWS),U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service; Wetland Component of the National Conservation Effects Assessment Project; U.S. Fish andWildlife Service (USFWS)(US Fish & Wildlife Service),"This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service, in association with the Wetland Component of the National Conservation Effects Assessment Project and interagency agreement with U.S. Fish andWildlife Service (USFWS).

However, current gravity field solutions still cannot reach the prelaunch baseline accuracy. One of the reasons for that is the presence of colored noise in GRACE data, which is typically ignored in the classical dynamic approach to gravity field modeling. In this research, we propose to account for colored noise in the classical dynamic approach by applying the frequency-dependent data weighting (FDDW) scheme, so that enhanced estimates of gravity field solutions are produced. The monthly solutions are compared with those produced using the standard least squares adjustment without a data weighting scheme. The comparison is performed in both spectral and spatial domains, showing the positive effect of the FDDW scheme in all considered cases. For instance, the cumulative geoid height errors up to degree 96 are reduced by 18%. In the spatial domain, the FDDW scheme lowers noise level in mass changes over the oceans, Mississippi river basin, and Greenland by 20, 38, and 23%, respectively, when compared to the without a data weighting scheme. In addition, the consistency of mass changes over the Mississippi and Congo river basins with those inferred from the state-of-the-art hydrology model WaterGAP is substantially improved when the FDDW scheme is applied. These results indicate that modeling colored noise in the GRACE data allows to significantly improve the recovered monthly solutions. This finding is likely applicable also to the GRACE Follow-On mission.","[Guo, Xiang; Zhao, Qile; Liu, Jingnan] Wuhan Univ, GNSS Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ditmar, Pavel] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands; [Sun, Yu] Fuzhou Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Data Min & Informat Sharing, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Delft University of Technology; Fuzhou University,"Zhao, QL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, GNSS Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhaoql@whu.edu.cn,,"Guo, Xiang/0000-0001-8637-5097; Ditmar, Pavel/0000-0002-8188-7680",National 863 Program of China [2014AA121501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41574030],National 863 Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work was sponsored by the National 863 Program of China (grant 2014AA121501) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 41574030).

Key challenges regarding energy generation, distribution and consumption are tackled, sharing knowledge amongst all partners and the general audience, and suitable practical solutions applied to improve DH systems' performances. Integration of renewable sources, promotion of sector coupling through storages and advanced digital tools, pumping and other operational optimization approaches are being applied in a variety of contexts, achieving multi-energy integration, full exploitation of existing assets and reduction of energy losses, operative costs and GHG emissions. Sound technical and business approaches are integrated by developing new business models and regional action plans designed to ensure overall sustainability and increase opportunities for technological scaleup and deployment of modern DH systems.

Modeling of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions emerged as an effective tool to help in developing and assessing such technologies, to help in predicting aggregate vehicle fuel consumption and emissions, and to complement traffic simulation models. The paper identifies the current state of the art on vehicle fuel consumption and emissions modeling and its utilization to test the environmental impact of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)' measures and to evaluate transportation network improvements. The study presents the relevant models to ITS in the key classifications of models in this research area. It demonstrates that the trends of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions provided by current models generally do satisfactorily replicate field data trends. It shows as well that microscopic modeling is the most accurate type of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions modeling and macroscopic modeling is most helpful in estimating aggregate emissions inventories. In addition, the paper demonstrates that mesoscopic models and empirical models strike a balance between accuracy and simplicity so that they are highly suitable for evaluating the environmental impact of the ITS' measures and transportation network improvements. The study indicates that there is a significant impact of ITS measures on vehicle fuel consumption and emissions rates. It identifies as well the relation among transportation models, cold start excess emission modeling subcategories, and hotstabilized emission models. The study concludes that no one model as yet fully meets the needs of ITS applications.","[Faris, Waleed; Elmoselhy, Salah A.

The goal to inspire guided the design of Dig It! The Secrets of Soil: a large exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Washington, DC, for 18 mo beginning in June 2008. The Dig It! exhibit was designed from an ecosystem perspective, in which agriculture the traditional context for soils education is considered to be just one of many ecosystem types. For visitors inspired primarily by art and culture, there were objects chosen to surprise and expand the imagination about soils. The exhibit was designed to communicate to wide range of ages, centered on 12-14 yr olds. As such, it was rich in audiovisual media that included a cartoon, a movie, two looping videos, a kiosk for exploring the state soils, a quiz game, and a role-playing game. It also included scale models and actual soil monoliths. The exhibit addressed the full spectrum of issues that concern contemporary soil scientists climate change, aquatic eutrophication, soil degradation, sustainable farming, and others by organizing the content according to scale (global, regional, and local). Interviews with visitors indicated that the exhibit had the potential to effectively alter the preconceived notions of more than 2 million visitors about soils. We fully expect the exhibit to continue inspiring the public about soils through the richness of the exhibit website (www.forces.si.edu/soils; verified 6 Mar. 2010), which includes videos, games, and interactive content.","[Megonigal, J.

J,"Hirsch, JL",,,,"Hirsch, Jennifer L.",,,New Allies for Nature and Culture: Exploring Common Ground for a Just and Sustainable Chicago Region,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The environmental justice movement (EJM) has long focused on the intersections between environmental and social issues. Recently, movements linking these issues have been gaining momentum around the world. This article examines an initiative called New Allies for Nature and Culture that has been promoting the integration of environmental and social justice work in the Chicago region. Led by the Division of Environment, Culture, and Conservation (ECCo) at The Field Museum with two partners, Lake County Forest Preserves and Friends of Ryerson Woods, New Allies involved a year of applied anthropological research followed by a series of gatherings that brought together representatives from diverse organizations across the Chicago region. The research identified five common concerns shared by environmental and social justice organizations: health and food, youth development, arts/ creative practices, economic development, and climate change. It also identified three models for connecting social and environmental issues: creating communities of choice, environmental projects as holistic approaches, and linking nature and cultural heritage. New Allies' initial impact on the work of the three project partners suggests that these issues and models have the potential to build stronger relationships between organizations working on social and environmental issues. The article concludes by exploring some implications of these growing integrated movements for the EJM. Briefly the implications point toward opportunities for the EJM to expand its influence as  translation experts and promote just sustainability, as well as to evolve from a reactive movement to a movement that promotes a radical change in our system of values.","[Hirsch, Jennifer L.] Field Museum, Div Sci, Environm Culture Conser ECCo, Chicago, IL USA",Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago),"Hirsch, JL (corresponding author), Field Museum, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",jhirsch@fieldmuseum.org,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1939-4071,1937-5174,,ENVIRON JUSTICE,Environ.

In some areas erosion rates are sufficiently rapid to be of concern to planners, whereas other cliffs have eroded imperceptibly slowly over human timescales. This paper reviews work conducted on New Zealand's cliffed coasts, from the pioneering studies of Sir Charles Cotton, who used Davisian theoretical methods to elucidate the evolution of hard-rock coasts, to Jeremy Gibb's nationwide benchmark measurements of historical erosion rates. This review is augmented with a description of state-of-the art methods in use globally for investigating processes of cliff evolution. Key methods identified include detailed measurements using the micro-erosion meter as well as novel geophysical methods of studying cliff movement under wave loading. Such process-based studies build on previous research that has been largely confined to explanatory description and observation. It is recognised that the combined impact of such studies has been relatively muted, owing particularly to the difficulty of unravelling ambiguous process-form interactions. However, the increasingly widespread availability of terrestrial and aerial remote laser scanning systems now provides an opportunity to re-invigorate such studies by extending the scale from local to regional. The paper concludes by outlining prospects within New Zealand for further research. In particular, the development and use of numerical models is seen as an important avenue both for clarifying some basic behaviours observed on cliffed coasts, and for studying the likely response of eroding cliffs to future climate change.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Christchurch 8440, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Kennedy, DM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",,"Dickson, Mark/C-7316-2008","KENNEDY, DAVID/0000-0002-4878-7717",,,,,86,7,8,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-6758,1175-8899,,J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL,J.

One of the key difficulties in doing this is the range of different methods of dating that can be used across different disciplines. For this reason, one of the main outputs of INTIMATE has been to use an event-stratigraphic approach which enables researchers to co-register synchronous events (such as the deposition of tephra from major volcanic eruptions) in different archives (Blockley et al., 2012). However, this only partly solves the problem, because it gives information only at particular short intervals where such information is present. Between these points the ability to compare different records is necessarily less precise chronologically. What is needed therefore is a way to quantify the uncertainties in the correlations between different records, even if they are dated by different methods, and make maximum use of the information available that links different records. This paper outlines the design of a database that is intended to provide integration of timescales and associated environmental proxy information. The database allows for the fact that all timescales have their own limitations, which should be quantified in terms of the uncertainties quoted. It also makes use of the fact that each timescale has strengths in terms of describing the data directly associated with it. For this reason the approach taken allows users to look at data on any timescale that can in some way be related to the data of interest, rather than specifying a specific timescale or timescales which should always be used. The information going into the database is primarily: proxy information (principally from sediments and ice cores) against depth, age depth models against reference chronologies (typically IntCal or ice core), and time-transfer functions that relate different timescales to each other, through the use of event stratigraphies or global phenomena such as cosmogenic isotope production rate variations.

N addition (+N) was combined with phosphorus (P) addition (+P) to determine nutrient limitations in plant functional groups. To examine responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and AMF effects on plant growth, in-growth cores containing local plant species (phytometers) were inserted, and in half of them the external mycelium was disrupted weekly to impede mycorrhizal functioning. At harvest, aboveground biomass and element concentrations of the established vegetation were measured, as well as phytometer shoot and root mass, and the percentage of root length colonized (%RLC) by AMF. Only productivity of grasses increased under +N and +P, while other groups showed no or negative growth responses. +P decreased %RLC in all phytometers, whereas +N increased %RLC in the most abundant grass species, and reduced the relative abundance of arbuscules to total intraradical mycelium in the other species. Weekly destruction of the external mycelium reduced %RLC in most species, but did not affect plant biomass. The results suggest that increased N deposition in such N- and P-co-limited grassland will lead to shifts in plant functional group composition due to differences in the plants' nutrient demand, that +N will affect AMF abundance and mutualistic functioning, but that changes in AMF abundance may not considerably affect plant growth.

Beneath the published, terminal Pleistocene sequence, recent excavations have uncovered a similar to 5m stratigraphic sequence containing flaked stone artifacts and sedimentary features that indicate extensive post-depositional change. As the effects of tropical conditions on Pleistocene cave sediments are poorly resolved, a range of complementary techniques was selected to reconstruct the nature of on-site sedimentation and occupation, while assessing the taphonomy of archaeological and palaeoecological materials. Our approach incorporates microstratigraphic, geochemical and sedimentological analyses, using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to estimate the time of sediment deposition in the cave. This case study has broad application to tropical zones worldwide. Sedimentation began in early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, while micromorphologically observed human occupation commenced before 42 thousand years ago (ka). By placing our results within the context of published, high-resolution regional records of climate, we demonstrate that on-site rhythms of Pleistocene occupation correlated with environmental changes in the region. During MIS 3, episodic abandonment of the site coincided with periods of drier conditions, while rapid climate fluctuations in MIS 2 corresponded with short-lived occupation events and a switch to predominantly geogenic deposition in the cave.","[McAdams, Conor; Roberts, Richard G.] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Kandyba, Alexander, V; Derevianko, Anatoly P.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol & Ethnog, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Nguyen, Dong T.; Doi, Nguyen G.] Vietnamese Acad Social Sci, Vietnamese Inst Archaeol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Roberts, Richard G.] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Australian Res Council, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","University of Wollongong; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Archaeology & Ethnography, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences; University of Wollongong","McAdams, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cm065@uowmail.edu.au,"Roberts, Richard Graham/B-8245-2013; CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019; Kandyba, Alexander/Q-4000-2016","Roberts, Richard Graham/0000-0002-0128-4119; Kandyba, Alexander/0000-0003-0985-9121; Fu, Xiao/0000-0002-4666-8749; Morley, Mike/0000-0001-7730-9637; McAdams, Conor/0000-0002-1499-315X",University of Wollongong; Australian Research Council [FL130100116],University of Wollongong; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"University of Wollongong; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: FL130100116",,125,11,12,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-6353,1520-6548,,GEOARCHAEOLOGY,Geoarchaeology,JAN-FEB,2020,1,,,,72,97,,10.1002/gea.21758,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gea.21758,,19-Aug,26,"Archaeology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology; Geology,QJ0AQ,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000481112200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed at improving the modelling of apple flowering time with the purpose of exploring the possible impacts of global warming in the recent past and in the near future. Dates of flowering F1 stage in 'Golden Delicious' apple orchards were collected in three cropping areas in France over the 1976-2002 period which provided a suitable climatic variability for modelling, taking account of the global warming. Original soft-ware, 'Pollenoscope', was used to estimate the parameters related to flower bud chilling and heat requirements, using seven chilling submodels and seven heat submodels. The software allowed an automatic research of optimal combinations of chilling and heat submodels. From more than 1000 tested combinations, 19 appeared optimal for the three areas explaining about 85% of the phenological variability. One of these combinations was used to simulate the time-course changes in endodormancy breaking and F1 stage over the 1976-2002 period. In each area, these simulations highlighted a slight trend towards a delayed end of dormancy and inversely a marked trend towards a shortening of floral primordium, active growth period. These results can account for the observed trend in the advance of flowering time. They suggest the existence of two opposite impacts of global warming in France since the end of 1980s, being a delay in satisfying the chilling requirements and a shortening in satisfying the heat requirements.","[Legave, J.

In Australia and several south-west Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), there are a limited number of in situ SM stations that can adequately assess soil-water availability in a near-real-time context. Satellite SM datasets provide a viable alternative for SM monitoring and agrometeorological drought provision in these regions. In this study, we investigated the performance of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS), SM from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) and SM from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) over Australia and south-west Pacific SIDS. Products were first evaluated in Australia, given the presence of several in-situ SM monitoring stations and a state-of-the-art hydrological model-the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape modelling system (AWRA-L). We further investigated the accuracy of SM satellite datasets in Australia and the south-west Pacific through Triple Collocation analysis with two other SM reference datasets-ERA5 reanalysis SM data and model data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset. All datasets have differing observation periods ranging from 1911-now, with a common period of observations between 2015-2021. Results demonstrated that ASCAT and SMOS were consistently superior in their performance. Analysis in the six south-west Pacific SIDS indicated reduced performance for all products, with ASCAT and SMOS still performing better than others for most SIDS with median R values ranging between 0.3-0.9. We conducted a case study of the 2015 El Nino and Positive Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought in Papua New Guinea. It was shown that ASCAT is a valuable dataset indicative of agrometeorological drought for the nation, highlighting the value of using satellite SM products to provide early warning of drought in data-sparse regions in the south-west Pacific.","[Bhardwaj, Jessica; Kuleshov, Yuriy; Chua, Zhi-Weng; Watkins, Andrew B.] Bur Meteorol, Docklands 3008, Australia; [Bhardwaj, Jessica; Kuleshov, Yuriy; Chua, Zhi-Weng; Choy, Suelynn; Sun, Qian (Chayn)] Royal Melbourne Inst Technol RMIT Univ, SPACE Res Ctr, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Kuleshov, Y (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Docklands 3008, Australia.;Kuleshov, Y (corresponding author), Royal Melbourne Inst Technol RMIT Univ, SPACE Res Ctr, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",yuriy.kuleshov@bom.gov.au,,"Bhardwaj, Jessica/0000-0002-8323-6638",World Meteorological Organization through the Weather and Climate EarlyWarning System for Papua New Guinea (CREWS-PNG) project [20170888],World Meteorological Organization through the Weather and Climate EarlyWarning System for Papua New Guinea (CREWS-PNG) project,This research was supported by the World Meteorological Organization through the Weather and Climate EarlyWarning System for Papua New Guinea (CREWS-PNG) project 20170888.,,61,0,0,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2022,16,,,,,,3971,10.3390/rs14163971,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14163971,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4A8MJ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000845347800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study is to investigate, using a global chemistry transport model, to what extent aviation emissions outside the boundary layer influence air quality in the boundary layer. The large-scale effects of current levels of aircraft emissions were studied through comparison of multiple simulations allowing for the separated effects of aviation emissions occurring in the low, middle and upper troposphere. We show that emissions near cruise altitudes (9-11 km in altitude) rather than emissions during landing and take-off are responsible for most of the total odd-nitrogen (NOy), ozone (O-3) and aerosol perturbations near the ground with a noticeable seasonal difference. Overall, the perturbations of these species are smaller than 1 ppb even in winter when the perturbations are greater than in summer. Based on the widely used air quality standards and uncertainty of state-of-the-art models, we conclude that aviation-induced perturbations have a negligible effect on air quality even in areas with heavy air traffic. Aviation emissions lead to a less than 1% aerosol enhancement in the boundary layer due to a slight increase in ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) during cold seasons and a statistically insignificant aerosol perturbation in summer. In addition, statistical analysis using probability density functions, Hellinger distance, and p value indicate that aviation emissions outside the boundary layer do not affect the occurrence of extremely high aerosol concentrations in the boundary layer. An additional sensitivity simulation assuming the doubling of surface ammonia emissions demonstrates that the aviation induced aerosol increase near the ground is highly dependent on background ammonia concentrations whose current range of uncertainty is large.","[Lee, H.; Olsen, S.

Novosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia that attracts tourists and Novosibirsk Oblast residents. Some major events are held in this city, and the 2023 Ice Hockey World Junior Championship is among them. The aim of the work is to determine the possible path to the formation of the Novosibirsk brand. To do this, it is necessary to solve some problems: firstly, consider the world experience in creating a city brand, secondly, conduct a survey of residents of Novosibirsk to find out their own ideas about the city, thirdly, conduct a study of factors affecting the uniqueness of the city. The main source of research was Novosibirsk, as well as other cities, such as Amsterdam, Sydney, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Smolensk. The research methodology included a full-scale examination of the environment of Novosibirsk with subsequent observation and photofixation, as well as an analysis of the world experience of city branding based on photographic materials and illustrations. The foundation for the theoretical foundations of the formation of the Novosibirsk brand was the scientific work on the territorial branding and color of the city. Doctor of Architecture A.V. Efimov, within the framework of his scientific school, the works of V.Zh. Elizarova, G. A. Sadigovoy, T.S. Semenova, A.V. Gavryushkina, O.A. Kozyreva and others. The works on D.V. are devoted to developments in territorial branding. Vizgalova, D.N. Zamyatina, Ya.R. Sufiyanova and others. We have conducted a comparative analysis of territory branding formation and city colouristic to determine a way of creating a city's image. In the process, we have discovered similar theoretical bases, such as cultural identity characteristics, environmental and climate features. As a result, we have completed a model of the brand's graphic of the Siberian city. Next, the model was applied to Novosibirsk. Novosibirsk is a young city (est. 1893), it's planning structure is very complex and multicore, the climate is humid continental and the terrain can be characterized as plain. Most city residents are the fifth-sixth generation visitors, which makes it hard to determine Novosibirsk's traditional culture. To define residents' cultural preferences, we have conducted a social poll. 160 people have taken part in the poll; 31.6% of participants are art undergraduate students aged 17-24, 56.1% are adults aged 18-50. We have come to general conclusions based on a described analysis, that became a basis of a brand we have been working on. The majority of responses have verified that a major per cent of respondents lacks the feeling of a place since they have mentioned only a few buildings of a historical core among city symbols. Respondents have also shown a low level of wayfinding: a lot of them have hard times locating without a personal navigator. The majority of respondents is proud of the symbolic constructions of Novosibirsk, among which are the Opera and Ballet Theater, the Bugrinskiy bridge and the Glory monument; they also characterize Novosibirsk as a scientific city. The authors suggest a concept of Novosibirsk's graphic image, where it is presented through Mendeleev's periodic table.","[Vorozhejkina, Vera A.; Kazarezov, Aleksey A.; Aken't'eva, Yulia S.] Novosibirsk State Univ Architecture, Novosibirsk, Russia",,"Vorozhejkina, VA (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ Architecture, Novosibirsk, Russia.",saalha@mail.ru,,,,,,,19,0,0,2,3,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2222-0836,2311-3685,,VESTN TOMSK GOS U KU,Vestn.

This study synthesized current strategies and challenges for river restoration in systems governed by change, emphasizing (1) an international survey of practitioners to document the state-of-the-practice, including challenges facing practitioners implementing river restoration and (2) a literature review of the state of the art in designing for resiliency, including advantages and limitations of established and more-experimental design approaches and tools. Survey results highlighted fundamental challenges associated with identifying appropriate project objectives within a design practice largely relying on historical data, the significance of social and regulatory barriers, and the need to focus on underlying processes. Important discrepancies between the expectations for resiliency of projects and the practices being implemented emerged. The state-of-the-art literature review summarized how design strategies may be modified to address those discrepancies, and discussed the divergent approaches for increasing resilience through (1) increasing resistance to change (i.e., stabilization) and (2) restoration of a channel's dynamism to reduce the risk of, and recovery time following, disturbances. Both the state of the practice and the state of the art highlight the lack of resiliency within the practice of river restoration itself, and illustrate the importance of designers, funders, regulators, and stakeholders adapting and innovating as the natural and human landscape they are managing changes.

The scene uncertainty is captured in a joint manner, where diversity of scene modes is ensured by training multiple separate anchor networks which specialize to different scene realizations. At the same time, each network outputs multiple trajectories that cover smaller deviations given a scene mode, thus capturing motion modes. In addition, we train our architectures with an outlier-robust regression loss function, which offers a trade-off between the outlier-sensitive L-2 and outlier-insensitive L-1 losses.

The need to historicise and continue to account for Finn-Kelcey's life and practice is made more pressing by her death in February 2014. In this sense, the article is firstly one of historical 'recovery', shedding new light on Finn-Kelcey's working processes and approaches to performances One for Sorrow Two for Joy (1976) and Mind the Gap (1980), as well as offering an overview of her work and surrounding cultural climates to elaborate on existing accounts. In particular, the article details Finn-Kelcey's participation in feminist discourses and artist-led groups such as Women Artists Collective, as interwoven with her artistic practice. Alongside the function of archival 'recovery', the article also suggests a model of feminist historiography and criticism, and draws attention to ways in which this is prompted and enabled by the challenges posed in Finn-Kelcey's work.","[Roberts, Eleanor] Univ London, Dept Drama Queen Mary, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London,"Roberts, E (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Drama Queen Mary, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,"Roberts, Eleanor/0000-0001-5045-3559",,,,,62,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6540,1741-7287,,OXFORD ART J,Oxf.

A key advantage of the proposed technique is the ability to directly compute steady-state solutions, a facility particularly well-suited to tracers such as natural radiocarbon.

Because building the palaeogeographic datasets for these models is often a time-consuming and elaborate exercise, palaeoclimate models frequently use reconstructions in which the latest state-of-the-art plate tectonic reconstructions, palaeotopography and -bathymetry, or vegetation have not yet been incorporated. In this paper, we therefore provide a new method to efficiently generate a global geographical reconstruction for the middle-late Eocene. The generalised procedure is also reusable to create reconstructions for other time slices within the Cenozoic, suitable for palaeoclimate modelling. We use a plate-tectonic model to make global masks containing the distribution of land, continental shelves, shallow basins and deep ocean. The use of depth-age relationships for oceanic crust together with adjusted present-day topography gives a first estimate of the global geography at a chosen time frame. This estimate subsequently needs manual editing of areas where existing geological data indicate that the altimetry has changed significantly over time. Certain generic changes (e.g. lowering mountain ranges) can be made relatively easily by defining a set of masks while other features may require a more specific treatment. Since the discussion regarding many of these regions is still ongoing, it is crucial to make it easy for changes to be incorporated without having to redo the entire procedure. In this manner, a complete reconstruction can be made that suffices as a boundary condition for numerical models with a limited effort. This facilitates the interaction between experts in geology and palaeoclimate modelling, keeping reconstructions up to date and improving the consistency between different studies. Moreover, it facilitates model intercomparison studies and sensitivity tests regarding certain geographical features as newly generated boundary conditions can more easily be incorporated in different model simulations. The workflow is presented covering a middle-late Eocene reconstruction (38 Ma), using a MatLab script and a complete set of source files that are provided in the supplementary material.","[Baatsen, Michiel; von der Heydt, Anna S.; Dijkstra, Henk A.] Univ Utrecht, IMAU, Princetonpl 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Hinsbergen, Douwe J.

Such inadvertent climatic modifications at the indoor level have imposed considerable demand on the urban energy resources. It is important to provide comfortable ambient climate at open urban squares. Researchers need to predict the comfortable conditions at such outdoor squares. The main objective of this study is predict the visitors' outdoor comfort indices by using a developed computational model termed as SVM-WAVELET (Support Vector Machines combined with Discrete Wavelet Transform algorithm). For data collection, the field study was conducted in downtown Isfahan, Iran (51 degrees 41' E, 32 degrees 37' N) with hot and arid summers. Based on different environmental elements, four separate locations were monitored across two public squares. Meteorological data were measured simultaneously by surveying the visitors' thermal sensations. According to the subjects' thermal feeling and their characteristics, their level of comfort was estimated. Further, the adapted computational model was used to estimate the visitors' thermal sensations in terms of thermal comfort indices. The SVM-WAVELET results indicate that R-2 value for input parameters, including Thermal Sensation, PMW (The predicted mean vote), PET (physiologically equivalent temperature), SET (standard effective temperature) and T-mrt were estimated at 0.482, 0.943, 0.988, 0.969 and 0.840, respectively.

The context for this is the role of small-scale renewable energy in addressing climate change. In the UK a number of small wind turbines have reached the market, however, in almost all cases, these are existing HAWT or VAWT tower mounted systems. Due to their inherent design qualities, and issues such as planning requirements, these have much reduced output due to their form and siting and are unable to take advantage of augmented airflow around buildings. The Crossflex proposal is a radical new development of a Darrieus turbine form. As well as having a technically innovative flexible blade system, it also utilises a lightweight cowling system that can provide both augmented airflow and improved visual integration into new and existing building forms. It is a modular form that can be sited on ridges and corners of buildings to provide useful levels of generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The enhanced version of these video frames is important as to assist law enforcement agency for investigation or to be tended as evidence in court. The most significant problem observed in the analysis is the enhancement of objects under probe in video. In many cases, the probes appeared to be in low-resolution and degraded with noise, lens blur and compression artifacts. The enhancement of these, low quality probes via conventional method of denoising and resizing has proven to further degrade the quality of the probe, The. objective. of this paper is to propose an enhancement analysis algorithm based on super-resolution. Hence, we present an solution which is a single-frame solution for super-resolution. For that purpose, our proposed method incorporates sparse coding with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization in order to improve hallucination of probes in video. Sparse coding is employed in learning a localized pari-based subspace which synthesizes higher resolution with respect to overcomplete patch dictionaries. We test our proposed method and compare with state-of-the-art methods namely resampling and super-resolution method, by enhancing probes in exhibit videos. We measure the image quality using peak-signal-to-noise-ratio. The result shows that our proposed method outperforms state-of the-art methods after enhancing, probes in exhibit videos.","[Zamani, Nazri A.; Zaharudin, A. D.

Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 degrees C during the test period (DL: 1.78 degrees C, PB: 2.03 degrees C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.","[Read, Jordan S.; Appling, Alison P.; Zwart, Jacob A.; Oliver, Samantha K.; Watkins, William] US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Jia, Xiaowei; Willard, Jared; Steinbach, Michael; Kumar, Vipin] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Karpatne, Anuj] Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Hansen, Gretchen J.

It is related to climate and soil characteristics, but mainly to deforestation and inappropriate use and management of natural resources including soil and water. The main effects are a decrease in water supply, a non sustainable agricultural and food production, and increased risks of catastrophic flooding, sedimentation, landslides, etc. In the medium or long term, the previewed global climatic changes may contribute to accelerate the processes of desertification in the Mediterranean Region, but in the short term, land use practices leading to soil degradation processes would increase the negative influence of those changes. The processes of soil and water degradation, leading to desertification, are strongly linked to unfavourable changes in the hydrological processes responsible for the soil water balance and for the soil moisture regime. These are affected by the climate conditions and variations, and by the changes in the use and management of soil and water resources. In the and and semiarid Mediterranean climates, the rainfall is highly variable among years and during the year, and usually occurs in erratic storms of short duration and high intensities. This factor increases the risks of land degradation leading to desertification processes. In N Mediterranean countries, agricultural production patterns and practices have been drastically changed in the last decades, emphasizing labour-substituting technologies in some cases, with abandon of traditional soil and water conservation practices, and leading to the abandonment of agricultural lands in others. By contrast, in most of the S Mediterranean countries, population growth and lack of resources have obliged to intensify the use of marginal lands without appropriate conservation practices. Both situations frequently lead to accelerated land degradation and desertification processes, although in N Mediterranean countries, if resources are available, these processes and effects are usually masked by technological external inputs of energy, irrigation water, nutrients, and other control measures. Any break in these artificial measures, generally causes a complete loss of productivity and leads to accelerated desertification processes. Hydrological approaches would be essential to identify and assess the causes and processes of desertification. The evaluation of the hydrological processes, under different scenarios of changing climate, soil properties, and land use and management, with flexible simulation models based on those processes, may help to predict and to identify the biophysical causes of desertification at local, national and regional levels. This is a required previous step for a rational land use planning, and for the selection and development of short and long term strategies and technologies to reduce or to control land degradation processes leading to desertification, and to the related social economic and security problems. There is proposed an integrated framework for the development of this kind of approach, with potential application under Mediterranean conditions.","Univ Lleida, Dept Med Ambient Ciencies Solj, Lleida, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,,,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1871-4668,,1-4020-3758-9,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,,,2006,,,,,579,600,,,,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BDW96,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000235906500027,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focuses on deciphering the stratigraphic record of eolian deposition and associated luminescence dating of quartz extracts by single aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocols. Stratigraphic assessment coupled with luminescence ages indicates that there are four broad eolian depositional events at ca. 3145 +/- 220 yr, 1950-1360 yr. 800 +/- 100 yr. and 690-315 yr. This nascent chronology, correlated with regional archeological evidence and paleoclimate proxy datasets, leads to two general conclusions: (1) loess deposits, transverse-dune formation and sand-sheet deposition in the late Holocene are probably linked to flow variability of the Gila River, though the last two events are concordant with regional megadroughts; and (2) the stability of eolian landforms since the 19th century reflects the lack of eolian sediment supply during a period of fluvial incision, resulting in Entisol formation on dunes.

We used visibility data from meteorological stations in dusty regions to assess the anthropogenic impact on long term trends in desert dust emissions. We did this by looking at time series of visibility derived variables and their correlations with precipitation, drought, winds, land use and grazing. Visibility data are available at thousands of stations globally from 1900 to the present, but we focused on 357 stations with more than 30 years of data in regions where mineral aerosols play a dominant role in visibility observations. We evaluated the 1974 to 2003 time period because most of these stations have reliable records only during this time. We first evaluated the visibility data against AERONET aerosol optical depth data, and found that only in dusty regions are the two moderately correlated. Correlation coefficients between visibility-derived variables and AERONET optical depths indicate a moderate correlation (0.47), consistent with capturing about 20% of the variability in optical depths. Two visibility-derived variables appear to compare the best with AERONET observations: the fraction of observations with visibility less than 5 km (VIS5) and the surface extinction (EXT). Regional trends show that in many dusty places, VIS5 and EXT are statistically significantly correlated with the Palmer drought severity index (based on precipitation and temperature) or surface wind speeds, consistent with dust temporal variability being largely driven by meteorology. This is especially true for North African and Chinese dust sources, but less true in the Middle East, Australia or South America, where there are not consistent patterns in the correlations. Climate indices such as El Nino or the North Atlantic Oscillation are not correlated with visibility-derived variables in this analysis. There are few stations where visibility measures are correlated with cultivation or grazing estimates on a temporal basis, although this may be a function of the very coarse temporal resolution of the land use datasets. On the other hand, spatial analysis of the visibility data suggests that natural topographic lows are not correlated with VIS5 or EXT, but land use is correlated at a moderate level. This analysis is consistent with land use being important in some regions, but meteorology driving interannual variability during 1974-2003.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Computat Earth Syst Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Geog, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Kansas; McGill University,"Mahowald, NM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",mahowald@ucar.edu,"Mahowald, Natalie M/D-8388-2013; Feddema, Johannes/J-4400-2012; Ramankutty, Navin/AAM-6074-2020","Mahowald, Natalie M/0000-0002-2873-997X; Feddema, Johannes/0000-0002-0800-0908; Ramankutty, Navin/0000-0002-3737-5717",,,,,67,167,168,0,43,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

The water level of Lake Victoria is determined by its water balance, consisting of precipitation on the lake, evaporation from the lake, inflow from tributary rivers and lake outflow, controlled by two hydropower dams. Due to a scarcity of in situ observations, previous estimates of individual water balance terms are characterized by substantial uncertainties, which means that the water balance is often not closed independently. In this first part of a two-paper series, we present a water balance model for Lake Victoria, using state-of-the-art remote sensing observations, high-resolution reanalysis downscaling and outflow values recorded at the dam. The uncalibrated computation of the individual water balance terms yields lake level fluctuations that closely match the levels retrieved from satellite altimetry. Precipitation is the main cause of seasonal and interannual lake level fluctuations, and on average causes the lake level to rise from May to July and to fall from August to December. Finally, our results indicate that the 2004-2005 drop in lake level can be about half attributed to a drought in the Lake Victoria Basin and about half to an enhanced outflow, highlighting the sensitivity of the lake level to human operations at the outflow dam.","[Vanderkelen, Inne; Thiery, Wim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium; [van Lipzig, Nicole P.

The models largely differ in their global mean radiation budgets, particularly at the surface. Compared to a comprehensive data set of 760 worldwide-distributed surface stations from the Global Energy Balance Archive, the models tend to overestimate the land surface insolation by 9 Wm(-2) on average. The biases in the net solar fluxes at the top of atmosphere are generally smaller. This suggests that the excessive surface insolation in the GCMs is rather related to inaccurate partitioning of solar absorption between surface and atmosphere than to excessive absorption by the planet as a whole. This applies also to 13 state-of-the-art GCMs participating in IPCC AR4. Uncertainties in the solar absorption by the atmospheric constituents are thus still significant in current GCMs and contribute to the large discrepancies amongst the GCM radiation budgets and their biases compared to surface observations.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Wild, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.wild@env.ethz.ch,"Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012",,,,,,20,49,53,0,8,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Energy consumption by housing is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and a cause of depletion of non-renewable energy sources. Of particular concern is existing stock, which has the worst performance and is hardest to improve. One means of addressing these issues that is attracting increasing interest is the integration of embedded renewable energy technologies. This paper discusses the use of wind turbines on buildings as a response to climate change legislation. It examines the potential for embedded generation in a specific built form (existing high rise housing) and places this in the context of a particular geographical location (Glasgow, Scotland) where the existing provision is highly problematic, but which also presents significant potential. It describes findings from two projects in Glasgow, a pilot installation on a city centre multi-storey block, and subsequent feasibility study for a Housing Association managed multi-storey block and identifies the problems and opportunities that may be applied in similar projects elsewhere.","Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Sch Architecture, MEARU, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow School of Art,"Sharpe, T (corresponding author), Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Sch Architecture, MEARU, 11 Dalhousie St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland.",t.sharpe@gsa.ac.uk,,"Sharpe, Tim/0000-0002-4275-5351",,,,,21,2,2,1,7,OPEN HOUSE INT ASSOC,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,SEP,2008,3,,,,60,69,,,,,,10,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,361FQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000260113300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate this effect a synoptic situation in the past which is expected to occur more often in future is analyzed in terms of air quality. In this study the effect of the meteorological conditions in the extreme summer 2003 on the concentration of PM10 and its components is investigated over Europe. To this end measurements of the EMEP network in Europe of the summer 2003 were compared to the average of the summers of a five years period (2003-2007). Furthermore simulation runs were performed with the German chemistry transport model REM-Calgrid and the Dutch model LOTOS-EUROS, to analyze whether state-of-the-art chemistry transport models are able to reproduce the observed concentrations during this episode. The synoptic situation in summer 2003 resulted in 1-10 mu g m(-3) higher observed PM10 concentrations compared to the five years average. This increase was not reproduced to the same extent by the two models at most of the stations and the two models show evident differences in their PM10 simulations. The correlation between PM10 concentrations and meteorological parameters indicates that observed concentrations increase during weather conditions with high daily maximum temperature. The same holds for elemental carbon which is chosen as an example for a primary component. Low horizontal transport and the absence of wet deposition as a result of low wind speed and little precipitation associated with conditions with high temperatures favour the accumulation of pollutants in the lower troposphere. Although these conditions are reflected in the meteorological input data of the chemistry transport models used in this study, the models were not able to reproduce this relationship; they underestimate the observed high concentrations. This indicates that the underestimation of the variability of PM with meteorology is due to missing but important components and associated emissions or uncertainties therein, e.g. mineral dust, secondary organic aerosols and wild fires. To improve the simulation performance of the chemistry transport models as function of meteorological conditions these emission sources and the formation of secondary organic aerosols have to be included or improved and the dependency of anthropogenic emissions on meteorological conditions should be explicitly taken into account. These are essential issues for the simulation of such extreme conditions. (C) 012 Elsevier Ltd.

One method to use renewable resources is to apply integrated systems. In this study, an optimal multi-objective integrated system has been applied to power generation. The proposed system includes wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants, and photovoltaic systems. To achieve maximum power generation with minimum fluctuations, a Developed Owl search algorithm (DOSA) with three pareto front solutions has been used. Also, the efficiency of the integrated system in different climate conditions is evaluated. The results of the pareto front show that the developed owl search algorithm is the closest algorithm to the pareto front. Therefore, it is the most accurate to improve the overall multi objective integrated system. Among pareto front solutions, the second solution provides acceptable results for increasing power generation and reduction of fluctuations. Also, the results of the evaluation of the efficient integrated system in different climate conditions show that in wet conditions when solar radiation and wind are reduced, hydropower causes current to continue in the system by generating electricity and compensating for wind and PV energy loss.

MES has received much attention in laboratory-scale research, although a technoeconomic-driven roadmap towards validation and large-scale demonstration of the technology is lacking. In this work, two main integrated systems were modelled, centered on (1) MES-from-CO2 and (2) MES from short-chain carboxylates, both for the production of pure, or mixture of, acetate, n-butyrate, and n-caproate. Twenty eight key parameters were identified, and their impact on techno-economic feasibility of the systems assessed. The main capital and operating costs were found to be the anode material cost (59%) and the electricity consumption (up to 69%), respectively. Under current state-of-the-art MES performance and economic conditions, these systems were found non-viable. However, it was demonstrated that sole improvement of MES performance, independent of improvement of non-technological parameters, would result in profitability. In otherwise state-of-the-art conditions, an improved electron selectivity (>= 36%) towards n-caproate, especially at the expense of acetate, was showed to result in positive net present values (i.e. profitability; NPV). Cell voltage, faradaic efficiency, and current density also have significant impact on both the capital and operating costs. Variation in electricity cost on overall process feasibility was also investigated, with a cost lower than 0.045 (sic) kWh(-1) resulting in positive NPV of the state-of-the-art scenario. Maximum purification costs were also determined to assess the integration of a product's separation unit, which was showed possible at positive NPV. Finally, we briefly discuss CO2 electroreduction versus MES, and their potential market complementarities.","[Jourdin, Ludovic; Strik, David P. B. T.

Several cases representing commonly occurring cloud types were simulated in an effort to understand which ice nucleation modes contribute the most to total concentrations of ice crystals. The cases include a completely idealised warm bubble, semi-idealised deep convection, an orographic cloud, and a stratiform case. Despite clear differences in thermodynamic conditions between the cases, the results are remarkably consistent between the different cloud types. In all the investigated cloud types and under normal aerosol conditions, immersion freezing dominates and contact freezing also contributes significantly. At colder temperatures, deposition nucleation plays only a small role, and homogeneous freezing is important. To some extent, the temporal evolution of the cloud determines the dominant freezing mechanism and hence the subsequent microphysical processes. Precipitation is not correlated with any one ice nucleation mode, instead occurring simultaneously when several nucleation modes are active. Furthermore, large variations in the aerosol concentration do affect the dominant ice nucleation mode; however, they have only a minor influence on the precipitation amount.","[Hande, Luke B.; Hoose, Corinna] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Hande, LB; Hoose, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",luke.hande@kit.edu; corinna.hoose@kit.edu,"Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009","Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the research unit INUIT-2 [FOR 1525, HO4612/1-2]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the research unit INUIT-2(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the research unit INUIT-2 (FOR 1525, HO4612/1-2).

The few studies on the indoor cooling of vertical greening are almost all conducted in a hot climate area with windowless building models, which is suspected to exaggerate the role of vertical greening in an indoor thermal environment. Through two improvements, this paper explored the realistic impact of vertical greening on an indoor thermal environment. First, we built models according to the actual window-to-wall ratio rather than a fictitious model without windows. Second, an annual cycle evaluation, considering both hot summer and cold winter, was used to replace the typical hot day. With the support of Envi-met and Kriging models, the results revealed that the existing research not only exaggerated vertical greening's positive effects on an indoor thermal environment in hot seasons but also ignored its potential harms to thermal perception in cold seasons. These exaggerated results could easily cause the abuse of vertical greening in cities. In actual windowed buildings, the role of vertical greening in indoor temperatures is not always positive, and the positive effect is not as strong as previous studies suggest.","[Li, Jiayu; Zheng, Bohong] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China",Central South University,"Zheng, BH (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",J.Y.Li@csu.edu.cn; Zhengbohong@csu.edu.cn,,"Li, Jiayu/0000-0002-3698-7527",,,,,52,1,1,15,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2022,2,,,,,,358,10.3390/f13020358,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13020358,,,14,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,ZI1OR,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000761398100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Particularly, the surface wave interactions with the continental shelf and their impact on tropical cyclones have received very little attention. Through a series of state-of-the-art high-resolution, fully-coupled ocean-wave and atmosphere-ocean-wave experiments, we show here, for the first time, that in presence of continental shelf waves can cause substantial cooling of the sea surface. Through whitecapping there is a transfer of momentum from the surface which drives deeper vertical mixing. It is the waves and not just the wind which become the major driver of stratified coastal ocean ahead-of-cyclone cooling. In the fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean-wave model a negative feedback is found. The maximum wind speed is weaker and the damaging footprint area of hurricane-force winds is reduced by up to 50% due to the strong wave induced ocean cooling ahead. Including wave-ocean coupling is important to improve land falling tropical cyclone intensity predictions for the highly populated and vulnerable coasts.","[Bruneau, Nicolas; Toumi, Ralf; Wang, Shuai] Imperial Coll, Dept Phys, Blackett Lab, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Bruneau, Nicolas] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Joseph Proudman Bldg, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England",Imperial College London; NERC National Oceanography Centre,"Bruneau, N (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Dept Phys, Blackett Lab, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Bruneau, N (corresponding author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Joseph Proudman Bldg, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England.",bruneau.n@gmail.com,"Bruneau, Nicolas/AAS-8232-2021","Bruneau, Nicolas/0000-0002-9017-1000; Wang, Shuai/0000-0002-0413-081X; Wang, Shuai/0000-0002-9528-3714",UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund; NERC [noc010010] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [noc010010] Funding Source: researchfish,UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work and its contributors were supported by the UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund.

It is obvious that this situation will not change within the next decade but that a new strategy is necessary. A truly global approach is needed to fully exploit existing and upcoming ocean observing systems. An excellent example has been provided by the World Climate Research Program where a strategy has been defined on how to improve the integration of existing observations and how to expand the scope of the climate observation services by defining so called essential climate variables. This strategy has been taken up by the IOC/GOOS and led to the Framework on Ocean Observing and accordingly the concept of essential ocean variables has been introduced. Currently, each individual ocean observing system is working with a dedicated data infrastructure that is optimized to serve the scientific users best. However, within the past decade the benefits of introducing standards for the exchange of data and information became obvious and are emerging. However, there is still a lack of harmonization across the different infrastructures and across nations. The scientific community is well aware of that but a promising concept on how to solve relevant issues has not been set in place. This is often due to the fact that diverging data policies, if there are any at all, have been set in place. The three-year joint European-US COOPEUS project has been started to address these issues and build a sustainable framework for future cooperation in this field. This project is supported by the European Commission and the National Science Foundation in the US to foster the links between the ocean science communities and also to develop future cooperative research programs. On the US side the EarthCube program imitated by the NSF has a similar agenda, i.e. bringing different disciplines together to develop a new mindset within the research communities and generate new perspectives on environmental sciences. Besides fostering the links between the research communities across the Atlantic it is planned to define user scenarios to explore the state of the art in the individual disciplines and ignite cooperation across domains. Some of the concepts that will be under scrutiny within the course of the COOPEUS project have also been considered within GEOSS, like for instance the data brokering approach that allows for coping with different ontologies and semantics in different disciplines. COOPEUS will build upon these experiences to make in the next step in integration existing and upcoming data information services in particular demonstrate the benefits of defining the minimum requirements on metadata descriptions. First results coming from project workshops are addressing the establishment of common, centralized services like registries and persistent identifiers. These services and agreements are forming the basis for improved data exchange based on and requirements of the user communities. To test these concepts as part of the user scenarios will be essential for the project progress.","[Waldmann, Christoph] Univ Bremen, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Pearlamn, Jay] Committee Earth Observ, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA",University of Bremen,"Waldmann, C (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",,"Waldmann, Christoph/F-3386-2017","Waldmann, Christoph/0000-0003-3388-7579",European Commission [312118],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),The COOPEUS project is funded by the European Commission under the contract no. 312118.,,3,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0197-7385,,978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2,OCEANS-IEEE,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BA4AU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000335313100211,View Full Record in Web of Science

Centred upon Ankara, the study focuses on building upon its weaker approach to human thermophysiological vulnerabilities in an era of climate change, and unregulated urban densification. Through newly defined local EHEs, the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) (and its cumulative derivatives), were utilised to develop the limited approaches that utilise Energy Based Models in the scope of EHE risk management. The study was undertaken by processing hourly data from 2008 to 2020 from Ankara's Meteorological Station, and Esenboga Meteorological Station. At a finer 10 min resolution, an interior Kestrel Heat-stress Station was used to assess summer thermal conditions in 2020 within a thermally vulnerable, yet still very frequent, residential Turkish construction typology. Among other outcomes, the results indicated the permanency of indoor PET that remained above 27 degrees C during non EHE periods. In the case of a Very Hot Day (VHD33), PET remained between 29 and 32.9 degrees C for almost 24 h. The thermal index also indicated how forced convective cooling led to indoor reductions of PET by 3-4 K, and in duration of such HS levels to less than 2 h.","[Nouri, Santos; Matzarakis, A.] Bilkent Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Dept Interior Architecture & Environm Design, TR-06800 Bilkent, Turkey; [Charalampopoulos, I.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Gen & Agr Meteorol, Athens 118 55, Greece; [Matzarakis, A.] German Meteorol Serv, Res Ctr Human Biometeorol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Matzarakis, A.] Albert Ludwigs Univ, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Environm Meteorol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Nouri, Santos] Bilkent Univ, Guzel Sanatlar Tasarim Mimarlik Fakultesi, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Deutscher Wetterdienst; University of Freiburg; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Nouri, S (corresponding author), Bilkent Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Dept Interior Architecture & Environm Design, TR-06800 Bilkent, Turkey.",andre.nouri@bilkent.edu.tr,"Charalampopoulos, Ioannis/X-2658-2018","Charalampopoulos, Ioannis/0000-0002-3357-2780; Santos Nouri, A/0000-0001-8084-3339","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [2236, 120C077]",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This investigation was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for the national research project [2236] funding, with the project grant number [120C077]",,150,1,1,2,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Among the many ways to generate hydrogen gas, electrochemical water splitting is more feasible and renewable. Compared to processes using solar energy for a specific geological environment or thermochemical decomposition at high temperatures, the electrocatalysis of water can produce hydrogen without the restriction of geological conditions and scale-up facilities. Water is one of the most renewable and sustainable resources to obtain hydrogen. On the other hand, water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is thermodynamically unfavorable under the atmospheric condition. Therefore, novel materials are needed to produce hydrogen from water splitting using electrocatalysts. Recently, various state-of-the-art technologies and catalysts have been developed in the electrocatalysis of water to pro-duce hydrogen. Among the litany of novel materials, according to the preparation method and morphology of electrocatalysts, the hydrogen production efficiency from water splitting shows great differences. This paper recently reported efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting using multi-component catalysts composed of several metals, organic polymer, metal sulfides, and metal phosphides. In addition, the essential principles for an investigation regarding more efficient hybrid electrocatalysts for water splitting as a renewable and sustainable hydrogen producing method can be determined.","[Lee, Jung Eun] Kwangwoon Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Seoul 01897, South Korea; [Jeon, Ki-Joon] Inha Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Show, Pau Loke] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Lee, Im Hack; Choi, Yong Jun; Park, Young-Kwon] Univ Seoul, Sch Environm Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea; [Jung, Sang-Chul] Sunchon Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Sunchon 57923, South Korea; [Rhee, Gwang Hoon] Univ Seoul, Dept Mech & Informat Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea; [Lin, Kun-Yi Andrew] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Environm Engn, 250 Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung, Taiwan",Kwangwoon University; Inha University; University of Nottingham Malaysia; University of Seoul; Sunchon National University; University of Seoul; National Chung Hsing University,"Park, YK (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Sch Environm Engn, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",catalica@uos.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1A2C3011274]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT) [2020M1A2A2079801],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT),"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1A2C3011274) .

Not only in developed countries (with high source separation), but also in developing countries (with poor source separation), this energy recovery technology can be interested. In many countries with mixed MSW like Iran, a mechanical separation (trommel screen, magnet, etc.) is used as a simple and efficient method to separate OFMSW. In this study, three main goals are followed; firstly, Selection of a suitable AD system (wet anaerobic digestion (WAD) or dry anaerobic digestion (DAD) and mesophilic or thermophilic)) according to physical and chemical composition of under-screen fraction of MSW and climate conditions. Secondly, evaluation of biogas energy potential of under-screen fraction of Isfahan municipal solid waste (USFIMSW), as one of the major cities of Iran is followed. Finally, it offers to use the results obtained in other developing countries with similar conditions in Isfahan. The physical analysis shows that about 70% of Isfahan MSW consists of the organic fraction (OF) which can be used in the AD system. Also, the value of total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS) and thereby VS/TS for the under-screen fraction of MSW changes seasonally between about 29% and 35.5%, 21%-25.5% and 64%-84%, respectively. The results show that in cities with a low source separation (due to the presence of hazardous materials in the under-screen fraction of MSW), high TS and dry climate like Isfahan, the use of DAD is more appropriate. According to bio-methane potential (BMP), TS and VS analysis, the average amount of methane yield, without purification of USFSMSW, is about 322.7 Nm(/)(3)t VS which can be increased by various steps in pre-treatment, feedstock preparation and co-substrate.","[Dehkordi, Seyed Mohammad Mehdi Noorbakhsh; Jahromi, Ahmad Reza Taghipour; Ferdowsi, Ali; Shumal, Mohammad; Dehnavi, Ali] Isfahan Municipal Waste Management Org, Esfahan 8166196116, Iran; [Dehnavi, Ali] Univ Isfahan, Civil & Transportat Fac, Dept Civil Engn, Esfahan 817467344, Iran",University of Isfahan,"Jahromi, ART (corresponding author), Isfahan Municipal Waste Management Org, Esfahan 8166196116, Iran.",ar.taghipourjahromi@alumni.iut.ac.ir,"Ferdowsi, Ali/AAX-7351-2021; Dehnavi, Ali/ABH-1520-2020","Taghipour, Ahmad Reza/0000-0002-2119-5826; Dehnavi, Ali/0000-0001-5036-8805",Isfahan Waste Management Organization; Isfahan Municipality,Isfahan Waste Management Organization; Isfahan Municipality,This project is supported under the Isfahan Waste Management Organization and Isfahan Municipality framework to study sustainable solutions for problems targeted at already-stressed megacities and serve as inputs for strategic policy making and near real-time environmental monitoring and response Sincere thanks are due to the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran the statistics department activities.,,72,23,23,2,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

In practice, national priorities influence the indicators and criteria adopted in the building codes. Consequently, neighbouring countries with similar climate conditions may use different criteria in their building codes to regulate the energy performance. In this paper, the energy performance criteria and their relative stringency in the latest residential building codes of Finland, Norway, Sweden and Russia are compared. The study is based on energy performance evaluations of one single-family building and one multi-family building, located in the north of Sweden. Both buildings complied with the Norwegian and Russian building code. However, the buildings did not comply with the specific fan power and heat loss criteria in the Finnish building code. Additionally, the single-family building did not comply with the specific primary energy and electric powerdemand criteria in the Swedish building code when heated by an electric heater. The national standard input data were found to have a large influence on the buildings' compliance with the studied energy use criteria. Policy implications of the results are discussed.

The performance of such a network is judged by the loss function, which is aggregated into a scalar value that decreases during training. Observing only this number hides the variation that occurs within the typically large training and testing data sets. Understanding these variations is of highest importance to adjust network hyper-parameters, such as the number of neurons, number of layers or to adjust the training set to include more representative examples. In this paper, we design a comprehensive and interactive system that allows users to study the output of recurrent neural networks on both the complete training data and testing data. We follow a coarse-to-fine strategy, providing overviews of annual, monthly and daily patterns in the time series and directly support a comparison of different hyper-parameter settings. We applied our method to a recurrent convolutional neural network that was trained and tested on 25 years of climate data to forecast meteorological attributes, such as temperature, pressure and wind velocity. We further visualize the quality of the forecasting models, when applied to various locations on the Earth and we examine the combination of several forecasting models.","[Roesch, Isabelle; Guenther, Tobias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Comp Graph Lab, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Roesch, I (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Comp Graph Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.",isabelleroesch@msn.com; tobias.guenther@inf.ethz.ch,,"Gunther, Tobias/0000-0002-3020-0930",,,,,30,9,10,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0167-7055,1467-8659,,COMPUT GRAPH FORUM,Comput.

Here, we report a core-shell formation of gradient tantalum-doped hematite homojunction nanorods by combination of hydrothermal regrowth strategy and hybrid microwave annealing, which enhances the photocurrent density and reduces the turn-on voltage simultaneously. The unusual bi-functional effects originate from the passivation of the surface states and intrinsic built-in electric field by the homojunction formation. The additional driving force provided by the field can effectively suppress charge-carrier recombination both in the bulk and on the surface of hematite, especially at lower potentials. Moreover, the synthesized homojunction shows a remarkable synergy with NiFe(OH) x cocatalyst with significant additional improvements of photocurrent density and cathodic shift of turn-on voltage. The work has nicely demonstrated multiple collaborative strategies of gradient doping, homojunction formation, and cocatalyst modification, and the concept could shed light on designing and constructing the efficient nanostructures of semiconductor photoelectrodes in the field of solar energy conversion.","[Zhang, Hemin; Byun, Woo Jin; Lee, Jae Sung] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Li, Dongfeng; Wang, Xiuli; Han, Hongxian; Li, Can] Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Catalysis, Zhongshan Rd 457, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China; [Shin, Tae Joo; Jeong, Hu Young] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, UNIST Cent Res Facil, UNIST 50, Ulsan 44919, South Korea","Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS; State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, CAS; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST)","Lee, JS (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.;Wang, XL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Catalysis, Zhongshan Rd 457, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China.;Jeong, HY (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, UNIST Cent Res Facil, UNIST 50, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",xiuliwang@dicp.ac.cn; hulex@unist.ac.kr; jlee1234@unist.ac.kr,"Zhang, Hemin/R-7942-2018; Han, Hongxian/Q-6054-2016","Zhang, Hemin/0000-0001-7599-3869; Wang, Xiuli/0000-0001-6231-4521; Byun, Woo Jin/0000-0001-7120-0040; Han, Hongxian/0000-0002-2522-1817",Climate Change Response project [2019M1A2A2065612]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21872143]; Korea-China Key Joint Research Program - MSIT [2017K2A9A2A11070341]; UCRF at UNIST; Basic Science Grant [NRF-2019R1A4A1029237]; Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH),Climate Change Response project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Korea-China Key Joint Research Program - MSIT; UCRF at UNIST; Basic Science Grant; Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH),"This work was supported by the Climate Change Response project (2019M1A2A2065612), the Basic Science Grant (NRF-2019R1A4A1029237), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21872143), and Korea-China Key Joint Research Program (2017K2A9A2A11070341) funded by MSIT, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), and UCRF at UNIST.",,56,70,70,20,138,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2041-1723,,NAT COMMUN,Nat.

The aim of the PCM glazing concept was to let (part) of the visible spectrum of the solar radiation enter the indoor environment, providing daylighting, while absorbing (the largest part of) the infrared radiation. In this paper, the influence of the PCM glazing configuration is investigated by means of numerical simulations carried out with a validated numerical model. Various triple glazing configurations, where one of the two cavities is filled with a PCM, are simulated, and PCM melting temperatures are investigated. The investigation is carried out in a humid subtropical climate (Cfa according to Koppen climate classification), and typical days for each season are used. The results show that the position of the PCM layer (inside the outer or the inner cavity) has a relevant influence on the thermo-physical behaviour of the PCM glazing system. PCM glazing systems (especially those with the PCM layer inside the outermost cavity) can be beneficial in terms of thermal comfort. The assessment of the energy performance and efficiency is instead more complex and sometimes controversial. All the configurations are able to reduce the solar gain during the daytime, but sometimes the behaviour of the PCM glazing is less efficient than the reference one. (C) 2012.

J,"Smith, P",,,,"Smith, Phillip",,,The American Yeoman in Andy Weir's The Martian,SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this essay I seek to place Andy Weir's The Martian (2011) in discourse with two imbricated genres: the political and cultural history of the American frontier, embodied, in this case, in the archetype of the yeoman, and the scientific and fictional history of Mars. The red planet has historically served as a site where, by way of the mythic American frontier, authors have sought imaginary solutions to contemporary anxieties. In the case of The Martian, Andy Wier draws upon the intellectual heritage of the American yeoman to present Mars as a habitable alternative to the Earth. His rhetoric is problematic not only because it lessens the apparent urgency of interventions into global climate change, but also because it reinforces the apparent verisimilitude of a certain version of American history. The Martian, I argue, represents the latest fold in the Martian fantasy of American frontierism in that it presents a version of the America's mythic past centered upon the white male experience and free of human or ecological victims. It thus seeks to sustain and invigorate a literary tradition predicated upon cultural, environmental, and physical violence as well as the marginalization of people of color in narratives of American history.","[Smith, Phillip] Savannah Coll Art & Design, English, Savannah, GA 31401 USA",Savannah College of Art & Design,"Smith, P (corresponding author), Savannah Coll Art & Design, English, Savannah, GA 31401 USA.",,,"Smith, Philip/0000-0001-7781-4350",,,,,41,0,0,0,2,SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES,GREENCASTLE,"DEPAUW UNIV, DEPT ROMANCE LANGUAGES, GREENCASTLE, IN 46135-0037 USA",0091-7729,,,SCI-FICTION STUD,Sci.-Fict.

Tracing the legacy versus newly deposited Hg is still, however, challenging. Here, we measured Hg isotope compositions in three dated sediment cores at different distances from the Flin Flon smelter, the largest Canadian Hg sources to the atmosphere during the 1930s-2000s. During the smelter's operative period, Hg isotope compositions showed limited variations in the near-field lake (<10 km) sediments but were rather variable in middle- (20-75 km) and far-field lake (similar to 800 kin) sediments. Only the post-2000 sediments in middle/far-field lakes showed significantly negative Hg isotope shifts, while sediments from the 1970s-1990s had Hg isotope values resembling those of near-field lake post- 1930 sediments. We suggest that the smelter's peak Hg emissions during the 1970s-1990s, which coincided with the deployment of a super stack in the mid-1970s, largely increased the long-range dispersion of smelter plumes. For the top post-2000 sediments, the fugitive dust from ore tailings and terrestrial legacy Hg re-emissions dominated Hg deposition in near-field lakes and middle/far-field lakes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that legacy Hg remobilization now exports substantial amounts of Hg to ecosystems, highlighting the need for aggressive remediation measures of Hg-contaminated sites.","[Sun, Ruoyu; Hintelmann, Holger] Trent Univ, Water Qual Ctr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Wiklund, Johan A.; Muir, Derek; Kirk, Jane L.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Aquat Contaminants Res Div, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada; [Evans, Marlene S.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Watershed Hydrol & Ecol Res Div, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Sun, Ruoyu] Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Trent University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Tianjin University,"Sun, RY (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Water Qual Ctr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.;Sun, RY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",ruoyu.sun@tju.edu.cn,"ruo yu, sun/F-3823-2010","ruo yu, sun/0000-0001-7261-8377",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42173011]; Government of Canada under the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda/Climate Change and Air Pollutant (CARA/CCAP),National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Government of Canada under the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda/Climate Change and Air Pollutant (CARA/CCAP),Funding for this research was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42173011) and the Government of Canada under the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda/Climate Change and Air Pollutant (CARA/CCAP).

In this study, the single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system RoxAnn served to assess seafloor hardness and roughness, and combine these parameters into one variable expressed as RGB (red green blue) color code followed by k-means fuzzy cluster analysis (FCA). The data were collected at a monitoring site west of the island of Helgoland (German Bight, SE North Sea) in the course of four surveys between September 2011 and November 2014. The study area has complex characteristics varying from out-cropping bedrock to sandy and muddy sectors with mostly gradual transitions. RoxAnn data enabled to discriminate all seafloor types that were suggested by ground-truth information (seafloor samples, video). The area appears to be quite stable overall; sediment import (including fluid mud) was detected only from the NW. Although hard substrates (boulders, bedrock) are clearly identified, the signal can be modified by inclination and biocover. Manually, six RoxAnn zones were identified; for the FCA, only three classes are suggested. The latter classification based on 'hard' boundaries would suffice for stakeholder issues, but the former classification based on 'soft' boundaries is preferred to meet state-of-the-art scientific objectives.","[Hass, H.

Due to the complexity of the factors affecting spatial configuration, new design approaches are needed. The research problem is how the spatial configuration of a school can be determined in a specific context from the perspective of stakeholders? To answer this question, a participatory approach and a pattern language have been used. Five groups of three participants took part in the process, each group consist of an architect, a student, and a teacher. In this research, the participatory process was performed in the data collection stage using the spatial matrix, group discussion, open-ended questionnaire, and pattern language. Changing the spatial configuration of a school was the final goal of this approach. The spatial configuration was analyzed through DepthmapX0.30 software implementing the space syntax method. Qualitative data also analyzed using Atlas-ti software through the coding method.

Millions of buildings around the globe have old roofs that are poorly insulated, but with large roof surface areas that could potentially provide significant renewable energy generation. Often, photovoltaic panels are simply added onto existing buildings regardless of thermal integrity. However, due to weathering, roofs frequently need repairs over their useful life. We evaluate a comprehensive methodology using EnergyPlus and TRNSYS simulation tools to evaluate how best to combine solar electric generation and improved insulation to achieve cost reductions, improve efficiency and renewable energy utilization at the time roofs are accessed. Advantages of combining efforts into a single intervention has not been fully explored in building energy research. We further incorporate important impacts that PV stand-off arrays have on roof thermal performance from shading and long-wave irradiance to skies. These influences have important comfort implications for poorly insulated structures with increasing summer heat waves associated with climate-related warming. They also have strong interaction with installed roof insulation levels. With an example analysis in Milan, Italy, we considered three typical residential building types in wide-use around the world (single-family, multi-family, apartment complex) with different geometries, insulation levels and roof constructions. We evaluated two options: reroofing (roof in need of repair/replacement) and refurbishment (energy intervention for roof improvement). We optimized roof insulation levels via state-of-the-art building energy simulations considering both energy and documented costs. PV electric generation was quantified in detail, also exploring how PV array roof shading affects roof thermal performance, an influence not previously considered. This is particularly important for uninsulated buildings where upper floors can experience excessive summertime heating. Both heating and cooling needs are considered to determine the optimal roof intervention and what savings- and related costs- can be obtained depending on differing parameters. We found combining appropriate insulation with PV can provide a cost-effective option to reduce net primary energy use in residential buildings. Savings from insulation alone varied from 3% (apartment complex) to 17% (single-family). When adding PV systems with the roof initially uninsulated, net savings range from 55% (apartment complex) to 80% (single-family). Shading from stand-off PV arrays reduced summer cooling loads by 17% in uninsulated apartment complexes and provided large predicted improvements in comfort to upper floor dwellings next to exposed roofs.

J,"Pallis, G",,,,"Pallis, Georgios",,,WALL-PAINTINGS IN CAVES OF MOUNT OITA,DELTION OF THE CHRISTIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY,,,Greek,Article,,,,,,,,"Very few examples of Byzantirie monumental painting are preserved in Phthiotis in east central Greece, despite the distinct flowering of the area, particularly after 1267, when it was the seat of the independent Byzantine state of Great Wallachia. The present article examines the paintings preserved in two caves on the north slopes of Mount Oita - Ai-Spilics, Mexiates and Grammenes Spilies, Kompotades - which contribute new evidence for the art of the wall-painting in this region. In Ai-Spilies (= Ayies Spilies, or Holy Caves) to the southwest of the village of Meximes, a wall-painting with a representation of the enthroned Virgin and Child between the two archangels is preserved in poor condition (Fig. 1). The figures are depicted against a white ground. The Virgin sits on a pearl-studded throne, holding the infant Christ, who has an unusual, purple halo (Fig. 2). The archangels flanking them wear luxurious imperial dress and hold staffs (Fig.. 3), Both have one hand protectively on the back of the Virgin's throne. The iconographic features of the figures, such as the belt beneath the archangels' breast, the luxury of the costumes and the throne.. and the bright colours, recall 13th century paintings that adhere to earlier models. The rare detail of the archangels placing their hands on the back of the throne is interesting: it makes its appearance in 6th-century monumental art and is later found mainly in a group of monuments from the Dodecanese, Cappadocia and Cyprus, dating from about 1200. In the light of the above details and the stylistic features, the wall-painting in Ai-Spilics may he dated to the first decades of the 13th century, as an example of conservative provincial painting that reproduced features of 12th-century art. The next representations are in Grammenes Spilies (= Zographismenes Spilies, or Painted Caves) to the south-west of the village of Kompotades. The best-preserved wall-painting is of the Deisis, in thc typical three-figure scheme of Christ between the Virgin and St John the Baptist (Fig. 4). Christ, seated on a throne without a backrest, raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing and holds a gem-studded gospel book in his left. The Virgin, who leans towards Christ, has a disproportionately large head and a short, stout body. There is also some disproportion in the body of the Baptist His face, the only one preserved in the representation, has intense, roughly drawn features and unruly, tufted hair (Fig. 5). The depiction of him, like other details in the scene, is akin to corresponding figures in provincial paintings of the 13th century. The Deisis in Grammenes Spilies exhibits several weaknesses, mainly in the clumsy proportions and stances of the figures, and the summary, awkward drapery, In stylistic terms, it appears to fall within the linear style found in many provincial monuments of the 13th century. On the same site is a shallow depression with a badly damaged representation of St Nicholas. The saint is shown in bust and frontally, flanked by two full-length archangels. Its poor state of preservation does not allow any secure assessments to be made of its style or date, though there are some indications pointing to the 13th century. The depiction of the saint between the archangels is rare and may be connected with the hagiological tradition surrounding his Dormition. The wall-paintings in the caves on Mount Oita form a small sample of the essentially unknown art of Phthiotis during the 13th century, at the time of the Despotate of Epirus and the state of Great Wallachia. They are the product of the conservative style predominant at this period, which remained true to the Komnenian tradition. They also attest to the flowering of monasticism in Phthiotis, which seems to have been encouraged by the local ecclesiastical and political leaders in the troubled religious and political climate of the period and the region.",,,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,CHRISTIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOC,ATHINAI,"CHRISTIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOC, ATHINAI, 00000, GREECE",1105-5758,2241-2190,,DELTION CHRIST ARCHA,Deltion Christ.

The collated data include ancient DNA sequences from over 200 ancient sea lion and penguin specimens, in addition to 150 modern genetic samples. ResultsOur temporal genetic analyses show that, following human-driven extinction events, synchronous marine megafaunal replacement events occurred at around 1500 AD, coinciding with the Little Ice Age onset and an associated drastic human demographic decline in southern New Zealand. ConclusionsA combination of climatic and human demographic shifts likely facilitated northward expansion of subantarctic sea lion and penguin lineages, replacing extirpated mainland New Zealand marine megafauna. Broadly, the interaction between human pressure and late Holocene climatic change may explain multiple biological turnover events in the Southern Hemisphere.","[Waters, Jonathan M.; Rawlence, Nicolas J.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Fraser, Ceridwen I.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Maxwell, Justin J.] Univ Otago, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Rawlence, Nicolas J.] Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of Otago; Australian National University; University of Otago,"Waters, JM (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand.",jon.waters@otago.ac.nz,"Waters, Jon/B-4983-2009","Waters, Jon/0000-0002-1514-7916; Fraser, Ceridwen/0000-0002-6918-8959",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund [UOO1112]; University of Otago; Allan Wilson Centre,Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); University of Otago; Allan Wilson Centre,"Christian Anderson, Jeremy Austin, Sanne Boessenkool, Catherine Collins, Stefanie Grosser, Lisa Matisoo-Smith, Michael Knapp, Paul Scofield and Ian Smith are thanked for their contributions to analyses synthesized here.

The determination of two important parameters (neutral temperature and outdoor temperature) in the adaptive thermal comfort model was the focus of this work. A longitudinal survey was conducted from Jan. 2010 to Feb. 2011 in two naturally ventilated office buildings located in Changsha, China. During the survey, the thermal sensation of the subjects was investigated, and the indoor temperature was measured daily. Based on the field data, the neutral temperature and the running mean outdoor temperature were determined. Further, an adaptive thermal comfort model was established by quantifying the relationship between the neutral temperature and the running mean outdoor temperature. The results show that the adaptive thermal comfort model based on the running mean outdoor temperature can well reflect the change of neutral temperature in the two office buildings with the climate of Changsha China.

The current system in this sector is not well known and understood, e.g., in terms of seasonal variability, across-shore structure, and forcing processes. This knowledge gap is addressed in two studies that analyze the mean seasonal cycle of an eddy-permitting numerical simulation of the tropical Atlantic. Part 1 is concerned with the circulation over the West African continental slope at the southernmost reach of the Canary Current system, between similar to 8 and 20 degrees N. The focus is on the depth range most directly implicated in the wind-driven circulation (offshore and coastal upwellings and Sverdrup transport) located above the potential density sigma(t) = 26.7 kg M-3 in the model (approx. above 250 m of depth). In this sector and for this depth range, the flow is predominantly poleward as a direct consequence of positive wind stress curl forcing, but the degree to which the magnitude of the upper ocean poleward transport reflects Sverdrup theory varies with latitude. The model poleward flow also exhibits a marked semiannual cycle with transport maxima in spring and fall. Dynamical rationalizations of these characteristics are offered in terms of wind forcing of coastal trapped waves and Rossby wave dynamics. Remote forcing by seasonal fluctuations of coastal winds in the Gulf of Guinea plays an instrumental role in the fall intensification of the poleward flow. The spring intensification appears to be related to wind fluctuations taking place at shorter distances north of the Gulf of Guinea entrance and also locally. Rossby wave activity accompanying the semiannual fluctuations of the poleward flow in the coastal waveguide varies greatly with latitude, which in turn exerts a major influence on the vertical structure of the poleward flow. Although the realism of the model West African boundary currents is difficult to determine precisely, the present in-depth investigation provides a renewed framework for future observational programs in the region.","[Kounta, Lala; Gaye, Amadou Thierno] ESP UCAD, Lab Phys Atmosphere & Ocean Simeon Fongang, Dakar, Senegal; [Kounta, Lala; Capet, Xavier] Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN Lab, MNHN, CNRS,IRD, Paris, France; [Jouanno, Julien] IRD Univ Paul Sabatier Observ Midipyrenees, LEGOS Lab, Toulouse, France; [Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas] IUEM, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatial, IFREMER IRD CNRS UBO, Plouzane, France; [Sow, Bamol] UASZ, Lab Oceanog Sci Environm & Climat, Ziguinchor, Senegal",University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Ifremer; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM),"Kounta, L (corresponding author), ESP UCAD, Lab Phys Atmosphere & Ocean Simeon Fongang, Dakar, Senegal.;Kounta, L (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN Lab, MNHN, CNRS,IRD, Paris, France.",soxnalala@gmail.com,"Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas/ABG-2605-2021; Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas/P-3553-2015","Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas/0000-0002-0751-1351; Kolodziejczyk, Nicolas/0000-0002-0751-1351; Jouanno, Julien/0000-0001-7750-060X; Gaye, Amadou Thierno/0000-0002-3688-1351",ART PhD program of the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement; AMMA2050 project - Future Climate for Africa program by the NERC; AMMA2050 project - Future Climate for Africa program by DFID; NERC [NE/M020428/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ART PhD program of the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement; AMMA2050 project - Future Climate for Africa program by the NERC; AMMA2050 project - Future Climate for Africa program by DFID; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The ART PhD program of the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement and Lala Kounta was funded through the ART PhD program of the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement while conducting most of this research.

Unfortunately, these nonmaterial losses are often overlooked or underappreciated. My aim in this article is to counter this tendency and explore the relationship between people and place in a way that sheds light on the nonmaterial threat of GCC.

This study proposes a site selection assessment model for citrus cultivation using Geographic Information System (GIS) Based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in the Mersin province of Turkey. The purpose of the study is to create a Multi-Criteria Assessment-Based Spatial Decision Support System which takes into account the opinions of local citrus farmers as well as those of experts. 14 preference factors and 10 exclusion factors were determined for the analysis of land suitability for citrus farming. The weighting of preference factors for citrus cultivation was determined using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and a land suitability map was generated using the weighted overlay method in the GIS environment. Based on the opinions of farmers and experts, higher weights were assigned to the average temperature in the flowering period, the average temperature in the winter season, and elevation, as compared to all other preference factors. The results also demonstrate that WorldClim, a global climate dataset, is an essential source of data in such studies, as climate conditions play a crucial role in potential citrus expansion. The final land suitability map shows that the most suitable and moderately suitable areas for citrus cultivation have surface areas of 85 824 ha and 85 430 ha, respectively. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate validation of the land suitability for citrus and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value was calculated at 0.87, indicating substantial consistency. This study proposes a methodology for the determination of suitable sites for citrus cultivation which relies on realistic data. The land suitability map produced in the study will be essential for the creation of sustainable agriculture strategies in the eastern Mediterranean region.","[Orhan, Osman] Mersin Univ, Engn Fac, Dept Geomat, TR-33343 Mersin, Turkey",Mersin University,"Orhan, O (corresponding author), Mersin Univ, Engn Fac, Dept Geomat, TR-33343 Mersin, Turkey.",osmanorhan44@gmail.com,"orhan, osman/W-6764-2019","orhan, osman/0000-0002-1362-8206",,,,,54,13,13,13,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

The options are calculated by combining a land evaluation (using a Geographical Information System, GIS), crop growth simulation models and Interactive Multiple Goal Linear Programming (IMGP). In the land evaluation, geographical information on soil types and other characteristics like steepness, stoniness, phase etc. is used to assess the suitability for different types of agriculture. Information on climate conditions and crop properties is used in the crop growth simulation models to calculate yield potentials for the suited areas. Economic, social and political goals are dealt with in a linear programming model. The result of this hierarchical modelling is a series of scenarios of optimal land use given the local properties of soils, crops and climate and given the economic, social and political considerations on topics like production costs, spreading of labor, market strategies and environmental conditions. Four different scenarios for future land use in the European Community emerge if the ongoing rise in productivity in agriculture is confronted with four partially conflicting goals of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The scenarios present a picture of the end results in land use if one of these goals is taken to its logical conclusion. The goals are minimizing production costs (scenario Free market and free trade), maintaining regional employment (scenario Regional development), minimizing agricultural land use in favor of nature conservation (scenario Nature and landscape) and minimizing the stress on the environment due to pesticides and nutrients (scenario Environmental protection). All scenarios show results that are in sharp contrast with current opinions on the most probable developments in rural areas. In this paper the methodology will be exemplified and the results for possible land use in the EC will be discussed. Special attention is given to the interpretation of the results of this type of exploration.",,,"VANLATESTEIJN, HC (corresponding author), NETHERLANDS SCI COUNCIL GOVT POLICY,POB 20004,2500 EA THE HAGUE,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,,11,11,11,2,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

Under such socio-ecological conditions, little is known about farmers' decision-making in response to uncertainties in uncertain rainfall conditions. To fill this gap and add to the literature on adaptive decision-making, we addressed the central question: what are the existing patterns of farming decision-making under uncertain rainfall conditions, and which decision-making strategies are adaptive? We developed an adaptive decision-making framework to investigate the behavior of farmers under variable rainfall conditions in Ghana's Volta delta in the Ada East District. We conducted 5 interviews with agricultural extension agents, 44 in-depth interviews and 4 focus group discussion with farmers. Subsequently, we interviewed a sub-selection of 32 farmers. Findings of the study shows that farmers carry out different decision-making patterns in response to the variable rainfall conditions. We distinguished six strategies: three based on flexibility and three based on robustness. Flexible adaptive decision-making strategies are switching dates for sowing seeds through wait-and-see or delay strategy, muddling through the farming season with the application of various options and alternative irrigation strategies. Robust adaptive decision-making strategies are portfolio strategy of transplanting seedlings in batches, selection of robust (hardy) crops, and intercropping or diversification. Based on how farmers select strategies in response to uncertainty in rainfall conditions, we argue that some decision-making strategies are more adaptive than others. Findings of this study are relevant for the design and implementation of climate related agricultural projects.","[Sarku, Rebecca; Dewulf, Art; Termeer, Katrien] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci, Publ Adm & Policy, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Slobbe, Erik] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Sci, Global Syst & Water Change, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kranjac-Berisavljevic, Gordana] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agr Mechanizat & Irrigat Technol, Tamale, Ghana",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; University for Development Studies,"Sarku, R (corresponding author), Publ Adm & Policy, Hollandseweg 1,Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",rebecca.sarku@wur.nl,,"Termeer, Catrien/0000-0001-7396-1476; Sarku, Rebecca/0000-0002-2525-5478; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644",Netherlands organisation for scientific research (NWO) [W 07.69.204],Netherlands organisation for scientific research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work was supported by the Netherlands organisation for scientific research (NWO) [W 07.69.204.].,,73,6,7,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1943-815X,1943-8168,,J INTEGR ENVIRON SCI,J.

Although biofuels will play an important role in conventional gasoline and diesel applications, bioderived solutions are particularly important in jet fuels and lubricants, for which no other viable renewable alternatives exist. Producing compounds for jet fuel and lubricant base oil applications often requires upgrading fermentation products, such as alcohols and ketones, to reach the appropriate molecular-weight range. Ketones possess both electrophilic and nucleophilic functionality, which allows them to be used as building blocks similar to alkenes and aromatics in a petroleum refining complex. Here, we develop a method for selectively upgrading biomass-derived alkyl methyl ketones with > 95% yields into trimer condensates, which can then be hydrodeoxygenated in near-quantitative yields to give a new class of cycloalkane compounds. The basic chemistry developed here can be tailored for aviation fuels as well as lubricants by changing the production strategy. We also demonstrate that a sugarcane biorefinery could use natural synergies between various routes to produce a mixture of lubricant base oils and jet fuels that achieve net life-cycle greenhouse gas savings of up to 80%.","[Balakrishnan, Madhesan; Sacia, Eric R.; Sreekumar, Sanil; Gunbas, Gorkem; Gokhale, Amit A.; Scown, Corinne D.; Toste, F.

However, their cooling and heating potential strongly depends on the climate and building characteristics. In particular, the increase of the thermal capacity of green roofs compared to traditional roofs, if not controlled with insulation, may lead to higher cooling and heating loads. This paper discusses the energy saving potential of green roofs adopting a variable insulation strategy. A system consisting of a plenum located between a green roof and the room underneath and a sensor-operated fan that couples (or decouples) the green roof mass with the indoor environment was developed. The fan is activated and stopped using temperature based rules; the plenum is ventilated only when the fan works, creating a variable insulation system. Four cells with an insulated traditional roof, a non-insulated green roof, an insulated green roof, and a green roof with the variable insulation system have been tested in a hot and dry climate with mild winters over several years. This paper compares and discusses different plenum control algorithms. Results are particularly promising because the variable insulating system proved to adjust the thermal capacity of the roof effectively. In summer, the non-insulated green roof and the green roof with variable insulation system achieved the lowest indoor temperature; in winter, the insulated traditional roof and the variable insulation green roof system achieved the highest indoor temperatures. Measurements are hence compared with simulations. Finally, the energy saving potential of the new green roof system is evaluated.

Considering the projected increase in global demand for this energy storage technology, driven primarily by growth in e-vehicles, and looking at the criticality of some raw materials used in LIBs, the need for an efficient recycling strategy emerges. In this study, current state-of-the-art technologies for LIB recycling are reviewed and future opportunities and challenges, in particular to recover critical raw materials such as lithium or cobalt, are derived. Special attention is paid to the interrelationships between mechanical or thermal pre-treatment and hydro- or pyrometallurgical post-treatment processes. Thus, the unique approach of the article is to link processes beyond individual stages within the recycling chain. It was shown that influencing the physicochemical properties of intermediate products can lead to reduced recycling rates or even the exclusion of certain process options at the end of the recycling chain. More efforts are needed to improve information and data sharing on the exact composition of feedstock for recycling as well as on the processing history of intermediates to enable closed loop LIB recycling. The technical understanding of the interrelationships between different process combinations, such as pyrolytic or mechanical pre-treatment for LIB deactivation and metal separation, respectively, followed by hydrometallurgical treatment, is of crucial importance to increase recovery rates of cathodic metals such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium, but also of other battery components.","[Windisch-Kern, Stefan; Raupenstrauch, Harald] Univ Leoben, Dept Environm & Energy Proc Engn, Chair Thermal Proc Technol, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Gerold, Eva; Antrekowitsch, Helmut] Univ Leoben, Dept Met, Chair Nonferrous Met, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Nigl, Thomas; Altendorfer, Michael; Rutrecht, Bettina; Pomberger, Roland] Univ Leoben, Dept Environm & Energy Proc Engn, Chair Waste Proc Technol & Waste Management, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Jandric, Aleksander; Scherhaufer, Silvia; Part, Florian] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Waste Management, Dept Water Atmosphere Environm, Muthgasse 107, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Leoben; University of Leoben; University of Leoben; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Gerold, E (corresponding author), Univ Leoben, Dept Met, Chair Nonferrous Met, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",eva.gerold@unileoben.ac.at,,"Rutrecht, Bettina/0000-0002-6977-4499; Jandric, Aleksander/0000-0002-3837-4329; Windisch-Kern, Stefan/0000-0002-6911-0246","Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology [878117, 880683]; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU)","Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU)","The authors thank the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology, who supports the research projects LIBRAT (project 878117) and SafeLiBatt (project 880683).

Analysis of a 175-year record of cyclones from the Cook Islands indicates minimum annual probabilities of 16% for storm surges and 5% for major storm surge impacts at Rarotonga. Storm surges have historically inundated areas of the coastal lowland where virtually all human activities and infrastructure are currently located. The impacts of such events have been particularly severe in the Cook Islands capital of Avarua and adjacent communities on the north coast of Rarotonga. Detailed infrastructure mapping combined with analysis of historic storm surge impacts and cyclone tracks in the vicinity of Rarotonga indicates that the storm surge risk is greatest along the north coast where the majority of the Cook Islands' government functions and commercial, industrial, transportation and communication infrastructure is located. Damage to this infrastructure at the shoreline can have serious repercussions throughout the Cook Islands. Any efforts to increase the countrys resilience to such impacts must be undertaken within the larger goal of adaptation to future climate changes and rising sea levels. The greatest risk presently to human life arises from many cyclone safety centres in locations where they are exposed to storm surges or flooding. A top priority should be relocation of these shelters to safer locations further inland so that they can provide suitable shelter from storm surges and flooding as well as tsunamis, taking into account other hazards presented by Rarotonga's rugged topography.

This study presents a novel approach using a statistical model that is trained to predict hourly concentrations of particles smaller than 10 mu m (PM10) by combining satellite-borne aerosol optical depth (AOD) with meteorological and land-use parameters. The model is shown to accurately predict PM10 (overall R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7.44 mu g/m(3)) for measurement sites in Germany. The capability of satellite observations to map and monitor surface air pollution is assessed by investigating the relationship between AOD and PM10 in the same modeling setup. Sensitivity analyses show that important drivers of modeled PM10 include multiday mean wind flow, boundary layer height (BLH), day of year (DOY), and temperature. Different mechanisms associated with elevated PM10 concentrations are identified in winter and summer. In winter, mean predictions of PM10 concentrations >35 mu g/m(3) occur when BLH is below similar to 500 m. Paired with multiday easterly wind flow, mean model predictions surpass 40 mu g/m(3) of PM10. In summer, PM10 concentrations seemingly are less driven by meteorology, but by emission or chemical particle formation processes, which are not included in the model. The relationship between AOD and predicted PM10 concentrations depends to a large extent on ambient meteorological conditions. Results suggest that AOD can be used to assess air quality at ground level in a machine learning approach linking it with meteorological conditions.","[Stirnberg, Roland; Cermak, Jan; Fuchs, Julia; Andersen, Hendrik] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Stirnberg, Roland; Cermak, Jan; Fuchs, Julia; Andersen, Hendrik] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Stirnberg, R (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Stirnberg, R (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Karlsruhe, Germany.",roland.stirnberg@kit.edu,"Cermak, Jan/B-7844-2009","Cermak, Jan/0000-0002-4240-595X; Fuchs, Julia/0000-0002-7137-2245; Stirnberg, Roland/0000-0003-2444-1858; Andersen, Hendrik/0000-0003-2983-8838",KIT Graduate School for Climate and Environment (GRACE),KIT Graduate School for Climate and Environment (GRACE),"RS was supported by the KIT Graduate School for Climate and Environment (GRACE).

This was obtained by determining the environmental performance of 10 selected recycling technologies with varying TRL levels, using the chemical properties of the top 25 produced polymers in Europe. The results were collected in a life cycle assessment (LCA) 'matrix' model. To simulate realistic plastic recycling challenges, case studies of PE/PP foils from municipal waste and ABS plastic with brominated flame retardants were developed, to be used as an addition to the LCA matrix model results. Potential emission reduction was assessed by combining LCA matrix outcomes with European polymer demand data. The LCA matrix model illustrates that potential environmental performance of recycling technologies varied strongly per polymer type and did not always follow the state-of-the-art recycling hierarchy. Commodity plastics performed well with tertiary recycling technologies, such as gasification and pyrolysis to monomers; secondary mechanical recycling was outperformed. A focus on primary recycling is environmentally beneficial for most engineering and high performance plastics. To enhance the performance of primary recycling technologies, a higher purity and improved sorting is required. As demonstrated in the case studies, low sorting efficiencies due to impurities reduces positive environmental impacts. Hence, optimal environmental performance of recycling is obtained where pre-treatment (sorting, cleaning) is adapted to the recycling technology. According to the model, recycling the 15 most demanded polymers in Europe reduces CO2 emissions from plastics by 73% or 200 Mtonne CO2 eq. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A composite of 7 nm Ni2Mo3N nanoparticles grown on nickel foam (Ni2Mo3N/NF) was prepared through a simple and economical synthetic method involving one-step annealing of Ni foam, MoCl5, and urea without a Ni precursor. The Ni2Mo3N/NF exhibits high activity with low overpotential (eta(10) of 21.3 mV and eta(100) of 123.8 mV) and excellent stability for the HER, achieving one of the best performances among state-of-the-art transition metal nitride based catalysts in alkaline media. Supporting density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that N sites in Ni2Mo3N with a N-Mo coordination number of four have a hydrogen adsorption energy close to that of Pt and hence may be responsible for the enhanced HER performance.","[Park, Sang Heon; Jo, Tae Hwan; Lim, Hyung-Kyu; Youn, Duck Hyun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Interdisciplinary Program Adv Funct Mat & Devices, Chunchon 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Lee, Min Hee] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Kawashima, Kenta; Mullins, C.

The precipitation in winter season (December, January and February) is very important for Rabi crops in north India, particularly for wheat, as it supplements moisture and maintains low temperature for the development of the crops. The GCM outputs (seasonal mean forecasts issued in November) from various organizations are compared with the observed high-resolution gridded rainfall data obtained from India Meteorological Department (IMD). Prediction skill of such GCMs is examined for the period 1982-2009. The climatology, interannual standard deviation (ISD) and correlation coefficients have been computed for the five GCMs and compared with observation. It is found that the models are able to reproduce the climatology and ISD to varying degrees; however, skill of predictions is too low. Multi-model ensemble (MME) approaches have been employed. It is found that the weighted MME using multiple linear regression technique improves the prediction skill of winter precipitation over northern India. The teleconnection between the sea surface temperature (SST) and winter precipitation revealed that the SST over the Pacific Ocean affects the precipitation over north India in winter season. While this observed feature is represented well by some models with high fidelity, most models are unable to respond to SST variations in the Pacific Ocean in a realistic manner. Lagged correlations between the north India rainfall and SST over the Nino-3.4 region reveal that only two of the five GCMs get the observed simultaneous teleconnection correctly. Furthermore, only one of these two models has the observed phase lag with the strongest correlation as observed.","[Tiwari, P.

The results indicate that the wind-driven transport of water in the surface layer is most efficient at increasing the depth of convection in the southeast region of the ocean basin investigated. To the north of the latitude of maximum wind stress at about 50 degrees S, a deepening of the convectively-mixed layer of more than 300 m is simulated if the wind forcing is doubled. In the real ocean, this identified mechanism of Ekman transport of cold and fresh water across the path of the antarctic circumpolar current may contribute to the formation of sub-antarctic mode water observed to the north of the sub-antarctic front of the southern ocean.","Univ Concepcion, Programme Reg Studies Phys Oceanog & Climate, Concepcion 3, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion,"Ribbe, J (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Programme Reg Studies Phys Oceanog & Climate, Cabina 7,Barrio Univ S-N,Casillo 160-C, Concepcion 3, Chile.",j-ribbe@profc.udec.c1,,"Ribbe, Joachim/0000-0001-6749-1228",,,,,12,17,17,1,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0280-6495,,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

A NEO HySpex VNIR-1600 sensor is used for this paper, and the improvements are based on measurements of sensor properties not covered by the manufacturer, in particular, detector nonlinearity and stray light. This additional knowledge about the instrument is used to implement corrections for nonlinearity, stray light, spectral smile distortion and nonuniform spectral bandwidth and to base the radiometric calibration on a SI-traceable radiance standard. Bathymetry is retrieved from a data take from the lake Starnberg using WASI-2D. The results using the original and improved calibration procedures are compared with ground reference data, with an emphasis on the effect of stray-light correction. For our instrument, stray-light biases the detector response from 416-500 nm up to 8% and from 700-760 nm up to 5%. Stray-light-induced errors affect bathymetry mainly in water deeper than Secchi depth, whereas in shallower water, the dominant error source is the calibration accuracy of the light source used for radiometric calibration. Stray-light correction reduced the systematic error of water depth by 19% from Secchi depth to three times Secchi depth, whereas the relative standard deviation remained stable at 5%.","[Lenhard, Karim; Baumgartner, Andreas; Gege, Peter] IMF, Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Nevas, Saulius; Nowy, Stefan; Sperling, Armin] PTB, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB),"Lenhard, K (corresponding author), IMF, Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",karim.lenhard@dlr.de; andreas.baumgartner@dlr.de; peter.gege@dlr.de; saulius.nevas@ptb.de; s.nowy@gigahertz-optik.com; armin.sperling@ptb.de,,,European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) within the joint research project Metrology for Earth Observation and Climate (MetEOC); EMRP within EURAMET; European Union,European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) within the joint research project Metrology for Earth Observation and Climate (MetEOC); EMRP within EURAMET; European Union(European Commission),"Manuscript received February 10, 2015; revised April 28, 2015; accepted May 4, 2015.

This paper seeks to assess and systematize the contribution of social sciences in the research on the human dimensions of global environmental change (HDGEC) in the region outlining its state of the art and process of development. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is the organization of a manual compilation and systematic review of publications on topics related to the HDGEC in order to investigate major research topics covering the period between 2001 and 2008. Findings - Although it is possible to identify an emergent body of the literature and scholarship in the region, the involvement of Latin American social science in the HDGEC research is still timid and tentative and not yet institutionalized. The evidence from this compilation has shown that this literature is fragmented bringing difficulties for the homogenization of criteria for analysis and assessment. Originality/value - The paper is one of the very few attempts to assess and analyze the research on HDGEC in Latin America through an international perspective. It provides an overview of its development building upon the progress of environmental studies in the region and looks to its challenges ahead in order to call for more involvement of social sciences in these research activities.","[Martins, Rafael D'Almeida; Ferreira, Leila da Costa] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Environm Studies, NEPAM, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Martins, RD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Environm Studies, NEPAM, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",rafael@cepps.org.br,"da costa ferreira, Leila/AAJ-5721-2020","Martins, Rafael/0000-0002-2937-6170; Ferreira, Leila da Costa/0000-0003-4138-9860",,,,,52,4,4,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Minimized flue gas emissions at high fuel flexibility were achieved only with primary measures. The fuel nitrogen conversion mechanisms were investigated in detail in the secondary zone of a 30 kW lab-reactor, designed as efficient reduction zone. Experimental investigations were carried out to determine the distribution of gas temperatures, main dry product gas components as well as NOX precursors such as NH3 and HCN along the height of the reduction zone. The objective was to determine and understand the various fuel nitrogen conversion mechanisms in the reduction zone that can minimize NOX emissions. It was found that the HCN/NH3 ratio increases with the fuel nitrogen content. This corresponds to an unexpected opposite trend to typical biomass grate furnaces. It was concluded that it is crucial for the HCN/NH3 ratio whether the released nitrogen tars are already cracked in the fixed-bed or only in the gas phase, as in the novel technology. Furthermore, the influence of gas temperature, air ratio, mixing, recirculated flue gas and residence time on the formation and reduction of NH3, HCN and NO is discussed. Finally, this novel technology achieves NOX emissions of<95 mg.m(-3) and 175 mg.m(-3) for woody and herbaceous fuels, respectively, which is well below the small-scale state-of-the-art for the respective N contents and it achieves fuel nitrogen conversions to NOX in flue gas of 35% and 25%, respectively.","[Archan, Georg; Scharler, Robert; Poelzer, Leonhard; Hochenauer, Christoph; Anca-Couce, Andres] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Thermal Engn, Inffeldgasse 25b, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Scharler, Robert; Sommersacher, Peter; Hochenauer, Christoph] BEST Bioenergy & Sustainable Technol GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21b, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Buchmayr, Markus; Gruber, Johann] Hargassner GesmbH, Anton Hargassner Str 1, A-4952 Weng, Austria",Graz University of Technology,"Archan, G (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Thermal Engn, Inffeldgasse 25b, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",georg.archan@tugraz.at,"Anca-Couce, Andres/AAB-5835-2021","Anca-Couce, Andres/0000-0001-9261-0698; Hochenauer, Christoph/0000-0001-8739-5217","Austrian Federal Government's Climate and Energy Fund (Klima-und Energiefonds) within the Energy Research Program (Austrian Research Promotion Agency, Multi Fuel Low Emission) [858771]","Austrian Federal Government's Climate and Energy Fund (Klima-und Energiefonds) within the Energy Research Program (Austrian Research Promotion Agency, Multi Fuel Low Emission)","The financial support of the Austrian Federal Government's Climate and Energy Fund (Klima-und Energiefonds) within the Energy Research Program (3rd call; Austrian Research Promotion Agency, Project Number 858771, Multi Fuel Low Emission) is gratefully acknowledged.",,52,4,4,2,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,15-Oct,2021,,,,,,,121073,10.1016/j.fuel.2021.121073,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2021.121073,,21-Jun,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,TM7TH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000675749800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tests by withdrawing a fraction of the gauge records from the analysis shows that the gauge data analysis system used in this study has a good performance in constructing daily high-resolution gridded analysis data over China. Analyses reveal that the 3B42-V6 product is capable of describing the observed spatial patterns and seasonal variations for most areas of China during the wet season, as well as the evolution of the summer precipitation belt in the Yangtze River valley. The differences between the satellite product and the gauge analysis of daily precipitation are within approximate to 10% over most of east China, but the satellite product underestimates the observed precipitation by 20%approximate to 50% for most of western China, especially the western Tibetan Plateau where the underestimates are over 50%. For daily variations of precipitation, the satellite product captures the observed precipitation signals but fails to show the correct magnitude or the timing of precipitation on synoptic or sub-synoptic scales. In addition, this satellite product overestimates the heavy and extreme daily precipitation for some areas of southeastern China but underestimates the light and moderate precipitation over most of northwestern China. Thus, the TRMM 3B42-V6 product should be used cautiously for monitoring droughts and heavy and extreme precipitation for some regions of China. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis shows that the TRMM product can well depict the spatiotemporal evolution of the observed daily precipitation for most China during the warm season.","[Zhao, Tianbao] Chinese Acad Sci, IAP, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res East Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yatagai, Akiyo] Kyoto Univ, RISH, Kyoto, Japan",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kyoto University,"Zhao, TB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, IAP, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res East Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zhaotb@tea.ac.cn,"Zhao, Tianbao/I-4890-2015","Zhao, Tianbao/0000-0002-8295-6537","National Key Basic Research Program of China [2012CB956203, 2009CB723904]; National Key Technology RD Program [2012BAC22B04]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40805032]; Beijing Nova Program [41001022]",National Key Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Key Technology RD Program(National Key Technology R&D Program); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Nova Program(Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission),"The TMPA data were provided by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center's Mesoscale Atmospheric Processes Laboratory and Precipitation Processing System, and the daily gauge observations was obtained from the NMIC of CMA.

China's INDC called for several low carbon actions toward 2030, and one of the important actions by 2030 in the China's INDC is to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% from the 2005 level. In this study, we concentrate in service sector and estimates CO2 emission from six sub-sectors: office building, retail and store, hotel and restaurant, education, health care and others. Considering the gap of tertiary industry development and climate diversity across regions, we base our study on regional analysis and the study subject includes 31 provincial regions of mainland China. We first use a bottom-up cost optimization model called AIM/Enduse to evaluate the CO2 reduction potential brought about by efficient technologies in China's service buildings. Then we design mitigation scenarios to examine the achievability of China's INDC as well as the efforts of service sector in achieving the CO2 reduction target stated in China's INDC. The results show that the service sector has a certain potential to succeed a no-regrets CO2 reduction target by 2030. For achieving China's INDC target, all six sub-sectors need implement more efficient technologies. Reduction rates vary across provinces due to climatic variations and different development statuses of tertiary industry. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In total, 31 case studies in Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil generated a database from an area where soil and water bioengineering techniques are not commonly used. The Transferability Analysis is structured in seven steps: (1) Objectives of the procedure, (2) Impacts of the measure, (3) Identification of up-scaling/down-scaling needs (4) Identification of the main phases and its components, (5) Identification of the level of importance of the components, (6) Assessment of the components in the context of the Take-Up Site and (7) Conclusions. For the assessment of soil and water bioengineering via the Transferability Analysis, in step 4 the following main phases have been identified from the data base: (a) Planning Phase, (b) Construction Phase, (c) Use Phase, as well as (d) End of Life Phase of a construction. Within these categories, 14 components have been defined: (a) know-how of soil and water bioengineering techniques, local climate conditions, botany, hydraulics, pedology; (b) materials, qualified labor, equipment and mechanical instruments, economic resources; (c) monitoring, efficiency, sustainability, maintenance; (d) replicability. The following assessment of the components allowed to determine key barriers, as well as key support factors for the transfer of soil and water bioengineering. As a result, barriers appeared to be the components qualified labor, equipment/mechanical instruments, hydraulics, know-how in soil and water bioengineering and pedology. Neither barriers, nor supporting key factors resulted to be the components local climate conditions, economic resources and efficiency. Supporting key factors for the transfer were materials, monitoring, sustainability, maintenance and replicability. The most important key factor of success was assessed to be botany, as various plant species with important characteristics for soil and water bioengineering are available in Central and South America, able to compensate the constraints through barriers in certain cases.","[Maxwald, Melanie; Preti, Federico] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agr Alimentari Ambienta, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Maxwald, Melanie; Rauch, Hans Peter] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Bioengn & Landscape Construct IBLB, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Crocetti, Cesare; Ferrari, Roberto; Preti, Federico] AIPIN Soil & Water Bioengn Italian Assoc, Via Monte 2, I-34122 Trieste, TS, Italy; [Petrone, Alessandro] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry Sci & Technol, I-50144 Florence, Italy","University of Florence; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Florence","Maxwald, M (corresponding author), Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agr Alimentari Ambienta, I-50144 Florence, Italy.;Maxwald, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Bioengn & Landscape Construct IBLB, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",melanie.maxwald@unifi.it; cesarecrocetti@gmail.com; ferrariroberto54@gmail.com; petroneale@gmail.com; hp.rauch@boku.ac.at; federico.preti@unifi.it,,"Maxwald, Melanie/0000-0003-3982-9572; Preti, Federico/0000-0002-4569-3811; Rauch, Hans Peter/0000-0002-8306-571X","Vulnerability estimation and Disaster Risk reduction at urban level in Ecuador.

Polynyas play an important climatic role. First, winter polynyas tend to warm the atmosphere, thus affecting atmospheric mesoscale motions. Second, ocean surface cooling and brine rejection during sea ice growth in polynyas lead to vertical mixing and convection, contributing to the transformation of intermediate and deep waters in the global ocean and the maintenance of the oceanic overturning circulation. Since 1990, there has been an upsurge in polynya observations and theoretical models for polynya formation and their impact on the biogeochemistry of the polar seas. This article reviews polynya research carried out in the last 2 decades, focusing on presenting a state-of-the-art picture of the physical interactions between polynyas and the atmosphere-sea ice-ocean system.

This work catalogs the various pathways of ensemble streamflow forecasting based on an exhaustive review of more than 700 studies over the last 40 years. We focus on the advanced state of the art in the model-based (dynamical) ensemble forecasting approaches. Ensemble streamflow prediction systems are categorized into three leading classes: statistics-based streamflow prediction systems, climatology-based ensemble streamflow prediction systems and numerical weather prediction-based hydrological ensemble prediction systems. For each ensemble approach, technical information, as well as details about its strengths and weaknesses, are provided based on a critical review of the studies listed. Through this literature review, the performance and uncertainty associated with the ensemble forecasting systems are underlined from both operational and scientific viewpoints. Finally, the remaining key challenges and prospective future research directions are presented, notably through hybrid dynamical - statistical learning approaches, which obviously present new challenges to be overcome in order to allow the successful employment of ensemble streamflow forecasting systems in the next decades. Targeting students, researchers and practitioners, this review provides a detailed perspective on the major features of an increasingly important area of hydrological forecasting.","[Troin, Magali; Arsenault, Richard; Brissette, Francois; Martel, Jean-Luc] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Troin, Magali] Hydro Climat TVT Maison Numer & Innovat, Toulon, France; [Wood, Andrew W.] NCAR, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO USA",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Troin, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",magali.troin@hydroclimat.com,"; Wood, Andrew/L-5133-2013","Martel, Jean-Luc/0000-0001-7142-6875; Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750; Troin-lambert, Magali/0000-0002-7811-9613; Wood, Andrew/0000-0002-6231-0085",Ecole de technologie superieure; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2018-04872],Ecole de technologie superieure; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This work was partially supported by Ecole de technologie superieure and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant No. RGPIN-2018-04872).

Satellite-based estimates can provide comprehensive spatiotemporal coverage, but the accuracy and comparability of the existing data sets must be ascertained to facilitate their use. Here we compare radiative flux estimates from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Synoptic 1-degree (SYN1deg)/Energy Balanced and Filled, Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) surface energy budget, and our own experimental FluxNet / Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring cLoud, Albedo and RAdiation (CLARA) data against in situ observations over Arctic sea ice and the Greenland Ice Sheet during summer of 2007. In general, CERES SYN1deg flux estimates agree best with in situ measurements, although with two particular limitations: (1) over sea ice the upwelling shortwave flux in CERES SYN1deg appears to be underestimated because of an underestimated surface albedo and (2) the CERES SYN1deg upwelling longwave flux over sea ice saturates during midsummer. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based GEWEX and FluxNet-CLARA flux estimates generally show a larger range in retrieval errors relative to CERES, with contrasting tendencies relative to each other. The largest source of retrieval error in the FluxNet-CLARA downwelling shortwave flux is shown to be an overestimated cloud optical thickness. The results illustrate that satellite-based flux estimates over the Arctic are not yet homogeneous and that further efforts are necessary to investigate the differences in the surface and cloud properties which lead to disagreements in flux retrievals. Plain Language Summary The amounts of solar and thermal radiative energies toward and away from the Earth's surface over the Arctic are the main driver of, e.g., the annual melt and freezing cycle of ice and snow. In this paper, we investigate how state-of-the-art satellite-based data sets of these radiative energy fluxes agree, or disagree, with each other and reference measurements made in the Arctic Ocean and on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We found that different data sets have not only individual strengths but also individual weaknesses which should be improved upon to enable a cohesive investigation of the radiative energy balance at annual and decadal time scales.","[Riihela, Aku] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Key, Jeffrey R.] NOAA, Madison, WI USA; [Meirink, Jan Fokke] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Munneke, Peter Kuipers] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Palo, Timo] Univ Tartu, Tartu, Estonia; [Karlsson, Karl-Goran] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden",Finnish Meteorological Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Utrecht University; University of Tartu; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Riihela, A (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",aku.riihela@fmi.fi,"Karlsson, Karl-Göran/AAA-1980-2022; Key, Jeffrey R./AAB-7248-2020; Riihelä, Aku/R-1750-2019; Riihelä, Aku/D-2799-2013; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Riihelä, Aku/0000-0001-6581-8792; Riihelä, Aku/0000-0001-6581-8792; Karlsson, Karl-Goran/0000-0001-7732-5100",Academy of Finland [287399]; EUMETSAT CM SAF project; Utrecht University,Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); EUMETSAT CM SAF project; Utrecht University,"The work of A.R. has been funded by the Academy of Finland research project 287399.

Quantifying their relative contributions is important to fully understand their individual effects. This review paper summarizes the progress on quantifying the relative contributions of forest or land cover change and climatic variability to hydrology in large watersheds using available case studies. It compared pros and cons of various research methods, identified research challenges and proposed future research priorities. Our synthesis shows that the relative hydrological effects of forest changes and climatic variability are largely dependent on their own change magnitudes and watershed characteristics. In some severely disturbed watersheds, impacts of forest changes or land use changes can be as important as those from climatic variability. This paper provides a brief review on eight selected research methods for this type of research. Because each method or technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, combining two or more methods is a more robust approach than using any single method alone. Future research priorities include conducting more case studies, refining research methods, and considering mechanism-based research using landscape ecology and geochemistry approaches.","[Wei, Xiaohua] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Liu, Wenfei; Zhou, Peicong] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Landscape & Art, Nanchang 330045, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenfei] Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia Okanagan; Jiangxi Agricultural University; Nanchang Institute Technology,"Wei, XH (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",adam.wei@ubc.ca; liuwf729@126.com; pc.zhou@me.com,,"Wei, Xiaohua (Adam)/0000-0003-2711-5636",National Science Foundation of China [31170665]; Young Scientific Funding of Nanchang Institute of Technology [2012KJ004],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Scientific Funding of Nanchang Institute of Technology,This work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 31170665) and the Young Scientific Funding of Nanchang Institute of Technology (2012KJ004).,,81,65,68,7,115,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2013,2,,,,728,746,,10.3390/w5020728,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w5020728,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,169HD,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000320769800023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The sediments of this coastal strip provide a record of sea level change if an accurate chronology of the coastal deposits is available. We have here surveyed and analysed coastal sites and established a chronology based on optical dating techniques. The optical ages range from 156 ka to 62 ka (2 sigma level) and cluster around the last interglacial period (similar to 125-75 ka). Our study shows that sea level rose after Termination 11 for about 25 ka leading to a transgressive deposit at similar to 120 ka. A disconformity shown by some deposits suggests a brief drop of sea level during this transgressional phase. Subsequently, for around 40 ka the coastal area became covered by soils, colluvia and aeolian sediments indicating a slowly falling sea level. While the composition of sediments at the north coast did not change, the deposits at the central and south coast experienced a drastic change from a quartz- to a carbonate-dominated sedimentation sometime during the last interglacial. Littoral sedimentation ceased at similar to 70 ka when the coast became sediment starved in the course of the falling sea level. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This process is caused both by overland and subsurface flow. Over the last decades, most studies on soil erosion by water have focused on surface processes, such as sheet (interrill), rill and gully erosion, although subsurface erosion by soil piping has been reported to be a significant and widespread process. This paper presents a state of art regarding research on soil piping and addresses the main research gaps. Recent studies indicate that this process (1) occurs in almost all climatic zones and in the majority of soil types, (2) impacts landscape evolution by changing slope hydrology, slope stability and slope-channel coupling, (3) is controlled by various factors including climate and weather, soil properties, topography, land use and land management. These issues are illustrated with various case studies from around the world. However, the majority of the reviewed studies used surface methods for soil pipe detection, although soil piping is a subsurface process. Surface methods, such as geomorphological mapping, may underestimate the piping-affected area by 50%. Moreover, most studies are limited to few case studies without presenting thresholds for soil pipe development in different environments. Subsurface erosion by soil piping is not represented in currently used soil erosion models. Therefore more research is needed to better understand the morphology and connectivity of soil pipes, their subsurface catchments, as well as soil erosion rates by piping in different environments. Knowledge of thresholds that induce erosion in pipes and subsequent initiation of gullies may help to improve models of hillslope hydrology and soil erosion that include pipeflow and piping erosion. The investigation of soil piping also requires improved methods that allow to better predict pipe development and collapses, and thus to detect piping-affected areas. Studies dealing with effective prevention and control measures of soil piping are scarce. Addressing these research gaps will help to improve our insights into subsurface erosion by soil piping, and thus help to better understand landscape evolution and hillslope hydrology, as well as to develop and improve effective piping erosion control techniques and strategies.","[Bernatek-Jakiel, Anita] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Dept Geomorphol, Ul Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Poesen, Jean] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",Jagiellonian University; KU Leuven,"Bernatek-Jakiel, A (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Dept Geomorphol, Ul Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",anita.bernatek@uj.edu.pl; jean.poesen@kuleuven.be,"Bernatek-Jakiel, Anita/J-8490-2019","Bernatek-Jakiel, Anita/0000-0001-9691-2159; POESEN, Jean/0000-0001-6218-8967","ETIUDA doctoral scholarship - National Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2015/16/T/ST10/00505]; National Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2017/24/C/ST10/00114]","ETIUDA doctoral scholarship - National Science Centre, Poland; National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","Anita Bernatek-Jakiel was supported by the ETIUDA doctoral scholarship (UMO-2015/16/T/ST10/00505) financed by the National Science Centre, Poland.

Not until about 160,000 years-ago does evidence for incipient art emerge. While records of farming emerge 23,000 years ago, it is only 12,000 years ago that more extensive agriculture is recorded in Middle East river valleys. With new food resources and wealth the human mind turned from camp-fire rituals to the construction of monuments for the dead and to mass killings named war, which dominate the history of civilization. From wars motivated by a need for resources deadly conflicts under a myriad of false flags have become an end for itself, including the most bizarre forms of blood rituals and torture. Since the industrial age with the development of new weapons for industrial-scale killing, and since the splitting of the atom, war has become a form of mass suicide threatening to destroy civilization and much of nature, leading to the 7th mass extinction of species.

It shows that Atze's stories closely followed the historical perspective prescribed by the communist party as well as the concept of the socialist picture story developed in the 1960s. These stories unfolded across series of individual images that generally avoided word balloons and sound effects and were accompanied by detailed text. Using a realistic style, such stories tried to convey a strong sense of authenticity but they remained unable to develop complex characters or stories.

However international carbon markets have not stimulated the demand for forestry offsets. Domestic market-mechanisms are emerging in many countries and forests could be highly valued through these policies as most of the benefits produced by forests are enjoyed locally. Here, a choice experiment explores drivers of valuation and willingness to pay for forest carbon services in voluntary markets in Mexico by comparing the valuation of citizens from four regions to test geographical preference for projects (n = 645). Findings from multinomial-logit models show valuation of forest carbon services is transferable and citizens would pay more for offsets from projects closer to their homes. Proximate forests provide a range of co-benefits to local users, including environmental services and opportunities for recreation. Factors related to valuation include sense of responsibility, previous knowledge of carbon emissions, previous visits to the sites, regional identification and the valuation of local environmental services (e.g. improvements in local air quality). Knowledge of spatial heterogeneity in valuation of the use of forest services can help to design market-based instruments by identifying highly valued areas for environmental services programs and carbon markets.

Physically this teleconnection can be explained by a simple Gill-Matsuno mechanism. In this work, the output from five different models chosen within the CMIP3 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 3) ensemble of coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) are analyzed to investigate how state-of-the-art CGCMs represent the impact of the South Tropical Atlantic (STA) SSTs on the Indian and African region. Using a correlation-regression technique, it is found that four out of the five models display a teleconnection between STA and Indian region which is generally weaker than in the observations but in agreement in the rainfall field pattern. This teleconnection is also noticeable in the ensemble mean of the five models. Over Africa, however, the significant changes in rainfall displayed in the observation are properly caught by only one of the CGCMs. Additionally, none of the models reproduces the symmetric upper-level wind response around the Equator seen over the Indian Ocean in the observations and all have significant biases also in the surface pressure field response to the tropical Atlantic SSTs. Nonetheless the STA response, particularly over the southern hemisphere, is indicative of the Gill-Matsuno-type mechanism identified in previous studies using idealized experiments with atmospheric GCMs and observational data. With a suite of atmospheric-only GCM integrations it is shown that the differences in amplitude and pattern are not only due to the strong biases and reduced variabilities of the CGCMs over the tropical Atlantic but they are also caused by the different physical parameterizations used in models.","[Barimalala, Rondrotiana; Kucharski, Fred] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, I-34014 Trieste, Italy; [Barimalala, Rondrotiana; Bracco, Annalisa] Georgia Inst Technol, EAS, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Barimalala, R (corresponding author), Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, Str Costiera 11, I-34014 Trieste, Italy.",rbarimal@ictp.it; abracco@gatech.edu; kucharsk@ictp.it,,"Bracco, Annalisa/0000-0002-1619-6103; Barimalala, Rondrotiana/0000-0001-7948-7699",,,,,51,21,22,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

This is because nonlinear wave-wave interactions play an important role in the evolution of wind waves, accounting for nonlinear transfer of wave energy to lower and higher frequencies within the spectrum. Presently, in almost all operational state-of-the-art wave models, nonlinear transfer due to wave-wave interactions are evaluated by the discrete interaction approximation (DIA), which was developed by pioneering studies led by Hasselmann more than two decades ago. Although many efforts have tried to develop new methodologies to improve DIA, its basic formulation has not changed. In this study, we present a new computational method by evaluating the dominant nonlinear wave transfer along the wave-number and the wave directional axes, and by approximating the contributions along the resonance loci. The new method is denoted the Advanced Dominant Interaction (AvDI) method. We show that AvDI is sufficiently efficient that it can be implemented within an operational wave model. As a validation of the approach, we compare simulations of hurricane Juan with observed wave data. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Blauhut, V",,,,"Blauhut, Veit",,,The triple complexity of drought risk analysis and its visualisation via mapping: a review across scales and sectors,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Drought risk; intelligibility of maps; drought hazard; vulnerability to drought; drought impacts,CLIMATE-CHANGE; METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT; WESTERN PART; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; INDEXES; CHINA; MANAGEMENT; SATELLITE; MODEL,"Drought risk quantifies the likelihood of environmental and socio-economic systems to suffer negative consequences due to drought. The analysis of drought risk is understood as the initial step to foster drought risk management at different scales and thematic foci. To communicate drought risk to stakeholders, a visualisation via risk maps is of preferable usage. Even though drought risk has been subject to investigations worldwide, a systematic review of current drought risk mapping practice is lacking. This work reviews recent practices of drought risk analysis with the aim of detangling issues of scale and focus of application, applied data, approaches to analyse risk, and drought risk mapping as generic visualisation technique. The review highlights a general lack of national and regional studies, especially in Central America as well as northern and south-eastern Asia. A majority of studies focuses specific topics, especially agriculture, but also general drought risk analyses are popular. From a methodological point of view, drought risk is based on different kinds of information: hazard, vulnerability and impact information; and combined in statistical or conceptual models. Hereby, a lack of statistical evidence for predictor selection as well as of verification of final results became evident. The majority of studies bases analysis on predictors on expert knowledge, whereas a proven suitability of the predictor to analyse the asset at risk remains questionable. The analysis of existing studies suggests that there is only little agreement on what a drought risk analysis entails. The variety of research aims and thematic foci results in a wide spectrum of drought hazard predictors and vulnerability factors applied as well as ways to analyse drought risk. Nevertheless, common paradigms of data application and combination practice were identified and resulted in the overall recommendation on considering the components of hazard predictors, vulnerability and impact information in the frame of a statistical model. Moreover, information on common practice of applied methodological approaches and data with regard to the location, spatial resolution and thematic focus of the study is provided. Furthermore, efforts to map drought risk differ widely with respect to purpose, intelligibility, and implementation details such as categorical visualisation. In order to increase intelligibility of prospective drought risk maps, basic standards have been recommended.","[Blauhut, Veit] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Environm Hydrol Syst, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Blauhut, V (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Environm Hydrol Syst, Freiburg, Germany.",veit.blauhut@hydrology.uni-freiburg.de,,,"Ministry of Science, Research and Art Baden-Wurttemberg; Wassernetzwerk Baden-Wurttemberg","Ministry of Science, Research and Art Baden-Wurttemberg; Wassernetzwerk Baden-Wurttemberg","This work was supported by Ministry of Science, Research and Art Baden-Wurttemberg and the Wassernetzwerk Baden-Wurttemberg in the frame of the DRIeR project.",,188,10,10,2,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0012-8252,1872-6828,,EARTH-SCI REV,Earth-Sci.

Byrd Glacier has the largest ice drainage system in Antarctica and is the fastest ice stream entering Ross Ice Shelf. In 2004 two large subglacial lakes at the head of Byrd Glacier suddenly drained and increased the terminal ice velocity of Byrd Glacier from 820 m yr(-1) to 900 m yr(-1). This resulted in partial ice-bed recoupling above the lakes and partial decoupling along Byrd Glacier. An attempt to quantify this behavior is made using flowband and flowline models in which the controlling variable for ice height above the bed is the floating fraction phi of ice along the flowband and flowline. Changes in phi before and after drainage are obtained from available data, but more reliable data in the map plane are required before Byrd Glacier can be modeled adequately. A holistic sliding velocity is derived that depends on phi, with contributions from ice shearing over coupled beds and ice stretching over uncoupled beds, as is done in state-of-the-art sliding theories.","[Hughes, Terence] Univ Maine, Dept Earth Sci, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Sargent, Aitbala; Fastook, James] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Dept Comp Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Hughes, T (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Earth Sci, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",terry.hughes@maine.edu,,"Fastook, James/0000-0003-3900-671X","NSF; NASA through a subcontract from the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS), University of Kansas","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA through a subcontract from the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS), University of Kansas","This manuscript was prepared and submitted by Beverly Hughes.

Its precipitation patterns are characterized by very low annual amounts with great seasonal and spatial variability. Moreover, extreme events often lead to flooding and pose threat to human life and activities. Towards a better understanding of the spatiotemporal features of precipitation in the region, a thirty-year (1986-2015) climatic analysis has been prepared with the aid of the state-of-the-art numerical modeling system RAMS/ICLAMS. Its two-way interactive nesting capabilities, explicit cloud microphysical schemes with seven categories of hydrometeors and the ability to handle dust aerosols as predictive quantities are significant advantages over an area where dust is a dominant factor. An extended evaluation based on in situ measurements and satellite records revealed a good model behavior. The analysis was performed in three main components; the mean climatic characteristics, the rainfall trends and the extreme cases. The extremes are analyzed under the principles of the extreme value theory, focusing not only on the duration but also on the intensity of the events. The annual and monthly rainfall patterns are investigated and discussed. The spatial distribution of the precipitation trends revealed insignificant percentage differences in the examined period. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the eastern part and the top half of the western Arabian Peninsula presented the lowest risk associated with extreme events. Apart from the pure scientific interest, the present study provides useful information for different sectors of society and economy, such as civil protection, constructions and reinsurance.","[Patlakas, Platon; Stathopoulos, Christos; Flocas, Helena; Bartsotas, Nikolaos S.; Kallos, George] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Univ Campus,Bldg PHYS 5, Athens 15784, Greece; [Patlakas, Platon; Stathopoulos, Christos; Bartsotas, Nikolaos S.; Kallos, George] Weather & Marine Engn Technol PC WeMET PC, Athens 17456, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Kallos, G (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Univ Campus,Bldg PHYS 5, Athens 15784, Greece.;Kallos, G (corresponding author), Weather & Marine Engn Technol PC WeMET PC, Athens 17456, Greece.",platon@mg.uoa.gr; chrisstath@mg.uoa.gr; efloca@phys.uoa.gr; nikos@mg.uoa.gr; kallos@mg.uoa.gr,"Patlakas, Platon/AAL-4320-2020","Patlakas, Platon/0000-0002-3572-6851",Saudi Aramco [6600033903],Saudi Aramco,"This work was supported by Saudi Aramco, Contract No: 6600033903 to WeMET P.C.",,43,4,4,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUL,2021,7,,,,,,103,10.3390/cli9070103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9070103,,,25,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,TO2WM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000676778700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One hypothesis is that such individuals are more likely to view stressful circumstances as an opportunity for growth. The association between aesthetic engagement and stress-related growth orientation (SRGO) was investigated in two studies (total N = 463) using both behavioral coding and survey methods. Study 1 examined the association between aesthetic engagement and growth-oriented striving (self-improvement) in the context of an ecologically valid laboratory stressor. Results indicated that aesthetic engagement was significantly associated with observational behavior ratings of self-improvement across structured interviews regarding two recent stressors. Study 2 was a cross-sectional study that employed structural equation modeling to examine the hypothesized relationships between aesthetic engagement, including an expanded assessment of proneness to aesthetic chill, and measures assessing aspects of SRGO (COPE Positive Reinterpretation and Growth Subscale, Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale). Results demonstrated that individual differences in propensity to aesthetic chill experiences were associated with a SRGO latent construct. Taken together, converging evidence from these studies suggest that the tendency to view stressors as an opportunity for growth may be a characteristic adaptation of individuals high in aesthetic engagement and, in particular, proneness to aesthetic chill.","[Johnson, Kimberley T.; Williams, Paula G.; Smith, Timothy W.; Baucom, Brian R.

The small mammals of Monte Peglia upper and lower levels had been studied in the past, whereas the remains of large mammals of Monte Peglia lower level, stored in several Institutions of central Italy, are described here for the first time. The following taxa have been described: Hystrix refossa, Homotherium latidens, Panthera cf. P. gombaszoegensis, Felis cf. F. lunensis, Canis mosbachensis, Vulpes alopecoides, Meles meles, Pannonictis cf. P. nestii, Mustela palerminea, Ursus cf. U. etruscus; Macaca sylvanus florentinus, Equus altidens, Stephanorhinus cf. S. hundsheimensis, Sus sp., Capreolus sp., Axis eurygonos, Hemitragus cf. H. orientalis, Bison degiulii. Moreover, the list of small mammals of the lower level has been updated with the addition of three new small vertebrate taxa: Rana sp., Myotis sp. (large size), cf. Miniopterus sp. The study of the remains of large mammals of the lower layer indicate the survival of a number of taxa of latest Villafranchian age. If we accept the biochronological correlation of Monte Peglia with the Colle Curti local fauna, its age should be similar to 1.072 Ma. In this case, it is possible to pinpoint the accumulation of the lower level to the MIS 35/33, as the small mammals confirm the presence of a mixed environment with forested and open spaces and warm temperate climate. The accumulation of the upper level, characterized by taxa typical of open spaces and steppes and a cooler climate, probably occurred during MIS 34/32.","[Petronio, Carmelo; Atzori, Pietro; Salari, Leonardo] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Angelone, Chiara; Kotsakis, Tassos] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Largo San Leonardo Murialdo 1, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Angelone, Chiara] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Palaeontol & Palaeoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Xi Zhi Men Wai Da Jie 142, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Angelone, Chiara] Inst Catala Paleontol Miquel Crusafont, Edifici Z ICTA ICP,Carrer Columnes S-N, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Famiani, Federico] Museo Vulcanol San Venanzo, Piazza Roma 1, I-05010 San Venanzo, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Roma Tre University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institut Catala de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont (ICP),"Angelone, C (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Largo San Leonardo Murialdo 1, I-00146 Rome, Italy.;Angelone, C (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Palaeontol & Palaeoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Xi Zhi Men Wai Da Jie 142, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.;Angelone, C (corresponding author), Inst Catala Paleontol Miquel Crusafont, Edifici Z ICTA ICP,Carrer Columnes S-N, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",angelone@uniroma3.it,,"ANGELONE, Chiara/0000-0002-7140-9431","President's International Fellowship Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Science; Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion; European Regional Development Fund of the European Union [CGL2016-76431-P]; CERCA Program, Generalitat de Catalunya; MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza","President's International Fellowship Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Science; Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund of the European Union; CERCA Program, Generalitat de Catalunya; MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza","CA was supported by a Visiting Professor grant of the President's International Fellowship Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Science; Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion and the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union (CGL2016-76431-P); CERCA Program, Generalitat de Catalunya; Grant to Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, ART. 1, C. 314-337 L. 232/2016).",,228,3,3,0,3,UNIV STUDI MILANO,MILANO,"C/O RIVISTA ITALIANA PALEONTOLOGIA STRATIGRAFIA, VIA MANGIAGALLI, 34, 20133 MILANO, ITALY",0035-6883,2039-4942,,RIV ITAL PALEONTOL S,Riv.

Therefore, studying the interrelationships between changes in the ecohydrological processes of this basin and its land cover is of great importance for maintaining sustainability and the environment. This study investigated the annual average air temperature, total annual precipitation, and river discharge variability, and land cover changes at selected stations of the basin by using the hydrometeorological analysis, satellite analysis, and land cover determination statistical analysis. During the study period, the average annual air temperature rose from -1.5 degrees C to +0.3 degrees C (1.8 degrees C 361 degrees C). The average annual precipitation exhibits relatively low change during this period. River discharge varied during the study period. A significant decreasing trend in river discharge was observed at the Terelj (phi = -2.72) and Ulaanbaatar (phi = -5.63) stations, whereas the other stations, Altanbulag, Lun, and Orkhontuul, showed a significant increasing trend. During the study period, changes in land cover were directly related to main hydrometeorological parameters. Between 2000 and 2020, the amount of grassland decreased by 319.67 km(2), while the area of water bodies increased by 28.36 km(2). In the study area, mainly water bodies and sensitive areas of the land cover types were changed due to changes in precipitation. Studies in the arid and semiarid regions of Central Asia show that changes of ecohydrological processes have a significant impact on land cover changes.","[Dorjsuren, Batsuren; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Environm & Forest Engn, Lab Air & Environm Monitoring, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Batsaikhan, Nyamdavaa; Enkhbold, Altanbold] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Yan, Denghua; Qin, Tianlin; Weng, Baisha; Bi, Wuxia] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Yadamjav, Otgonbayar] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Demberel, Otgonbayar] Khovd State Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Geol, Khovd 164300, Mongolia; [Boldsaikhan, Tsasanchimeg] Natl Agcy Meteorol Environm Monitoring, Dept Weather Forecast, Ulaanbaatar 15160, Mongolia; [Gombo, Oyunkhuu] Informat & Res Inst Meteorol Hydrol & Environm IR, Hydrol Div, Ulaanbaatar 15160, Mongolia; [Gedefaw, Mohammed; Girma, Abel; Abiyu, Asaminew] Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",National University of Mongolia; National University of Mongolia; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; National University of Mongolia; Khovd State University; Ministry of Nature Environment &Tourism Mongolia; Donghua University,"Batsaikhan, N (corresponding author), Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",nyamdavaab@num.edu.mn; nyamdavaab@num.edu.mn; yandh@iwhr.com; otgonbayar_ya@num.edu.mn; ch_sonomdagva@num.edu.mn; altanbold@num.edu.mn; qintl@iwhr.com; wengbs@iwhr.com; biwx@iwhr.com; otgonbayar@khu.edu.mn; tsasanchimeg@namem.gov.mn; oyunkhuu@irimhe.namem.gov.mn; mohammedgedefaw@gmail.com; abel.girma@uog.edu.et; asaminewab@yahoo.com,"Demberel, Otgonbayar/ABD-3196-2021; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/Q-6986-2018; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/AAK-8941-2021; Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/AFV-4937-2022; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/GQY-9193-2022; Demberel, Otgonbayar/ABD-4748-2021; Batsaikhan, Nyamdavaa/B-2235-2014","Dorjsuren, Batsuren/0000-0002-7864-8291; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/0000-0003-2724-9263; Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/0000-0002-2412-1507; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/0000-0003-2724-9263; Demberel, Otgonbayar/0000-0001-9748-3392; Batsaikhan, Nyamdavaa/0000-0002-0785-0513; Qin, Tianling/0000-0002-6073-6744; Gedefaw, Mohammed/0000-0003-1985-7023; Enkhbold, Altanbold/0000-0003-3810-449X",Young Scientist Grant of the National University of Mongolia [P2019-3732]; National Key Research and Development Project of China [2016YFA0601503],Young Scientist Grant of the National University of Mongolia; National Key Research and Development Project of China,This work was supported by the Young Scientist Grant of the National University of Mongolia (grant: P2019-3732) with additional support from the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant: 2016YFA0601503).,,45,6,6,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,3,,,,,,1153,10.3390/su13031153,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031153,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6RC,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000615641700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a database of archaeological radiocarbon dates and diagnostic material culture records from a series of key sites in the northern Levant we show that the hitherto apparent long-term continuity interpreted as the origins and consolidation of agricultural systems was not linear and uninterrupted. A major cultural discontinuity is observed in the archaeological record around 10,000 cal BP in synchrony with a Holocene Rapid Climate Change (RCC), a short period of climatic instability recorded in the Northern Hemisphere. This study demonstrates the interconnectedness of the first agricultural economies and the ecosystems they inhabited, and emphasizes the complex nature of human responses to environmental change during the Neolithic period in the Levant. Moreover, it provides a new environmental-cultural scenario that needs to be incorporated in the models reconstructing both the establishment of agricultural economy in southwestern Asia and the impact of environmental changes on human populations.","[Borrell, Ferran] Ctr Rech Francais Jerusalem CRFJ CNRS, Jerusalem, Israel; [Junno, Aripekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Anton Barcelo, Joan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of Helsinki; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Borrell, F (corresponding author), Ctr Rech Francais Jerusalem CRFJ CNRS, Jerusalem, Israel.",silmarils1000@hotmail.com,"Barcelo, Juan/L-2626-2014","Barcelo, Juan/0000-0002-1580-471X","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [HAR2012-31036, CSD2010-00034]; Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation","Funding for this research was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Grant HAR2012-31036 and Project CSD2010-00034 Social and environmental transitions: Simulating the past to understand human behavior, see: http://www.simulpast.es) to J.A.

Chickpea, as a cool season crop, is under the direct influence of heat and drought stress that is not only affecting this crop in its podding stage but, with current climate trends, the drought and heat are now also affecting earlier stages, such as flowering. The deteriorating effects of heat and droughts include reduced flowering, abortion of flowers and absence of podding; thus, this is severely affecting crop yield. Further research has been conducted to identify the genes correlated to higher stress tolerance and to utilize them in developing more tolerant varieties. Different alleviation approaches have been also tested and it has been determined that some positive effects can be seen in supplementation with Zn through melioration of water relations, seed priming and some transgenic and genome editing approaches. Breeding strategies for future chickpea varieties have been focused on the identification of varieties with more tolerant traits for an improved yield under stressed conditions. In this review, we have reviewed recent strategies and biotechnological approaches that have been used with chickpea crops to address the two major abiotic stresses (heat and drought) linked to future climate change.","[Karalija, Erna; Vergata, Chiara; Basso, Marcos Fernando; Negussu, Miriam; Martinelli, Federico] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Karalija, Erna] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Zmaja Od Bosne 33-35, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Basso, Marcos Fernando; Grossi-de-Sa, Maria Fatima] Embrapa Genet Resources & Biotechnol, BR-70297400 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Zaccai, Michele] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel",University of Florence; University of Sarajevo; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Ben Gurion University,"Martinelli, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Biol, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",federico.martinelli@unifi.it,"Karalija, Erna/AAE-9366-2020","Karalija, Erna/0000-0001-7262-0645; Basso, Marcos Fernando/0000-0001-8192-8959; Vergata, Chiara/0000-0003-2727-7977; GROSSI-DE-SA, MARIA FATIMA/0000-0001-8184-9599","PRIMA-The Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area; Horizon 2020, the European Union's Framework Program for Research and Innovatio [1432-LEGU-MED2]; Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology; Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation [3-17924]","PRIMA-The Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area; Horizon 2020, the European Union's Framework Program for Research and Innovatio; Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel); Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation(Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy))","Authors were supported by PRIMA-The Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area.

These models have recently started to be applied in the study of fossil xenarthrans. SDMs were generated for 15 South American late Pleistocene xenarthrans: eight Cingulata (Glyptodon clavipes, Doedicurus clavicaudatus, Panochthus tuberculatus, Neosclerocalyptus paskoensis, Pampatherium typum, Pampatherium humboldtii, Holmesina paulacoutoi, and Holmesina occidentalis) and seven Folivora (Glossotherium robustum, Lestodon armatus, Mylodon darwinii, Catonyx cuvieri, Catonyx (=Scelidodon) chilensis, Megatherium americanum, and Eremotherium laurillardi). Models were evaluated for three periods: the last interglacial (LIG), the last glacial maximum (LGM), and the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO). Co-occurrence records were studied based on the overlap of the potential distributions and compared with the available biome reconstructions of South America during the LGM to analyze species distribution patterns, ecological requirements, and possible interactions. Our results suggest the existence of provincialization within xenarthran megamammals grouped in at least three bioregions. Northern and southwestern taxa overlap in the Rio de la Plata region where also some endemic taxa are found. We observed overlapping potential distributions but separated and continuous realized distributions between closely related xenarthrans suggesting competitive exclusion. A generalized reduction in potential habitats at the end of the Pleistocene was not obvious as some taxa show stable potential areas during HCO when comparing with LGM. Nonetheless, fragmentation of the most suitable areas due to climate variation and the impact of reduction in available land due to sea level changes cannot be ruled out as involved in the extinction.","[Varela, Luciano; Sebastian Tambusso, P.; Patino, Santiago J.; Farina, Richard A.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Paleontol, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Di Giacomo, Mariana] Univ Delaware, Dept Art Conservat, Newark, DE USA","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; University of Delaware","Varela, L (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Paleontol, Montevideo, Uruguay.",luciano.lvr@gmail.com,"Fariña, Richard/GRF-6009-2022; Varela, Luciano/R-2111-2018","Varela, Luciano/0000-0002-9481-6558; Tambusso, Pablo Sebastian/0000-0001-7349-5292; Di Giacomo, Mariana/0000-0002-7191-3961",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion [FCE_ 1_ 2014_ 1_ 104572],Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion,"We are grateful to Susana Bargo and John Nyakatura for inviting us to participate in this volume as an extension of the symposium Morphology and Evolution of the Xenarthra during the 11th International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology, Washington DC, USA, in 2016.

The climate-controlled experiments include five temperature levels of 26, 30, 33, 37 and 39 degrees C, two relative humidity levels of 50% and 70%, and two activity levels with light and moderate and in which the estimated average metabolic rate were respectively 58 W/m(2) and 165 W/m(2). A total of 136 healthy subjects who lived in hot-humid climate for a long time participated in these experiments. During the experiments, the ratings of thermal sensation, comfort and acceptability were documented, local skin temperatures were continuously monitored, and five mean skin temperatures were calculated. Using Fisher discriminant analysis to model thermal sensation from skin temperature, then obtaining the thresholds of local and mean skin temperatures corresponding to different thermal sensation categories, and finally verifying the accuracy of the models assessment. The results show that the skin temperature can also predict thermal sensation at high temperatures of 30-39 degrees C beyond the range of normal temperatures. The proposed evaluation models show a high accuracy to predict the hot/very hot category, and up to 93% accuracy of predicting thermal sensation from wrist skin temperature. Additionally, thermal adaptation to high temperature and humidity can affect the prediction accuracy of hot/very hot category from skin temperature. The results of this study provide an important basis for early warning when human's safety risk occurs under high temperatures.","[Liu, Weiwei; Tian, Xiaoyu; Deng, Yun] Cent South Univ, Sch Energy Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Diyu] HuNan Ind Polytech, Dept Modern Art Design, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China",Central South University; Hunan Industry Polytechnic,"Liu, WW (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Energy Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",wliu@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51978661, 51778625]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The project was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.51978661 and No.51778625).

However, little is known about effects of these pollutants individually or in combination on plant species in alpine habitats. We analyzed 11 frequent plant species of a subalpine Geo-Montani-Nardetum pasture exposed at 2,000 m a.s.l. in the Swiss Alps during 3 years using a factorial free-air exposure system with three concentrations of O(3) and five rates of N application. The aim was to detect subtle effects on leaf chlorophyll and N concentrations, leaf weight, specific leaf area (SLA), and delta(18)O and delta(13)C as proxies for gas exchange. We expected that the species' responsiveness to O(3) and N would be related to their functional traits and that N-induced changes in these traits would modify the species' response to O(3) via increased growth and higher leaf conductance (g(s)). Most species reacted to N supply with the accumulation of N and chlorophyll, but with no change in SLA, g(s), and growth, except Carex sempervirens which showed increased water use efficiency and leaf weight. Elevated O(3) reduced gs in most species, but this was not related to a reduction in leaf weight, which was recorded in half of the species. Contrary to our expectation, the magnitude of the response to both O(3) and N was not related to species-specific traits such as SLA or g(s). No pronounced O(3) x N interactions were observed. In conclusion, since for most species neither N nor gas exchange limited growth, their short-term response to O(3) and N and to their combination was small. O(3) x N interactive effects are expected to be more pronounced in habitats where species are more responsive to N due to favorable growth conditions in terms of nutrient availability and temperature.","[Bassin, Seraina; Volk, Matthias; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut & Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Werner, Roland A.; Soergel, Karin; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bassin, S (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",Seraina.Bassin@art.admin.ch,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Werner, Roland A./P-8665-2017","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Werner, Roland A./0000-0002-4117-1346",Swiss Federal Office of Environment in the framework of the International Cooperative Programe Vegetation (ICP Vegetation) [UNECE CLR-TAP],Swiss Federal Office of Environment in the framework of the International Cooperative Programe Vegetation (ICP Vegetation),"This work was supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Environment in the framework of the International Cooperative Programe Vegetation (ICP Vegetation) under the UNECE CLR-TAP.

However international carbon markets have not stimulated the demand for forestry offsets. Domestic market-mechanisms are emerging in many countries and forests could be highly valued through these policies as most of the benefits produced by forests are enjoyed locally. Here, a choice experiment explores drivers of valuation and willingness to pay for forest carbon services in voluntary markets in Mexico by comparing the valuation of citizens from four regions to test geographical preference for projects (n = 645). Findings from multinomial-logit models show valuation of forest carbon services is transferable and citizens would pay more for offsets from projects closer to their homes. Proximate forests provide a range of co-benefits to local users, including environmental services and opportunities for recreation. Factors related to valuation include sense of responsibility, previous knowledge of carbon emissions, previous visits to the sites, regional identification and the valuation of local environmental services (e.g. improvements in local air quality). Knowledge of spatial heterogeneity in valuation of the use of forest services can help to design market-based instruments by identifying highly valued areas for environmental services programs and carbon markets.

Rainfall to the north of the Mozambique Channel, bounded 10 degrees - 5 degrees S and 40 degrees - 50 degrees E, is found to be quite feeble despite being in the warm SST regime of up to 29 -29.5 degrees C. The rainfall intensity is rather found to be highly associated with the atmospheric surface divergence. The vigorous rainfall is associated with the more convergence over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), while the weak rainfall is linked with the divergence to the north of the Mozambique Channel. The surface divergent flow to the north of the Mozambique Channel is associated with a deep southward penetration of the northerly Indian Winter Monsoon (IWM). Corresponding to the surface divergent field, a relatively high sea level pressure (SLP) compared to the SLP in the ITCZ, weak subsidence, and low-level stratiform clouds are formed to the north of the Mozambique Channel, despite the warm, tropical SST. These atmospheric conditions are most likely conductive to the inhibition of cumulus convection over the region and the unique relationship between rainfall and SST seems peculiar. Our analysis also shows that the rare occurrence of tropical cyclones over the area is attributed to a high-pressure surge and the associated positive surface vorticity (anti-cyclonic). This study suggests that the area to the north of the Mozambique Channel is dynamically interesting for climatological studies.","[Koseki, Shunya; Bhatt, Bhuwan Chandra] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Koseki, Shunya; Bhatt, Bhuwan Chandra] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Koseki, S (corresponding author), Postboks 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",shunya.koseki@gfi.uib.no,,"Koseki, Shunya/0000-0001-7205-7434",EU FP7 PREFACE project [603521]; ERC-STERCP project [648982],EU FP7 PREFACE project; ERC-STERCP project,"The authors greatly appreciate two anonymous reviewers for their quite constructive comments.

In this work, we present an efficient scheduling optimization approach that captures scheduling-relevant dynamics in a linear scale-bridging model and relies on collocation for time discretization. The resulting mixed-integer linear program (MILP) can be solved with state-of-the-art solvers. We apply the approach to a case study on building DSM. A detailed simulation model represents an office building, which allows load shifting through dynamic concrete core activation and is heated by a heat pump with minimum part-load. The DSM scheduling optimization approach reduces energy cost significantly compared to a rule-based scheduler without DSM if electricity price volatility is high.

A multiple-methods approach combining a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interview was tested for effective post-occupancy evaluation. The study compared one non-LEED healthcare facility with five LEED certified healthcare buildings and examined which variable(s) had significant relationship with comfort and productivity by surveying 249 occupants and interviewing six facility managers in six healthcare settings. The results showed that five LEED-certified healthcare settings were superior to one non-LEED facility in most of building performance factors. Building design, temperature comfort, image presented to visitors, use of space, control over noise and ability to meet occupants' needs were significant predictors for overall comfort. Lighting overall, temperature comfort and image presented to visitors had a significant positive relationship with perceived productivity. Only one non-LEED hospital was selected and some buildings had small response rate, the results should be interpreted with caution.","[Xuan, Xiaodong] Hefei Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology,"Xuan, XD (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",xxuan@hfut.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51508142],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51508142).",,70,10,11,3,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1420-326X,1423-0070,,INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON,Indoor Built Environ.,APR,2018,4,,,,544,560,,10.1177/1420326X16684007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1420326X16684007,,,17,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",GC5JJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000429823100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, up to date, it is still unclear which crystal structure is present in the thin films, a piece of information relevant for device applications. In this work, we address this issue by an in-depth characterization of the polymorphs of Indigo in the bulk and in drop-cast films. To do this, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-Raman spectroscopy have been employed jointly, with the support of state-of-the-art density functional theory calculations in the solid state. Structural and spectroscopic characterizations have established that the two known A and B polymorphs grow as concomitant in the bulk under most of the experimental conditions adopted in this work. In the drop-cast films, XRD cannot unambiguously identify the structure, but Raman spectroscopy is effective in establishing that only the B form is present. The calculations augment the experiments, providing valuable insights into the relative thermodynamic stability of the two forms as a function of temperature. They also allow for a more comprehensive characterization of the Raman modes.","[Salzillo, T.; Rivalta, A.; Giunchi, A.; Brillante, A.; Della Valle, R.

Due to the increasing population and climate change of the earth, human societies need freshwater sources and conservation more than ever before. According to these rapid changes in the importance of water sources, positive actions by the United Nations (UNs) are increasing around the world. Regarding the dramatic increase in energy demand, especially in the water industry, water management plays a significant role in this industry, especially for urban areas. Hence, water management can be useful as a practical and applicable method to achieve energy sustainability and prevent water waste. The main objective of this study is to investigate the four influential indexes, including policy, economy, environment, social and most important indicators that have an impact on water management based on energy sustainability. A new way to achieve energy sustainability using appropriate indicators for water management is crucial, thus correct selection and how to implement them is essential. The result of this study shows, if energy experts and policymakers have a proper strategy and appropriate actions, can improve the situation of water management for megacities and urban areas.","[Razmjoo, Armin] Univ Politecn Cataluna, ETSEIB, Av Diagonal 647, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Khalili, Negar] Yazd Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Studies, Yazd, Iran; [Nezhad, Meysam Majidi] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Astronaut Elect & Energy Engn DIAEE, Rome, Italy; [Mokhtari, Nima] Univ Isfahan, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Esfahan, Iran; [Davarpanah, Afshin] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Math, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Yazd; Sapienza University Rome; University of Isfahan; Aberystwyth University,"Davarpanah, A (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Math, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",afshindpe@gmail.com,,"Razmjoo, Armin/0000-0001-9415-4649",,,,,72,7,7,3,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

Viewed from a semiotic perspective, street names constitute a spatial-text produced over time, capturing the political, social and cultural climates in which it is formed. In this article we propose an analysis of street names in four Israeli towns of different social, political and demographic backgrounds. The study is based on a two-stage analysis: an analysis of the local narratives and a hermeneutic reading of the street maps as spatial-texts. This is followed by a quantitative summary of street names according to categories. By studying practices of naming and renaming, and deciphering key elements in these spatial-texts, we conclude that street names reflect the changing character of the Israeli political, social and cultural orders. As such, they are indicative of shifts occurring in the social production of the Israeli collective memory.","McGill Univ, Dept Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T6, Canada; Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Polit Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",McGill University; Tel Aviv University,"Pinchevski, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Art Hist & Commun Studies, 853 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T6, Canada.",,,"Pinchevski, Amit/0000-0001-7839-1732",,,,,34,39,39,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"6 BONHILL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4PU, ENGLAND",0163-4437,,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

The thermal dissipation method (TDM) is widespread in the scientific community for measuring sap flow and has provided novel insights into water use and its environmental sensitivity, from the tree- to the forest-stand level. Yet, methodological approaches to determine sap flux density (SFD) from raw TDM measurements remain case-specific, introducing uncertainties and hampering data syntheses and meta-analyses. Here, we introduce the r package TREX (TRee sap flow EXtractor), incorporating a wide range of sap flow data-processing procedures to quantify SFD from raw TDM measurements. TREX provides functions for (a) importing and assimilating raw measurements, (b) data quality control and filtering and (c) calculating standardized SFD outputs and their associated uncertainties according to different data-processing methods. A case study using a Norway spruce tree illustrates TREX's functionalities, featuring interactive data curation and generating outputs in a reproducible and transparent way. The calculations of SFD in TREX can, for instance, use the original TDM calibration coefficients, user-supplied calibration parameters or calibration data from a recently compiled database of 22 studies and 37 species. Moreover, the package includes an automatic procedure for quantifying the sensitivity and uncertainty of the obtained results to user-defined assumptions and parameter values, by means of a state-of-the-art global sensitivity analysis. Time series of plant ecophysiological measurements are becoming increasingly available and enhance our understanding of climate change impacts on tree functioning. TREX allows for establishing a baseline for data processing of TDM measurements and supports comparability between case studies, facilitating robust, transparent and reproducible large-scale syntheses of sap flow patterns. Moreover, TREX facilitates the simultaneous application of multiple common data-processing approaches to convert raw data to physiological relevant quantities. This allows for robust quantification of the impact (i.e. sensitivity and uncertainty) of user-specific choices and methodological assumptions, which is necessary for process understanding and policy making.","[Peters, Richard L.; Goossens, Willem; Steppe, Kathy] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Plants & Crops, Lab Plant Ecol, Ghent, Belgium; [Peters, Richard L.; Zweifel, Roman] Swiss Fed Res Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WS, Forest Dynam, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Pappas, Christoforos] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pappas, Christoforos] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pappas, Christoforos] Univ Quebec, Teluq, Dept Sci & Technol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hurley, Alexander G.] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Climate Dynam & Landscape Evolut 4 3, Potsdam, Germany; [Hurley, Alexander G.; Flo, Victor] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Poyatos, Rafael] CREAF, E-08193 Bellaterra, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Poyatos, Rafael] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Bellaterra, Cerdanyola Del, Spain","Ghent University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ; University of Quebec Montreal; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Birmingham; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Autonomous University of Barcelona","Peters, RL (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Plants & Crops, Lab Plant Ecol, Ghent, Belgium.;Peters, RL (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WS, Forest Dynam, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",Richard.Peters@UGent.be,"Flo, Víctor/AAX-5065-2021; Zweifel, Roman/C-2852-2009; Poyatos, Rafael/F-8305-2010; Peters, Richard L./P-7942-2018","Flo, Víctor/0000-0003-1908-4577; Zweifel, Roman/0000-0001-9438-0582; Poyatos, Rafael/0000-0003-0521-2523; Hurley, Alexander/0000-0002-9641-2805; Steppe, Kathy/0000-0001-6252-0704; Peters, Richard L./0000-0002-7441-1297; Goossens, Willem/0000-0002-9734-8585","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [121859, 150205, P2BSP3_184475, P2EZP2_162293, P300P2_174477]; Spanish grant [RTI2018-095297-J-I00]; Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Spanish grant(Spanish Government); Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: INTEGRAL (121859), LOTFOR (150205), P2BSP3_184475, P2EZP2_162293 and P300P2_174477; Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers; Spanish grant, Grant/Award Number: RTI2018-095297-J-I00",,33,7,7,3,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

A series of systematically designed idealized simulations are carried out in such a way that dust emissions from the selected source regions are either perpetually suppressed or enhanced from these source regions and the response of the intra-seasonal oscillations (ISOs) of SAM rainfall to such perturbations in dust emissions are investigated. It is noted that the intra-seasonal variability of SAM rainfall is dominated by three different ISOs with periodicities of 10-20 days, 30-60 days and 60-90 days. Modulations in the characteristics of each of these three ISOs are studied for each of the dust perturbation experiments. Statistically robust K-S test and F test performed on the results from various dust perturbation experiments suggest that the perpetual perturbations in dust emissions from remote sources as well as locally from south Asia can significantly modulate the spatial and temporal structure of the ISOs of rainfall across scales during the monsoon season. Substantial changes are also noted in the spatial scales and propagation characteristics of ISOs attributable to the dust emission changes made over local and remote source regions in our idealized simulations. Our results suggest that perturbations in dust emissions over remote locations can substantially modulate the depth and duration of active and break rainfall events in the south Asian monsoon region. Results presented here have implications for better understanding and predicting the SAM rainfall variability at the intra-seasonal scales or at shorter time scales (~less than a season) under variable dust emissions from remote and local source regions.","[Singh, Charu] ISRO, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun, India; [Ganguly, Dilip; Sharma, Puneet] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Delhi, India","Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi","Singh, C (corresponding author), ISRO, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun, India.",singhcharu105@gmail.com,,"singh, charu/0000-0002-6249-9965",,,,,92,12,12,3,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

It consists of four geographically fixed centers over the west of the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, western Siberia, and Lake Baikal, respectively. Its intraseasonal variations and dynamics are investigated based on reanalysis datasets. The BBC pattern has a life cycle of about two weeks. Its precursor could be traced back to an upstream wave packet propagating along the Atlantic jet 10 days before its peak, and its life cycle resembles the evolution of a quasi-stationary Rossby wave train. Diagnosis of the streamfunction tendency equation suggests that the growth and decay of the BBC pattern are primarily driven by the nonlinear processes, whereas the quasi-stationary feature of the BBC pattern arises from the cancellation among the linear processes. Energetics analysis indicates that the energy cycle with the transient eddies (TEs) plays an essential role in the growth and decay of the BBC pattern. The BBC pattern first feeds on the barotropic energy provided by the TEs and then returns the energy to TEs in the form of baroclinic energy. It is this nonlinear interaction with the TEs that poses a tough challenge to the current state-of-the-art models to capture the BBC pattern reasonably.","[Xu, Peiqiang; Wang, Lin; Chen, Wen] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Peiqiang; Wang, Lin; Chen, Wen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guosen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Earth Syst Modeling Ctr, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Kang, In-Sik] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, Indian Ocean Operat Oceanog Res Ctr, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China","Wang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wanglin@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Wang, Lin/G-5245-2010; Chen, Wen/G-6058-2011","Wang, Lin/0000-0002-3557-1853; Chen, Wen/0000-0001-9327-9079","NationalKeyR&DProgram of China [2016YFA0600604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41721004, 41925020]",NationalKeyR&DProgram of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We appreciate the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions that helped us to improve the paper.

Surface latent heat fluxes provide major energy input to the atmosphere. Despite the importance of these fluxes, state-of-the-art data sets of surface energy and water fluxes largely differ. The present paper introduces a new framework for the estimation of surface energy and water fluxes at the land surface, which allows for temporally and spatially high-resolved flux estimates at the quasi-global scale ( 50 degrees S, 50 degrees N) ( High resOlution Land Atmosphere Parameters from Space - HO-LAPS v1.0). The framework makes use of existing long-term satellite and reanalysis data records and ensures internally consistent estimates of the surface radiation and water fluxes. The manuscript introduces the technical details of the developed framework and provides results of a comprehensive sensitivity and evaluation study. Overall the root mean square difference ( RMSD) was found to be 51.2 ( 30.7) W m(-2) for hourly ( daily) latent heat flux, and 84 ( 38) W m(-2) for sensible heat flux when compared against 48 FLUXNET stations worldwide. The largest uncertainties of latent heat flux and net radiation were found to result from uncertainties in the solar radiation flux obtained from satellite data products.","[Loew, Alexander] Univ Munich, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Loew, Alexander; Peng, Jian] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Borsche, Michael] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Natl Climate Monitoring, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany",University of Munich; Max Planck Society; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Loew, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.;Loew, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",alexander.loew@lmu.de,,"/0000-0003-3948-1924; Peng, Jian/0000-0002-4071-0512","Cluster of Excellence CliSAP, University of Hamburg [EXC177]; German Science Foundation (DFG)","Cluster of Excellence CliSAP, University of Hamburg; German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This study was supported through the Cluster of Excellence CliSAP (EXC177), University of Hamburg, funded through the German Science Foundation (DFG), which is gratefully acknowledged.

The work documented in this paper is part of the first author's Professional Doctorate change project in Sustainable Built Environment (D.SBE) at Cardiff Metropolitan University with a medical facility case study in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in use since 2015. The project is investigating the impact of alternative water sources energy consumption versus public network seawater desalinated potable water for outdoor use. The context is a 364 beds hospital in Abu Dhabi with a 21,600m(2) building footprint area surrounded by a 36,310m(2) vegetated open space. The hospital includes a treated air cooling condensate water system suitable for use as irrigation water and water feature use. The condensate water has been tested in 2016 and 2017 to verify compliance for reuse. Whilst, the water test results demonstrate suitability for outdoor reuse in a healthcare setting, additional alternative water sources such as fire test pump water (450m(3)/year) have been tested in March 2017, which shows that a tertiary treatment system is needed for its reuse. It was also found that onsite alternative water sources are less energy intensive for irrigation (0.22kWh/m(3)) and water feature use (39.09kWh/m(3)) than offsite produced desalinated potable water (55.68kWh/m(3) average). The next steps are to quantify the treated condensate water from the air cooling system for 12 months through the newly installed flow meters at the raw condensate water tanks to confirm the 2013 theoretical model and calculate yearly water energy consumption. To date (March 2017) 26 days of data have been recorded (February to March 2017) which align with the model by data extrapolation. This study will help understand how alternative water sources for outdoor use, impact on building systems energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, operation and maintenance cost and the environment. This study may be beneficial to local competent authorities for making and adjusting standards for energy and water conservation strategies in healthcare settings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

WILHELM; SPECIATION; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSIFICATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DISPERSAL; INFERENCE; ISLANDS; CLIMATE; RECORDS,"Islands and mountaintops are often considered evolutionary dead ends. Using whole genomic data of 18 bird species and demographic models, the authors show that populations become isolated at high elevations, but disjunct montane populations maintain gene flow and thus the capacity for further colonisation. Tropical mountains harbor exceptional concentrations of Earth's biodiversity. In topographically complex landscapes, montane species typically inhabit multiple mountainous regions, but are absent in intervening lowland environments. Here we report a comparative analysis of genome-wide DNA polymorphism data for population pairs from eighteen Indo-Pacific bird species from the Moluccan islands of Buru and Seram and from across the island of New Guinea. We test how barrier strength and relative elevational distribution predict population differentiation, rates of historical gene flow, and changes in effective population sizes through time. We find population differentiation to be consistently and positively correlated with barrier strength and a species' altitudinal floor. Additionally, we find that Pleistocene climate oscillations have had a dramatic influence on the demographics of all species but were most pronounced in regions of smaller geographic area. Surprisingly, even the most divergent taxon pairs at the highest elevations experience gene flow across barriers, implying that dispersal between montane regions is important for the formation of montane assemblages.","[Pujolar, Jose Martin; Reeve, Andrew Hart; Kennedy, Jonathan D.; Marki, Petter Zahl; Jonsson, Knud Andreas] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Pujolar, Jose Martin] DTU Aqua, Ctr Ocean Life, Bldg 202, Lyngby, Denmark; [Blom, Mozes P.

Unfortunately, our understanding of the global patterns of land use intensity is weak, partly because land use intensity is a complex, multidimensional term, and partly because we lack appropriate datasets to assess land use intensity across broad geographic extents. Here, we review the state of the art regarding approaches for mapping land use intensity and provide a comprehensive overview of available global-scale datasets on land use intensity. We also outline major challenges and opportunities for mapping land use intensityfor cropland, grazing, and forestry systems, and identify key issues for future research.","[Kuemmerle, Tobias; Mueller, Daniel; Estel, Stephan; Hostert, Patrick; Levers, Christian] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Kuemmerle, Tobias] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Erb, Karlheinz; Haberl, Helmut; Kastner, Thomas; Plutzar, Christoph] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Social Ecol Vienna SEC, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] FRS FNRS, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Earth & Climate Res Ctr, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Mueller, Daniel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Verburg, Peter H.; van der Zanden, Emma H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Global Change Inst, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jepsen, Martin R.; Reenberg, Anette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lindner, Marcus; Verkerk, Pieter Johannes] EFI, Sustainabil & Climate Change Programme, Joensuu 80100, Finland",Humboldt University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Klagenfurt; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Universite Catholique Louvain; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Copenhagen,"Kuemmerle, T (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",tobias.kuemmerle@geo.hu-berlin.de,"Reenberg, Anette/E-1476-2015; Kastner, Thomas/C-6346-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Plutzar, Christoph/J-6055-2015; Hostert, Patrick/Q-5792-2019; Haberl, Helmut/G-3679-2013; Mueller, Daniel/A-4454-2009; Erb, Karlheinz/F-1282-2016; Levers, Christian/L-9204-2013; Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Müller, Daniel/AAI-4867-2021; Jepsen, Martin R/J-4039-2012; Verburg, Peter h./A-8469-2010; Kuemmerle, Tobias/B-4340-2008; Meyfroidt, Patrick/G-7768-2012","Reenberg, Anette/0000-0003-2676-380X; Kastner, Thomas/0000-0002-8155-136X; Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; , IAMO/0000-0001-7922-9665; Plutzar, Christoph/0000-0003-2041-6399; Hostert, Patrick/0000-0002-5730-5484; Haberl, Helmut/0000-0003-2104-5446; Mueller, Daniel/0000-0001-8988-0718; Erb, Karlheinz/0000-0002-8335-4159; Levers, Christian/0000-0003-4810-9024; Müller, Daniel/0000-0001-8988-0718; Jepsen, Martin R/0000-0002-1107-7260; Verburg, Peter h./0000-0002-6977-7104; Kuemmerle, Tobias/0000-0002-9775-142X; Meyfroidt, Patrick/0000-0002-1047-9794; Verkerk, Pieter Johannes/0000-0001-5322-8007; Lindner, Marcus/0000-0002-0770-003X; van der Zanden, Emma/0000-0003-1687-5533","European Commission [VOLANTE FP7-ENV-2010-265104]; Global Land Project; Einstein Foundation, Berlin (Germany); Austrian Science Funds (FWF) [P20812-G11]","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Global Land Project; Einstein Foundation, Berlin (Germany); Austrian Science Funds (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","This research was partly funded by the European Commission (Integrated Project VOLANTE FP7-ENV-2010-265104) and the Global Land Project (www.globallandproiect.org) and we are grateful for this support.

Increasing resolution leads to resolving the 3D motion field and has been shown to improve the representation of clouds and precipitation. Using a hectometer-scale model in forecasting mode on a large domain therefore offers a chance to study processes that require the simulation of the 3D motion field at small horizontal scales, such as deep summertime moist convection, a notorious problem in NWP. We use the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic weather and climate model in large-eddy simulation mode (ICON-LEM) to simulate deep moist convection and distinguish between scattered, large-scale dynamically forced, and frontal convection. We use different ground- and satellite-based observational data sets, which supply information on ice water content and path, ice cloud cover, and cloud-top height on a similar scale as the simulations, in order to evaluate and constrain our model simulations. We find that the timing and geometric extent of the convectively generated cloud shield agree well with observations, while the lifetime of the convective anvil was, at least in one case, significantly overestimated. Given the large uncertainties of individual ice water path observations, we use a suite of observations in order to better constrain the simulations. ICON-LEM simulates a cloud ice water path that lies between the different observational data sets, but simulations appear to be biased towards a large frozen water path (all frozen hydrometeors). Modifications of parameters within the microphysical scheme have little effect on the bias in the frozen water path and the longevity of the anvil. In particular, one of our convective days appeared to be very sensitive to the initial and boundary conditions, which had a large impact on the convective triggering but little impact on the high frozen water path and long anvil lifetime bias. Based on this limited set of sensitivity experiments, the evolution of locally forced convection appears to depend more on the uncertainty of the large-scale dynamical state based on data assimilation than of microphysical parameters. Overall, we judge ICON-LEM simulations of deep moist convection to be very close to observations regarding the timing, geometrical structure, and cloud ice water path of the convective anvil, but other frozen hydrometeors, in particular graupel, are likely overestimated. Therefore, ICON-LEM supplies important information for weather forecasting and forms a good basis for parameterization development based on physical processes or machine learning.","[Rybka, Harald; Kohler, Martin; Seifert, Axel] German Meteorol Serv, Offenbach, Germany; [Burkhardt, Ulrike; Arka, Ioanna; Bugliaro, Luca; Strandgren, Johan] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Gorsdorf, Ulrich; Reichardt, Jens] German Meteorol Serv, Lindenberg, Germany; [Horvath, Akos] Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Meyer, Catrin I.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, Julich, Germany",Deutscher Wetterdienst; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Deutscher Wetterdienst; University of Hamburg; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Rybka, H (corresponding author), German Meteorol Serv, Offenbach, Germany.",harald.rybka@dwd.de,"Horvath, Akos/A-2453-2008; Meyer, Catrin I/B-7094-2013; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Horvath, Akos/0000-0002-5860-2368; Meyer, Catrin/0000-0002-9271-6174; Seifert, Axel/0000-0001-9760-3550; Rybka, Harald/0000-0003-2094-8010; Kohler, Martin/0000-0003-3386-1715","BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) [01LK1505A, 01LK1505B, 01LK1505D, 01LK1505F]; DLR project Klimarelevanz von atmospharischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken (KliSAW)","BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); DLR project Klimarelevanz von atmospharischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken (KliSAW)","This work is funded by the research program High Definition of Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction (HD(CP)2) of the BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) (grant nos. 01LK1505A, 01LK1505B, 01LK1505D, and 01LK1505F).

Although state-of-the-art NWP models have been shown to lack predictive skill with respect to subseasonal weekly TC occurrence, they may predict the environmental conditions sufficiently well to generate predictors for a statistical model. Therefore, an extensive predictor set was generated, including predictor groups representing the climatological seasonal cycle (CSC), oceanic, and tropical conditions, tropical wave modes, as well as extratropical influences, respectively. The developed hybrid forecast model is systematically validated for the Gulf of Mexico and central main development region (MDR) for lead times up to 5 weeks. Moreover, its performance is compared against a statistical approach trained on past data, as well as against different climatological and NWP benchmarks. For subseasonal lead times, the CSC models are found to outperform the NWP models, which quickly lose skill within the first two forecast weeks, even in case of recalibration. The statistical models trained on past data increase skill over the CSC models, whereas even greater improvements in skill are gained by the hybrid approach out to week 5. The vast majority of the additional subseasonal skill in the hybrid model, relative to the CSC model, could be attributed to the tropical (oceanic) conditions in the Gulf of Mexico (central MDR).","[Maier-Gerber, Michael; Fink, Andreas H.; Fischer, Christoph] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Riemer, Michael] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Schoemer, Elmar; Fischer, Christoph] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Comp Sci, Mainz, Germany; [Schulz, Benedikt] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Stochast, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Maier-Gerber, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",michael.maiergerber@kit.edu,"Fink, Andreas H./F-3024-2017","Fink, Andreas H./0000-0002-5840-2120",German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TRR 165],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The research leading to these results has been accomplished within projects C3 Predictability of tropical and hybrid cyclones over the North Atlantic Ocean'' and C5 Dynamical feature-based ensemble postprocessing of wind gusts within European winter storms'' of the Transregional Collaborative Research Center SFB/TRR 165 Waves to Weather'' funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG).

The observed differences are analyzed utilizing concurrent International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) estimates of cloudiness and other satellite observations. The results show that the NCEP-NCAR longwave cloud forcing agrees well with that of ERBE not only for the annual means but also for seasonal and climatic variations. Areas of disagreement are generally related to disagreements between NCEP-NCAR high cloudiness and observations. Overall, the NCEP-NCAR shortwave cloud forcing is in poorer agreement with ERBE observations. NCEP-NCAR annual means in the Tropics are often 20-30 W m(-2) too negative. On the other hand the NCEP-NCAR total cloud cover in this region is 10%-20% less than the ISCCP observations, which should lend to less, rather than more, negative shortwave cloud forcing. Thus the primary error in the mean shortwave cloud forcing is likely due to specification of clouds that are too reflective in the NCEP analysis model. Moderate errors in the variability of NCEP-NCAR SWCF are apparently related to errors in the analyzed seasonal variability of total cloudiness, which art: exacerbated by NCEP model specification of clouds that are too bright and underestimates of the seasonal variability of the clear-sky fluxes.",,,"Weare, BC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT LAND AIR & WATER RESOURCES,ATMOSPHER SCI PROGRAM,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,,29,29,30,1,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

However, it is challenging because PM2.5 travels long distances and most constituents are the result of complex chemical processes. We developed a reduced-form source-receptor model for estimating locations and magnitudes of downwind health costs from a source or, conversely, the upwind sources that contribute to health costs at a receptor location. Built upon outputs from a state-of-the-art air quality model, our model produces comprehensive risk-based source apportionment results with trivial computational costs. Using the model, we analyzed all the sources contributing to the inorganic PM2.5 health burden in 14 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States. Our analysis for 12 source categories shows that 80-90% of the burden borne by these areas originates from emissions sources outside of the area and that emissions sources up to 800 km away need to be included to account for 80% of the burden. Conversely, 60-80% of the impacts of an MSA's emissions occurs outside of that MSA. The results demonstrate the importance of regionally coordinated measures to improve air quality in metropolitan areas.","[Heo, Jinhyok; Gao, H.

This study investigates the impact of stochastic perturbation schemes based on three different subgrid-scale parameterizations in multidecadal ocean-only simulations with the ocean model NEMO at 18 resolution. The three parameterizations are an enhanced vertical diffusion scheme for unstable stratification, the Gent-McWilliams (GM) scheme, and a turbulent kinetic energy mixing scheme, all commonly used in state-of-the-art ocean models. The focus here is on changes in interannual variability caused by the comparatively high-frequency stochastic perturbations with subseasonal decorrelation time scales. These perturbations lead to significant improvements in the representation of low-frequency variability in the ocean, with the stochastic GM scheme showing the strongest impact. Interannual variability of the Southern Ocean eddy and Eulerian streamfunctions is increased by an order of magnitude and by 20%, respectively. Interannual sea surface height variability is increased by about 20%-25% as well, especially in the Southern Ocean and in the Kuroshio region, consistent with a strong underestimation of interannual variability in the model when compared to reanalysis and altimetry observations. These results suggest that enhancing subgrid-scale variability in ocean models can improve model variability and potentially its response to forcing on much longer time scales, while also providing an estimate of model uncertainty.","[Juricke, Stephan; Palmer, Tim N.; Zanna, Laure] Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Dept Phys, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Juricke, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Dept Phys, Oxford, England.",stephan.juricke@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Zanna, Laure/L-3169-2019","Zanna, Laure/0000-0002-8472-4828; Juricke, Stephan/0000-0003-4614-2509","UK NERC [NE/K013548/1, NE/J00586X/1]; European Research Council [PESM 291406]; NERC [NE/K013548/1, NE/J00586X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J00586X/1, NE/K013548/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the UK NERC Grants NE/K013548/1 and NE/J00586X/1.

A new method (the TIP method) for cloud shadow detection in multi-spectral satellite images is presented and compared to current methods. The TIP method is based on the evaluation of thresholds, indices and projections. Most state-of-the-art methods solemnly rely on one of these evaluation steps or on a complex working mechanism. Instead, the new method incorporates three basic evaluation steps into one algorithm for easy and accurate cloud shadow detection. Furthermore the performance of the masking algorithms provided by the software packages ATCOR (Atmospheric Correction) and PACO (Python-based Atmospheric Correction) is compared with that of the newly implemented TIP method on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe, covering a wide variety of environments and climates. The algorithms incorporated in each piece of masking software use the class of cloud shadows, but they employ different rules and class-specific thresholds. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or truth. The overall accuracies for the class cloud shadows of ATCOR and PACO (including TIP) for difference areas of the selected scenes are 70.4% and 76.6% respectively. The difference area encompasses the parts of the classification image where the classification maps disagree. User and producer accuracies for the class cloud shadow are strongly scene-dependent, typically varying between 45% and 95%. The experimental results show that the proposed TIP method based on thresholds, indices and projections can obtain improved cloud shadow detection performance.","[Zekoll, Viktoria; de los Reyes, Raquel; Richter, Rudolf] German Aerosp Ctr, DLR, D-82234 Wessling, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Zekoll, V (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr, DLR, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.",viktoria.zekoll@dlr.de; raquel.delosreyes@dlr.de; rudolf.richter@dlr.de,,"Richter, Rudolf/0000-0002-8499-4780; de los Reyes Lopez, Raquel/0000-0003-0485-9552; Zekoll, Viktoria/0000-0002-8329-8564",,,,,42,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUN,2022,12,,,,,,2922,10.3390/rs14122922,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14122922,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,2K6TB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000816464500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These phenomena often bring along rocks, debris, and heavy materials that can extensively damage and destroy the landscape and infrastructures, causing devastating economic loss, and often, human casualties. The risk of future disasters continues to escalate with the increase of real estate development in suburban areas, including mountainous regions. Further assessment and prediction on such disasters and their countermeasures are, therefore, in high economic demands. One of the most intuitive ways is to install protective structures in mountain slopes and valleys that can hold the materials brought by the moving landslides. While the current state of the art of landslide prediction using numerical methods has been mainly dominated by the development of advanced geomechanical models suited for different types of soil materials, e.g. multi-phase unsaturated soil model, this study focuses more on the interaction of such phenomena with the installed protective structures. Here, an implicit formulation of material point method (MPM) is implemented to model the landslides considering finite strain assumption. Furthermore, a staggered coupling scheme with traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) is proposed to simulate accurately and robustly the dynamic force and displacement coupling of soil-structure interaction (SSI). All developments of the method are implemented within the Kratos-Multiphysics framework [1] and available under the BSD license (https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki). In the future works, more adequate consideration of coupling scheme and material models considering damage and fracture will be investigated before conducting a real-scale landslide simulation.","[Chandra, Bodhinanda; Bucher, Philipp; Wuechner, Roland] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Struct Anal, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Larese, Antonia] Univ Padua, Dept Math Tullio Levi Civita, Via Trieste 63, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Larese, Antonia] Int Ctr Numer Methods Engn CIMNE, Campus Nord UPC,C Gran Capita S-N, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Technical University of Munich; University of Padua; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Centre Internacional de Metodes Numerics en Enginyeria (CIMNE),"Chandra, B (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Struct Anal, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",bodhinanda.chandra@tum.de; philipp.bucher@tum.de; wuechner@tum.de; info.statik@tum.de,"Almeida, Andre Q./L-9113-2016; Larese, Antonia/M-5529-2013","Almeida, Andre Q./0000-0002-5063-1762; Larese, Antonia/0000-0002-7284-3926",Kratos Multiphysics group by CIMNE; MIUR; project PRECISE [BIA2017-83805-R]; MINECO [RTC-2016-4967-5],"Kratos Multiphysics group by CIMNE; MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); project PRECISE; MINECO(Spanish Government)",The research work was supported by the Kratos Multiphysics group by CIMNE and the Chair of Structural Analysis led by Prof. K.U.

WEST is based on a statistical-dynamical downscaling approach, i. e. (i) a statistical analysis of climate data to determine the basic atmospheric states, and (ii) a dynamic adaptation of each basic state to high-resolution terrain and surface roughness by using mesoscale and microscale models. The approach has already been used by Frank and Landberg (1997), in their KAMM/WAsP method, to create a numerical wind atlas. The novel part of WEST is the fixed wind-speed interval in classification scheme and the integration of different modules (meso-/micro-scale models and statistical module) into a single toolkit in a more portable form. WEST was built for use by industries not having sophisticated computer facilities. WEST is applied to the Gaspe region of Canada. The mesoscale model MC2 (operated within WEST) is run at 5 km resolution, while the microscale model within WEST is at 200 m resolution. The simulation results are evaluated in comparison with tower observations at a height of 40 m above ground level. The mean of the 29 observed sets of wind data is 6.6 m/s. The mean absolute difference between the observed and simulated sets of wind data is 0.83 m/s with MC2 (meso-component of WEST) and 0.69 with ` full WEST' (with both meso-and micro-components). The correlation coefficient of the mean windspeeds between the simulations and observations for the 29 stations is improved from 0.5 with MC2 to 0.7 with WEST.","[Yu, Wei; Benoit, Robert; Girard, Claude; Glazer, Anna; Lemarquis, David] RPN, MRB, Environm Canada, 2121 TransCanada Highway, 500, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada; [Salmon, James] Zephyr North, Burlington, ON L7M 4B9, Canada; [Pinard, Jean-Paul] JP Pinard Consulting, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2P6, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Yu, W (corresponding author), RPN, MRB, Environm Canada, 2121 TransCanada Highway, 500, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada.",Wei.Yu@ec.gc.ca,,,Panel for Energy Research and Development (PERD) funds,Panel for Energy Research and Development (PERD) funds,This Research project was initiated and supported by Panel for Energy Research and Development (PERD) funds.

Density functional theory calculation in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that S-doping decreases the electron density near the Fermi level to reduce the metallic nature of Co2P. Thus, a more positive charge is induced onto Co to balance between hydride (Co delta+ H delta-) and proton (S/P delta- H delta+) acceptors. As a result, it increases the number of active Co2+ sites as well as the turnover frequency of a single site. The hybrid electrodes obtained by loading S:Co2P nanoparticles on N-doped carbon cloth or nickel foam (NF) exhibit an outstanding activity and stability of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline electrolytes outperforming conventional, precious metal-based Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts, and most of the other state-of-the-art nonprecious metal electrocatalysts reported so far. An alkaline electrolyzer with S:Co2P@NF as both cathode and anode produces a stable current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at 1.782 V, which is superior to the IrO2 - Pt/C electrolyzer (1.823 V).","[Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza; Bhatt, Mahesh Datt; Lee, Min Hee; Lee, Jae Sung] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza] Pakistan Inst Nucl Sci & Technol PINSTECH, Directorate Sci, Div Chem, PO Nilore, Islamabad 45650, Pakistan",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology,"Lee, JS (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",jlee1234@unist.ac.kr,"Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza/N-5398-2016; Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza/N-6441-2015","Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza/0000-0002-6995-6428; Lee, Jae Sung/0000-0001-6432-9073","Climate Change Response Project [2015M1A2A2074663]; Korea Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (KCAP) [2009-0093880]; Korea-China Key Joint Research Program - Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea [2017K2A9A2A11070341]; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea [10050509, KIAT N0001754];  [NRF-2018R1A2A1A05077909]","Climate Change Response Project; Korea Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (KCAP); Korea-China Key Joint Research Program - Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea; ","This research was supported by a Basic Science Grant (NRF-2018R1A2A1A05077909), the Climate Change Response Project (2015M1A2A2074663), Korea Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (KCAP, no. 2009-0093880), and Korea-China Key Joint Research Program (2017K2A9A2A11070341), which are funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea; and Project nos. 10050509 and KIAT N0001754 of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea.",,44,52,52,14,110,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0897-4756,1520-5002,,CHEM MATER,Chem.

Sustaining fresh water-dependent agriculture in such areas will entail an increased demand for fresh water flushing. Unfortu-nately, the flushing of surface water is not operationally optimised and results in excessive use of scarce fresh-water. To meet the increased demand for flushing, while minimizing the need for diverted freshwater, new operational designs are required. This paper presents a novel network model based approach that uses De Saint Venant (SV) and Advection Dispersion (AD) equations to optimize multiple objectives on water level and salinity control using a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The resulting NMPC problem is solved with a receding horizon implementation, where the nonlinear program (NLP) at each iteration is solved using state-of -the-art large scale interior point solver (IPOPT). We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it to the traditional fixed flushing for a representative Dutch polder. Firstly, the approach is shown to be capable of controlling the water level and salinity level in the polder. Secondly, the results highlight that the network of canals, which were originally made for drainage, could not be made sufficiently fresh with current intake capacity. A simple design approach was used to identify appropriate new capacities for two of the gates that allow optimal flushing to guarantee the required water level and salinity constraints.","[Aydin, Boran Ekin; van de Giesen, Nick; Abraham, Edo] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Water Management, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Aydin, Boran Ekin] Nelen & Schuurmans, Operat Water Management, NL-3511 AE Utrecht, Netherlands; [Essink, Gualbert H.

The first pragmatic approach consists of sampling the initial condition uncertainty and assess the predictability through the divergence of this ensemble in time. The second approach is provided by a theoretical framework to determine error growth by estimating optimal linear growing modes. In this paper, it is shown that under the assumption of linearized dynamics and normal distributions of the uncertainty, the exact quantitative spread of ensemble can be determined from the theoretical framework. This spread is at least an order of magnitude less expensive to compute than the approximate solution given by the pragmatic approach. This result is applied to a state-of-the-art Ocean General Circulation Model to assess the predictability in the North Atlantic of four typical oceanic metrics: the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the intensity of its heat transport, the two-dimensional spatially-averaged Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the North Atlantic, and the three-dimensional spatially-averaged temperature in the North Atlantic. For all tested metrics, except for SST, 75% of the total uncertainty on interannual time scales can be attributed to oceanic initial condition uncertainty rather than atmospheric stochastic forcing. The theoretical method also provide the sensitivity pattern to the initial condition uncertainty, allowing for targeted measurements to improve the skill of the prediction.

Here, we explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of representation learning: we propose to learn a joint embedding of multiple satellite sensors within a deep neural network. Our application problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the temporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Suomi-NPP visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS). The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains and between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the sensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a late fusion that is learned in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has separate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single latent embedding, i.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs, such that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of which sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice at a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit lake ice maps with pixelwise accuracies >91% [respectively, mean per-class Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores >60%] and generalizes well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it sets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off dates for the target lakes, in many cases meeting the GCOS requirement.","[Tom, Manu; Jiang, Yuchang; Baltsavias, Emmanuel; Schindler, Konrad] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tom, Manu] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Remote Sensing Grp, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Tom, Manu] Univ Zurich, Chair Glaciol & Geomorphodynam, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Zurich,"Tom, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",manu.tom@eawag.ch; yujiang@student.ethz.ch; emmanuel.baltsavias@geod.baug.ethz.ch; konrad.schindler@geod.baug.ethz.ch,"Tom, Manu/ABV-9231-2022","Tom, Manu/0000-0002-0352-7153",,,,,58,0,0,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

Consequently, many countries are imposing strict environmental regulations due to increasing concern on the climate change, and a significant amount of research is being conducted to tackle this problem. Carbon capture and sequestration are one of the major methods, which can remarkably contribute to this issue since a major greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere is carbon dioxide (CO2). The general objective of this work was to investigate the significance of potential use of aqueous salt solutions for capturing CO2 by developing an accurate model for estimation of this phenomenon. In particular, 608 experimental data of CO2 solubility in aqueous solutions of salts as a function of temperature, pressure, salt solution concentration (molality), hydrogen bond acceptor count of salts, molecular weight of salts, and complexity value of the salts were collected from the literature. Four state-of-the-art computational methods (LSSVM, ANN, PSO-ANFIS and GA-ANFIS) were employed to examine their predictive capability for the problem. The results reveal that the LSSVM offers the highest accuracy with R-2 = 0.9927 and %AARD = 537. Although the neural network and fuzzy interface systems are more complex approaches, the superiority of the LSSVM method for the problem under study demonstrates the easy nature of this phenomenon. Thus, the LSSVM model is recommended for estimating the CO2 solubility in aqueous salt solutions because not only it has more accuracy, but also it is easy to apply, has less mathematically complicated and less time-consuming.

SO2 is a permanent and abundant component of air pollution and, although it does not have an immediate visual effect, after continuous exposure, it can cause irreversible damage to building materials. Marble is one of the most commonly used ornamental stones in historical monuments and its mineralogical composition makes it very susceptible to damage caused by exposure to SO2. To measure the chemical reactions caused on marble by the action of atmosphere rich in SO2, selected calcitic and dolomitic samples were altered by weathering accelerated test. For this, seven marble types (four calcitic and three dolomitic) were exposed to high concentration of sulphur dioxide for 24 h in a climate chamber under controlled temperature and humidity conditions (20 A degrees C and > 90 % HR). Changes on marble surfaces caused by reactions of SO2 with calcite and dolomite were studied using two non-destructive techniques: chromatic change by means of colorimetry and chemical analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The development of new mineral phases was also observed by scanning electron microscopy. Colorimetric analysis revealed a decrease in lightness and chromatic parameters suggesting that these changes were due to the development of new mineral phases in all marbles. The XPS technique, which is generally used in the analysis of metals, is relatively new in the field of stone deterioration. It enabled us to recognise the development of sulphites and sulphates on marble surfaces with high precision, after just 24 h of exposure to high SO2 concentrations and to distinguish different decay paths for calcitic and dolomitic marbles.","[Luque, A.; Cultrone, G.; Sebastian, E.] Univ Granada, Fac Sci, Dept Mineral & Petr, Granada 18002, Spain; [Martinez de Yuso, M.

Data retrieved from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument show positive f(c)-tau relationships across most of the globe. A global mean f(c) increase of approximately 0.2 between low and high tau conditions is found for both ocean and land. However, these relationships are not necessarily due to cloud-aerosol interactions. Using state-of-the-art Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) reanalysis-forecast tau data, which should be less affected by retrieval artefacts, it is demonstrated that a large part of the observed f(c)-tau signal may be due to cloud contamination of satellite-retrieved tau. For longer MACC forecast time steps of 24 h, which likely contain less cloud contamination, some negative f(c)-tau relationships are found. The global mean f(c) increase between low and high tau conditions is reduced to 0.1, suggesting that cloud contamination may account for approximately one half of the satellite-retrieved increase in f(c). ECHAM5-HAM general circulation model (GCM) simulations further demonstrate that positive f(c)-tau relationships may arise due to covariation with relative humidity. Widespread negative simulated f(c)-tau relationships in the tropics are shown to arise due to scavenging of aerosol by convective precipitation. Wet scavenging events are likely poorly sampled in satellite-retrieved data, because the properties of aerosol below clouds cannot be retrieved. Quantifying the role of wet scavenging, and assessing GCM representations of this important process, remains a challenge for future observational studies of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions.","[Grandey, B.

The Tunable Optical Profiler for Aerosol and Ozone (TOPAZ) lidar was deployed aboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft during the Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS 2006) and the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex 2010) field campaigns. TOPAZ is capable of measuring ozone concentrations in the lower troposphere with uncertainties of several parts per billion by volume at 90-m vertical and 600-m horizontal resolution from an aircraft flying at 60 m s(-1). The system also provides uncalibrated aerosol backscatter profiles at 18-m vertical and 600-m horizontal resolution. TOPAZ incorporates state-of-the-art technologies, including a cerium-doped lithium calcium aluminum fluoride (Ce:LiCAF) laser, to make it compact and lightweight with low power consumption. The tunable, three-wavelength UV laser source makes it possible to optimize the wavelengths for differing atmospheric conditions, reduce the interference from other atmospheric constituents, and implement advanced analysis techniques. This paper describes the TOPAZ lidar, its components and performance during testing and field operation, and the data analysis procedure, including a discussion of error sources. The performance characteristics are illustrated through a comparison between TOPAZ and an ozonesonde launched during the TexAQS 2006 field campaign. A more comprehensive set of comparisons with in situ measurements during TexAQS 2006 and an assessment of the TOPAZ accuracy and precision are presented in a companion paper.","[Alvarez, R.

A review of the literature and discussions with experts revealed that several approaches for an Integrated Design Process for energy efficient buildings exist. However, most of these approaches are relatively abstract and philosophical in nature, and do not prescribe procedures that enable energy efficient design. This paper attempts to address this gap by proposing a comprehensive design process titled the 'Integrated Energy-Efficient Building Design Process' (IEBDP). This process provides a framework based on systems theory that facilitates the integration of various facets of the energy-efficient alternatives selection process. In addition, the proposed framework seeks to integrate state-of-the-art analysis tools and methods, to aid designers in performing holistic building design. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-attribute decision-making technique is used to resolve conflicts amongst diverging design goals. The proposed IEBDP framework was then used to design an office building, taken as a case study, in the composite climate of New Delhi, India. It was found that considerable energy savings could be achieved by following the IEBDP process. The benefits of this framework vis-a-vis traditional energy efficient design approaches were evaluated by comparing the design done through the IEBDP process with designs submitted by a group of practicing architects.

Constraints in costs and lands make it prohibitive to increase the height of the existing dyke system in the Red River Delta. These constraints call for new, non-struclural methods to reduce the severity and magnitude of floods, using the special physical conditions of the River Basin One such method is the use of karst caves in limestone areas to cope with extreme flood events by storing excess flood waters and gradually releasing the waters into ground water aquifers in a controlled and calculated manner. This paper examines the proposed new flood control measures to use groundwater flood retention of the extensive pervious karstic limestone formation in the study area. In order to support this new concept of fighting against extreme floods, known as flood karst method, hydraulic modeling is extensively used to study possible options for different flood scenarios to identify decision-making. These options are derived front the studies on how best to combine the use storage of existing and potential surface water storage and underground retention facilities to cope with excess storm waters of extreme flood events. Finally, on the basis of the simulation of possible contributions by the facilities available, namely the Hoa Binh Reservoir, the Karst caves, the flood diversion works and proposed emergency spilways, a set of operation procedures was recommended for adoption to minimize impacts of extreme flood events.","[Kumar, Tripathi Nitin] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Engn & Technol, Remote Sensing & GIS, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Marshall, Silver L.] Cent Comm Flood Control & Storm Management Viet N, Hanoi, Vietnam",Asian Institute of Technology,"Kumar, TN (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Sch Engn & Technol, Remote Sensing & GIS, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand.",nitingis@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,5,DISASTER ADVANCES,INDORE,"SECTOR AG-80, SCHEME NO 54, VIJAY NAGAR, A B RD, INDORE, 452010, INDIA",0974-262X,2278-4543,,DISASTER ADV,Disaster Adv.,OCT,2009,4,,,,5,14,,,,,,10,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,512ED,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000271225700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The wind stress, which forces the wave model, depends in the coupled model on the stage of development of the wave field. As the waves depend on the local and instantaneous wind as well as the earlier wind elsewhere, nonlocal and memory effects are thus introduced in the momentum flux parameterization. It is examined how strong these effects are compared to the local and instantaneous wind contribution. A second variable considered is the energy flux from the atmosphere to the wave field, which can be determined diagnostically from the wave model. Almost all of the momentum and energy passed to the wave field is lost quasi-instantaneously and locally to the ocean, whereas only a small fraction remains in the local wave field or propagates away. The momentum and energy contained in the wave field are determined by the small difference between input and dissipation. This small difference depends strongly on the memory of the wave field. Wave propagation also influences the local balance. The case for the fluxes is different. A memory effect is only visible in the momentum flux for storms that last relatively long. In general, the typical time scale of wind changes is smaller than that of wave evolution. Nonlocal effects can be neglected in both the momentum flux and the energy flux. These results indicate that, at the present state of the art in wave and climate modeling, the wave effect on the air-sea fluxes can be described adequately in (coupled) atmosphere-ocean GCMs by the local and instantaneous wind.",,,"WEBER, SL (corresponding author), ROYAL NETHERLANDS METEOROL INST, POB 201, 3730 AE DE BILT, NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,,23,12,16,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-3670,1520-0485,,J PHYS OCEANOGR,J.

Improving the resilience of cities is a critical need for the international community and especially for territories exposed to multiple risks, such as Chile. Although disasters are always tragic, the recovery and reconstruction post-disaster may provide a unique opportunity to prevent future suffering, enhancing the resilience of local communities. This paper presents the analysis of two Chilean reconstruction programmes applied in Mehuin and Dichato, after the earthquake and tsunami of 22 May 1960 and 27 February 2010, respectively. In both cases, reconstruction programmes were supported by the Chilean Government, but using different approaches: one focused on providing housing for people injured in the earthquake, while the other also included urban amenities and services. This article proposes an urban morphology analysis framework; in addition, it presents the assessment of the two case studies before and after a disaster, thus evaluating their resilience. By comparing urban morphology resilience pre- and post-disaster, a discussion about the effectiveness of two reconstruction approaches is presented. Finally, conclusions and recommendations to better integrate resilience into urban planning are proposed, with the aim of opening the discussion about how to make cities more resilient to natural disasters.","[Tumini, Irina] Bio Bio Univ, Dept Planning & Urban Design, Avda Collao 1202,Casilla 5-C, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Villagra-Islas, Paula] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Environm Sci & Evolut, Lab Landscape & Urban Resilience, Edificio Emilio Pugin,Of 326,Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Herrmann-Lunecke, Geraldine] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Architecture Art & Design, Manuel Rodriguez Sur 415, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Austral de Chile,"Tumini, I (corresponding author), Bio Bio Univ, Dept Planning & Urban Design, Avda Collao 1202,Casilla 5-C, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.",irina.tumini@gmail.com; paula.villagra@uach.cl; geraldine.herrmann@udp.cl,"Tumini, Irina/AAB-6380-2019; Villagra, Paula A/J-3632-2014","Tumini, Irina/0000-0001-8306-5384; Villagra, Paula A/0000-0001-6428-3933",CONICYT Program-Fondecyt [N.1150137];  [I-2014-11];  [PEF-2014-01],CONICYT Program-Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); ; ,The paper has been developed partially using the results obtained in the I-2014-11 and PEF-2014-01 and CONICYT Program-Fondecyt N.1150137 research projects.,,57,19,20,4,104,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

These influences occur through feedbacks of differing strength and importance with co-evolution representing the tightest coupling between biological and geomorphological systems. The ongoing failure to incorporate these dynamic bio-physical interactions with human activity in landscape studies limits our ability to predict the response of landscapes to human disturbance and climate change. This limitation is a direct result of the poor communication between the ecological and geomorphological communities and consequent paucity of interdisciplinary research. Recognition of this failure led to the organization of the Meeting of Young Researchers in Earth Science (MYRES) III, titled 'Dynamic Interactions of Life and its Landscape'. This paper synthesizes and expands upon key issues and findings from that meeting, to help chart a course for future collaboration among Earth surface scientists and ecologists: it represents the consensus view of a competitively selected group of 77 early-career researchers. Two broad themes that serve to focus and motivate future research are identified: (1) co-evolution of landforms and biological communities; and (2) humans as modifiers of the landscape (through direct and indirect actions). Also outlined are the state of the art in analytical, experimental and modelling techniques in ecological and geomorphological research, and novel new research avenues that combine these techniques are suggested. It is hoped that this paper will serve as an interdisciplinary reference for geomorphologists and ecologists looking to learn more about the other field.

The ability of single-column model (SCM) versions of a number of state-of-the-art climate and numerical weather prediction models to capture these convective processes is also evaluated. During the suppressed periods, the CRMs are found to simulate a maximum moistening around 3 km, which is associated with a predominance of shallow convection. All SCMs produce adequate amounts of shallow convection during the suppressed periods, comparable to that seen in CRMs, but the relatively drier SCMs have higher precipitation rates than the relatively wetter SCMs and CRMs. The relatively drier SCMs dry, rather than moisten, the lower troposphere below the melting level. During the transition periods, convective processes act to moisten the atmosphere above the level at which mean advection changes from moistening to drying, despite an overall drying effect for the column. The SCMs capture some essence of this moistening at upper levels. A gradual transition from shallow to deep convection is simulated by the CRMs and the wetter SCMs during the transition periods, but the onset of deep convection is delayed in the drier SCMs. This results in lower precipitation rates for these SCMs during the active periods, although much better agreement exists between the models at this time.

However, the traditional handcrafted methods cannot quickly provide quantitative, objective and reliable extraction of information from radargrams. Most traditional handcrafted methods, designed to detect ice-surface and ice-bed layers from ice sheet radargrams, require complex human involvement and are difficult to apply to large datasets, while deep learning methods can obtain better results in a generalized way. In this study, an end-to-end multi-scale attention network (MsANet) is proposed to realize the estimation and reconstruction of layers in sequences of ice sheet radar tomographic images. First, we use an improved 3D convolutional network, C3D-M, whose first full connection layer is replaced by a convolution unit to better maintain the spatial relativity of ice layer features, as the backbone. Then, an adjustable multi-scale module uses different scale filters to learn scale information to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network. Finally, an attention module extended to 3D space removes a redundant bottleneck unit to better fuse and refine ice layer features. Radar sequential images collected by the Center of Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets in 2014 are used as training and testing data. Compared with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, the MsANet shows a 10% reduction (2.14 pixels) on the measurement of average mean absolute column-wise error for detecting the ice-surface and ice-bottom layers, runs faster and uses approximately 12 million fewer parameters.","[Cai, Yiheng; Liu, Dan; Xie, Jin; Yang, Jingxian; Lang, Shinan] Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xiangbin] Polar Res Inst China, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology; Polar Research Institute of China,"Lang, SN (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.",caiyiheng@bjut.edu.cn; liu_dan.bjut.edu@emails.bjut.edu.cn; xiejin@emails.bjut.edu.cn; yangjx@bjut.edu.cn; cuixiangbin@pric.org.cn; langshinan@bjut.edu.cn,,"Cui, Xiangbin/0000-0002-4269-8086; Lang, Shinan/0000-0003-3909-7316; Cai, Yiheng/0000-0002-5859-5858",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1703302]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41776186],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no.2017YFC1703302) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41776186).,,39,1,1,3,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUN,2021,12,,,,,,2425,10.3390/rs13122425,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13122425,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,SZ1UO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000666359400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The key observation is the biased inter-satellite range, which is measured primarily by a K-Band Ranging system (KBR) in GRACE and GRACE Follow-On. The GRACE Follow-On satellites are additionally equipped with a Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI), which provides measurements with lower noise compared to the KBR. The biased range of KBR and LRI needs to be converted for gravity field recovery into an instantaneous range, i.e. the biased Euclidean distance between the satellites' center-of-mass at the same time. One contributor to the difference between measured and instantaneous range arises due to the nonzero travel time of electro-magnetic waves between the spacecraft. We revisit the calculation of the light time correction (LTC) from first principles considering general relativistic effects and state-of-the-art models of Earth's potential field. The novel analytical expressions for the LTC of KBR and LRI can circumvent numerical limitations of the classical approach. The dependency of the LTC on geopotential models and on the parameterization is studied, and afterwards the results are compared against the LTC provided in the official datasets of GRACE and GRACE Follow-On. It is shown that the new approach has a significantly lower noise, well below the instrument noise of current instruments, especially relevant for the LRI, and even if used with kinematic orbit products. This allows calculating the LTC accurate enough even for the next generation of gravimetric missions.","[Yan, Yihao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Yan, Yihao; Zhong, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, APM, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China; [Mueller, Vitali; Heinzel, Gerhard] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Gravitat Phys, Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, Albert Einstein Inst, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Zhong, Min] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China","Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geodesy & Geophysics, CAS; Leibniz University Hannover; Max Planck Society; Sun Yat Sen University","Yan, YH (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Yan, YH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, APM, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China.;Muller, V (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Gravitat Phys, Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, Albert Einstein Inst, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",yihaoyan@hust.edu.cn; vitali.mueller@aei.mpg.de,,"Heinzel, Gerhard/0000-0003-1661-7868; Muller, Vitali/0000-0002-2339-1353","China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41704013]; Max-Planck-Society; Chinese Academy of Sciences [M.IF.A.QOP18098]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC-2123, 390837967]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Max-Planck-Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Yihao Yan acknowledges the China Scholarship Council for scholarship support and expresses his gratitude to the GRACE-Follow-On LRI group members at the Albert-Einstein-Institute in Hannover, Germany.

During central Pacific events, the CO(2)flux anomaly can vary up to fourfold between events (2002/2003 vs. 2015/2016), but it always recedes during the boreal winter to spring transition and the poleward transport of the anomaly mostly extends into the Northern Hemisphere. During eastern Pacific events characterized by an equatorially centered intertropical convergence zone (e.g., 1997/1998), the intense CO(2)flux anomaly persists into boreal summer and can extend further into the Southern Hemisphere. The hemispheric asymmetry (northward vs. southward extension) and the termination (boreal winter/spring for central Pacific events vs. boreal summer for eastern Pacific events) of the ocean CO(2)response are tied to the El Nino dynamics in the near-equatorial region and also how it is amplified by poleward Ekman transport. Finally, we evaluate how differences in the ocean response influence atmospheric CO(2)and discuss the potential of atmospheric CO(2)satellite data to provide observational constraints.","[Liao, Enhui; Resplandy, Laure] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Liu, Junjie; Bowman, Kevin W.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",Princeton University; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Resplandy, L (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",laurer@princeton.edu,"Bowman, Kevin/L-8786-2019; OCO, OCO/GVS-4314-2022; Liu, Junjie/F-5739-2017","Bowman, Kevin/0000-0002-8659-1117; Liu, Junjie/0000-0002-7184-6594; Resplandy, Laure/0000-0002-1212-3943; Liao, Enhui/0000-0002-5516-7831",NASA OCO-2 Science Team Grant [80NSSC18K0893]; NASA CMS-Flux [NNH16ZDA001N-CMS],NASA OCO-2 Science Team Grant; NASA CMS-Flux,"Part of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

However, there is no systematic and in-depth analysis on this topic in the academia. In this study, a state-of-the-art review on novel PCMs based strategies to reduce cooling load of buildings has been presented. The investigated strategies include the structural configuration, systematic control and the multi-criteria for assessment. The roles of ventilations, radiative cooling and the underlying heat transfer mechanism have been characterized for the in-depth understanding. In order to realise the multivariable optimal design and robust operations under multi-level scenario uncertainties, parametric and uncertainty analysis, single- and multi-objective optimisations have been comprehensively reviewed, together with technical challenges for each solution. Research results show that, integrated passive and active systems with flexible transitions on operating modes are full of prospects for the multi-criteria performance improvement. Trade-off solutions along the multi-objective Pareto frontier are multi-diversified, dependent on the adopted approach and the studied scenario. Furthermore, machine learning methods are promising for the thermal and energy performances improvement, through the surrogate model development, the model predictive control and the optimisation function. Future studies and prospects have been demonstrated as avenues for future research. This study presents a systematic overview on novel PCMs based strategies, together with the application of machine-learning methods for cooling performance enhancement, which are critical for the promotion of novel PCMs based cooling strategies in buildings.","[Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqian] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Collaborat Bldg Safety & Environ, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; Hunan University,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, SQ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuekuan.zhou@connect.polyu.hk; candyz129@sina.com,"Zhou, Yuekuan/ABE-4194-2020",,Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan university,Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); Hunan university,"This research is supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, City University of Hong Kong and Hunan university.",,102,34,35,16,84,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Its impact on the environment is heavily debated, particularly in relation to climate forcing attributed to emissions at cruising altitudes and the noise and the deterioration of air quality at ground-level due to airport operations. This latter environmental issue is of particular interest to the scientific community and policymakers, especially in relation to the breach of limit and target values for many air pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, near the busiest airports and the resulting consequences for public health. Despite the increased attention given to aircraft emissions at ground-level and air pollution in the vicinity of airports, many research gaps remain. Sources relevant to air quality include not only engine exhaust and non-exhaust emissions from aircraft, but also emissions from the units providing power to the aircraft on the ground, the traffic due to the airport ground service, maintenance work, heating facilities, fugitive vapours from refuelling operations, kitchens and restaurants for passengers and operators, intermodal transportation systems, and road traffic for transporting people and goods in and out to the airport. Many of these sources have received inadequate attention, despite their high potential for impact on air quality. This review aims to summarise the state-of-the-art research on aircraft and airport emissions and attempts to synthesise the results of studies that have addressed this issue. It also aims to describe the key characteristics of pollution, the impacts upon global and local air quality and to address the future potential of research by highlighting research needs.

The purpose of the study is to determine the nature and extent of interest in children's books in the formative period of the ''golden age of children's literature.'' Which periodicals covered children's books, and how did their cultural discourse, as revealed through reviewing and commentary, shape the norms and assumptions by which children's books were created and evaluated? Seventy-five literary periodicals were studied for their coverage of children's books in this period. The literary periodicals are drawn from Poole's Index, Nineteenth-Century Readers' Guide, and Wellesley Index. Using reception theory, a branch of reader-response criticism, I construct the contemporary context in which children's books were received-expressed as ''horizons of expectations.'' A spectrum of cultural discourse included the following horizons: the treatment of children's books as a commodity; the elevation of children's books as works of art; an emphasis on illustration and pictorial effects in literature; a lack of rigid demarcation between adult and children's literature; a growing gender division; a diversification of the didactic tradition; a continuing debate on fantasy and realism; the romantic idealization of childhood and its literature; attention to the historiography of children's literature; and anxiety about the changing character of children's reading. While these concerns informed the larger history of children's literature, they converged in late Victorian England and America to create a unique climate for the reception of children's books as a body of literature, a field of study, and a form of expressive culture.",,,"LUNDIN, AH (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,SCH LIB & INFORMAT STUDIES,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,,,,,,95,10,10,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0024-2519,,,LIBR QUART,Libr.

The model composite shows that the overall spatial pattern of summer monsoon rainfall is similar to the observed, although the western Pacific rainfall is relatively weak. For the simulated precipitation over the western Pacific, the models can be classified into two categories. The first category of models simulates the precipitation more confined to the equatorial region and weaker precipitation in the subtropical western Pacific compared to the observed. The second category of models simulates large precipitation in the subtropical western Pacific but the region is shifted to the north by 5-10degrees. None of the models realistically reproduce the observed Mei-yu rain band in the region from the East China Sea to the mid Pacific. Most of the models produce a rain band along the continental side of East Asia. The climatological variations of simulated summer rainfall are examined in terms of their amplitude and their principal EOF modes. All models simulate larger amplitudes of the climatological seasonal variation of Indian summer monsoon than the observed, though most models simulate smaller amplitudes in the western Pacific. The ten model composite produces four leading EOF modes over the Asian-western Pacific region, which are remarkably similar to the observed counterparts. The first and second eigenmodes, respectively, represent the smoothed seasonal march of broad-scale monsoon and the onsets of the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon. The third and fourth modes relate to the climatological intraseasonal oscillation (CISO). In contrast to the model composite, several models fail to reproduce the first principal mode, and most models do riot reproduce the observed modes higher than the second. The CISO of precipitation is also examined over the Indian monsoon and the East Asia-western Pacific monsoon regions separately.","Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Climate & Radiat Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Inst Global Environm & Soc Inc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Data Adm Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Terr & Planetary Atmospheres, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Princeton Univ, NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO USA; Natl Ctr Environm Predict, Camp Springs, MD USA; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Numer Math, Moscow, Russia; Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune, Maharashtra, India; Korea Meteorol Adm, Climate Predict Div, Seoul, South Korea; Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","Seoul National University (SNU); University of Hawaii System; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Russian Academy of Sciences; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Kang, IS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",kang@climate.snu.ac.kr,"Stern, William/W-9763-2019; Lau, William K/E-1510-2012; Kitoh, Akio/F-1765-2010","Lau, William K/0000-0002-3587-3691; Jin, Emilia/0000-0002-5257-3340",,,,,46,371,411,0,57,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

To facilitate the structural design and risk assessment of coastal bridges under extreme events, it is imperative to efficiently predict the wave-induced forces with high accuracy. In this study, a novel predictive model for wave-induced forces is established using the ensemble learning technique. Specifically, four state-of-the-art surrogate models, namely the support vector regression (SVR), Kriging (KRG), polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), and decision tree (DT) are employed to construct a weighted predictive model, where the weights of individual models are implicitly determined by the artificial neural network (ANN). Depending on the architecture of the ANN model, e.g., with or without a hidden layer, these four surrogate models can be ensembled nonlinearly (ANN1) or linearly (ANN2). Four benchmark functions and two ocean engineering cases are utilized to validate the performance of the established ensemble models. The coefficient of determination R-2, maximum absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are used as the error metrics. The results show that the proposed ANN-based ensemble strategy is capable of providing robust and accurate approximation for different force components; it can effectively reduce the adverse effect of poorly behaved candidate surrogates by wisely assigning weights to the individual models, which is beneficial to protect against the use of the worst surrogate model. It is envisioned that the proposed ensemble models can be extended to predict wave forces of unstable wave conditions, thus facilitating the associated risk assessment and structural design of ocean infrastructure assets.","[Xu, Guoji; Ji, Chengjie; Wei, Huan; Wang, Jinsheng] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Peng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Wang, JS (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",jinshengwangrjc@swjtu.edu.cn,,,NSFC [52078425],NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The financial support from NSFC (Grant no. 52078425) is highly appreciated.

And they constitute a rational and functional approach for health and comfort to their residents, translating the state-of-the-art of architecture at the time, through the use of lighting and natural ventilation. In this research study, buildings of Baixa are observed as a scenario where residents of 21st Century live in spatial and built structures of 18th Century. This paper is about environmental controls of windows within current thermal and lighting performance of Baixa Pombalina Buildings. It analyses the habits of its occupants in controlling and regulating windows in Baixa buildings at present time. A questionnaire was developed to study bioclimatic performance of offices, and residences selected in Baixa. And field work involved a survey where workers of fifteen offices and residents of five houses have participated. Results demonstrate that in buildings of Baixa, windows are used less interactively during winter season and more interactively during summer season. Results indicate that in the Lisbon climate, it is mainly during the summer season that controls have a major role in thermal performance of Baixa's buildings. This Paper aims to show that Regulations shall rate adequately heritage buildings by including in greater consideration, bioclimatic strategies such as natural ventilation, and adaptive actions such as opening windows, as environmental control.

The causes of this spring predictability barrier (SPB) remain elusive. With a theoretical ENSO system model, we investigate this controversial issue by tracing the evolution of conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) and by analyzing the behavior of initial error growth. The CNOPs are the errors in the initial states of ENSO events, which have the biggest impact on the uncertainties at the prediction time under proper physical constraints. We show that the evolution of CNOP-type errors associated with El Nino episodes depends remarkably on season with the fastest growth occurring during boreal spring in the onset phase. There also exist other kinds of initial errors, which have either somewhat smaller growth rates or neutral ones during spring. However, for La Nina events, even if initial errors are of CNOP-type, the errors grow without significant seasonal dependence. These findings suggest that the SPB in this model results from combined effects of three factors: the annual cycle of the mean state, the structure of El Nino, and the pattern of the initial errors. On the basis of the error tendency equations derived from the model, we addressed how the combination of the three factors causes the SPB and proposed a mechanism responsible for the error growth in the model ENSO events. Our results help in clarifying the role of the initial error pattern in SPB, which may provide a clue for explaining why SPB can be eliminated by improving initial conditions. The results also illustrate a theoretical basis for improving data assimilation in ENSO prediction.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; University of Hawaii System","Mu, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",mumu@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Duan, Wansuo/AAJ-4536-2020",,,,,,50,99,121,0,31,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Based on the first exhaustive compilation of palaeoecological data in this region, we present the state-of-the-art and attempt to synthesize the available information concerning glacial refugia and post-glacial migration, and analyse the information with regard to climate and orography. Location South-western Alps and adjacent areas, southern France. Methods The work compiles the available palaeoecological data in the south-western Alps (52 sites, 290 radiocarbon dates). The post-glacial migration pattern of Abies alba is reconstructed based on 22 selected palynological analyses (11 well-dated reference sites and 11 supplementary ones). Results The geographical patterns of approaching area limit, immigration and expansion are reconstructed at the scale of the southern French Alps. Main conclusions Despite previous assertions, the evidence of refugia in southern France is non-existent. The late-glacial records of fir pollen, previously interpreted in French Mediterranean regions and on adjacent foot-hills as possibly reflecting regional refugia, most probably correspond to reworking phenomena or long-distance pollen transport. Fir migration, originating in the Apennine refugia and through the south-western extremity of the Alps, was extremely rapid in the southern French Alps, only spanning a few centuries between 10,100 and 9800 cal. yr BP. The subsequent spread of fir populations was controlled by local parameters, such as the aridity of the inner valleys, which resulted in a delayed expansion in comparison to other regions. Abies almost disappeared from the south-western Alps during the Roman era, around 2000 cal. yr BP.","Univ Montpellier 2, ISEM, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Inst Mediterraneen Ecol & Paleoecol, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France; Inst Bot, Ctr Bioarcheol & Ecol, F-34090 Montpellier, France; Ctr Europeen Rech & Enseignement Geosci Environm, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Newcastle University - UK; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Muller, SD (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, ISEM, Case 061, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",smuller@univ-montp2.fr,"Carcaillet, Christopher/G-1218-2011","Carcaillet, Christopher/0000-0002-6632-1507; Nakagawa, Takeshi/0000-0003-0831-6803",,,,,137,45,45,5,30,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Helicobacter pylori is the first bacterium to be categorized as a definite carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO). Half of the world's population carries H. pylori, which may be responsible for severe gastric diseases like peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. These two gastric diseases take more than a million lives every year. However, the role of H. pylori as sole pathogen in gastric diseases is heavily debated and remained controversial. It is still not convincingly understood, why most (80-90%) H. pylori infected individuals remain asymptomatic, while some (10-20%) develop such severe gastric diseases. Moreover, several reports indicated that colonization of H. pylori has positive and negative associations with several other gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI diseases. In this review, we have discussed the state of the art knowledge on H. pylori factors and several other factors, which have been claimed to have links with severe gastric and duodenal diseases. We conclude that H. pylori infection alone does not satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition for developing aggressive clinical outcomes. Rather, the cumulative effect of a number of factors like the virulence proteins of H. pylori, local geography and climate, genetic background and immunity of the host, gastric and intestinal microbiota, and dietary habit and history of medicine usage together determine whether the H. pylori infected person will remain asymptomatic or will develop one of the severe gastric diseases.","[Alexander, Sneha Mary; Retnakumar, Radhakrishnan Jayalakshmi; Chouhan, Deepak; Devi, Thillai Natarajan Barani; Dharmaseelan, Sanjai; Chattopadhyay, Santanu] Rajiv Gandhi Ctr Biotechnol, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; [Retnakumar, Radhakrishnan Jayalakshmi; Chouhan, Deepak] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Ctr Doctoral Studies, Manipal, India; [Devadas, Krishnadas] Govt Med Coll, Dept Gastroenterol, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; [Thapa, Namrata] Nar Bahadur Bhandari Degree Coll, Dept Zool, BiotechHub, Gangtok, India; [Tamang, Jyoti Prakash] Sikkim Univ, Dept Microbiol, Gangtok, India; [Lamtha, Sangey Chhophel] STNM Hosp, Gangtok, India",Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB); Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE); Sikkim University,"Chattopadhyay, S (corresponding author), Rajiv Gandhi Ctr Biotechnol, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.",santanu@rgcb.res.in,,"Chouhan, Deepak/0000-0002-3749-0280; Chattopadhyay, Santanu/0000-0002-6275-8568","Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India [MED/2017/46]; Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India [ECR/2016/171]","Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","This work was supported by a grant (MED/2017/46) from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India and a grant (ECR/2016/171) from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India to SC as well as by the institutional support from the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, and an autonomous institute under the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.",,180,16,16,4,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Expanding renewable power generation in a significant way is seen as an imperative measure within this transition. To compensate for the inherent volatility of wind- and solar-based power generation, flexible and dispatchable power generation technologies such as gas turbines are required. If operated with CO2-neutral fuels such as hydrogen or in combination with carbon capture plants, a green house gases-neutral gas turbine operation can be achieved. An effective leverage to enhance carbon capture efficiency and a possible measure to safely burn hydrogen in gas turbines is the partial external recirculation of exhaust gas. By means of a model-based analysis of a state-of-the-art industrial gas turbine, this study initially assesses the thermodynamic impact caused by a fuel switch from natural gas to hydrogen. Although positive trends such as increasing net electrical power output and thermal efficiency can be observed, the overall effect on the gas turbine process is only minor. In a following step, the partial external recirculation of exhaust gas is evaluated and compared both for the combustion of natural gas and hydrogen, regardless of potential combustor design challenges. The influence of altering working fluid properties throughout the whole gas turbine process is thermodynamically evaluated for ambient temperature recirculation and recirculation at an elevated temperature (303.15 K). A reduction in thermal efficiency as well as non-negligible changes in relevant process variables can be observed. These changes are more distinctive at a higher recirculation temperature.","[Bexten, Thomas; Joerg, Sophia; Petersen, Nils; Wirsum, Manfred] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Plant Technol Steam & Gas Turbines, Fac Mech Engn, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Liu, Pei; Li, Zheng] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Power Syst, Tsinghua BP Clean Energy Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Energy & Power Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",RWTH Aachen University; Tsinghua University,"Bexten, T (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Plant Technol Steam & Gas Turbines, Fac Mech Engn, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",bexten@ikdg.rwth-aachen.de,"Liu, Pei/C-4913-2011","Liu, Pei/0000-0002-6854-4333","Bundesministerium fur Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie [01DO17033]","Bundesministerium fur Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","Bundesministerium fur Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie (Grant No. 01DO17033; Funder ID: 10.13039/501100010571).",,23,3,3,3,13,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0742-4795,1528-8919,,J ENG GAS TURB POWER,J.

However, tree detection in cities is challenging, given the irregular shape, size, occlusion, and complexity of urban areas. With the advance of environmental technologies, deep learning segmentation mapping methods can map urban forests accurately. We applied a region-based CNN object instance segmentation algorithm for the semantic segmentation of tree canopies in urban environments based on aerial RGB imagery. To the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the performance of deep learning-based methods for segmentation tasks inside the Cerrado biome, specifically for urban tree segmentation. Five state-of-the-art architectures were evaluated, namely: Fully Convolutional Network; U-Net; SegNet; Dynamic Dilated Convolution Network and DeepLabV3+. The experimental analysis showed the effectiveness of these methods reporting results such as pixel accuracy of 96,35%, an average accuracy of 91.25%, F1-score of 91.40%, Kappa of 82.80% and IoU of 73.89%. We also determined the inference time needed per area, and the deep learning methods investigated after the training proved to be suitable to solve this task, providing fast and effective solutions with inference time varying from 0.042 to 0.153 minutes per hectare. We conclude that the semantic segmentation of trees inside urban environments is highly achievable with deep neural networks. This information could be of high importance to decision-making and may contribute to the management of urban systems. It should be also important to mention that the dataset used in this work is available on our website.","[Martins, Jose Augusto Correa; Goncalves, Wesley Nunes; de Oliveira, Paulo Tarso Sanches; Marcato Junior, Jose] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Nogueira, Keiller] Univ Stirling, Comp Sci & Math Div, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Osco, Lucas Prado] Univ Western Sao Paulo, Fac Engn & Architecture & Urbanism, Rodovia Raposo Tavares,Km 572, BR-19067175 Bairro Limoeiro, Brazil; [Gomes, Felipe David Georges; Furuya, Danielle Elis Garcia; Ramos, Ana Paula Marques] Univ Western Sao Paulo, Environm & Reg Dev Program, Rodovia Raposo Tavares,Km 572, BR-19067175 Bairro Limoeiro, Brazil; [Sant'Ana, Diego Andre] INOVISAO Univ Catolica Dom Bosco, Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Ave Tamandare 6000, BR-79117900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Ramos, Ana Paula Marques] Univ Western Sao Paulo, Agron Program, Rodovia Raposo Tavares,Km 572, BR-19067175 Bairro Limoeiro, Brazil; [Liesenberg, Veraldo] Santa Catarina State Univ, Forest Engn Dept, Ave Luiz de Camoes 2090, BR-88520000 Lages, SC, Brazil; [dos Santos, Jefersson Alex] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Comp Sci, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; University of Stirling; Universidade do Oeste Paulista; Universidade do Oeste Paulista; Universidade do Oeste Paulista; Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Ramos, APM (corresponding author), Univ Western Sao Paulo, Environm & Reg Dev Program, Rodovia Raposo Tavares,Km 572, BR-19067175 Bairro Limoeiro, Brazil.;Ramos, APM (corresponding author), Univ Western Sao Paulo, Agron Program, Rodovia Raposo Tavares,Km 572, BR-19067175 Bairro Limoeiro, Brazil.",jose.a@ufms.br; keiller.nogueira@stir.ac.uk; lucasosco@unoeste.br; felipedgg@yahoo.com.br; daniellegarciafuruya@gmail.com; wesley.goncalves@ufms.br; diego.santana@ifms.edu.br; anaramos@unoeste.br; veraldo.liesenberg@udesc.br; jefersson@dcc.ufmg.br; paulo.t.oliveira@ufms.br; jose.marcato@ufms.br,"Ramos, Ana Paula Marques/J-6538-2014; Osco, Lucas Prado/V-3997-2018; Sant'Ana, Diego André/Q-8198-2018; Oliveira, Paulo Tarso S/A-4187-2011; dos Santos, Jefersson/G-6498-2012; Marcato Junior, Jose/H-4406-2017","Ramos, Ana Paula Marques/0000-0001-6633-2903; Osco, Lucas Prado/0000-0002-0258-536X; Sant'Ana, Diego André/0000-0002-9209-9129; Oliveira, Paulo Tarso S/0000-0003-2806-0083; Furuya, Danielle Elis Garcia/0000-0002-9106-1620; dos Santos, Jefersson/0000-0002-8889-1586; Georges Gomes, Felipe David/0000-0003-0843-560X; Nogueira, Keiller/0000-0003-3308-6384; Liesenberg, Veraldo/0000-0003-0564-7818; Correa Martins, Jose Augusto/0000-0003-0668-8224; Marcato Junior, Jose/0000-0002-9096-6866","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [310517/2020-6, 303559/2019-5, 313887/2018-7, 433783/2018-4, 304173/2016-9]; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [88881.211850/2018-01]; Foundation to Support the Development of Education, Science and Technology of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT) [59/300.066/2015, 59/300.095/2015]","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Foundation to Support the Development of Education, Science and Technology of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT)","This research was funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) p: (310517/2020-6, 303559/2019-5, 313887/2018-7, 433783/2018-4 and 304173/2016-9), the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) Print p: (88881.211850/2018-01), and the Foundation to Support the Development of Education, Science and Technology of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT) p: (59/300.066/2015 and 59/300.095/2015).",,58,11,11,9,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2021,16,,,,,,3054,10.3390/rs13163054,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13163054,,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,UH7KL,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000690104700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, even the most exciting scientific information and results are not readily available to a nonprofessional audience. Interdisciplinarity and a suitable cultural framework can bring new life to the results of scientific research. If the presentation of science is interconnected with cultural disciplines such as literature, art, music or theatre, its account can be enriched and media interest can be increased. The scientific-cultural festivals AT HOME IN SVALBARD 2018 and ARCTIC FESTIVAL 2019 are just two good examples.

At present the global mean sea level rises at 3.1 +/- 0.7 mm yr(-1) with an accelerating tendency. However, the magnitude of recent decadal sea level trends varies greatly spatially, attaining values of up to 10 mm yr(-1) in some areas of the western tropical Pacific. Identifying the causes of recent regional sea level trends and understanding the patterns of future projected sea level change is of crucial importance. Using a wind-forced simplified dynamical ocean model, the study shows that the regional features of recent decadal and multidecadal sea level trends in the tropical Indo-Pacific can be attributed to changes in the prevailing wind regimes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that within an ensemble of 10 state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models, forced by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the next century, wind-induced redistributions of upper-ocean water play a key role in establishing the spatial characteristics of projected regional sea level rise.

In recent years, with the emergence of new inspection technologies and the growing concern about climate change and people's health, the concern about the integrity of building structures has been extended to their analysis as insulating envelopes. In addition, the growing network of historic buildings gives this sector special attention. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive review of the application of two of the most common and most successful Non-Destructive Techniques (NDTs) when inspecting a building: InfraRed Thermography (IRT) and Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR). To the best knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that a joint compilation of the state-of-the-art of both IRT and GPR for building evaluation is performed in the same work, with special emphasis on applications that integrate both technologies. The authors briefly explain the performance of each NDT, along with the individual and collective advantages of their uses in the building sector.

Recently, climate change and human activities have resulted in higher frequencies of wildfires throughout the world. Timely and accurate detection of the burned areas can help to make decisions for their management. Remote sensing satellite imagery can have a key role in mapping burned areas due to its wide coverage, high-resolution data collection, and low capture times. However, although many studies have reported on burned area mapping based on remote sensing imagery in recent decades, accurate burned area mapping remains a major challenge due to the complexity of the background and the diversity of the burned areas. This paper presents a novel framework for burned area mapping based on Deep Siamese Morphological Neural Network (DSMNN-Net) and heterogeneous datasets. The DSMNN-Net framework is based on change detection through proposing a pre/post-fire method that is compatible with heterogeneous remote sensing datasets. The proposed network combines multiscale convolution layers and morphological layers (erosion and dilation) to generate deep features. To evaluate the performance of the method proposed here, two case study areas in Australian forests were selected. The framework used can better detect burned areas compared to other state-of-the-art burned area mapping procedures, with a performance of >98% for overall accuracy index, and a kappa coefficient of >0.9, using multispectral Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral PRISMA image datasets. The analyses of the two datasets illustrate that the DSMNN-Net is sufficiently valid and robust for burned area mapping, and especially for complex areas.","[Seydi, Seyd Teymoor; Hasanlou, Mahdi] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran 1417466191, Iran; [Chanussot, Jocelyn] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Chanussot, Jocelyn] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GIPSA Lab, Grenoble INP, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France",University of Tehran; Chinese Academy of Sciences; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Hasanlou, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran 1417466191, Iran.",seydi.teymoor@ut.ac.ir; hasanlou@ut.ac.ir; jocelyn.chanussot@grenoble-inp.fr,"Seydi, Seyd Teymoor/AAD-7239-2022; seydi, seyd teymoor/K-3366-2017","Seydi, Seyd Teymoor/0000-0002-3678-4877; Chanussot, Jocelyn/0000-0003-4817-2875; Hasanlou, Mahdi/0000-0002-7254-4475",AXA fund; MIAI @ Grenoble Alpes [ANR-19-P3IA-0003],AXA fund(AXA Research Fund); MIAI @ Grenoble Alpes,"The authors would like to thank the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency for providing the datasets.

Aiming to promote the energy efficiency and sustainability, coal to gas is playing a more and more important role in the national environmental and climate change. However, the presence of harmful H2S in the syngas not only corrodes the equipment and poisons the catalyst, but also pollutes the environment seriously after it is discharged to the atmosphere, so it must be removed. The preparation of desulfurization materials with high sulfur capacity, high efficiency, good regenerability and stable performance has always been the research hotspot in this field. Based on previous works, first, newly developing desulfurization sorbents prepared with excellent performance and novel methods and materials emerging in recent years have been reviewed and highlighted in the present paper. Second, the preparation method, performance indicators and merits of various single metal oxides (Fe2O3, ZnO, Mn2O3, CuO, CaO) and composite metal oxides (Fe-Zn-O, Mo-Fe-Mn-O, Mn-Ca, etc.) have been discussed and compared. More important, the further perspectives, such as techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of the relating field were also proposed based on the existing understandings, which will make sense for the promotion of energy efficiency and sustainability, pollution reduction and resource recovery.

However, in certain areas of the world, they are consumed by humans as food. and they can represent a source of valuable active ingredients of ethnomedical interest. In this study, three North African parasitic plants of the Orobanchaceae family, Cistanche violacea. Orobanche crenata and Orobanche lavandulacea, normally considered as weeds, were studied to compare their biological activities. The antioxidant activity of hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and water extracts obtained by sequential maceration was estimated by DPPH, ARTS and FRAP assays. The metabolic profiles of aqueous extracts were studied by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The oils extracted using hexane as solvent were analyzed by GC-FID and HPLC-DAD to characterize the fatty acid profile. The cytotoxic effect of the oil from the parasitic plants was also studied on B16F10 melanoma cancer cells. All extracts showed antioxidant activity and differences between extracts obtained using different solvents as well as for different plants have been highlighted. The highest total phenolic content was determined in O. crenata acetone extract (3.53 +/- 0.20 mmol GAE/g) and in O. lavandulacea methanol extract (2.29 +/- 0.02 mmol GAE/g). H-1 NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of amino acids, organic acids and carbohydrates. The major fatty acids in the oils were 18:2 n-6, 16:0. 18:1 n-9, and 18:3 n-3. O. lavandulacea revealed to be a highly cytotoxic species for B16F10 melanoma cells. These data suggest that. despite the extreme climate conditions and the damage that can result. the studied desert parasitic plants can represent a novel and precious source of metabolites. with promising biological activities.","[Ben Attia, Imen; Chaieb, Mohamed] Univ Sfax, Fac Sci, LEBIOMAT, Sfax, Tunisia; [Zucca, Paolo; Nieddu, Mariella; Rosa, Antonella; Rescigno, Antonio] Univ Cagliari, Dept Biomed Sci, I-09042 Monserrato, CA, Italy; [Marincola, Flaminia Cesare; Piras, Alessandra] Univ Cagliari, Dept Chem & Geol Sci, I-09042 Monserrato, CA, Italy",Universite de Sfax; Faculty of Sciences Sfax; University of Cagliari; University of Cagliari,"Rescigno, A (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Biomed Sci, I-09042 Monserrato, CA, Italy.",rescigno@unica.it,"Rescigno, Antonio/A-8862-2011; Rosa, Antonella/J-4842-2018; Marincola, Flaminia Cesare/G-3520-2015; Zucca, Paolo/B-2426-2008","Rescigno, Antonio/0000-0002-2855-8378; Rosa, Antonella/0000-0003-0939-9364; Marincola, Flaminia Cesare/0000-0002-9695-5957; Zucca, Paolo/0000-0002-3548-7635; PIRAS, Alessandra/0000-0002-7232-4966; Nieddu, Mariella/0000-0001-8595-7001; Ben Attia, Imen/0000-0002-1146-0462",Sfax University; Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; University of Cagliari (F.I.R. 2017-2018); Italian Ministry of University and Research (F.F.A.B.R. 2018),Sfax University; Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; University of Cagliari (F.I.R. 2017-2018); Italian Ministry of University and Research (F.F.A.B.R. 2018),"This research was partially funded by grants from Sfax University, Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, University of Cagliari (F.I.R. 2017-2018) and Italian Ministry of University and Research (F.F.A.B.R. 2018).",,44,2,2,0,5,INST ANIMAL REPRODUCTION & FOOD RESEARCH POLISH ACAD SCIENCES OLSZTYN,OLSZTYN,"UL J TUWIMA 10, OLSZTYN, 10-747, POLAND",1230-0322,2083-6007,,POL J FOOD NUTR SCI,Pol.

This issue can only be overcome by using low-emission energy means such as natural gas, geothermal energy, and solar energy. Although there is enormous potential for power generation with geothermal energy, to date commercial geothermal energy production has mostly been limited to geothermal areas with accessible heat sources, where significant amounts of fluids are available (conventional geothermal reservoirs). In recent decades, the geothermal industry has moved to utilize more challenging unconventional resources, and of these, enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) have been steadily improving worldwide. Although knowledge of reservoir geomechanics has developed substantially thus far, technical challenges specific to EGS technology (high-temperature and -pressure environments, accelerated chemical characteristics) and critical environmental concerns have prevented the widespread utilization of EGSs. A number of research areas in geotechnical engineering, including understanding the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical and chemical interactions in intact and fractured rock mass, the initiation and propagation of natural and artificially-induced rock fractures, the mechanisms of induced seismicity and mitigation techniques, and the exploration of non-water-based fracturing fluids, can provide crucial information on reservoir stimulation, long-term performance and the sustainability of EGS. This paper critically reviews the state-of-art of the technology, including major geotechnical and environmental concerns in EGS development. The current study aims to stimulate the discussion of sustainable EGS development among the geothermal community, highlighting the future research needs for exploration, stimulation, and long-term production.","[Kumari, W.

However, a reliable modelling of sediment deposits and delta formation in reservoirs is still a challenging problem due to many uncertainties in the modelling process. Modelling performance can be improved by adjusting the uncertainty caused by sediment load boundary conditions. In our study, we diminished the uncertainty factor by setting more precise sediment load boundary conditions reconstructed using wavelet artificial neural networks for a morphodynamic model. The model was calibrated for hydrodynamics using a backward error propagation method. The proposed approach was applied to the Tarbela Reservoir located on the Indus River, in northern Pakistan. The results showed that the hydrodynamic calibration with coefficient of determination (R-2 ) = 0.969 and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.966 also facilitated good calibration in morphodynamic calculations with R-2 = 0.97 and NSE = 0.96. The model was validated for the sediment deposits in the reservoir with R-2 = 0.96 and NSE = 0.95. Due to desynchronization between the glacier melts and monsoon rain caused by warmer climate and subsequent decrease of 17% in sediment supply to the Tarbela dam, our modelling results showed a slight decrease in the sediment delta for the near future (until 2030). Based on the results, we conclude that our overall state-of-the-art modelling offers a significant improvement in computational time and accuracy, and could be used to estimate hydrodynamic and morphodynamic parameters more precisely for different events and poorly gauged rivers elsewhere in the world. The modelling concept could also be used for predicting sedimentation in the reservoirs under sediment load variability scenarios.","[Ateeq-Ur-Rehman, Sardar; Minh Duc Bui; Rutschmann, Peter] Tech Univ Munich, Hydraul & Water Resources Engn, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [ul Hasson, Shabeh] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [ul Hasson, Shabeh] Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",Technical University of Munich; University of Hamburg,"Ateeq-Ur-Rehman, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Hydraul & Water Resources Engn, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",sardar.ateeq@tum.de; bui@tum.de; shabeh.hasson@uni-hamburg.de; p.rutschmann@tum.de,"hasson, shabeh ul/D-5672-2014; Bui, Minh Duc/HDL-8543-2022","hasson, shabeh ul/0000-0002-7791-9635; Ateeq-Ur-Rehman, Sardar/0000-0002-2039-9093; Bui, Minh Duc/0000-0002-0756-7136; Rutschmann, Peter/0000-0002-9903-730X",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan; German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM); Cluster of Excellence CliSAP [EXC177]; University of Hamburg through the German Science Foundation (DFG),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Technical University of Munich (TUM); Cluster of Excellence CliSAP; University of Hamburg through the German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan jointly financed this work.

At the same time, the power of computers and newly developed algorithms have grown sharply. Such advances have extended the range of possibilities for hydrologists, who are trying to exploit these potentials the most, updating and re-inventing the way hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are carried out. A variety of research fields have progressed significantly, ranging from the evaluation of water features, to the classification of land-cover, the identification of river morphology, and the monitoring of extreme flood events. The description of flood processes may particularly benefit from the integrated use of recent algorithms and monitoring techniques. In fact, flood exposure and risk over large areas and in scarce data environments have always been challenging topics due to the limited information available on river basin hydrology, basin morphology, land cover, and the resulting model uncertainty. The ability of new tools to carry out intensive analyses over huge datasets allows us to produce flood studies over large extents and with a growing level of detail.

This mythological quantification of race and culture is an heirloom of ideological whiteness. Given the complex dynamics of power and representation that haunt the socio-political climate of postapartheid South Africa, how might a white South African artist problematise whiteness in a way that allows for a cultural fluidity that runs counter to this gaze? This article identifies the strategies used by the white South African artist, Minnette Vari, to subvert her apparent whiteness and build a case for accessing a multiple identity that is African in its ability to be diverse. I argue that, rather than addressing established ideas of a sexual or maternal femininity, Vari's use of her own (usually naked) body attempts to expose her whiteness. In this way, she is less concerned with reclaiming the female body from the male gaze, than from the racialised gaze. I conclude that it is ultimately this use of her body that allows Vari to discuss issues of representation and belonging without falling into the ideological position of the coloniser.","[Draper, Jessica Lindiwe] Univ Oxford, Christ Church, Ruskin Sch Drawing & Fine Art, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Draper, JL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Christ Church, Ruskin Sch Drawing & Fine Art, Oxford, England.",,"Draper, Jessica Lindiwe/AAD-8124-2019","Draper, Jessica Lindiwe/0000-0002-0623-0232",,,,,47,1,1,0,0,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",0004-3389,2471-4100,,DE ARTE,De Arte,JAN,2015,,,,,50,67,,,,,,18,Art,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Art,VB0EE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000411635500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many systems are available on the market. For an impartial comparison, a definite level of thermal comfort should be defined and ensured in all systems. This work studied the influence of component size on electricity demand for a state of the art solar thermal and heat pump system. A systematic series of parametric studies was carried out by using TRNSYS to show the impact of climate, load and size of main components as well as heat source for the heat pump. Penalty functions were used to ensure that all variations provided the same comfort requirements. Two reference systems were defined and modelled based on products on the market, one with ambient air and the other with borehole as heat source for the heat pump. The results show that changes in collector area from 5 to 15 m(2) result in a decrease in system electricity of between 305 and 552 kW h/year. Changes in heat exchanger size for DHW preparation were shown to give nearly as large changes in electricity use due to the fact that the set temperature in the store was changed to give the same thermal comfort in all cases. Decrease in heat pump size was shown to give a decrease in electricity use for the ASHP in the building with larger heat demand while it increased or had only a small change for other boundary conditions. Heat pump losses were shown to be an important factor highlighting the importance of modelling this factor explicitly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides a conservation value per se, biodiversity is related to the services that ecosystems provide to society and the ability of these to cope with stressors, including climate change. Using macro-invertebrates and fish as sentinel organisms, this overview presents a synthesis of the state of the art in the application of biomarkers (stress and enzymatic responses, endocrine disruptors, trophic tracers, energy and bile metabolites, genotoxic indicators, histopathological and behavioural alterations, and genetic and cutting edge omic markers) to determine the causes and effects of anthropogenic stressors on the biodiversity of European Mediterranean rivers. We also discuss how a careful selection of sentinel species according to their ecological traits and the food-web structure of Mediterranean rivers could increase the ecological relevance of biomarker responses. Further, we provide suggestions to better harmonise ecological realism with experimental design in biomarker studies, including statistical analyses, which may also deliver a more comprehensible message to managers and policy makers. By keeping on the safe side the health status of populations of multiple-species in a community, we advocate to increase the resilience of fluvial ecosystems to face present and forecasted stressors. In conclusion, this review provides evidence that multi-biomarker approaches detect early signs of impairment in populations, and supports their incorporation in the standardised procedures of the Water Frame Work Directive to better appraise the status of European water bodies.

Long-term solutions to address these issues are based on developing sustainable alternatives for the human energy thirst. However, the versatilities offered by the carbonaceous fuels have still preserved their popularity as the main source of energy for a wide variety of applications. After decades of practicing conventional carbon capture and storage, researchers believe the ultimate solution of realistically facing with CO2 sequestration problem is the chemical conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable products. However, substantial development of state-of-the-art materials remains the major bottleneck of such technologies. Graphene, as the rising star of the materials world in 21st century, offers game-changing prospects towards a more sustainable future for fossil-fuel-based economies. This two-dimensional planar sheet of sp(2)-bonded carbon atoms is the most widely studied nanomaterial since its discovery in 2004. Here we aim to highlight various aspects of graphene research in carbon dioxide capture and conversion from materials viewpoint. After presenting an overview of the most common and effective synthesis and doping/functionalization methods, the application of graphene and its derivatives in CO2 capture and conversion is discussed in detail. Catalytic, electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic use of graphene-based compounds could potentially revolutionize some of the current techniques for CO2 transformation to valuable chemical 'commodities. CO2 to graphene conversion pathways are also covered extensively in this review paper as another intriguing relation of graphene with CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Forest sites are the basic building blocks for undertaking integrated resource management which weighs wildlife, recreation, environmental impact and various other concerns along with timber harvesting. Consequently, accurate and practical systems for classifying and mapping forest sites are becoming increasingly necessary to organize, communicate and use existing and new management knowledge and experience effectively. Over the past four decades in Ontario, a number of studies and resource surveys have provided important background information on forest sites. Many have considered, to varying extents, the integrative roles of vegetation, soil-site, landform and general climate on forests and forest land. Generally, the emphasis has been on description and classification, with results generating a better understanding of how various forests in different areas develop, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in relation to soil-site or other features of the basic land resource. Some of these studies and surveys have been instrumental in advancing the definitions and understanding of forested ecosystems. Others have provided new information on site dynamics, interrelationships and functions, or have contributed to the science (and art) of site evaluation and classification. This paper briefly summarizes the current status of forest site classification in Ontario. Over time, the role of forest site classification has evolved in response to new technologies and information, and to new emphases and values in resource management. In general, site classification research has become increasingly integrative and quantitative.

This cost is likely to increase in the future due to climate variability and economic development. In order to avoid or reduce such significant financial losses, risk management requires tools which can provide a reliable estimate of potential flood impacts across the country. Flood loss functions are an internationally accepted method for estimating physical flood damage in urban areas. In this study, we derived a new flood loss function for Italian residential structures (FLF-IT), on the basis of empirical damage data collected from a recent flood event in the region of Emilia-Romagna. The function was developed based on a new Australian approach (FLFA), which represents the confidence limits that exist around the parameterized functional depth-damage relationship. After model calibration, the performance of the model was validated for the prediction of loss ratios and absolute damage values. It was also contrasted with an uncalibrated relative model with frequent usage in Europe. In this regard, a threefold cross-validation procedure was carried out over the empirical sample to measure the range of uncertainty from the actual damage data. The predictive capability has also been studied for some sub-classes of water depth. The validation procedure shows that the newly derived function performs well (no bias and only 10% mean absolute error), especially when the water depth is high. Results of these validation tests illustrate the importance of model calibration. The advantages of the FLF-IT model over other Italian models include calibration with empirical data, consideration of the epistemic uncertainty of data, and the ability to change parameters based on building practices across Italy.","[Nafari, Roozbeh Hasanzadeh] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, CDMPS, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Nafari, Roozbeh Hasanzadeh] Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Amadio, Mattia; Mysiak, Jaroslav] FEEM, Venice, Italy; [Amadio, Mattia; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies Div, Venice, Italy; [Ngo, Tuan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, APTES Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Melbourne,"Nafari, RH (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, CDMPS, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.;Nafari, RH (corresponding author), Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",rhasanzadeh@student.unimelb.edu.au,"Ngo, Tuan/P-8184-2014; Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019; Hasanzadeh Nafari, Roozbeh/N-3934-2015","Ngo, Tuan/0000-0002-9831-8580; Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Amadio, Mattia/0000-0003-0359-4230; Hasanzadeh Nafari, Roozbeh/0000-0002-3987-4974",Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre; project ENHANCE [308438]; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [609642],"Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); project ENHANCE; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)","The authors would like to acknowledge the ongoing financial contribution and support from the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.

However, the investment costs often constitute a major barrier to their spread use. Moreover, the overall benefits of renewable energy technologies are often not well understood and consequently they are often evaluated to be not as cost effective as traditional technologies. From the moment that the energy sector started a deregulation process, with a high level of competitiveness and associated increased market uncertainty, traditional project evaluation techniques alone became insufficient to properly deal with these additional risk and uncertainty factors. The diffusion of the renewable energy technologies is also affected by this feature. The way investors evaluate their investments call now for the use of more sophisticated evaluation techniques. Real options approach can deal with these issues and, as so, began to be considered and applied for the energy sector decision aid. This approach it is now extensively widespread in evaluating investment projects in the energy sector. A large set of applications in almost all fields of energy decision making, from electricity generation technologies appraisal to policy evaluation is available in the literature. However the use of this technique in the field of RES is still limited and worth to be analysed. This paper addresses this issue. A review of the current state of the art in the application of real options approach to investments in non-renewable energy sources and RES is presented, giving perspectives for further research in this field.

Two statistical approaches that have already been used in the variance genome-wide association study (vGWAS) paradigm are the Brown-Forsythe test (BFT) and the double generalized linear model (DGLM). To ensure that these approaches are deployed as effectively as possible, it is critical to study the factors that influence their ability to identify variance-controlling loci. We used genome-wide marker data in maize (Zea mays L.) and Arabidopsis thaliana to simulate traits controlled by epistasis, genotype by environment (GxE) interactions, and variance quantitative trait nucleotides (vQTNs). We then quantified true and false positive detection rates of the BFT and DGLM across all simulated traits. We also conducted a vGWAS using both the BFT and DGLM on plant height in a maize diversity panel. The observed true positive detection rates at the maximum sample size considered (N = 2815) suggest that both of these vGWAS approaches are capable of identifying epistasis and GxE for sufficiently large sample sizes. We also noted that the DGLM decisively outperformed the BFT for simulated traits controlled by vQTNs at sample sizes of N = 500. Although we conclude that there are still certain aspects of vGWAS approaches that need further refinement, this study suggests that the BFT and DGLM are capable of identifying variance-controlling loci in current state-of-the-art plant or agronomic data sets.","[Murphy, Matthew D.; Fernandes, Samuel B.; Lipka, Alexander E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Morota, Gota] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, 175 West Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lipka, AE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",alipka@illinois.edu,,"Fernandes, Samuel/0000-0001-8269-535X","National Science Foundation [1355406, 1733606]; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Department of Crop Science",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Department of Crop Science,"We would like to thank the Associate Editor and four anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions.

Up to date, continental precipitation archived in marine sediment cores is reconstructed based mainly on the hydrogen isotopic composition of plant-wax compounds (i.e., n-alkane delta D) or on the ratio between terrigenous and marine sediments expressed as elemental ratios (e.g., ln (Fe/Ca)). Although these proxies provide reliable precipitation reconstructions, there are some inherent limitations, as plant-wax dD application depends on the availability of n-alkanes in marine sediments and elemental ratios can be influenced by other factors like the relative sea-level, primary productivity, and postdepositional processes. Here we introduce new precipitation proxies based on optically stimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence signals of quartz and feldspar. The rationale is that when precipitation changes over the catchment through time, different sediment sources regarding weathering intensity and parent rock types are drained, supplying sediments with varying signals of luminescence to the ocean. We compared our new proxy records with records of well-established proxies, for the same (ln (Fe/Ca)) and neighboring (n-alkane dD) marine sediment cores. The comparison among all proxies as well as with a state-of-art transient climate model run (TraCE-21ka) demonstrates that the new proxies accurately constrain precipitation changes over northeastern Brazil for the last 30,000 years. The main advantage of these new proxies relies on their fast response to precipitation changes over the continent. Furthermore, they are straightforward to measure and not expensive.","[Mendes, Vinicius R.; Sawakuchi, Andre O.; Giannini, Paulo C.

Both approaches are commonly considered in the definition of terroir at regional and local approaches. The purpose of this preliminary study was to develop and apply a methodology for viticultural zoning in order to establish the basis of studies on wine typicality. This will allow to question and compare the existent Protected Designations of Origin (D.O.) in the North West Iberian Peninsula wine regions (North of Portugal and Galicia-Spain). The assessment of Agro-ecological Terroir Units for viticulture includes climate and soil environmental factors selected for their relevance at regional scale, with the use of state-of-the-art variables and indices appropriate for the specified regions. The methodology considers the International Organisation of Vine and Wine guidelines (OIV, 2012), it is based upon the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) and uses multivariate zoning with principal component analysis and clustering procedures. The results suggest that the sub-regions of Moncao e Melgaco and Rias Baixas are integrated in a different terroir unit from the other Minho Sub-regions, which could give way to further inquiry with the purpose of reclassification based on studies on quality and typicality for the Alvarinho Wine. This regional and national cross-border classification provides a useful framework for territorial and viticultural policies with further validation at local and farm scales. This validation includes experimental surveys in selected vineyards for geographic differentiation of wine profiles and for supporting precision viticulture at plot and landscape scale.","[Cardoso, Andreia Saavedra; Alonso, Joaquim; Araujo-Paredes, Claudio] IPVC, Res Unit Mat Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Escola Super Agr Ponte Lima ESA, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Ana Sofia; Mendes, Susana; Valin, Maria Isabel] IPVC, Ctr Res & Dev Agrifood Syst & Sustainabil, Escola Super Agr Ponte Lima ESA, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal",,"Cardoso, AS (corresponding author), IPVC, Res Unit Mat Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Escola Super Agr Ponte Lima ESA, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal.",andreiasaavedra@esa.jpvc.pt; malonso@esa.ipvc.pt; sofia@esa.ipvc.pt; cparedes@esa.ipvc.pt; smendes@esa.ipvc.pt; isabelvalin@esa.ipvc.pt,"Cardoso, Andreia Saavedra/AAD-2909-2019; Mendes, Susana/GXZ-6025-2022; Paredes, Claudio/GYA-1394-2022; Rodrigues, Ana Sofia G./J-6996-2013","Cardoso, Andreia Saavedra/0000-0003-2470-4152; Rodrigues, Ana Sofia G./0000-0001-5268-6102; Valin, M.

In this paper, a novel neural network architecture inspired by the immune algorithm is presented and used in the forecasting of naturally occurring signals, including weather big data signals. Big Data Analysis is a major research frontier, which attracts extensive attention from academia, industry and government, particularly in the context of handling issues related to complex dynamics due to changing weather conditions. Recently, extensive deployment of IoT, sensors, and ambient intelligence systems led to an exponential growth of data in the climate domain. In this study, we concentrate on the analysis of big weather data by using the Dynamic Self Organized Neural Network Inspired by the Immune Algorithm. The learning strategy of the network focuses on the local properties of the signal using a self-organised hidden layer inspired by the immune algorithm, while the recurrent links of the network aim at recalling previously observed signal patterns. The proposed network exhibits improved performance when compared to the feedforward multilayer neural network and state-of-the-art recurrent networks, e.g., the Elman and the Jordan networks. Three non-linear and non-stationary weather signals are used in our experiments. Firstly, the signals are transformed into stationary, followed by 5-steps ahead prediction. Improvements in the prediction results are observed with respect to the mean value of the error (RMS) and the signal to noise ratio (SNR), however to the expense of additional computational complexity, due to presence of recurrent links.

The Innovations for Existing Plants (formerly the Advanced Research and Environmental Technologies) programme, managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), develops advanced environmental control technologies for coal-based power systems. The programme also provides high-quality scientific information on present and emerging environmental issues or use in regulatory and policy decision-making. An important component of the programme is the research and development of advanced nitrogen oxide (NOx) control technologies. This effort is focused primarily on systems capable of controlling NOx emissions to a level at or below 0.15 lb/million Btu at a cost significantly lower than state-of-the-art technology. The programme ill also provide an improved understanding of the impact of these advanced technologies on related issues such as unburned carbon, waterwall wastage, and mercury speciation and capture. The research is driven by continuing pressure for further reductions in NOx emissions from coal-fired utility boilers to address ground-level ozone and other environmental considerations including ambient fine particulates, visibility, cutrophication, and climate change. NETL is currently managing a portfolio of NOx control technology R&D projects ranging from laboratory studies to modelling to full-scale demonstration. This paper will provide an update on the status of these projects covering ultra-low-NOx burners, advanced reburning, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), methane de-NOx, and enhanced-oxygen combustion.","US DOE, Natl Energy Technol Lab, Washington, DC 20585 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE),"Feeley, TJ (corresponding author), US DOE, Natl Energy Technol Lab, Washington, DC 20585 USA.",,,,,,,,3,4,4,0,12,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA AEROPORT,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG 110 AVE LOUSIS CASAI CP 306, CH-1215 GENEVA AEROPORT, SWITZERLAND",0957-4352,,,INT J ENVIRON POLLUT,Int.

The agro residue biorefinery aims in sustainable approach which provides a good solution for sustainable ways of utilizing agricultural residues. Agro residues are by-products of agricultural crop production and processing, which are abundantly available at lower price. Agro residues are one of the major resources of unexploited potential lignocellulosic feedstocks. It includes straws, leaves and plant materials left in the field after harvesting of the crop. Its characteristics would vary with crops, species and environmental conditions. Annual agro residue production potential in India is ca. 550 MT. Currently, most of the residues are underutilized or burnt in situ, creating serious environmental pollutions. In order to utilize and effective disposal of these wastes, several methods are tried for tapping the energy/bioproducts from various crop residues via biochemical or thermochemical conversion routes. Biorefinery technologies can offer a platform for production of high-value chemicals and fuels from these residues, which are value-added products as well as provide more income for agriculturists. This chapter aims in bringing out sources of agro residues, the current state of the art of biomass processing and conversion viable technologies, and recent developments in the biorefinery of agro residues, and finally sheds light on commercialization of agro residue biorefinery.","[Ramesh, Desikan] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Hort Coll & Res Inst Women, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Muniraj, Iniya Kumar] Kumaraguru Inst Agr, Sakthinagar, Erode, India; [Thangavelu, Kiruthika; Karthikeyan, Subburamu] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Agr Engn Coll & Res Inst, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India",Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"Ramesh, D (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Hort Coll & Res Inst Women, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India.",rameshd@tnau.ac.in,"Karthikeyan, Subburamu/AAI-8511-2020; Desikan, Ramesh/D-6990-2015; Muniraj, Iniya Kumar/AAI-6987-2020","Karthikeyan, Subburamu/0000-0003-1003-3546; Desikan, Ramesh/0000-0002-3870-1393; ",,,,,78,7,7,1,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-7609,2363-761,978-3-319-94797-6; 978-3-319-94796-9,BIOFUEL BIOREFIN TEC,,,2019,,,,,47,71,,10.1007/978-3-319-94797-6_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94797-6_3,10.1007/978-3-319-94797-6,,25,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,BN4FT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000481831900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In previous work, we have presented an approach that a state-of-the-art mesoscale atmospheric model called Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) theory which can be used to estimate surface layer C-n(2) over the ocean. Here this paper is focused on surface layer C-n(2) over snow and sea ice, which is the extending of estimating surface layer C-n(2) utilizing WR model for ground-based optical application requirements. This powerful approach is validated against the corresponding 9-day C-n(2) data from a field campaign of the 30th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE). We employ several statistical operators to assess how this approach performs. Besides, we present an independent analysis of this approach performance using the contingency tables. Such a method permits us to provide supplementary key information with respect to statistical operators. These methods make our analysis more robust and permit us to confirm the excellent performances of this approach. The reasonably good agreement in trend and magnitude is found between estimated values and measurements overall, and the estimated C-n(2) values are even better than the ones obtained by this approach over the ocean surface layer.

Such models, while computationally efficient, are based on a simplified set of physical assumptions about the mechanical regime of the ice flow, which does not uniformly apply everywhere on the ice sheet/ice shelf system, especially near grounding lines, where rapid changes are taking place at present. Here, we present a new thermomechanical finite element model of ice flow named ISSM (Ice Sheet System Model) that includes higher-order stresses, high spatial resolution capability and data assimilation techniques to better capture ice dynamics and produce realistic simulations of ice sheet flow at the continental scale. ISSM includes several approximations of the momentum balance equations, ranging from the two-dimensional SSA to the three-dimensional full-Stokes formulation. It also relies on a massively parallelized architecture and state-of-the-art scalable tools. ISSM employs data assimilation techniques, at all levels of approximation of the momentum balance equations, to infer basal drag at the ice-bed interface from satellite radar interferometry-derived observations of ice motion. Following a validation of ISSM with standard benchmarks, we present a demonstration of its capability in the case of the Greenland Ice Sheet. We show ISSM is able to simulate the ice flow of an entire ice sheet realistically at a high spatial resolution, with higher-order physics, thereby providing a pathway for improving projections of ice sheet evolution in a warming climate.","[Larour, E.; Seroussi, H.; Morlighem, M.; Rignot, E.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Seroussi, H.; Morlighem, M.] Ecole Cent Paris, CNRS, UMR 8579, Lab MSSMat, F-92295 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Rignot, E.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Larour, E (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,MS 300-227, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",eric.larour@jpl.nasa.gov,"Morlighem, Mathieu/O-9942-2014; Rignot, Eric/A-4560-2014; Seroussi, Helene/AAX-5342-2021","Morlighem, Mathieu/0000-0001-5219-1310; Rignot, Eric/0000-0002-3366-0481; Seroussi, Helene/0000-0001-9201-1644",National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Cryospheric Sciences Program; Modeling Analysis and Prediction Program; Jet Propulsion Laboratory Research Technology and Development; NASA through the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at Ames Research Center; NSF [ANT-0424589]; NASA [NNX10AT68G]; Office of Polar Programs (OPP) [1155885] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Cryospheric Sciences Program; Modeling Analysis and Prediction Program; Jet Propulsion Laboratory Research Technology and Development; NASA through the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at Ames Research Center; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Office of Polar Programs (OPP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, at the Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, and at Laboratoire MSSMat, Ecole Centrale Paris, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Cryospheric Sciences Program and Modeling Analysis and Prediction Program, and a contract with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Research Technology and Development Program.

Windows are the most vulnerable part of building where energy loss occurs. Double-glazed windows are very effective in keeping inside temperature isolated from outside; thereby, saving electrical and thermal energy. The current study estimates the numerical changes in cooling and heating load in case of replacement double-glazed window with single-glazed window and calculates saving level for this replacement. In this context, this paper presents a model of real samples taken in Mashhad climate. To ensure the accuracy of the simulation results, real results were compared with electricity and gas bills. To calculate energy related parameters such as cooling load, heating load, the consumption of gas and electricity, the energy simulation software (Design Builder) was used. The research method was a quantitative analysis based on energy consumption modeling, associated with building windows which comes in four sections. The field study was also used to compare with real electricity and gas bills. As the first stage, samples of the plan were identified, based on the observation of climate models and library studies. Then, simulation parameters such as window materials and internal and external walls were considered. The simulation was performed based software's parameters and model limitations were determined based on thermal, lighting, climatic and architectural parameters. Finally, the experimental and practical data were used to determine the validity of the model under Mashhad climate conditions. Overall, the results indicated that double-glazed windows could save 50% of entire building loads, 0.2% on power consumption, 16.2% on gas and 12.4% on overall households' energy consumption.","[Forughian, Samaneh] Shahrood Univ Technol, Architecture Engn, Shahroud, Semnan Province, Iran; [Aiini, Masoud Taheri Shahr] Shahrood Univ Technol, Coll Architecture, Shahroud, Semnan Province, Iran",Shahrood University of Technology; Shahrood University of Technology,"Forughian, S (corresponding author), Shahrood Univ Technol, Architecture Engn, Shahroud, Semnan Province, Iran.",Foroughian_samaneh@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,8,KARABUK UNIV,KARABUK,"MAIN CAMPUS, BALIKLARKAYASI, KARABUK, 00000, TURKEY",2147-0626,,,TARIH KULT SANAT ARA,Tarih Kult.

Machine-learning methods can help to improve both speed and accuracy of this process. Specifically, deep-learning image-segmentation models using the U-Net structure perform faster and can identify areas that are missed by more restrictive approaches, such as expert hand-labeling and a priori heuristic methods. This paper discusses four different state-of-the-art U-Net models designed for detection of tropical and extratropical cyclone regions of interest (ROI) from two separate input sources: total precipitable water output from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model and water vapor radiance images from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). These models are referred to as International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)-GFS, Heuristic-GFS, IBTrACS-GOES, and Heuristic-GOES. All four U-Nets are fast information extraction tools and perform with an ROI detection accuracy ranging from 80% to 99%. These are additionally evaluated with the Dice and Tversky intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics, having Dice coefficient scores ranging from 0.51 to 0.76 and Tversky coefficients ranging from 0.56 to 0.74. The extratropical cyclone U-Net model performed 3 times as fast as the comparable heuristic model used to detect the same ROI. The U-Nets were specifically selected for their capabilities in detecting cyclone ROI beyond the scope of the training labels. These machine-learning models identified more ambiguous and active ROI missed by the heuristic model and hand-labeling methods that are commonly used in generating real-time weather alerts, having a potentially direct impact on public safety.","[Kumler-Bonfanti, Christina] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kumler-Bonfanti, Christina; Stewart, Jebb; Govett, Mark] NOAA, OAR, ESRL, Global Syst Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Hall, David] NVIDIA Corp, Boulder, CO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Nvidia Corporation,"Kumler-Bonfanti, C (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Kumler-Bonfanti, C (corresponding author), NOAA, OAR, ESRL, Global Syst Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",christina.e.kumler@noaa.gov,"Kumler, Christina/AAC-4938-2021","Kumler, Christina/0000-0001-6129-1209","NOAA Award [NA14OAR4320125, NA17OAR4320101]; NOAA's Software Engineering for Novel Architectures (SENA) program through the NOAA Office of the Chief Information Officer",NOAA Award; NOAA's Software Engineering for Novel Architectures (SENA) program through the NOAA Office of the Chief Information Officer,"We give a special thank you to our colleagues, especially Isidora Jankov, who have provided help, feedback, and support through the duration of this project.

The formulation of the spectral energy budget of the atmosphere by Augier and Lindborg (2013) is used to illustrate how the nonlinear spectral fluxes differ for a hierarchy of reduced models, adiabatic dynamical core, Held-Suarez dry, and idealized moist aquaplanet simulations, compared to NWP simulations with full complexity. The results identify surface drag and momentum vertical mixing as the key processes for influencing the transfer of energy in a stratified atmosphere. Moreover, the circulation generated by topography plays a significant role in these transfers. Given that subgrid-scale vertical mixing is parametrized, and that the treatment of orography filtering varies vastly between NWP models, the magnitude and scale of the nonlinear interactions can differ substantially from model to model, and depends on the choices made for the physical parametrizations. The need to appropriately parametrize the essential influence of subgrid-scale processes in global NWP and climate simulations has the effect that the physical energy cascade is replaced by a parametrized energy transfer. This explains the seeming failure of the IFS to produce a shallower mesoscale energy spectrum. In contrast, neither the horizontal filtering, typically applied in NWP models to avoid a spectral blocking at the smallest scales, nor implicit numerical dissipation significantly constrain, at sufficiently high resolution, the nonlinear interactions or the dominant slope of the energy spectra at synoptic and mesoscales.","[Malardel, Sylvie; Wedi, Nils P.] ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Malardel, S (corresponding author), ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England.",sylvie.malardel@ecmwf.int,"Wedi, Nils/AAE-6430-2021","Wedi, Nils/0000-0001-5324-2749",,,,,30,40,40,0,10,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This field covers a wide range of fundamental and applied problems of paramount importance (space weather, radiation hazard in space, operation of spaceborne and ground-based technological systems, heliobiology, etc.). Besides, it is closely connected with some general gnosiological problems (Weltanschauung). State-of-the-art information on existing problems is given and different channels for extraterrestrial influences arc discussed at the up-to-date level: electromagnetic waves and fields, total solar irradiance, solar wind, energetic solar particles, galactic cosmic rays, cosmic dust, etc. Some of well-known and suggested SIR effects and corresponding physical mechanisms are illustrated by several examples. In particular, we consider a number of different external <<signals>> in observed changes of terrestrial climate and weather. Especially, we analyse an expected impact of geophysical disturbances on the accuracy of some precise physical measurements and experiments. Due attention is paid to the heliobiological aspects of STR. Specifically, it is emphasized the multifactor nature of magneto-biological effect (MBE), its non-stationary and non-linear behaviour. We discuss the main features of different physical mechanisms (electromagnetic fields, ionising radiation, triggers, rhythmic and resonances in solar-terrestrial systems) and their applicability to the Sun - Earth problem. Most of them are still needed in more sophisticated theoretical development and experimental confirmation. The main goals of interdisciplinary studies in this field are to determine partial impacts of solar-geomagnetic variability on the terrestrial environments and to estimate (separate) relative contributions of different factors into various STR phenomena.","[Miroshnichenko, L.

During the early dry season campaign of the Cooperative LBA Airborne Regional Experiment (LBA-CLAIRE-2001), a tower-based surface layer gradient (SLG) technique was applied simultaneously with a relaxed eddy accumulation ( REA) system. Airborne measurements of vertical profiles within and above the convective boundary layer (CBL) were used to estimate fluxes on a landscape scale by application of the mixed layer gradient (MLG) technique. The mean daytime fluxes of organic carbon measured by REA were 2.1 mg C m(-2) h(-1) for isoprene, 0.20 mg C m(-2) h(-1) for alpha-pinene, and 0.39 mg C m(-2) h(-1) for the sum of monoterpenes. These values are in reasonable agreement with fluxes determined with the SLG approach, which exhibited a higher scatter, as expected for the complex terrain investigated. The observed VOC fluxes are in good agreement with simulations using a single-column chemistry and climate model (SCM). In contrast, the model-derived mixing ratios of VOCs were by far higher than observed, indicating that chemical processes may not be adequately represented in the model. The observed vertical gradients of isoprene and its primary degradation products methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) suggest that the oxidation capacity in the tropical CBL is much higher than previously assumed. A simple chemical kinetics model was used to infer OH radical concentrations from the vertical gradients of (MVK+MACR)/isoprene. The estimated range of OH concentrations during the daytime was 3-8 x 10(6) molecules cm(-3), i.e., an order of magnitude higher than is estimated for the tropical CBL by current state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry and transport models. The remarkably high OH concentrations were also supported by results of a simple budget analysis, based on the flux-to-lifetime relationship of isoprene within the CBL. Furthermore, VOC fluxes determined with the airborne MLG approach were only in reasonable agreement with those of the tower-based REA and SLG approaches after correction for chemical decay by OH radicals, applying a best estimate OH concentration of 5.5 x 10(6) molecules cm(-3). The SCM model calculations support relatively high OH concentration estimates after specifically being constrained by the mixing ratios of chemical constituents observed during the campaign. The relevance of the VOC fluxes for the local carbon budget of the tropical rainforest site during the measurements campaign was assessed by comparison with the concurrent CO2 fluxes, estimated by three different methods ( eddy correlation, Lagrangian dispersion, and mass budget approach). Depending on the CO2 flux estimate, 1 - 6% or more of the carbon gained by net ecosystem productivity appeared to be re-emitted through VOC emissions.","Max Planck Inst Chem, Biogeochem Dept, Mainz, Germany; Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, Zurich, Switzerland; Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; Area Ric Roma, Ist Metodol Chim, Monterot Scalo, Italy; IPEN CNEN SP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Max Planck Inst Chem, Atmospher Chem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra, Wageningen, Netherlands; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Sci & Environm, Viterbo, Italy",Max Planck Society; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie Chimiche (IMC-CNR); Comissao Nacional de Energia Nuclear (CNEN); Instituto de Pesquisas Energeticas e Nucleares (IPEN); Max Planck Society; Wageningen University & Research; Max Planck Society; Tuscia University,"Kuhn, U (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Biogeochem Dept, Mainz, Germany.",kuhn@mpch-mainz.mpg.de,"Lloyd, Jonathan J/F-8893-2010; Andreae, Meinrat O./B-1068-2008; Kuhn, Uwe/C-4830-2013; Lelieveld, Jos/A-1986-2013; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010; Pöschl, Ulrich/A-6263-2010; Nobre, Antonio/H-4309-2012; Gatti, Luciana Vanni/J-8569-2012; Spirig, Christoph/D-2471-2014; Kesselmeier, Jürgen/E-2389-2016","Lloyd, Jonathan J/0000-0002-5458-9960; Andreae, Meinrat O./0000-0003-1968-7925; Lelieveld, Jos/0000-0001-6307-3846; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634; Pöschl, Ulrich/0000-0003-1412-3557; Nobre, Antonio/0000-0001-6840-6398; Gatti, Luciana Vanni/0000-0003-4908-8974; Spirig, Christoph/0000-0001-9535-7333; Kesselmeier, Jürgen/0000-0002-4446-534X",,,,,31,123,123,2,57,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Both creators establish a fruitful conversation around friendship, art, architecture and landscape with numerous common interests and places. Since they met in the sixties of the last century, a complicity forged in a similar way of seeing life, a passionate, hedonistic and committed stance, based on a special sensitivity to the environment and a concern for creating for people and not for criticism. Iconoclastic and contradictory, they will recreate the dream of an alternative way of inhabiting the world linked to the tradition of anonymous architecture, to nature and to the landscape with a wild force. This almost ancestral position brings them closer to animals and their essential ways of building a shelter, attentive to the conditions of the place and the climate, while at the same time distancing themselves from the elitist intellectual discourse to find the essence of their discourse in space and construction technique. The objective of this article is to reveal the most determining aspects of this conversation, taking the island of Lanzarote as the setting, delving into some of their residential architectures, their incursions into the design of tourist accommodation and the development of the most intimate spaces of the house. In this motivation to reveal alternatives to industrial and alienated production, in the work of Higueras and Manrique we recognise characteristics of the artisan, a term defined by the sociologist Richard Sennett as a figure of resistance to capitalist dynamics, placing them in a position of manifest contemporaneity.","[Navarro-de-Pablos, Javier] Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura Sevilla, Dept Urbanist & Ordenac Terr Arquitecto, Seville, Spain; [Navarro-de-Pablos, Javier] Univ Roma Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Mayoral-Campa, Esther] Univ Seville, ETSA, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; Sapienza University Rome; University of Sevilla,"Navarro-de-Pablos, J (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",navarrodepablos@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,"UNIV SEVILLA, EDITORIAL",SEVILLE,"SECRETARIADO PUBLICACIONES, C/ PORVENIR, NO 27, SEVILLE, 41013, SPAIN",2171-6897,2173-1616,,PROY PROGRESO ARQUIT,Proy.

Among different bioenergy applications, advanced liquid biofuels produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste biomass have gained interest as promising drop-in alternatives to fossil fuels. However, there is lack of studies in literature that evaluate the potential of HTL as negative emission technology in the context of BECCS and present detailed process design of such an implementation for different types of biomass. In this paper, we perform carbon capture modeling based on state-of-art experimental data on HTL of waste lignocellulosic and urban biomasses by means of physical absorption via the Selexol (TM) process. The process model is utilized for developing a techno-economic analysis that highlights key parameters to optimize CO2 capture cost efficiency. The results indicate that the purity of the CO2 product fulfils the requirements for geological storage in all cases studied, and is on-spec for pipeline transportation when the composition of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2S in the HTL gas are kept below 4 and 1 mol % respectively, or by the implementation of two absorption steps. For the standard process evaluated, the estimated cost of the captured CO2 is between 40 and 53 EUR/tonne, which is in the range of the carbon price expected within this decade in the EU emission trading system, given the announced cap reductions until 2030 and the targets set by the European Green Deal.","[Lozano, E.

Competition in the generation and supply of power provides new business opportunities and strategic business alliances with partners at home and abroad, especially after the introduction of the Energy Community Treaty. A short review of the situation in Croatia regarding liberalization is presented. The analysis of possible variants of the establishment and development of market relations is made, as well as of the corresponding repercussions on short-term and long-term power plant operation and development. Electricity prices are still being regulated by the state and a small share of industrial consumers. Electricity consumption is around 17 TWh which is increasing, supplied by a relatively large share of hydropower plants. This has implications on the development of the power generation sector in Croatia as well as on electricity market operation. Environmental protection in the energy sector implies the primary action in connection with energy efficiency, renewable sources, choice of energy-generating products and application of state-of-the-art protection technologies, quality legislation and supervision, public opinion and education, and promotion of best practices. In this regard the National Environmental Strategy and National Environmental Action Plan has determined its long-term emission reduction objectives for the main air pollutants, in accordance with existing and future obligations related to mitigation of climate change.

A contemporary line of research in EcoDevo aims at gaining insights into the immediate tolerance of organisms and their evolutionary potential to adapt to the changing abiotic and biotic environmental conditions created by anthropogenic climate change. Thus, an EcoDevo perspective may be critical to understand and predict the future of organisms in a changing world. Many decapod crustaceans display a complex life cycle that includes pelagic larvae and, in many subgroups, benthic juvenile-adult stages so that a niche shift occurs during the transition from the larval to the juvenile phase. Already at hatching, the larvae possess a wealth of organ systems, many of which also characterise the adult animals, necessary for autonomously surviving and developing in the plankton and suited to respond adaptively to fluctuations of environmental drivers. They also display a rich behavioural repertoire that allows for responses to environmental key factors such as light, hydrostatic pressure, tidal currents, and temperature. Cells, tissues, and organs are at the basis of larval survival, and as the larvae develop, their organs continue to grow in size and complexity. To study organ development, researchers need a suite of state-of-the-art methods adapted to the usually very small size of the larvae. This review and the companion paper set out to provide an overview of methods to study organogenesis in decapod larvae. This first section focuses on larval rearing, preparation, and fixation, whereas the second describes methods to study cells, tissues, and organs.","[Torres, G.; Gimenez, L.] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Ostkaje 1118, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; [Melzer, R.

Very often the models fail to accurately predict the track and movement of the low pressure systems leading to large spatial errors in the predicted rain. Quantification of errors in forecast rainfall location and amounts is important for forecasters (to choose a forecast and interpret) and modelers for monitoring the impact of changes and improvements in model physics and dynamics configurations. This study aims to quantify and summarize errors in rainfall forecast for heavy rains associated with a Bay of Bengal (BOB) low pressure systems. The verification analysis is based on three heavy rain events during June to September (JJAS) 2015. The performance of the three deterministic models, NCMRWF's Global Forecast Systems (NGFS), NCMRWF's Unified Model (NCUM) and Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator - Global (ACCESS-G) in predicting these heavy rainfall events has been analysed. In addition to standard verification metrics like RMSE, ETS, POD and HK Score, this paper also uses new family of scores like EDS (Extreme Dependency Score), EDI (External Dependence Index) and Symmetric EDI with special emphasis on verification of extreme rainfall to bring out the relative performance of the models for these three rainfall events. The results indicate that Unified modeling framework in NCUM and ACCESS-G by and large performs better than NGFS in rainfall forecasts over India specially at higher lead times. Relatively improved skill in NCUM forecasts can be attributed to (i) improved resolution (similar to 17 km) and (ii) END Game dynamics of NCUM.","[Sharma, Kuldeep; Ashrit, Raghavendra; Rakhi, R.; Iyengar, G.

The transfer to the atmosphere of heat, due to the inefficiency of conversion of chemical energy into other forms of energy, and CO2 is also causing the increase of atmospheric water vapor, a stronger and more abundant greenhouse gas than CO2: all actors (heat, CO2 and H2Ov) concur to increase the temperature of the planet. Partial substitution of fossil-C can be achieved by using biomass, but that alone cannot produce all the energy and goods necessary for our society. Carbon will still be present in our future, but the solution to our problems is integrating solar chemistry and biotechnologies for using atmospheric CO2. This chapter, after an introduction to Carbon Circular Economy-CCE and CO2 utilization in Chemical Industry, considers the various options available of using solar energy for CO2 conversion into energy vectors that may allow to continue to use the existing infrastructures in transport and every-day life. Two options are considered: (i) solar-based water splitting and use of H-2 for chemo-catalytic CO2 conversion using known processes, or (ii) photo-co-processing of water and CO2 to afford energy products and chemicals without H-2 generation, a most innovative technology. The state of the art is provided and barriers to overcome for a large-scale exploitation of the two options are highlighted. The contribution to fossil-C substitution that may come from integration of solar chemistry with material science and biotechnology concludes this chapter.","[Marcolongo, Davide M.

Public lighting in Croatia consumes up to 440.314.330 kWh annually. This represents 2,8% of Croatia's total annual consumption. Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund promotes energy efficiency in public lighting in Croatia by announcing tenders and calls of proposals. Non-refundable financial aid is offered to municipalities in 40-80% of the eligible investment costs for reconstruction of public lighting systems or building new ones. Bearing in mind Fund's Three main targets (energy efficiency, environmental protection and traffic safety), it is obvious that simple replacement of old lights with new ones isn't acceptable. Public lighting, in terms of traffic safety, means meeting with minimal performance requirements of EN 13201 Standard. The Fund defines maximum acceptable performance requirements in terms of energy efficiency and environmental protection. Balancing between those targets represents a challenge in construction of new public lighting systems and an art in reconstruction of the old ones.

As the boundary layer between the ocean and the atmosphere, the SML covers 70% of Earth. The remote-controlled Sea Surface Scanner is based on a glass disk sampler to automate the sampling of the thin SML, overcoming the disadvantages of techniques such as low volume sampling and ex situ measurement of the SML. A suite of in situ sensors for seven biogeochemical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, chromophoric dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll-a, and photosynthetic efficiency) was implemented to characterize the SML in reference to the mixed bulk water. The Sea Surface Scanner has the capability to collect 24 discrete water samples with a volume of 1 L each for further laboratory analysis. Meteorological parameters such as wind speed influence SML properties and are continuously monitored. This paper reports the use of the Sea Surface Scanner to identify and study (i) upwelling regions and associated fronts, (ii) rain events, and (iii) the occurrence of surface blooms. The high patchiness of the SML was detected during the observed sea surface phenomena, and high-resolution mapping of the biogeochemical parameters of the oceanic boundary layer to the atmosphere are presented for the first time. The Sea Surface Scanner is a new technology to map and understand sea surface processes and, ultimately, to fill the gaps in knowledge about ocean-atmosphere interactions relevant to ocean and climate science.","[Ribas-Ribas, Mariana; Mustaffa, Nur Ili Hamizah; Rahlff, Janina; Stolle, Christian; Wurl, Oliver] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Stolle, Christian] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Rostock, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde,"Ribas-Ribas, M (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",mariana.ribas.ribas@uol.de,"Wurl, Oliver/AAQ-9972-2021; Mustaffa, Nur Ili Hamizah/AAJ-9676-2020; Rahlff, Janina/H-9952-2019; Mustaffa, Nur Ili Hamizah/O-8622-2019; Ribas-Ribas, Mariana/L-3501-2013","Mustaffa, Nur Ili Hamizah/0000-0002-3815-3446; Rahlff, Janina/0000-0002-2132-2709; Mustaffa, Nur Ili Hamizah/0000-0002-3815-3446; Ribas-Ribas, Mariana/0000-0003-3318-5462",European Research Council (ERC) project PASSME [GA336408],European Research Council (ERC) project PASSME(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank German Research Foundation (DFG), Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Senckenberg research institutes for the ship time on R/V Meteor (cruise M117) and R/V Senckenberg.

This is central to European transport, economic and environmental policy. Many parts of Europe's rail network were constructed in the mid-19th century, long before the advent of modern construction standards. Historic levels of low investment, poor maintenance strategies and the deleterious effects of climate change (for example scour of bridge foundations due to flooding and rainfall induced landslides) has resulted in critical elements of the rail network such as bridges, tunnels and earthworks being at significant risk of failure. The consequence of failures of major infrastructure elements is severe and can include loss of life, significant replacement costs (typically measured in millions of Euro's) and line closures which can often last for months. The SMART Rail project brings together experts in the areas of highway and railway infrastructure research, SME's and railway authorities who are responsible for the safety of national infrastructure. The goal of the project is to reduce replacement costs, delay and provide environmentally friendly maintenance solutions for ageing infrastructure networks. This will be achieved through the development of state of the art methods to analyze and monitor the existing infrastructure and make realistic scientific assessments of safety. These engineering assessments of current state will be used to design remediation strategies to prolong the life of existing infrastructure in a cost effective manner with minimal environmental impact. This paper presents the organization, scope of work and project objectives of the SMART Rail project.","[Gavin, Kenneth] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland; [Oslakovic, Irina Stipanovic] Univ Twente, Construct Management & Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Vajdic, Marko; Puz, Goran] Inst IGH Dd, Zagreb, Croatia; [Sporcic, Velimir] HZ Infrastruktura Doo, Razvoj, Croatia; [Sporcic, Velimir] HZ Infrastruktura Doo, Gradenje, Croatia",University College Dublin; University of Twente,"Gavin, K (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,5,2,2,2,9,"UNIV ZAGREB, FAC CIVIL ENGINEERING",ZAGREB,"DEPT TRANSPORTATION, KACICEVA 26, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA",1848-9850,,978-953-6272-50-1,ROAD RAIL INFRASTR,,,2012,,,,,429,435,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Transportation,BE5OL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000373110000051,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this region, extensive observations of selected optical parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made in the past and reported on in the literature. Less is known about other optical characteristics that are important in climate modeling and remote sensing. New observational techniques and inversion methods allow for the expansion of the earlier information. Observations have been taken with a state of the art sun photometer for a 1-year period and their analysis will be presented here. Monthly mean AODs at 500 nm were found to be in the range of 0.03-0.12; the monthly mean Angstrom exponent ranged from 0.9 to 1.6, being higher in spring and summer and lower in late fall and winter. Volume size distributions exhibit clear dominance of smaller particles, with a gradual increase in size from winter to spring and into summer. Annual variation of the radii of the smaller and the larger particles ranged between 0.05-0.4 and 4-8 mum, respectively. Radiance measurements at 940 nm were used to estimate precipitable water. The retrieved values compared within limits of uncertainty with independently derived estimates from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) regional weather forecast model.

A survey of family planning provision,BRITISH JOURNAL OF FAMILY PLANNING,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background. Family planning has been delivered through dual provision by general practice and community based clinics since its inception. This may be perceived as duplication of services and can be regarded as an ar-ea of possible disinvestment in a climate of rising health care costs. Aim. A survey of family, planning service provision across a health district was carried out to establish the potential To rationalise current service provision by studying the pattern of service provision in the district and the links between family planning clinics and general practices. Method. A postal questionnaire and covering letter were sent to all practices and clinics in May 1997. Following analysis, results were fed back to clinic staff and general practitioners through accredited meetings. Results. Basic family planning was universally available to the population at all practices and clinics. Clinics offered a wider range of services, especially specialist services for psychosexual counselling and hormonal implants. Very few separate services for young people were identified. Within the primary care sector there was little 'out-of-hours' provision of contraceptive services. Half of the practices responding had used or would use family planning services as referral centres; implants and psychosexual services attracted most referrals. Conclusion. Art understanding of the complementary nature of the services iii primary care and community FP clinics was achieved and agreement was reached that disinvestment ir? clinics locally was not appropriate, The need to I raise public awareness of availability of all contraceptive services was identified. Services in general practice and community clinics are complementary and need to develop a joint strategy to ensure an effective, comprehensive service.

Excess ammonia in the environment also contributes to the acidification and eutrophication of ecosystems(3-5) and to climate change(6). Anthropogenic emissions dominate natural ones and mostly originate from agricultural, domestic and industrial activities(7). However, the total ammonia budget and the attribution of emissions to specific sources remain highly uncertain across different spatial scales(7-9). Here we identify, categorize and quantify the world's ammonia emission hotspots using a high-resolution map of atmospheric ammonia obtained from almost a decade of daily IASI satellite observations. We report 248 hotspots with diameters smaller than 50 kilometres, which we associate with either a single point source or a cluster of agricultural and industrial point sources-with the exception of one hotspot, which can be traced back to a natural source. The state-of-the-art EDGAR emission inventory(10) mostly agrees with satellite-derived emission fluxes within a factor of three for larger regions. However, it does not adequately represent the majority of point sources that we identified and underestimates the emissions of two-thirds of them by at least one order of magnitude. Industrial emitters in particular are often found to be displaced or missing. Our results suggest that it is necessary to completely revisit the emission inventories of anthropogenic ammonia sources and to account for the rapid evolution of such sources over time. This will lead to better health and environmental impact assessments of atmospheric ammonia and the implementation of suitable nitrogen management strategies.","[Van Damme, Martin; Clarisse, Lieven; Whitburn, Simon; Hurtmans, Daniel; Clerbaux, Cathy; Coheur, Pierre-Francois] ULB, Serv Chim Quant & Photophys, Atmospher Spect, Brussels, Belgium; [Hadji-Lazaro, Juliette; Clerbaux, Cathy] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, LATMOS IPSL, UVSQ,CNRS, Paris, France",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Van Damme, M; Clarisse, L (corresponding author), ULB, Serv Chim Quant & Photophys, Atmospher Spect, Brussels, Belgium.",martin.van.damme@ulb.ac.be; lclariss@ulb.ac.be,"Clarisse, Lieven/GQQ-4657-2022; Van Damme, Martin/K-8884-2017","Clarisse, Lieven/0000-0002-8805-2141; Van Damme, Martin/0000-0003-1752-0558","F.R.S.-FNRS; Belgian State Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (Prodex arrangement IASI.FLOW); CNES","F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Belgian State Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (Prodex arrangement IASI.FLOW); CNES(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales)","IASI is a joint mission of EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES, France).

It was founded by Revd Andrew Cranston in 1701 and was established as a charitable trust in 1708. It was the only library specifically exempted from the provisions of the 1708/09 Parochial Libraries Act. From the start it operated as a public lending library and, until the establishment of the Surrey County Library Service in the 1920s, it provided intellectual stimulus for all the people of Reigate, not just the clergy. The collection is not entirely theological, but contains some 2350 volumes on a wide range of subjects. The Library's records of donors, borrowers, and trustees, and the books themselves, provide a fascinating insight into the intellectual climate of the period. In the twenty-first century we endeavour to maintain the Library in good condition as a jewel of the local heritage, and as an academic resource for scholars. All our trustees and helpers are volunteers and we have no financial endowment behind us. We are therefore reliant on the generosity of our supporters and the good offices of the Reigate Decorative and Fine Arts Society and the Cowlishaw conservation workshop to achieve our aims. The opportunities and pitfalls of the digital age present the current trustees with many new challenges as we try to balance the demands of access with security, and preservation with utilization. We take inspiration from our founder and seek to ensure that the Library should flourish for at least another three hundred years.","[Thomas, Andrea; Ely, Hilary] Cranston Lib, Surrey, England; [Ely, Hilary] Chartered Inst Lib & Informat Profess, London, England",,"Thomas, A (corresponding author), Cranston Lib, Surrey, England.",ast@eggconnect.net,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1758-3489,1758-3497,,LIBR INF HIST,Libr.

By monitoring the forest changes, managers and planners can make appropriate decisions to preserve these natural areas. In this regard, this paper presents a novel deep learning-based forest change detection method including two main steps: (1) producing a new difference image enabling a more efficient distinction of changed and unchanged areas, and (2) generating a reliable forest change map by applying the recurrent residual-based U-Net deep neural network (R2U-Net) on the difference image. The recently introduced forest fused difference image (FFDI) is first improved by modifying its weighted angular operator as well as applying the fast local laplacian filter (FLLF) to generate an enhanced forest fused difference image (EFFDI). R2U-Net is subsequently used to segment the EFFDI into the changed and unchanged regions because it preserves their geometric shapes more effectively than other U-net variants. To assess the efficacy of the presented method, experimental results were conducted on four bi-temporal images acquired by the Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 satellite sensors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed EFFDI in reflecting the true forest changes from the background. Moreover, compared with the other conventional U-Net-based models, including U-Net, ResU-Net, and U-Net ++, forest changes and their geometrical details were better preserved by R2U-Net. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed the other state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised change detection methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative results, demonstrating its high potential for forest change detection applications.","[Khankeshizadeh, Ehsan; Mohammadzadeh, Ali; Moghimi, Armin; Mohsenifar, Amin] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Tehran, Iran; [Moghimi, Armin] Leibniz Univ Hannover LUH, Inst Photogrammetry & GeoInformat IPI, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",K.

Pakistan is enriched with a wide variety of feed stocks which can be used for biodiesel production. Pakistan has an enormous potential of biodiesel production from jatropha, plants seed oil and microalgae which needs more consideration and practical applications. Harvesting the potential of microalgae for biodiesel production in Pakistan can be helpful to make it self-sufficient for energy demands. Pakistan is also facing several challenges like climate change, lack of financial resources, state of art technology and absence of appropriate government policies, which limit the commercialization of biodiesel.

Monitoring mangrove forests biomass accurately still remains challenging compared to other forest ecosystems. We investigated the usability of machine learning techniques for the estimation of AGB of mangrove plantation at a coastal area of Hai Phong city (Vietnam). The study employed a GIS database and support vector regression (SVR) to build and verify a model of AGB, drawing upon data from a survey in 25 sampling plots and an integration of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) dual-polarization horizontal transmitting and horizontal receiving (HH) and horizontal transmitting and vertical receiving (HV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral data. The performance of the model was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. Usability of the SVR model was assessed by comparing with four state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, i.e. radial basis function neural networks, multi-layer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The SVR model shows a satisfactory result (R-2 = 0.596, RMSE = 0.187, MAE = 0.123) and outperforms the four machine learning models. The SVR model-estimated AGB ranged between 36.22 and 230.14 Mg ha(-1) (average = 87.67 Mg ha(-1)). We conclude that an integration of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A data used with SVR model can improve the AGB accuracy estimation of mangrove plantations in tropical areas.","[Tien Dat Pham] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Tien Dat Pham] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, CARES, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Yoshino, Kunihiko] Univ Tokyo, Fac Agr, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Nga Nhu Le] VAST, Inst Mech, Dept Marine Mech & Environm, Ba Dinh, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Dept Business & IT, Geog Informat Syst Grp, Bo I Telemark, Norway",University of Tsukuba; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); University of Tokyo; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); University College of Southeast Norway,"Pham, TD (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",dat6784@gmail.com,"Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017; Tien Bui, Dieu/K-2125-2012","Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847; nhu Le, Nga/0000-0001-5845-5233; Tien Bui, Dieu/0000-0001-5161-6479","MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology), Japanese Government","MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology), Japanese Government(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","The authors would like to thank CARES (Center for Agricultural Researches and Ecological Studies), Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA), Vietnam for logistical support during fieldwork.

The World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe in 2005 adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action, which clearly states the urgent need for developing vulnerability index. An extensive literature survey was firstly conducted to find out the State of the Art regarding to the development of systems of indicators of disaster risk and vulnerability at national and sub-national scale. The survey indicates that the system of indicators such as World Risk Index (WRI) is widely accepted. By modifying the WRI index, a new index named GNS (Gross National Safety for natural disasters) was developed in this study. Risk in GNS is defined by Hazard x Exposure x Vulnerability. Five natural events are considered in 2015 version of GNS, including earthquake, tsunami, storm surge, sediment related disaster event, and volcanic activity. An initial calculation was carried out by using various big data available open to public. The results of disaster risk and vulnerability are presented in the prefectural scale in Japan. Our intension is not to provide the ranking of GNS but to offer the policy and decision makers a piece of scientific information for selecting highest priority measures for mitigation in a rational manner. A few commentary remark is added to include the impact of climate change on natural disasters in the safety index system.","[Kusakabe, O.] Int Press In Assoc, Minato Ku, 9F Konan YK Bldg,2-4-12 Konan, Tokyo 1080075, Japan; [Kikumoto, M.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Urban Innovat, Hodogaya Ku, Tokiwadai 79-5, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Shimono, K.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Urban Innovat, Hodogaya Ku, Tokiwadai 79-5, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Itoh, K.] Tokyo City Univ, Dept Urban & Civil Engn, Setagaya Ku, Tamatsutusmi 1-28-1, Tokyo 1588557, Japan; [Inagaki, H.] Kankyo Chishitsu Co Ltd, Kawasaki Ku, Kaiduka 1-4-15-203, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2100014, Japan; [Ohsato, S.] Doshitsu Res Co Ltd, Setagaya Ku, Oh Hara 2-27-31, Tokyo 1560041, Japan; [Watanabe, K.] Obayashi Corp, Tech Res Inst, Shimo Kiyoto 4-640, Kiyose, Tokyo 2048558, Japan",Yokohama National University; Yokohama National University; Tokyo City University; Obayashi Corporation,"Kusakabe, O (corresponding author), Int Press In Assoc, Minato Ku, 9F Konan YK Bldg,2-4-12 Konan, Tokyo 1080075, Japan.",ipa.kusakabe@press-in.org,"Kikumoto, Mamoru/AAX-7764-2020","Kikumoto, Mamoru/0000-0003-0713-7010",,,,,38,0,0,0,1,SOUTHEAST ASIAN GEOTECHNICAL SOC,BANGKOK,"C/O ASIAN INST TECHNOLOGY, PO BOX 2754, BANGKOK, 10501, THAILAND",0046-5828,,,GEOTECH ENG,Geotech.

The robustness of such filters lies in the variety and the quality of the data used to train them. There is, therefore, a need for a tool that automatically generates fake but realistic news. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that automatically generates news headlines. The model is trained with a corpus of existing headlines from different topics. Once trained, the model generates a fake but realistic headline given a seed and a topic. For example, given the seed Kim Jong Un and the topic Business, the model generates the headline kim jong un says climate change is already making money. In order to better capture and leverage the syntactic structure of the headlines for the task of synthetic headline generation, we extend the architecture - Contextual Long Short Term Memory, proposed by Ghosh et al. - to also learn a part-of-speech model. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a real corpora of headlines. We compare our proposed approach and its variants using Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units as the building blocks. We evaluate and compare the topical coherence of the generated headlines using a state-of-the-art classifier. We, also, evaluate the quality of the generated headline using a machine translation quality metric and its novelty using a metric we propose for this purpose. We show that the proposed model is practical and competitively efficient and effective.","[Dandekar, Ashish; Bressan, Stephane] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Zen, Remmy A.

Mapping water bodies from remote places, such as polar regions, using traditional surveying method is a laborious and logistically expensive task. A rapid method for extracting and monitoring water bodies in Antarctic coastal oases has a tremendous application in remote sensing. This study discusses the design of a rapid and novel method to extract water body features in Antarctic coastal oasis environment from remotely-sensed images. We devised semiautomatic approach for extracting water body features based on a novel set of normalized difference water index (NDWI) by incorporating high-resolution WorldView-2 (WV-2) panchromatic and multispectral image data. This study highlights and compares the viability of state-of-the-art spectral processing water body extraction approaches with the newly designed NDWI approach. An extensive quantitative evaluation was carried out to test the newly designed NDWI approach for extracting water bodies on Larsemann Hills, eastern Antarctica. The results suggest that the modified NDWI approach render intermediate performance with bias error varying from similar to 1 to similar to 34 m(2) (least amount of misclassified pixels). We also analyzed the distinctive 8-band capability of WV-2 data coupled with semiautomatic extraction methods to compare their reliability in extracting the water body area. The results indicate that the use of the modified NDWI approach on 8-band WV-2 data can significantly improve the semiautomatic extraction of water body features, which can ultimately contribute to an enhanced perceptive of the Antarctic coastal oasis in the context of climate change.

The dates of the beginning of different ice events (e.g. ice drift, ice-cover formation, frazil ice drift, etc.) are analysed as well as the duration of such events for 16 rivers typical of the Russian Arctic. It is demonstrated that ice on Arctic rivers of Asian Russia forms earlier and breaks up later compared to those of European Russia; this is explained by the more severe climate conditions that affect the northern areas of Siberia. Ice-cover duration on the study rivers varies from 140 to 250 days with the maximum duration being observed in the; lower reaches of large rivers in East Siberia and the Far East. Ice-cover duration and the latitude of the observation stations are strongly correlated. The dynamics of ice-cover growth and melting on rivers, ice thickness and snow-pack depth on the ice are considered in different parts of the Russian Arctic. It is demonstrated that the nature of ice growth during the autumn-winter period and its decrease in spring mainly depend on the thermal conditions during a particular year. In years with low air temperatures, ice-cover thickness in the rivers of the Far East can attain 200 cm and greater, meanwhile it tray be 50 or 60 em only in the rivers of European Russia if the winter is warm. Particular case studies are given to illustrate these features.

The pilot phase of GSWP deals with the production of a two-year global dataset of soil moisture, temperature, runoff, and surface fluxes by integrating uncoupled land surface schemes (LSSs) using externally specified surface forcings from observations and standardized soil and vegetation distributions. Approximately one dozen participating LSS groups in five nations have taken the common ISLSCP forcing data to drive their state-of-the-art models over the 1987-88 period to generate global datasets. Many of the LSS groups have performed specific sensitivity studies, which are intended to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in model parameters and forcing fields on simulation of the surface water and energy balances. A validation effort exists to compare the global products to other forms of estimation and measurement, either directly (by comparison to field studies or soil moisture measuring networks) or indirectly (e.g., use of modeled runoff to drive river routing schemes for comparison to streamflow data). The soil wetness data produced are also being tested within general circulation models to evaluate their quality and their impact on seasonal to interannual climate simulations. An Inter-Comparison Center has also been established for evaluating and comparing data from the different LSSs. Comparison among the model results is used to assess the uncertainty in estimates of surface components of the moisture and energy balances at large scales and as a quality check on the model products themselves.","Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Winand Staring Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands; Japanese Meteorol Agcy, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan",,"Dirmeyer, PA (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",dirmeyer@cola.iges.org,"Dirmeyer, Paul/P-3275-2019; Dirmeyer, Paul/B-6553-2016","Dirmeyer, Paul/0000-0003-3158-1752; Dirmeyer, Paul/0000-0003-3158-1752; Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457",,,,,73,263,270,0,18,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Two classic micrometeorological methods (aerodynamic and modified Bowen ratio) have been applied to estimate net GEM exchange rates and to determine the response of the GEM flux to changes in environmental conditions (e. g. heavy rain, summer ozone) on an ecosystem-scale. Both methods proved to be appropriate to estimate fluxes on time scales of a few hours and longer. Average dry deposition rates up to 4.3 ng m(-2) h(-1) and mean deposition velocities up to 0.10 cm s(-1) were measured, which indicates that during the active vegetation period temperate grasslands are a small net sink for atmospheric mercury. With increasing ozone concentrations depletion of GEM was observed, but could not be quantified from the flux signal. Night-time deposition fluxes of GEM were measured and seem to be the result of mercury co-deposition with condensing water. Effects of grass cuts could also be observed, but were of minor magnitude.","[Fritsche, J.; Alewell, C.] Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Wohlfahrt, G.; Hammerle, A.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Ammann, C.] Agroscope Reckenholz Taenikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zeeman, M.] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Obrist, D.] Desert Res Inst, Div Atmospher Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA",University of Basel; University of Innsbruck; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE,"Fritsche, J (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, Bernoullistr 30, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",johannes.fritsche@unibas.ch,"Wohlfahrt, Georg/D-2409-2009; Zeeman, Matthias J/E-4604-2011; Zeeman, Matthias/N-8713-2019; Hammerle, Albin/N-4345-2016; Alewell, Christine/K-5104-2016","Wohlfahrt, Georg/0000-0003-3080-6702; Zeeman, Matthias J/0000-0001-9186-2519; Zeeman, Matthias/0000-0001-9186-2519; Hammerle, Albin/0000-0003-1963-5906; Alewell, Christine/0000-0001-9295-9806; Ammann, Christof/0000-0002-0783-5444","Swiss National Science Foundation [200020-113327/1, 200021-105949]; Austrian National Science Foundation [P17560-B03]",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Austrian National Science Foundation,"We thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (project numbers: 200020-113327/1 to D.

With this alarming carbon footprint, food protein waste not only contributes to climate change but also significantly impacts other environmental boundaries, such as nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, global freshwater use, change in land composition, chemical pollution, and biodiversity loss. This contrasts sharply with both the high nutritional value of proteins, as well as their unique chemical and physical versatility, which enable their use in new materials and innovative technologies. In this review, we discuss how food protein waste can be efficiently valorized not only by reintroduction into the food chain supply but also as a template for the development of sustainable technologies by allowing it to exit the food-value chain, thus alleviating some of the most urgent global challenges. We showcase three technologies of immediate significance and environmental impact: biodegradable plastics, water purification, and renewable energy. We discuss, by carefully reviewing the current state of the art, how proteins extracted from food waste can be valorized into key players to facilitate these technologies. We furthermore support analysis of the extant literature by original life cycle assessment (LCA) examples run ad hoc on both plant and animal waste proteins in the context of the technologies considered, and against realistic benchmarks, to quantitatively demonstrate their efficacy and potential. We finally conclude the review with an outlook on how such a comprehensive management of food protein waste is anticipated to transform its carbon footprint from positive to negative and, more generally, have a favorable impact on several other important planetary boundaries.","[Peydayesh, Mohammad; Bagnani, Massimo; Soon, Wei Long; Mezzenga, Raffaele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Soon, Wei Long] Nanyang Technol Univ, Ctr Sustainable Mat SusMat, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Mezzenga, Raffaele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Mezzenga, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Mezzenga, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",raffaele.mezzenga@hest.ethz.ch,"Peydayesh, Mohammad/K-9971-2019","Peydayesh, Mohammad/0000-0002-6265-3811; Bagnani, Massimo/0000-0002-1326-1600",,,,,633,3,3,50,50,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0009-2665,1520-6890,,CHEM REV,Chem.

Many machine-learning methods including deep learning can be employed for ice-type detection, and most classifiers tend to prefer different feature combinations. In order to find the optimal classifier-feature assembly (OCF) for sea ice classification, it is necessary to assess their performance differences. The objective of this letter is to make a recommendation for the OCF for sea ice classification using Cryosat-2 (CS-2) data. Six classifiers including convolutional neural network (CNN), Bayesian, K nearest-neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were studied. CS-2 altimeter data of November 2015 and May 2016 in the whole Arctic were used. The overall accuracy was estimated using multivalidation to evaluate the performances of individual classifiers with different feature combinations. Overall, RF achieved a mean accuracy of 89.15%, followed by Bayesian, SVM, and BPNN (similar to 86%), outperforming the worst (CNN and KNN) by 7%. Trailingedge width (TeW) and leading-edge width (LeW) were the most important features, and feature combination of TeW, LeW, Sigma0, maximum of the returned power waveform (MAX), and pulse peakiness (PP) was the best choice.

An understanding of the role played by tidewater glaciers in marine primary production is still affected by a lack of data from close proximity to glacier fronts, to which, for safety reasons, manned surface vessels cannot get too close. In this context, autonomous marine vehicles can play a key role in collecting high quality data in dangerous interface areas. In particular, the contribution given by light, portable, and modular marine robots is discussed in this paper. The state-of-the-art of technology and of operating procedures is established on the basis of the experience gained in campaigns carried out by Italian National Research Council (CNR) robotic researchers in Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard Islands, in 2015, 2017, and 2018 respectively. The aim was to demonstrate the capability of an Unmanned Semi-Submersible Vehicle (USSV): (i) To collect water samples in contact with the front of a tidewater glacier; (ii) to work in cooperation with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for sea surface and air column characterisation in the proximity of the fronts of the glaciers; and (iii) to perform, when equipped with suitable tools and instruments, repetitive sampling of water surface as well as profiling the parameters of the water and air column close to the fronts of the tidewater glaciers. The article also reports the issues encountered in navigating in the middle of bergy bits and growlers as well as the problems faced in using some sensors at high latitudes.","[Bruzzone, Gabriele; Odetti, Angelo; Caccia, Massimo; Ferretti, Roberta] Ist iNgn Mare CNR INM, Uos Genoa, Consiglio Nazl Ric, Via Marini 6, I-16149 Genoa, Italy; [Ferretti, Roberta] Univ Ferrara, UniFe Dipartimento Fis & Sci Terra, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ingegneria del Mare (INM-CNR); University of Ferrara,"Bruzzone, G (corresponding author), Ist iNgn Mare CNR INM, Uos Genoa, Consiglio Nazl Ric, Via Marini 6, I-16149 Genoa, Italy.",gabriele.bruzzone@cnr.it; angelo.odetti@inm.cnr.it; massimo.caccia@cnr.it; roberta.ferretti@inm.cnr.it,"Odetti, Angelo/O-2931-2015; Bruzzone, Gabriele/B-5771-2015; Ferretti, Roberta/P-3724-2018","Odetti, Angelo/0000-0003-0338-0742; Bruzzone, Gabriele/0000-0002-9569-1160; Caccia, Massimo/0000-0002-4482-4541; Ferretti, Roberta/0000-0002-1985-2145",Arctic: Present Climatic change and pAst extreme events (ARCA); EC Horizon 2020 Twinning EXCELLABUST-Excelling LABUST in marine robotics [691980],Arctic: Present Climatic change and pAst extreme events (ARCA); EC Horizon 2020 Twinning EXCELLABUST-Excelling LABUST in marine robotics,This work was partially funded by the projects Arctic: Present Climatic change and pAst extreme events (ARCA) and EC Horizon 2020 Twinning EXCELLABUST-Excelling LABUST in marine robotics G.A. 691980.,,49,7,7,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUN,2020,11,,,,,,1707,10.3390/rs12111707,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12111707,,,30,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,MC6LX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000543397000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Photochemical escape of hot atoms is crucial to the long-term evolution of the Martian climate. For atomic C and N, photochemical escape is primarily driven by photodissociation (PD) of CO and N-2. Aims. Combining the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) measurements of atmospheric neutral densities and solar EUV/X-ray irradiance, we perform a state-of-the-art analysis of atomic C and N escape on Mars. Methods. For each MAVEN orbit, we calculated the hot C and N production rates in the dayside Martian upper atmosphere via PD, from which the escape rates are estimated using a simplified technique to parameterize the respective escape probabilities taking into account multiple collisions with ambient neutrals. Results. The mean C and N escape rates are 1 x 10(24) s(-1) and 9 x 10(24) s(-1), appropriate for low to moderate solar activity conditions, and thermospheric PD makes a larger contribution to the total N escape than to the total C escape. The above differences highlight the importance of nascent energy, with more energetic nascent escaping atoms able to survive collisions with ambient neutrals more easily, thus extending down to deeper regions of the atmosphere. Solar cycle variation in C and N escape is revealed by our analysis, whereas solar zenith angle variation is absent for both species. These results could be explained by the fact that the production of nascent escaping atoms responds to varying solar illumination angle at low altitudes where the escape probability is negligible, but responds to varying level of solar EUV/X-ray irradiance at high altitudes where the atmosphere is essentially collisionless.","[Cui, J.] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Cui, J.; Wu, X. -S.; Jiang, F. -Y.] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Lunar & Deep Space Explorat, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cui, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Gu, H.] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Space Sci Inst, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wei, Y.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Earth & Planetary Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Astronomical Observatory, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Macau University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geology & Geophysics, CAS","Cui, J (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Cui, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Lunar & Deep Space Explorat, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cui, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",cuijun7@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Karapinar, Nurdan/E-8058-2019; Wei, Yong/H-5112-2011; Hao, Gu/AAZ-3604-2020","Karapinar, Nurdan/0000-0001-8301-5897; Wei, Yong/0000-0001-7183-0229; Hao, Gu/0000-0002-9831-0618; Jiang, Fayu/0000-0002-5332-0214; Cui, Jun/0000-0002-4721-8184","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41525015, 41774186, 41525016]; Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau SAR (FDCT) [039/2013/A2, 082/2015/A3]",National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau SAR (FDCT),"J.C. and Y.W. acknowledge supports from the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) through grants 41525015, 41774186, and 41525016.

Protection of extant seagrass often requires a zoning approach to fit the local conditions and to identify the spatial prioritization. In this study, we integrated the state-of-the-art machine learning model (CatBoost) and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery for mapping the extent of seagrass meadows, combined with the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), fuzzy logic (Sigmoidal membership function), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique in a GIS database to score the ecological protection zoning of seagrass ecosystem in Lap An lagoon, Vietnam. Seagrass map retrieved from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery was used as the constrain factor, whilst salinity, water depth, substratum, and distance to aquaculture sites were conditioning factors. Our results presented accurate mapping of seagrass meadows in the study site (scores of overall accuracy, precision, and F-1 are 0.93, 0.90 and 0.92, respectively) and indicated 22.05 ha (scores 0.66-0.99) in high, 18.63 ha (scores 0.33-0.66) in medium, and 10.80 ha (scores 0-0.33) in low priority of protection in the southern and the eastern southwest parts of the lagoon, and the areas closed to the aquaculture sites, respectively. Our novel integrated approach to map the priority zones is useful for sustainable protection and management of seagrass meadows and provides a framework to strengthen the application of remote sensing and GIS-based techniques for further conservation of seagrass globally.","[Ha, Nam Thang; Tran, Thi Thuy Hang] Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Fisheries, Hue 530000, Vietnam; [Pham, Tien Dat] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Hue University; Nong Lam University; Macquarie University,"Ha, NT (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Fisheries, Hue 530000, Vietnam.",hanamthang@hueuni.edu.vn; ttthang87@hueuni.edu.vn,"Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017","Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847",,,,,87,1,1,3,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,DEC,2021,8,,,,,,122,10.1007/s13157-021-01504-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01504-8,,,15,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XN2RI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000729357200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Man-made structures provide diverse habitats where algae can grow, mainly aerophytic in nature. Literature reveals that algae that is potentially harmful to humans do occur in the anthropogenic environment in the air, on surfaces or in water bodies. Algae may negatively affect humans in different ways: they may be toxic, allergenic and pathogenic to humans or attack human structures. Toxin-producing alga are represented in the built environment mainly by blue green algae (Cyanoprokaryota). In special occasions, other toxic algae may also be involved. Green algae (Chlorophyta) found airborne or growing on manmade surfaces may be allergenic whereas Cyanoprokaryota and other forms may not only be toxic but also allergenic. Pathogenicity is found only in a special group of algae, especially in the genus Prototheca. In addition, rare cases with infections due to algae with green chloroplasts are reported. Algal action may be involved in the biodeterioration of buildings and works of art, which is still discussed controversially. Whereas in many cases the disfigurement of surfaces and even the corrosion of materials is encountered, in other cases a protective effect on the materials is reported. A comprehensive list of 79 taxa of potentially harmful, airborne algae supplemented with their counterparts occurring in the built environment, is given. Due to global climate change, it is not unlikely that the built environment will suffer from more and higher amounts of harmful algal species in the future. Therefore, intensified research in composition, ecophysiology and development of algal growth in the built environment is indicated.","[Hofbauer, Wolfgang Karl] Fraunhofer Inst Bauphysik, Umwelt Hyg & Sensorik, 83626 Valley, Bavaria, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Hofbauer, WK (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Bauphysik, Umwelt Hyg & Sensorik, 83626 Valley, Bavaria, Germany.",wolfgang.hofbauer@ibp.fraunhofer.de,,"Hofbauer, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6703-5548",,,,,304,3,3,8,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-6651,,TOXINS,Toxins,JUL,2021,7,,,,,,465,10.3390/toxins13070465,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins13070465,,,28,Food Science & Technology; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology; Toxicology,TO5QZ,34209446,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000676967200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While these crops are the primary supplier of carbohydrates, they lack essential amino acids and minerals for a balanced nutrition. The overdependence on only few crops makes the future cropping systems vulnerable to the predicted climate change. Diversifying food resources through incorporation of orphan or minor crops in modern cropping systems is one potential strategy to improve the nutritional security and mitigate the hostile weather patterns. One such crop is buckwheat, which can contribute to the agricultural sustainability as it grows in a wide range of environments, requires relatively low inputs and possess balanced amino acid and micronutrient profiles. Additionally, gluten-free nature of protein and nutraceutical properties of secondary metabolites make the crop a healthy alternative of wheat-based diet in developed countries. Despite enormous potential, efforts for the genetic improvement of buckwheat are considerably lagged behind the conventional cereal crops. With the draft genome sequences in hand, there is a great scope to speed up the progress of genetic improvement of buckwheat. This article outlines the state of the art in buckwheat research and provides concrete perspectives how modern breeding approaches can be implemented to accelerate the genetic gain. Our suggestions are transferable to many minor and underutilized crops to address the issue of limited genetic gain and low productivity.","[Joshi, D.

Coding oneself as an artist in this climate became synonymous with internalizing the codes of formalized arts education. As a reaction to the shift toward compulsory academicization, radical pedagogical formats proliferated in artistic output of the 1960s. At precisely this moment, the lecture-performance emerged as a vital aesthetic form. Throughout the decade, artists mobilized the format to imagine how knowledge may be produced and disseminated outside the academy: within alternative institutional frameworks, beyond authorized communicative forms and through embodied modes of performativity. Bringing its hitherto nebulous history into focus, this essay traces the deployment of the lecture-performance by postwar practitioners, contending that the origins of the format lie in artists' critical responses to the university and the impetus to produce streamlined verbal discourse surrounding their work. Robert Morris's 21.3 singularly addresses the conditions of academic institutionalization to which artistic practice had become subject. Despite its contemporary prominence, the origins of the lecture-performance in the 1960s remain critically neglected. Current paradigmatic shifts within the academy and the post-Fordist conversion of the educator into a manager of knowledge assets' demand that we revisit these early pedagogical experiments with ever-greater urgency. Looking backward toward Morris and lecture-performances of the postwar period, this essay charts possibilities for radical modes of knowledge production, performative pedagogy and zones of resistance in the present.",,,,,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1352-8165,1469-9990,,PERFORM RES,Perform.

The purpose of the 3MI is to provide multi-spectral (12 channels between 410 and 2130 nm), multi-polarization (-60 degrees, 0 degrees, and +60 degrees), and multi-angular (10 to 14 views) images of the Earth top of atmosphere outgoing radiance. 3MI does not have an onboard calibration facility and its radiometric and geometric performance will rely on vicarious calibration. The aim of this paper is to present the state of the art of vicarious calibration methods applicable to 3MI. The 3MI measurement principle is based on the French atmospheric mission PARASOL (Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar) heritage [1]. This allows adapting the vicarious calibration methods of the PARASOL mission to the needs of 3MI. However, the monitoring of the SWIR (short wave infrared) channels will be a new challenge for the 3MI calibration as this spectral range was not present on PARASOL. The cross-calibration with other instruments flying on the same satellite will support the calibration of 3MI. Indeed the Metop-SG payload includes two other optical instruments covering the same spectral regions. METimage and Sentinel-5 will both be equipped with on-board calibration capabilities and provide valuable measurements for vicarious calibration of 3MI. Further cross-calibration with Earth observation instruments on other satellites, will be studied.","[Marbach, T.; Lacan, A.; Schluessel, P.] EUMETSAT, Eumetsat Allee 1, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany; [Fougnie, B.] Ctr Natl Etud Spatiales, 18 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France",European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites,"Marbach, T (corresponding author), EUMETSAT, Eumetsat Allee 1, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany.",thierry.marbach@eumetsat.int,,"Schlussel, Peter/0000-0003-2552-3425",,,,,11,1,1,1,10,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-1-5106-0404-9; 978-1-5106-0405-6,PROC SPIE,,,2016,,,,,,,UNSP 1000017,10.1117/12.2239601,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2239601,,,9,"Engineering, Aerospace; Optics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Optics,BG7MZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000391489900028,View Full Record in Web of Science

This field is determined by the largest scale patterns of magnetism at the solar surface, dominated by the lower latitude active regions during cycle maximum and by the circumpolar fields during cycle minimum. Whereas the magnetic field in the activity belt is readily studied, the high-latitude field is much less accessible, and its study requires a combination of modeling and observation. Current models hold that the high-latitude magnetic field on the Sun is determined solely by the accumulation of field transported poleward from lower latitude active regions. We test this hypothesis by simulating the evolution of the magnetic field at the solar surface and in the heliosphere during the last 340 yr using a state-of-the-art model that incorporates all processes that are known to contribute significantly to the evolution of the large-scale patterns in the solar field. We find that if only the emergence frequency of magnetic bipoles is varied in accordance with observed sunspot records, the polar- cap field reservoir does not match measurements during past years. Based on comparisons of our simulations with observed polar fluxes over the last few decades and with the proxy for the heliospheric flux formed by 340 yr of Be-10 ice-core data, we suggest that the high-latitude field may be subject to decay on a timescale of 5-10 yr. We discuss the consequences of this finding for our understanding of the Sun-Earth connection and explore inferences for the coupling of the Sun's internal magnetic field to the heliospheric field.","Lockheed Martin Adv Technol Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94394 USA",Lockheed Martin,"Schrijver, CJ (corresponding author), Lockheed Martin Adv Technol Ctr, L9-41,Bldg 252,3251 Hanover St, Palo Alto, CA 94394 USA.",,,"Schrijver, Carolus/0000-0002-6010-8182; DeRosa, Marc/0000-0002-6338-0691",,,,,31,120,120,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0004-637X,,,ASTROPHYS J,Astrophys.

To complement previous studies of incubating females, 39 males were necropsied and from a subsample of these a biochemical and haematological profile was obtained. The birds were emaciated and cachexic having a 50% reduction in body mass. Twenty-nine eiders were diagnosed with hydropericardium, 15 had hunger edema, three birds had enteritis and a single air sac infection. All birds were infested with intestinal Polymorphus minutus and 32 of these with the intestinal Trematoda spp. Microscopic parasitic investigations identified endoparasitic trematodes of the families Bucephhalidae, Echinostomidae, Notocotyluridae and Levinsiniella. White blood cell count showed slight heterophilia and lymphopenia while the albumin: globulin ratio (0.28) indicated stress, immune supression and inflammatory reactions supported by a high heterophil: lymphocyte index (13). Declined plasma concentration of glucose, fructosamine, amylase, albumin and protein likewise indicated long-term starvation prior to mortality indicating phase III starvation (catabolism of protein). The dramatic increase in aspartate transaminase, glutamate-dehydrogenase, lactate-dehydrogenase and bile acids indicate liver disorders while dehydration, renal, heart and bone disorders was reflected in the increased uric acid, urea, phosphor and potassium values. These findings show that male eiders undergo long-term starvation and multi organ failure similar to that of incubating females previously reported from the same colony. It increases our knowledge of the physiology of starving eiders and add to our understanding of the recurrent mortality events in the colony that seems to be linked to changes in food availability being an important factor together with a warmer climate in a declining Baltic eider population. We recommend future studies to focus on food composition, migration patterns and environmental changes including parasitic infections and global warming. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Land degradation has a negative impact on the livelihood and food security worldwide. The annual cost of land degradation caused by land use land cover change is estimated at 231 billion US dollars. It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by global climate change and, on the other hand, population growth have increased the rate of urbanization in Iran. In this study, to monitor the recent urbanization, several advanced and state-of-the-art classification algorithms, including small and large neural networks, support vector machine, and the genetic algorithm multi-layer perceptron (GAMLP) model, are developed in R and MATLAB programming languages for land use land cover modeling in the years 1990 and 2018 of the Shiraz City. For the year 1990, the SVM algorithm has the best performance in terms of overall accuracy and kappa indices with the values of 93.55 and 89.22, respectively. The SVM classifier has better performance for the year 2018 as well, with values of 98.37 and 95.76 for the overall accuracy and kappa indices. The developed GAMLP model has better performance over the other two small and deep neural network classifiers with the values of 92.88 and 89.09 for the year 1990 and values of 97.38 and 93.12 for overall accuracy and kappa indices for the year 2018.

Rainfall is a prime example, as it exhibits unique characteristics of high volatility and chaotic patterns that do not exist in other time series data. Moreover, rainfall is essential for applications that surround financial securities, such as rainfall derivatives. This paper extensively evaluates a novel algorithm called Decomposition Genetic Programming (DGP), which is an algorithm that decomposes the problem of rainfall into subproblems. Decomposition allows the GP to focus on each subproblem, before combining back into the full problem. The GP does this by having a separate regression equation for each subproblem, based on the level of rainfall. As we turn our attention to subproblems, this reduces the difficulty when dealing with data sets with high volatility and extreme rainfall values, since these values can be focused on independently. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on 42 cities from Europe and the USA, and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art (Markov chain extended with rainfall prediction), and six other popular machine learning algorithms (Genetic Programming without decomposition, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Neural Networks, M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, and k-Nearest Neighbours). Results show that the DGP is able to consistently and significantly outperform all other algorithms. Lastly, another contribution of this work is to discuss the effect that DGP has had on the coverage of the rainfall predictions and whether it shows robust performance across different climates.

This facility is designed for product development testing of heavy trucks and buses in a range of controllable environments. Having this unique test environment at the main development center enables Scania to test its vehicles in a controlled repeatable environment year round, improving lead times from design to production, producing higher quality and more reliable vehicles, and significantly improves the capability for large vehicle performance research. This state-of-the-art facility provides environmental conditions from -35 degrees C to 50 degrees C with humidity control from 5 to 95 percent. The 13 m(2) nozzle wind tunnel can produce wind speeds up to 100 km/h. The dynamometer is rated at 800 kW for the rear axle and 150 kW for the front axle, which also has +/- 10 degrees yaw capability. In addition to the 'standard features' listed above for a climatic wind tunnel, this facility includes several additional capabilities. A Flow Control Device to improve the aerodynamic simulation around the sides of large, long vehicles in the test section was developed and implemented. Acoustic treatments in the circuit and test section plenum were designed to produce low background noise levels suitable for vehicle acoustic tests. This facility is also capable of producing complete simulation of solar, rain, snow, and soiling conditions. Moreover, emissions can be measured under road load conditions and in varying climates with different supplies of fuels.

Additionally, Z(r) observations are usually only representative of a single plant or several plants, which can differ greatly from the effective Z(r) over a modeling unit (e.g., catchment or grid-box). Here, we provide a global parameterization of an analytical Z(r) model that balances the marginal carbon cost and benefit of deeper roots, and produce a climatological (i.e., 1982-2010 average) global Z(r) map. To test the Z(r) estimates, we apply the estimated Z(r) in a highly transparent hydrological model (i.e., the Budyko-Choudhury-Porporato (BCP) model) to estimate mean annual actual evapotranspiration (E) across the globe. We then compare the estimated E with both water balance-based E observations at 32 major catchments and satellite grid-box retrievals across the globe. Our results show that the BCP model, when implemented with Z(r) estimated herein, optimally reproduced the spatial pattern of E at both scales (i.e., R-2=0.94, RMSD=74 mm yr(-1) for catchments, and R-2=0.90, RMSD=125 mm yr(-1) for grid-boxes) and provides improved model outputs when compared to BCP model results from two already existing global Z(r) data sets. These results suggest that our Z(r) estimates can be effectively used in state-of-the-art hydrological models, and potentially biogeochemical models, where the determination of Z(r) currently largely relies on biome type-based look-up tables.","[Yang, Yuting; Donohue, Randall J.; McVicar, Tim R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Donohue, Randall J.; McVicar, Tim R.] Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Yang, YT (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",yuting.yang@csiro.au,"yang, yuting/Y-7885-2018; Yang, Yuting/C-8527-2014; Donohue, Randall/A-8446-2011; McVicar, Tim R/D-8614-2011","yang, yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; Yang, Yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; McVicar, Tim R/0000-0002-0877-8285",CSIRO OCE postdoctoral Fellowship program,CSIRO OCE postdoctoral Fellowship program,"We acknowledge CSIRO Land and Water and CSIRO Agriculture.

With considerable uncertainties related to retrieval based on observations, a numerical study is a powerful method, if not the only one, to provide a better and more accurate understanding of retrieved optically effective ACRIs of aged black carbon (BC) particles. Numerical investigations of the optically effective ACRIs of polydisperse coated BC aggregates retrieved from their accurate scattering and absorption properties, which are calculated by the multiple-sphere T-matrix method (MSTM), without overall particle shape variations during retrieval, are carried out. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of aerosol microphysics, including shell/core ratio D-p/D-c, BC geometry, BC position inside coating, and size distribution, on retrieved optically effective ACRIs of coated BC particles. At odds with expectations, retrieved optically effective ACRIs of coated BC particles in coarse mode are not merely impacted by their chemical compositions and shell/core ratio, being highly complicated functions of particle microphysics. However, in accumulation mode, the coated BC optically effective ACRI is dominantly influenced by particle chemical compositions and the shell/core ratio. The popular volume-weighted average (VWA) method and effective medium theory (EMT) provide acceptable ACRI results for coated BC in accumulation mode, and the resulting uncertainties in particle scattering and absorption are both less than approximately 10 %. For coarse coated BC, the VWA and EMT, nevertheless, produce dramatically higher imaginary parts than those of optically effective ACRIs, significantly overestimating particle absorption by a factor of nearly 2 for heavily coated BC with a large BC fractal dimension or BC close to the coating boundary. Using the VWA could introduce significant overestimation in aged BC absorption analysis studies, and this may be one of the reasons why modeled aerosol optical depth is 20% larger than observed, since it is widely employed in the state-of-the-art aerosol-climate models. We propose a simple new ACRI parameterization for fully coated BC with D-p/D-c >= 2.0 in coarse mode, which can serve as a guide for the improvement of ACRIs of heavily coated BC, and its scattering and absorption errors are reduced by a factor of nearly 2 compared to the VWA. Our study indicates that a reliable estimate of the radiative effects of aged BC particles in coarse mode would require accounting for the optically effective ACRI, rather than the ACRI given by the VWA, in aerosol-climate models.","[Zhang, Xiaolin; Mao, Mao; Yin, Yan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Key Lab Aerosol Cloud Precipitat,Joint Int Res La, Minist Educ KLME,China Meteorol Adm,ESMC,CIC FEMD, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaolin; Mao, Mao; Yin, Yan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Zhang, XL; Mao, M (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Key Lab Aerosol Cloud Precipitat,Joint Int Res La, Minist Educ KLME,China Meteorol Adm,ESMC,CIC FEMD, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XL; Mao, M (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xlnzhang@nuist.edu.cn; mmao@nuist.edu.cn,"Yin, Yan/I-8350-2014","Yin, Yan/0000-0002-8391-2712","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91644224 41505127, 21406189]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150901]; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [15KJB170009]; Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education [KLME201810]; Startup Foundation for introducing Talent of NUIST [2015r002, 2014r011]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M591883]; Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds [1601262C]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education; Startup Foundation for introducing Talent of NUIST; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (nos. 91644224 41505127, and 21406189), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (no.

Orkney holds a special place in this discussion, since the sheep of North Ronaldsay have been confined to the seashores since the early nineteenth century, and are entirely adapted to a diet consistingmainly of seaweeds. Here, we report the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of twenty-five faunal specimens from the Neolithic chambered tomb ofQuanterness, Orkney. Three of the 12 sheep analysed showelevated delta C-13 values that can only be explained by the consumption of seaweed. Radiocarbon dates place two of the three animals in the Neolithic, coevalwith the use of the monument for burial, while the third animal dates to the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age. The findings are placed into the wider context of previous isotopic analyses of domestic fauna from prehistoric Orkney. A possible disjoint is noted between the results for bone collagen-where seaweed consumption seems to relate to the pre-natal period, since all the animals with high delta C-13 values are less than ca. three months of age-and previous studies using high-resolution sequential enamel measurements, which suggest a repeated pattern of winter consumption of seaweed in older animals.

However, this problem receives little attention. Applying a DPSIR approach (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses), we analyzed the environmental impacts and their effects on urban hydrosystems (including stagnant waters), and suggest possible solutions from a series of case studies worldwide. We find that rivers in the Global South, with their distinctive geographical and socio-political setting, display significant differences from the Urban Stream Syndrome described so far in temperate zones. We introduce the term of 'Southern Urban Hydrosystem Syndrome' for the biophysical problems as well as the social interactions, including the perception of water bodies by the urbanites, the interactions of actors (e.g., top-down, bottom-up), and the motivations that drive urban hydrosystem restoration projects of the Global South. Supported by a synthesis of case studies (with a focus on Brazilian restoration projects), this paper summarizes the state of the art, highlights the currently existing lacunae for research, and delivers examples of practical solutions that may inform UNESCO's North-South-South dialogue to solve these urgent problems. Two elements appear to be specifically important for the success of restoration projects in the Global South, namely the broad acceptance and commitment of local populations beyond merely 'ecological' justifications, e.g., healthy living environments and ecosystems with cultural linkages ('River Culture'). To make it possible implementable/practical solutions must be extended to (often poor) people having settled along river banks and wetlands.","[Wantzen, Karl M.; Cao, Yixin; Rotge, Vincent; Zingraff-Hamed, Aude] Univ Tours, CNRS, UMR 7324, CITERES, F-37200 Tours, France; [Wantzen, Karl M.] UNESCO Chair River Culture Fleuves & Patrimoine, F-37200 Tours, France; [Mascarenhas Alves, Carlos Bernardo; Neves, Moana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Projeto Manuelzao, Nuvelhas, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-30270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Badiane, Sidia Diaouma] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar, Lab Biogeog, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal; [Bala, Raita; Mahdi, Obaidullah] PolyTech Tours, Dept Amenagement & Environm, Int Master Urban Planning & Sustainabil, F-37200 Tours, France; [Blettler, Martin] Natl Inst Limnol INALI, Ciudad Univ, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Blettler, Martin] CONICET UNL, Ciudad Univ, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Callisto, Marcos] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Lab Ecol Bentos, Dept Biol Geral, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Cao, Yixin] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ecole Econ Sorbonne UFR 02, 90 Rue Tolbiac, F-75013 Paris, France; [Kolb, Melanie] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geog, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Kondolf, G.

Analyses focus on 15 North Atlantic TCs that made landfall along the U.S. coast over the 2007-2012 period. As reference data we use gridded rainfall provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). We consider forecast lead-times up to five days. To benchmark the skill of these models, we consider rainfall estimates from one radar-based (Stage IV) and four satellite-based [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, both real-time and research version); Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); the CPC MORPHing Technique (CMORPH)] rainfall products. Daily and storm total rainfall fields from each of these remote sensing products are compared to the reference data to obtain information about the range of errors we can expect from observational data. The skill of the NWP models is quantified: (1) by visual examination of the distribution of the errors in storm total rainfall for the different lead-times, and numerical examination of the first three moments of the error distribution; (2) relative to climatology at the daily scale. Considering these skill metrics, we conclude that the NWP models can provide skillful forecasts of TC rainfall with lead-times up to 48 h, without a consistently best or worst NWP model.

This situation creates the need for the development of new process controls for buildings operations to achieve the goal of a completely intelligent building which is able to respond dynamically to internal and external perturbations in order to foster comfort conditions for the building occupants. Unpredictable user-behavior, changing weather conditions, mismatch between consumption and production of resources, operation of active and passive climate-control systems are factors that affect buildings behavior hence requiring the use of intelligent control decisions in real-time. These intelligent control decisions directly affect the buildings energy efficiency and occupant thermal comfort The road towards intelligent control decisions in real time for intelligent buildings operation requires groundbreaking innovations and progress beyond the current state-of-the-art in various aspect of building construction. In achieving the desired goals, the application of AI techniques promises to be very useful, especially multi agent systems which has shown enormous potential for improving the operational control of buildings. Up until now, there has not been any real application of intelligent agents in building management systems, however field tests with multi agent systems on top of current building management systems has shown to be a promising approach for combined cooperation between building management systems and the Grid. A further development is to implement MAS structures for comfort management in combination with energy optimization as an addition to existing building management functionality.

Light is the major environmental time cue that resets the human circadian pacemaker, an endogenous clock in the hypothalamus that controls the timing of many 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behavior. Insufficient or inappropriate light exposure can disrupt normal circadian rhythms which may result in adverse consequences for human performance, health and safety. This article addresses the problem of prospective analysis of building architecture for circadian stimulus potential based on the state of the art in photobiology. Three variables were considered in this analysis: lighting intensity, timing, and spectrum. Intensity is a standard design tool frequently used in illuminating engineering. Timing and spectrum are not commonplace considerations, so the analysis that follows proposes tools to quantitatively address these additional requirements. Outcomes of photobiology research were used in this paper to define threshold values for illumination in terms of spectrum, intensity, and timing of light at the human eye, and were translated into goals for simulation - and ultimately for building design. In particular, the climate-based Daylight Autonomy (DA) metric was chosen to simulate the probabilistic and temporal potential of daylight for human health needs. The developed method was applied to study the impact of key architectural decisions on achieving prescribed stimulus of the circadian system in a hospital patient room design; studied variables included orientation, window size, and glazing material. A healthcare setting was specifically chosen with the intent of follow-on research to validate our findings with actual patient outcome data.","[Pechacek, Christopher S.; Andersen, Marilyne] MIT, Dept Architecture, Building Technol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lockley, Steven W.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Sleep Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School,"Andersen, M (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Architecture, Building Technol Program, Room 5-418,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mand@mit.edu,,"Andersen, Marilyne/0000-0001-8813-1184",,,,,58,51,51,1,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1550-2724,1550-2716,,LEUKOS,Leukos,JUL,2008,1,,,,1,26,,10.1582/LEUKOS.2008.05.01001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1582/LEUKOS.2008.05.01001,,,26,Construction & Building Technology; Optics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Optics,366IC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000260473100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective is to create a territorial-city organism instead of the actual disarticulated layout. The results expected will constitute a contribution for both the state of the art and the reconstruction of the city after the 2009 earthquake. The main critical aspect of the current city is identified in the disarticulation of its urban structure, conceived as a sum of parts and not as a unitary organism. Due to this background situation, the attention focuses on the structure of the proposed system and the design rules of its constituent districts. The target is to create comfortable and energy-efficient urban spaces, apt to the fruition of passive sun/wind gains (to implement passive and low energy techniques), working on the urban geometry in relation to the Aquilan morphological and climate context. In these terms, the study will evaluate the characters of the texture grain, through the analysis of the parameters more involved in energy efficiency issues: orientations, passive zones distribution, urban horizon angles and obstruction sky views. The strategy is to study the fractal degree of the texture, in order to use the potentialities of the envelopes to reach the passive gains, without forgetting the importance of thermal inertia in the cold Aquilan climate. Moreover, the density degree of the compact texture is used to control light and wind favourable passages, working on it in terms of Height/Width ratio of urban canyons. The goal is to guarantee the right level of radiation and daylight, gaining the direct contributions from the sky and using the reflected light for obstructed floors. The connected-nucleuses model is evaluated also in terms of environmental impacts, playing up the potentiality to re-compose the natural system of Aterno Valley, through the capillary organization of urban green spaces and water-recycle integrated solutions. In fine, the suggested model contributes to the sustainable management of mobility. The same structural connections between the short-distances and mixed-use districts can became the public mobility network, in order to reduce the traffic flows at the decreasing of the urban scale. The research project and the methodology defined for its future steps, are based on the idea that the urban design plays the first fundamental role in a sustainable city.","[La Rocca, Giovanni Luigi] Univ Aquila, I-67100 Laquila, Italy",University of L'Aquila,"La Rocca, GL (corresponding author), Univ Aquila, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-06-3,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,685,696,,,,,,12,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BE0GN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000365991700093,View Full Record in Web of Science

The EWWP is characterized by the absence of Gondolelloides and Vjalovogonthus in the Cisuralian, abundance of Sweetognathus and Pseudosweetognathus in the Kungurian (late Cisuralian), Jinogondolmichael and Sweetognathus in the Guadalupian, and Clarkina and Iranognathus in the Lopingian. The GCWP is marked by Vjalovognathus, Merrillina in the Cisuralian, Vjalovognathus, Merrillina and Mesogondolella in the Guadalupian, and Vjalovognathus and Merrillina in the Lopingian. Mixed faunas are recognized in regions bordering between the EWWP and GCWP including Western Timer during the Artinskian, Pamirs during the Kungurian and the Salt Range during the Guadalupian and Lopingian. Three different conodont zonations: art: proposed, one for each of the three conodont provinces. Four potential horizons for inter-provincial correlation of Permian conodonts are recognized. They are in ascending order: (1) the first appearance of Sweetognathus whitei, which is closely related to the last occurrence of Carboniferous-type conodonts such as Streptognathodus and Adetognathus; (2) the first appearance of Neostreptognathodus pequopensis; (3) the base of the Jinogondolella nankingensis Zone; and (4) the base of the Clarkina postbitteri-Iranognthus erwini Zone. The spatial and temporal distribution pattern of Permian conodonts suggests that temperature is the primary controlling factor. Evolution of Permian conodont provincialism reveals a glaciation during the Asselian and Sakmarian, a global warming during the Artinskian, a climate cooling in North Pangea during the Kungurian, a continuation of Kungurian climate trends in the Guadalupian, a relatively minor warming during the Wuchiapingian, a returned cooling in the Changhsingian and Lower and Middle Griesbachian, and a global warming in the Late Griesbachian, which ended the Permian conodont lineage.

This service presents three main business models: two of these models base their services on stations while the remainder, the free-floating service, is free of fixed stations. Despite the notable advantages of carsharing, this service is prone to several problems, such as fleet imbalance due to the variance of the daily demand in large urban centers. Forecasting the demand for the service is a key task to deal with this issue. In this sense, in this work, we analyze the use of well-known techniques to forecast a carsharing service demand. More in deep, we evaluate the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Prophet techniques to predict the demand of three real carsharing services. Moreover, we also evaluate seven state-of-the-art forecasting models on a given free-floating carsharing service, highlighting the potentials of each technique. In addition to historical carsharing service data, we have also used climatic series to enhance the forecasting. Indeed, the results of our analysis have shown that the addition of meteorological data improved the models' performance. In this case, the mean absolute error of LSTM may fall by half, when using the climate data. When considering the free-floating carsharing service, and prediction for the short-term (i.e., 12 hours), the boosting algorithms (e.g. XGBoost, Catboost, and LightGBM) present superior performance, with less than 20% of mean absolute error when compared to the next best-ranked model (Prophet). On the other hand, Prophet performed better for predictions conducted on long-term periods.","[Alencar, Victor Aquiles; Pessamilio, Lucas Ribeiro; Rooke, Felipe; Bernardino, Heder Soares; Borges Vieira, Alex] Univ Fed Juiz Fora, Rua Jose Lourenco Kelmer, BR-36036900 Juiz Do Fora, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora,"Alencar, VA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Juiz Fora, Rua Jose Lourenco Kelmer, BR-36036900 Juiz Do Fora, Brazil.",victoraquiles@ice.ufjf.br,,"Soares de Barros Alencar, Victor Aquiles/0000-0002-9670-076X",CNPq; CAPES; FAPEMIG; CGI/FAPESP,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CGI/FAPESP,"This research is partially funded by CNPq, CAPES, FAPEMIG, and CGI/FAPESP.",,20,3,3,0,11,SOC BRASILEIRA COMPUTACAO,Porto Alegre,"Av.

After a period of abandon, due mainly to the spread of Portland concrete, this building technique has gained a new attention in the last decades, at least in a niche sector of self-builders. Indeed, the main issue that an engineer or an architect must face when he/she decides to build a straw bale house is the absence of certain data about technical performance. The aim of the present paper is to investigate a straw bale wall, both in laboratory and in situ, and to perform a Life Cycle Assessment to identify strong and weak points of this building technique. After a section reporting the state of the art of the main features of straw bale constructions, including the most important physical parameters that affect durability and indoor comfort conditions, the paper reports the results of laboratory measurements aimed at assessing the sound absorption coefficient with an impedance tube and thermal conductivity with a guarded hot plate apparatus. Then, results of in-situ measurements of thermal and sound insulation are reported. Data show that in winter (steady-state) conditions the investigated wall offers adequate thermal insulation, but the lightness of the structure can be detrimental for the summer (unsteady-state) season, leading to possible overheating in warm climates. Furthermore, the sound insulation is limited by the lightness of the structure. Finally, the Life Cycle Assessment demonstrates that the use of straw bales in walls is capable of reducing the energy and carbon embodied in the building.","[D'Alessandro, F.] Univ Perugia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Via G Duranti 93, I-06125 Perugia, Italy; [Bianchi, F.; Rotili, A.; Schiavoni, S.] Univ Perugia, CIRIAF, Inter Univ Res Ctr Environm & Pollut Mauro Felli, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy; [Baldinelli, G.] Univ Perugia, Dept Engn, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Perugia; University of Perugia,"D'Alessandro, F (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Via G Duranti 93, I-06125 Perugia, Italy.",dalessandro.unipg@ciriaf.it,,"D'Alessandro, Francesco/0000-0002-9867-7540",,,,,78,43,43,1,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

The data set is based on SEVIRI measurements of the Meteosat Second Generation satellites, of which the visible and near-infrared channels were intercalibrated with MODIS. Applying two state-of-the-art retrieval schemes ensures high accuracy in cloud detection, cloud vertical placement and microphysical cloud properties. These properties were further processed to provide daily to monthly averaged quantities, mean diurnal cycles and monthly histograms. In particular, the per-month histogram information enhances the insight in spatio-temporal variability of clouds and their properties. Due to the underlying intercalibrated measurement record, the stability of the derived cloud properties is ensured, which is exemplarily demonstrated for three selected cloud variables for the entire SEVIRI disc and a European subregion. All data products and processing levels are introduced and validation results indicated. The sampling uncertainty of the averaged products in CLAAS is minimized due to the high temporal resolution of SEVIRI. This is emphasized by studying the impact of reduced temporal sampling rates taken at typical overpass times of polar-orbiting instruments. In particular, cloud optical thickness and cloud water path are very sensitive to the sampling rate, which in our study amounted to systematic deviations of over 10% if only sampled once a day. The CLAAS data set facilitates many cloud related applications at small spatial scales of a few kilometres and short temporal scales of a few hours. Beyond this, the spatio-temporal characteristics of clouds on diurnal to seasonal, but also on multi-annual scales, can be studied.","[Stengel, M. S.; Kniffka, A. K.; Lockhoff, M. L.; Tan, J.

The economic, social, technological, and ideological transformations immediately preceding and following these changes were profound. Early models of culture change associated with pre-agricultural societies of the Levant focused on the sudden, late origin of settled farming villages triggered by climate change. Accompanying this new economic and living situation was durable stone-built architecture; intensified plant and animal use; a flourishing of art and decoration; new mortuary traditions, including marked graves and cemeteries; elaborate ritual and symbolic behavior - a new way of life. This new life style arguably had a slow start, but really took off during the Epipaleolithic period (EP), spanning more than 10,000 years of Levantine prehistory from c. 23,000-11,500 cal BP. The last EP phase, immediately preceding the Neolithic, is by far the best-studied in terms of its cultural and economic contributions to questions on the origins of agriculture.(1-4) Recently, archeologists have considered the earlier parts of the EP to be more culturally dynamic and similar to the later phase (Natufian) than was previously thought.(3-10) The earlier EP is increasingly seen as demonstrating the behavioral variability and innovations that help us to understand the economic, technological, and social changes associated with complex hunter-gatherers of the Natufian and farmers of the Neolithic. This paper traces the cultural and biological developments of the EP period leading up to the Natufian and considers the long-term trajectory of culture change, social complexity, and village life in the Near East.","[Maher, Lisa A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Richter, Tobias] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Stock, Jay T.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Copenhagen; University of Cambridge,"Maher, LA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",maher@berkeley.edu,"Stock, Jay T/B-6453-2011; Richter, Tobias/AEX-8549-2022","Stock, Jay T/0000-0003-0147-8631; Richter, Tobias/0000-0001-9902-8852",,,,,116,68,68,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1060-1538,1520-6505,,EVOL ANTHROPOL,Evol.

Here, we performed compositional engineering of BVO-varying Bi/V ratio and inclusion of different concentrations of Mo dopants. Through physical and chemical analyses, we found that the materials properties of BiVO4 and its PEC performance were highly sensitive to the chemical composition. Our optimized BiVO4-based photoanode exhibited the highest photocurrent density among the state-of-the-art SnO2/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanodes reported in the literature: 2.62 and 4.20 mA cm(-2) measured at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction and sulfite oxidation reaction, respectively. A complete picture explaining various PEC performances with different chemical compositions via the band structure of BiVO4 has emerged.

In order to evaluate the ice sheet's present and future response to global climate change, detailed information about spatial and temporal ice mass dynamics is required. While ice sheet surface mass balance can be estimated from regional climate models, ice discharge is often determined from spaceborne measurements of ice thickness and ice motion at selected flux gates. The retrieval of ice motion is not only critical for analysing the rate of ice transport into the ocean but also for investigating the spatial and temporal pattern or the driving forcings of Antarctic ice flow dynamics. This study provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art spaceborne ice velocity measurements in Antarctica. Based on 201 scientific papers, published over the last three decades, our analysis revealed a dominant interest in local and regional scale investigations. Yet, the launch of the ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1 SAR satellites in the 1990s dramatically increased data coverage over the Antarctic continent and enabled the first circum-antarctic velocity product to be published in the late 2000s. In recent years, the improved imaging capabilities of Landsat 8 led to a shift towards using mainly optical satellite data and enabled great advances in circum-antarctic velocity mapping. Data from the currently operating Sentinel-1/-2 missions was applied in fewer studies but will play a crucial role in future ice motion studies e.g. as part of ESA CCI projects. In addition, we found a growing interest in high temporal resolution velocity change analyses. Based on the reviewed studies, we moreover summarized the highly dynamic and locally variable flow pattern over the Antarctic continent being in accordance with varying local and regional driving mechanisms. Despite the great advances in spaceborne ice velocity mapping in Antarctica, we report some major drawbacks and discuss future challenges and requirements. To start with, our study uncovered strong variations regarding the spatial availability of investigations. While we found an aggregation of studies over selected glaciers, we report a major lack of studies in all three Antarctic sectors. Additionally, many velocity datasets were created with strongly heterogeneous output parameters and were provided at coarse temporal resolution or at point-based measurement locations only. Future studies should consequently aim at creating more uniform ice motion products at defined spatial and temporal coverage and resolution standards and at analysing particularly the least studied glaciers.","[Dirscherl, Mariel; Dietz, Andreas J.; Dech, Stefan; Kuenzer, Claudia] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Dech, Stefan; Kuenzer, Claudia] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Remote Sensing, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); University of Wurzburg,"Dirscherl, M (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.",Mariel.Dirscherl@dlr.de; Andreas.Dietz@dlr.de; Stefan.Dech@dlr.de; Claudia.Kuenzer@dlr.de,,"Dietz, Andreas/0000-0002-5733-7136; Dirscherl, Mariel/0000-0002-3324-7646",DLR VO-R Young Investigator Group Antarctic Research,DLR VO-R Young Investigator Group Antarctic Research,Authors would like to thank the editor and the reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions that improved this paper over all aspects.

The climatological features of ionospheric peak densities and heights (NmF(2) and hmF(2)) from WACCM-X are in general agreement with the results derived from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) data, although the WACCM-X predicted NmF(2) values are smaller, and the equatorial ionization anomaly crests are closer to the magnetic equator compared to COSMIC and ionosonde observations. This may result from the excessive mixing in the lower thermosphere due to the gravity wave parameterization. These data-model comparisons demonstrate that WACCM-X can capture the dynamic behavior of the coupled atmosphere and ionosphere in a climatological sense. Plain Language Summary The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) is a numerical model of entire atmosphere, from the surface to around 600 km in altitude. Recent enhancements to WACCM-X include a fully coupled ionosphere, including electric field effects and ion transport. WACCM-X results are compared with several datasets, and with a predecessor, the TIE-GCM during a very low solar activity year 2008. Comparisons with wind and temperature measurements by the TIMED satellite show that WACCM-X reproduces the seasonal variability of atmospheric tides remarkably well. There is overall agreement between WACCM-X, TIE-GCM, and vertical ion motions observed by the C/NOFS satellite over the magnetic equator, but apparent discrepancies also exist among them. The climatological features of ionospheric peak densities and heights from WACCM-X are in general agreement with results derived from COSMIC data, although the WACCM-X-predicted peak values are smaller, and the equatorial ionosphere has bands of enhancement that are closer to the magnetic equator compared to COSMIC and ionosonde observations. These data-model comparisons demonstrate that WACCM-X can capture the basic climate and variation of the coupled atmosphere and ionosphere.","[Liu, Jing; Liu, Hanli; Wang, Wenbin; Burns, Alan G.; Wu, Qian; Solomon, Stanley C.; Marsh, Daniel R.; Qian, Liying; Lu, Gang; Pedatella, Nicholas M.; McInerney, Joe M.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Pob 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Gan, Quan] Clemson Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Russell, James M.] Hampton Univ, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Hampton, VA 23668 USA; [Schreiner, William S.] Univ Corp Atmospher Res, COSMIC Program Off, Boulder, CO USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Clemson University; Hampton University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Liu, J (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Pob 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",jingliu@ucar.edu,"Pedatella, Nicholas/Q-2242-2015; Wang, Wenbin/G-2596-2013; Gan, Quan/AAA-2674-2022; Gan, Quan/B-5004-2012; Qian, Liying/D-9236-2013; Marsh, Daniel/A-8406-2008; Liu, Han/GVT-8296-2022; Liu, Jing/AAU-1586-2020; Lu, Gang/A-6669-2011; Solomon, Stanley C/J-4847-2012; Liu, Han-Li/A-9549-2008","Pedatella, Nicholas/0000-0002-8878-5126; Wang, Wenbin/0000-0002-6287-4542; Gan, Quan/0000-0003-3703-5453; Gan, Quan/0000-0003-3703-5453; Qian, Liying/0000-0003-2430-1388; Marsh, Daniel/0000-0001-6699-494X; Solomon, Stanley C/0000-0002-5291-3034; Liu, Han-Li/0000-0002-6370-0704; McInerney, Joseph/0000-0002-6103-3311","NASA [NNX13AE20G, NNX14AE06G, NNX14AF20G, NNX14AH54G, NNX15AB83]; NSF [1135432]; AFOSR grant [FA9550-16-1-0050]; National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1135432] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AFOSR grant(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We acknowledge the CESM, CAM, WACCM, and WACCM-X development teams at NCAR and, in particular, Art Richmond, Ben Foster, and Francis Vitt for key contributions to WACCM-X.

Specifically, a confirmed theoretical tool, Evapotranspiration Temporal VARiance Decomposition (EVARD), is used as a benchmark to estimate ET monthly variance (sigma ET2) across the contiguous United States (CONUS) with inputs including hydroclimatic observations, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-based terrestrial water storage, four observation-based products (ET(RSUW)by the University of Washington, ET(RSMOD16)from MOD16 Global Terrestrial ET Data Set, ET(FLUXNET)upscaled from of fluxtower observations, and ET(GLEAM)from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model), and four operational land surface models (LSMs: MOSAIC, NOAH, NOAH-MP, and VIC). Five experiments are systematically designed to evaluate and diagnose possible errors and uncertainties in ET temporal variance estimated by the four observation-based ET products and the four LSM simulations. Based on the results of these experiments, the following diagnostic hypotheses regarding the uncertainty of the observation-based ET products are illustrated: ET(RSUW)captures the high sigma ET2 signals in the Midwest with negligible bias and moderate uncertainty over the contiguous United States; ET(FLUXNET)systematically underestimates sigma ET2 over CONUS but with the lowest level of uncertainty; ET(RSMOD16)has medium bias with the highest level of uncertainty, and the spatial distribution of high sigma ET2 signal from ET(RSMOD16)is different from other estimates;ET(GLEAM)has slight negative bias and medium uncertainty, and sigma ET2 in the West Coast is smaller than that from ETVARD. Regarding the LSMs, it is found that any of the four LSMs can be the best depending on a certain set of reference observations. The study reveals that LSMs have shown a reasonably worthy, though not perfect, capability in estimating ET and its variability in regions/aquifers with limited human interference. However, RS-based observations and theoretical estimates suggest that all the four LSMs examined in this study are not able to accurately predict the ET variability in regions/aquifers heavily influenced by human activities like Central Valley and High Plains aquifers; they all underestimate ET variability along the West Coast due to seasonal vegetation responses to Mediterranean climate and human water use. In addition, LSMs underestimate intraannual ET variance in California and the High Plains with underestimated terrestrial storage change components in ET variance, due to the inappropriate representation of groundwater pumping and its impact on ET and other hydrologic processes. This paper urges advancing hydrologic knowledge by finding congruence among models, data, and theories.","[Zeng, Ruijie] Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Utah Water Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Zeng, Ruijie; Cai, Ximing] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ven Te Chow Hydrosyst Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Zeng, RJ (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Utah Water Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;Zeng, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ven Te Chow Hydrosyst Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ruijie.zeng@usu.edu,"Zeng, Rui/GRY-0646-2022","Zeng, Rui/0000-0003-1188-3198; Zeng, Ruijie/0000-0003-3229-3146; Cai, Ximing/0000-0002-7342-4512",,,,,71,6,6,3,42,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

To maximize risk reduction, it is also necessary to consider the environment. With the majority of older people living in cities, we explored how urban environments could support risk reduction. Materials and Methods In our qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with community members aged >= 65 years and stakeholders, all living in Leipzig, Germany. Interview guides were informed by the framework on modifiable risk factors for dementia of the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care. Interviews were audio-recorded, verbatim-transcribed, and thematically analysed. Results Community members (n = 10) were M = 73.7 (SD = 6.0) years old and 50% were women. Stakeholders (n = 10) were aged 39-72 years, and 70% were women. Stakeholders' fields included architecture, cultural/arts education, environmental sciences, geriatrics, health policy, information and technology, philosophy, psychology, public health, and urban sociology. Across interviews with both older individuals and stakeholders, three main themes were identified: (i) social participation and inclusion (emphasizing social contacts, social housing, intergenerationality, neighbourhood assistance, information and orientation, digital and technological literacy, lifelong learning, co-creation/co-design), (ii) proximity and accessibility (emphasizing proximity and reachability, mobility, affordability, access to health care, access to cultural events, public toilets), (iii) local recreation and wellbeing (emphasizing safety in traffic, security, cleanliness and environmental protection, urban greenery, climate change and heat waves, outdoor physical activity). Discussion The design of urban environments holds large potential to create favourable conditions for community-dwelling individuals to practice lifestyles that promote brain health. Public policy should involve community members in co-creating such environments.","[Roehr, Susanne; Rodriguez, Francisca S.; Siemensmeyer, Rosa; Mueller, Felix; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.] Univ Leipzig, Med Fac, Inst Social Med Occupat Hlth & Publ Hlth ISAP, Philipp Rosenthal Str 55, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Roehr, Susanne; Romero-Ortuno, Roman] Trinity Coll Dublin, GBHI, Dublin, Ireland; [Rodriguez, Francisca S.] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Greifswald, Germany; [Romero-Ortuno, Roman] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med Discipline Med Gerontol, Dublin, Ireland; [Romero-Ortuno, Roman] St James Hosp, Mercers Inst Successful Ageing, Dublin, Ireland",Leipzig University; Trinity College Dublin; Helmholtz Association; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE); Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Rohr, S (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Med Fac, Inst Social Med Occupat Hlth & Publ Hlth ISAP, Philipp Rosenthal Str 55, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",susanne.roehr@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,"Riedel-Heller, Steffi/ABG-1537-2021","Rohr, Susanne/0000-0001-9385-0669",Fritz und Hildegard Berg Stiftung [T0133-34.929],Fritz und Hildegard Berg Stiftung,"Fritz und Hildegard Berg Stiftung, Grant/Award Number: T0133-34.929; Universitat Leipzig; Open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.",,50,6,6,6,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6230,1099-1166,,INT J GERIATR PSYCH,Int.

However, both GRACE products and model results suffer from inherent uncertainties, calling for the need to make a combined use of GRACE and models to examine the variations in total TWS and their individual components, especially in relation to natural and human-induced changes in the terrestrial water cycle. In this study, we use the results from two state-of-the-art hydrological models and different GRACE spherical harmonic products to examine the variations in TWS and its individual components, and to attribute the changes to natural and human-induced factors over large global river basins. Analysis of the spatial patterns of the long-term trend in TWS from the two models and GRACE suggests that both models capture the GRACE-measured direction of change, but differ from GRACE as well as each other in terms of the magnitude over different regions. A detailed analysis of the seasonal cycle of TWS variations over 30 river basins shows notable differences not only between models and GRACE but also among different GRACE products and between the two models. Further, it is found that while one model performs well in highly-managed river basins, it fails to reproduce the GRACE-observed signal in snow-dominated regions, and vice versa. The isolation of natural and human-induced changes in TWS in some of the managed basins reveals a consistently declining TWS trend during 2002-2010, however; significant differences are again obvious both between GRACE and models and among different GRACE products and models. Results from the decomposition of the TWS signal into the general trend and seasonality indicate that both models do not adequately capture both the trend and seasonality in the managed or snow-dominated basins implying that the TWS variations from a single model cannot be reliably used for all global regions. It is also found that the uncertainties arising from climate forcing datasets can introduce significant additional uncertainties, making direct comparison of model results and GRACE products even more difficult. Our results highlight the need to further improve the representation of human land-water management and snow processes in large-scale models to enable a reliable use of models and GRACE to study the changes in freshwater systems in all global regions.

Here we report on simulations using NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) which was used to evaluate the consistency of two different sets of observationally informed land and ocean fluxes with atmospheric CO2 records. Despite the observation inputs, the average difference in annual terrestrial biosphere flux between the two land (NASA Ames Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and CASA-Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED)) models is 1.7 Pg C for 2009-2010. Ocean models (NASA's Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM) and Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II (ECCO2)-Darwin) differ by 35% in their global estimates of carbon flux with particularly strong disagreement in high latitudes. Based upon combinations of terrestrial and ocean fluxes, GEOS-5 reasonably simulated the seasonal cycle observed at Northern Hemisphere surface sites and by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) while the model struggled to simulate the seasonal cycle at Southern Hemisphere surface locations. Though GEOS-5 was able to reasonably reproduce the patterns of XCO2 observed by GOSAT, it struggled to reproduce these aspects of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations. Despite large differences between land and ocean flux estimates, resulting differences in atmospheric mixing ratio were small, typically less than 5ppm at the surface and 3ppm in the XCO2 column. A statistical analysis based on the variability of observations shows that flux differences of these magnitudes are difficult to distinguish from inherent measurement variability, regardless of the measurement platform.","[Ott, Lesley E.; Pawson, Steven; Gregg, Watson W.; Rousseaux, Cecile S.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Collatz, George J.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Menemenlis, Dimitris; Bowman, Kevin W.; Liu, Junjie; Eldering, Annmarie; Gunson, Michael R.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Brix, Holger] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Rousseaux, Cecile S.] Univ Space Res Assoc, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Kawa, Stephan R.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Atmospher Chem & Dynam Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Ott, LE (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",lesley.e.ott@nasa.gov,"Liu, Junjie/F-5739-2017; Kawa, Stephan R/E-9040-2012; Ott, Lesley/E-2250-2012; Rousseaux, Cecile/E-8811-2012; Pawson, Steven/I-1865-2014; collatz, george j/D-5381-2012; Bowman, Kevin/L-8786-2019; Menemenlis, Dimitris/G-8091-2017","Liu, Junjie/0000-0002-7184-6594; Rousseaux, Cecile/0000-0002-3022-2988; Pawson, Steven/0000-0003-0200-717X; Bowman, Kevin/0000-0002-8659-1117; Brix, Holger/0000-0003-4229-6164; Menemenlis, Dimitris/0000-0001-9940-8409",NASA's CMS FPP and Phase One activities,NASA's CMS FPP and Phase One activities,"This work was supported by funding from NASA's CMS FPP and Phase One activities.

Toward this end, we conducted a year-long thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) simulation for 2009, which is characterized by low solar and geomagnetic activity. In order to account for tropospheric waves and tides propagating upward into the approximate to 30-400 km model domain, we used 3-hourly MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application) reanalysis data. We focus on exospheric tidal temperatures, which are also compared with 72 day mean determinations from combined Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations to assess the model's capability to capture the observed tidal signatures and to quantify the uncertainties associated with the satellite exospheric temperature determination technique. We found strong day-to-day tidal variability in TIME-GCM that is smoothed out when averaged over as few as ten days. TIME-GCM notably overestimates the 72 day mean eastward propagating tides observed by CHAMP/GRACE, while capturing many of the salient features of other tidal components. However, the CHAMP/GRACE tidal determination technique only provides a gross climatological representation, underestimates the majority of the tidal components in the climatological spectrum, and moreover fails to characterize the extreme variability that drives the dynamics and electrodynamics of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. A multisatellite mission that samples at least six local times simultaneously is needed to provide this quantification.","[Haeusler, K.; Hagan, M.

The existing literature on impacts of technological availability and cost on electric sector planning typically use models that do not have sufficient technological, spatial, and temporal detail to adequately resolve the economic competitiveness of variable renewable energy vis-a-vis dispatchable generators. Using a state-of-the-art energy-economic model, this work examines impacts of technological availability and advanced generation technologies on U.S. electricity market outcomes across a range of regional, market, and policy contexts. We show that decarbonization costs are 11%-76% higher as technological options are removed from consideration (incremental compliance costs for a 95% CO2 reduction below 2005 levels are roughly twice as high when new nuclear, carbon-capture-equipped units, and transmission are not allowed). However, the economic and technical implications of limited portfolios depend on the market and policy contexts (e.g., costs are higher with stringent targets, more extensive end-use electrification, and lower gas prices) and the costs and capabilities of the remaining options. The analysis demonstrates how lower temporal and spatial resolution models likely understate the value of technology by omitting key economic and technical features of high variable renewable pathways. Additionally, the analysis quantifies how technological change can lower costs of emissions reductions by 7%-73% and how low-cost battery storage can provide a hedge against higher costs when technological portfolios are limited.

Scientists, researchers, expert organizations, and policymakers suggest that in order to combat the instabilities caused by global warming, further investigation in the direction of safe CO2 storage should be at utmost priority. To reduce GHG concentration in atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising bridge technology, by capturing CO2 from the major sources such as cement factories, fossil fuel-based production plants, etc. and subsequently storing it in subsurface. CCS technology greatly reduces CO2 concentration and restricts and protects subsequent migration by safely storing within geologic formations for millions of years. The CO2 is injected into suitable geological formations at depths below 800 m or more, and various trapping mechanisms would prevent further migration of the stored CO2 to the surface. Potential candidates for safe storage of CO2 are geological storage (in geological formations, such as un-mineable coal seams, depleted oil and gas fields, and deep saline formations), ocean storage (direct release into ocean), and industrial fixation into inorganic carbonates. This chapter provides a detailed knowledge on the sources of GHG emissions into the atmosphere and the status of CCS process worldwide emphasizing on the various trapping mechanisms of CO2 in geological formations. The storage of CO2 in geological formations is greatly affected by environmental factors, so impact of these variables is described. In order to study the impact of these variables on CO2 sequestration, a state-of-the-art modeling techniques along with the numerical methods are reviewed comprehensively.","[Shachi; Gupta, Pankaj Kumar; Yadav, Brijesh Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Shachi (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.",shachi2809@gmail.com,,"Gupta, Dr. Pankaj Kumar/0000-0003-0683-4148","MHRD, Government of India (GOI), New Delhi, India","MHRD, Government of India (GOI), New Delhi, India","Authors are extremely grateful to the MHRD, Government of India (GOI), New Delhi, India for financial support as JRF/SRF to Ms. Shachi and the University Grant Commission (UGC).",,60,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2512-1901,2512-1898,978-981-13-7904-8; 978-981-13-7903-1,MICROORG SUSTAIN,,,2019,,,,,83,100,,10.1007/978-981-13-7904-8_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-7904-8_4,10.1007/978-981-13-7904-8,,18,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering,BQ0CC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000571509400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In turn, soil and landscape properties determine how water is distributed in soil landscapes. Understanding the complex dynamics of this co-evolution of soils, landscapes and the hydrological system is fundamental in adapting land management to changes in climate. Soil-Landscape Evolution Models (SLEMs) are used to simulate the development and evolution of soils and landscapes. However, many hydrologic processes, such as preferential flow and subsurface lateral flow, are currently absent in these models. This limits the applicability of SLEMs to improve our understanding of feedbacks in the hydro-pedo-geomorphological system. Implementation of these hydrologic processes in SLEMs faces several complications related to calculation demands, limited methods for linking pedogenic and hydrologic processes, and limited data on quantification of changes in the hydrological system over time. In this contribution, we first briefly review processes and feedbacks in soil-landscape-hydrological systems. Next, we elaborate on the development required to include these processes in SLEMs. We discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge, identify complications, give partial solutions and suggest important future development. The main requirements for incorporating hydrologic processes in SLEMs are: (1) designing a model framework that can deal with varying timescales for different sets of processes, (2) developing and implementing methods for simulating pedogenesis as a function of water flow, (3) improving and implementing knowledge on the evolution and dynamics of soil hydraulic properties over different timescales, and (4) improving the database on temporal changes and dynamics of flow paths.","[van der Meij, W.

The author analyzes the nature and objectives of mediation as an alternative to litigation for resolving disputes related to compensation for professional liability. Materials and methods. The deteriorating relationship of trust between doctors and patients stems on the one hand from the latters' increasing awareness of their rights and their decreasing sense of awe in the presence of the physician and on the other hand from doctors' more or less constant fear of lawsuit. It is accompanied by an ever-increasing number of claims filed for damages related to malpractice. Dialogue and listening are key elements in an appropriate, productive doctor-patient relationship. Therefore, meetings between the two parties at the mediation table, in a climate of collaboration and communication, may lead to an amicable resolution of the dispute before involving the courts, thereby shortening the time required for litigation. Results and conclusions. Legislators, inspired by desires to limit unnecessary recourse to law courts and resolve disputes rapidly and effectively, have reviewed the rules of civil procedure and sought alternatives for resolving existing disputes by means of conciliation. Provision for preventive technical advice with specifically conciliatory function was introduced into the Civil Procedure Code (art. 696 bis) in 2005. More recently a Legislative Decree was issued on mediation aimed at conciliation, which makes conciliation proceedings mandatory for many civil and commercial disputes, including those related to damages resulting from medical liability. In the field of dentistry, claims for damages are often very high, and it is here that mediation faces an interesting challenge: to overcome the litigants' respective positions and induce them to abandon their opposing claims in order to reach a mutually acceptable resolution to the conflict.","[Zangari, F.] Odontoiatra Iscritta Albo Consulenti Tecnici Tecr, Ravenna, Italy",,"Zangari, F (corresponding author), Odontoiatra Iscritta Albo Consulenti Tecnici Tecr, Ravenna, Italy.",f.zangari@tin.it,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER MASSON,MILANO,"VIA PALEOCAPA 7, 20121 MILANO, ITALY",0011-8524,,,DENT CADMOS,Dent.

With subsequent protocols and increased understanding of the inter-relationships between local air quality, transboundary air pollution and climate change, a variety of spatio-temporal issues must be addressed in order to model the multiscalar processes involved and nest Integrated Assessment Models. We describe the state-of-the-art in Integrated Assessment Modelling using a conceptual framework which locates the research activities driving integrated assessment in relation both to each other and to flows of information between activities, and identify inter-relationships with scientific and policy domains beyond the scope of the UN/ECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, recognising the utility of social science in understanding the effects of policy on socio-cultural behaviours. We discuss how the issues identified are being captured by integrated assessment models, with particular focus on the treatment of non-technical pollution abatement measures, noting current developments at the micro-scale addressing the dynamics of behavioural responses to abatement policies. Finally, we identify three key challenges for issue-driven Integrated Assessment Modelling: (i) capturing the dynamics of behavioural responses to value-driven policy mechanisms designed to promote non-technical abatement measures; (ii) the development of new tools to handle the delay times, inter-dependencies and multi-pollutant effects of abatement measures; and (iii) the identification of boundaries between knowledge domains and the effective transfer of multi-disciplinary scientific and socio-cultural knowledge to an increasingly trans-disciplinary policy domain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the basic chemical and oenological characteristics of wines obtained by three technologies of production. The wines were made from a hybrid cultivar 'Hibernal', grown under cool climate conditions. 'Hibernal' is a hybrid variety. This 'Hibernal' variety is widely cultivated in central and eastern Europe, where it is of great economic importance. Wines produced from this variety are popular in local markets. In comparison with the production of varieties belonging to Vitis vinifera, a very small percentage of the 'Hibernal' variety is cultivated. The methods used in the experiment for the production of wines were: classical method in the Italian passito style, modification of the passito style with a seven-day maceration of grapes, and a method of production in the Tokaj wine style at five Puttonyos. Basic chemical parameters, acid profile, total phenolic content, antioxidant and antiradical capacities, and quantitative analysis of selected polyphenols was performed. The sensory features and quality of the wines was assessed using a sommelier analysis based on The Wine & Spirit Education Trust guidelines. The results indicated that the seven-day maceration of the dehydrated grapes resulted in the highest polyphenol content, as well as the largest antioxidant and antiradical contents. The oenological evaluation of wines produced by the Tokaj method and Italian passito method with seven-day maceration found that the wines were appreciated due to their rich taste, flavor, and overall quality. The present study confirms the promising opportunities to obtain special sweet wine with a valuable composition and oenological characteristics in regions with cooler climates.","[Kowalczyk, Barbara] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Ornamental Plants & Garden Art, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Bieniasz, Monika] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Hort, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Kostecka-Gugala, Anna] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Plant Biol & Biotechnol, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow,"Kowalczyk, B (corresponding author), Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Biotechnol & Hort, Dept Ornamental Plants & Garden Art, Al 29 Listopada 54, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",barbara.kowalczyk@urk.edu.pl; bieniasz.monika@urk.edu.pl; anna.kostecka-gugala@urk.edu.pl,"Kowalczyk, Barbara/ABC-5595-2021; Bieniasz, Monika/AHD-4761-2022; Bieniasz, Monika/GQA-9672-2022; Kostecka-Gugała, Anna/M-7712-2019","Kostecka-Gugała, Anna/0000-0002-8298-9419; Kowalczyk, Barbara Anna/0000-0002-2051-6421",Ministry of Education and Science of Poland,Ministry of Education and Science of Poland,This research was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of Poland as a part of a research subsidy to the University of Agriculture in Krakow.,,55,0,0,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2304-8158,,FOODS,Foods,APR,2022,7,,,,,,1027,10.3390/foods11071027,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods11071027,,,14,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,0M3VA,35407114,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000782084800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, visitation to these places also creates a need for management measures, mainly the definition of tourist carrying capacity. The present work describes the results of climate monitoring and atmospheric profiling performed in Santana Cave (Alto Ribeira State and Tourist Park - PETAR, Brazil) between 2008 and 2011. Based on the results, distinct preliminary zones with different levels of thermal variation were identified, which classify Santana Cave as a warm trap. Two critical points along the tourist route (Cristo and Encontro Halls) were identified where the temperature of the locality increased by 1.3 degrees C when tourists were present. Air flow from the inner cave to the outside occurs during the austral summer, and the opposite flow occurs when the outside environment is colder than the air inside the cave during the austral winter. The temperature was used to establish thresholds to the tourist carrying capacity by computing the recovery time of the atmospheric conditions after the changes caused by the presence of tourists. This method suggests a maximum limit of approximately 350 visits per day to Santana Cave. The conclusion of the study is that Santana Cave has an atmosphere that is highly connected with the outside; daily variations in temperature and, to a lesser extent, in the relative humidity occur throughout the entire studied area of the cave. Therefore, the tourist carrying capacity in Santana Cave can be flexible and can be implemented based on the climate seasonality, the tourism demand and other management strategies.","[Lobo, Heros A.

Atmospheric weighted mean temperature (Tm) is a crucial parameter in the retrieval of precipitable water vapor (PWV) from the zenith wet delay (ZWD) of ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal propagation. In this paper, the correlation between weighted mean temperature and surface temperature (Ts) is studied firstly. It is shown that the correlation coefficients between Tm and Ts are 0.93 in the Antarctic and 0.94 in the Arctic. The linear regression Tm model and quadratic function Tm model of the Antarctic and the Arctic are established respectively using the radiosonde profiles of 12 stations in the Antarctic and 58 stations in the Arctic from 2008 to 2015. The accuracies of the linear regression Tm model, the quadratic function Tm model and GPT2w Tm model which is a state-of-the-art global Tm model are verified using the radiosonde profiles from 2016 to 2018 in the Antarctic and Arctic. Root Mean Square (RMS) errors of the linear regression Tm model, the quadratic function Tm model and GPT2w Tm model in the Antarctic are 3.07 K, 2.87 K and 4.32 K respectively, and those in the Arctic are 3.53 K, 3.38 K and 4.82 K, which indicates that the quadratic function Tm model has a higher accuracy compared to linear regression Tm model, and the accuracies of the two regional Tm models are better than that of GPT2w Tm model in the polar regions. In order to better evaluate the accuracy of Tm in the PWV retrieval, the PWV values of radiosondes are used for comparisons as the reference value. The RMS errors of PWV derived from the two Tm models are similar for 1.28 mm in the Antarctic and 1 mm in the Arctic respectively. In addition, the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of Tm are analyzed in the polar regions by spectral analysis of Tm data using fast Fourier transform. The results show that the Tm has obvious seasonality and annual periodicity in the polar regions, and the maximum difference between warm season and cold season is about 63 K. After comparing and analyzing the influences of latitude, longitude and elevation on the Tm in the polar regions, it is found that latitude and elevation have a greater influence on the Tm than the longitude. As the latitude and elevation increase, the Tm decreases, and vice versa in the polar regions. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The availability of huge datasets of remote sensing measurements to be processed, and the increasing need for near-real-time data analysis for operational uses, has fostered the development of fast, efficient-retrieval algorithms. Deep learning techniques were recently applied to satellite data for retrievals of target quantities. Forward models (FM) are a fundamental part of retrieval code development and mission design, as well. Despite this, the application of deep learning techniques to radiative transfer simulations is still underexplored. The DeepLIM project, described in this work, aimed at testing the feasibility of the application of deep learning techniques at the design of the retrieval chain of an upcoming satellite mission. The Land Surface Temperature Mission (LSTM) is a candidate for Sentinel 9 and has, as the main target, the need, for the agricultural community, to improve sustainable productivity. To do this, the mission will carry a thermal infrared sensor to retrieve land-surface temperature and evapotranspiration rate. The LSTM land-surface temperature retrieval chain is used as a benchmark to test the deep learning performances when applied to Earth observation studies. Starting from aircraft campaign data and state-of-the-art FM simulations with the DART model, deep learning techniques are used to generate new spectral features. Their statistical behavior is compared to the original technique to test the generation performances. Then, the high spectral resolution simulations are convolved with LSTM spectral response functions to obtain the radiance in the LSTM spectral channels. Simulated observations are analyzed using two state-of-the-art retrieval codes and deep learning-based algorithms. The performances of deep learning algorithms show promising results for both the production of simulated spectra and target parameters retrievals, one of the main advances being the reduction in computational costs.","[Castelli, Elisa; Papandrea, Enzo; Di Roma, Alessio] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate ISAC, Via Piero Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Bloise, Ilaria; Varile, Mattia; Feruglio, Lorenzo] AIKO SRL, Via Mille 22, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Tabani, Hamid] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Pl Eusebi Guell 1-3, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Gastellu-Etchegorry, Jean-Philippe] Toulouse Univ, CNRS, Cesbio UT3, CNES,IRD,INRAE, F-31400 Toulouse, France",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE),"Castelli, E (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate ISAC, Via Piero Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",e.castelli@isac.cnr.it; E.Papandrea@isac.cnr.it; a.diroma@isac.cnr.it; laria@aikospace.com; mattia@aikospace.com; hamid.tabani@bsc.es; jean-philippe.gastellu@iut-tlse3.fr; lorenzo@aikospace.com,"Papandrea, Enzo/GSO-2158-2022","Papandrea, Enzo/0000-0001-6698-0011; Gastellu-Etchegorry, jean philippe/0000-0002-6645-8837; Varile, Mattia/0000-0001-9833-2537","European SpaceAgency (ESA) [4000125402/18/NL/NA, 4000125840/18/NL/LF, AO/1-8733/16/NL/AF/eg, 4000120368/17/NL/AF/hh, 4000128370/19/NL/AS]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program [LM2018123]","European SpaceAgency (ESA)(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the CzeCOS program","Airborne acquisition, data analysis, and DART simulations were financed by the European SpaceAgency (ESA) in the frame of the FLEXSense campaign (ESAContractNo. 4000125402/18/NL/NA) and the SurfSense campaign (ESA contract No. 4000125840/18/NL/LF), and the LSTM project (ESA contract No.: AO/1-8733/16/NL/AF/eg) and the Assessment of the potential use of high-resolution TIR bands project (ESA contract No.: 4000120368/17/NL/AF/hh).

Polymerization with L-cysteine as an additional organic precursor produces an ACP sheath around the carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene (GR) hybrid support made of a small domain size with abundant edge sites and doped with sulfur. A few-minute-long microwave pyrolysis anchors strongly the single-atomic M-N moiety on the ACP while suppressing its agglomeration during the high-temperature synthesis and makes the ACP highly graphitized. As a typical example, the edge-hosted single-atomic catalytic sites in Fe-N/S-CNT-GR provide superior pH-independent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to previously reported Fe-N-C catalysts and commercial Pt/C while demonstrating oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in basic conditions similar to known state-of-the-art catalysts. In particular, the Fe-N/S-CNT-GR catalyst is much more stable than commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts during ORR and OER in both base and acid solutions. Inferior stability is a common problem of this type of single-atom heterogeneous catalyst (SAC).

Multi-objective optimization is a popular way to explore competing objectives in environmental management problems. Interactive visualizations allow stakeholders to explore and gain insights about the large, high-dimensional datasets produced by multi-objective optimization. Among visualization methods, parallel coordinates are well-suited for this task. However, current software and open source libraries have limited support for these plots. The Parasol library described in this work provides developers with the building blocks to create sharable, interactive parallel coordinates web applications. Moreover, by incorporating state of the art clutter reduction techniques-such as clustering, linking, brushing, marking, and bundling-Parasol improves upon traditional parallel coordinates visualizations. We demonstrate the benefit of such features through simple examples and by exploring a real-world water resources problem commonly used in multi-objective optimization literature.","[Raseman, William J.; Kasprzyk, Joseph R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jacobson, Joshuah] Univ Colorado, Dept Appl Math, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Raseman, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",william.raseman@colorado.edu; josh.jacobson@colorado.edu; joseph.kasprzyk@colorado.edu,"Raseman, William/O-6066-2019; Kasprzyk, Joseph/A-7764-2012","Raseman, William/0000-0001-5946-8888; Kasprzyk, Joseph/0000-0002-6344-6478; Jacobson, Josh/0000-0003-4418-2208",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Priorities: Systems-Based Strategies to Improve the Nation's Ability to Plan and Respond to Water Scarcity and Drought Due to Climate Change [R835865]; Discovery Learning Apprenticeship Program at the University of Colorado Boulder; Dawn Labs,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Priorities: Systems-Based Strategies to Improve the Nation's Ability to Plan and Respond to Water Scarcity and Drought Due to Climate Change; Discovery Learning Apprenticeship Program at the University of Colorado Boulder; Dawn Labs,"This work was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Priorities: Systems-Based Strategies to Improve the Nation's Ability to Plan and Respond to Water Scarcity and Drought Due to Climate Change, Grant No. R835865 and the Discovery Learning Apprenticeship Program at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Special attention is given to rain enhancement because it is further developed than snowpack augmentation, hail suppression, tornado and hurricane modification, and other weather-related disaster control ideas. The question of what makes a rain enhancement experiment acceptable to the scientific community is answered by the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) criteria, which address statistical evaluation, the measurement of rain, the understanding of nature's precipitation processes with the underlying physics and dynamics of clouds and cloud systems, and the transferability of experiment design. These criteria are no longer specific enough or satisfactory and will have to be reconsidered An actual WM experiment also involves a variety of techniques and technologies, aspects that need to be complemented by numerical modeling of clouds and cloud responses to seeding. Modeling also allows assessment of the extra-area effects, that is, detrimental effects of precipitation on adjacent areas. Assimilation models may be giving better estimates of the rain at the ground because they can integrate restricted information from radar and rain gauges with mesoscale meteorological and remote sensing, as well as hydrological, data. However, massive improvements in computer capacity are required to handle these problems. Weather modification has been progressing very slowly in the past because of the enormity of the problem and the fact that the precipitation process is far from being understood. Considering that rain increases are attempted within a range of 10%-20%, the lack of knowledge at corresponding accuracy is particularly evident in the fields of cloud physics, cloud and cloud systems dynamics, weather forecasting, numerical modeling, and measuring technology. Benefits of new intensive studies of precipitation processes will not be limited to WM; they are also vital to improving weather forecasting and climate change modeling. There is one additional aspect of WM; WM can also be used to test newly developed precipitation physics and models by studying if the clouds react to seeding in the predicted manner. This article is a wake-up call to put more intellectual and financial resources into the exploration and modification of the precipitation processes in all their forms. All these points lead to the suggestion of an outline of a national precipitation research and weather modification program.","Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada",University of Toronto,"List, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, 60 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada.",list@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,55,15,19,1,23,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

As the consequence of technological improvements, the first electric vehicles are now being introduced and greater market penetration can be expected. But any wider implementation of battery-powered electrical propulsion systems in the future will give rise to new challenges for both the traditional automotive industry and other new players, e.g. battery manufacturers, the power supply industry and other service providers. Different application cases of electric vehicles are currently being discussed which means that numerous business models could emerge, leading to new shares in value creation and involving new players. Consequently, individual stakeholders are uncertain about which business models are really effective with regard to targeting a profitable overall concept. Therefore, this paper aims to define a holistic approach to developing business models for electric mobility, which analyzes the system as a whole on the one hand and provides decision support for affected enterprises on the other. To do so, the basic elements of electric mobility are considered and topical approaches to business models for various stakeholders are discussed. The paper concludes by presenting a systemic instrument for business models based on morphological methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

State-of-the-art techniques to overcome these challenges mainly feature heterogeneous nucleating agents with regard to grain coarsening or alternating alloy concepts as well as post-weld heat treatments as for restoration of intergranular corrosion resistance. The present investigation seeks to depart from these traditional approaches through the use of a tailored heat input during pulsed laser beam welding by means of free-form pulse shaping. Grain size analysis using electron backscatter diffraction shows a substantial reduction of grain size as compared to continuous-wave lasers due to a distinctive columnar to equiaxed transition. Moreover, phase analyses reveal the overcoming of chromium carbide precipitation within the heat-affected zone. As corrosion tests demonstrate, intergranular attack is therefore concentrated on the weld metal. In comparison to continuous-wave laser beam welding, intergranular corrosion susceptibility is substantially reduced for very short pulse durations. From these results, it can be derived that pulsed laser beam welding using free-form pulse shaping enables direct control of heat input and, thus, tailored grain growth and precipitation formation properties.","[Sommer, N.; Stredak, F.; Wiegand, M.; Boehm, S.] Univ Kassel, Inst Prod Technol & Logist, Dept Cutting & Joining Mfg Proc, Kurt Wolters Str 3, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Sommer, N (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Inst Prod Technol & Logist, Dept Cutting & Joining Mfg Proc, Kurt Wolters Str 3, D-34125 Kassel, Germany.",n.sommer@uni-kassel.de,,"Sommer, Niklas/0000-0002-5442-8761; Bohm, Stefan/0000-0002-4370-525X; Wiegand, Michael/0000-0002-2747-3460",German Welding Society; German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) by Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) [20.129N],German Welding Society; German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) by Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK),"The corresponding author thankfully acknowledges the support provided within the framework of DVS IIW Young Professionals by the German Welding Society.

The city of Venice already depends on operational storm surge forecasting systems to warn the population and economy of imminent flood threats, as well as help to protect the extensive cultural heritage. This will be more important in the future, with the new mobile barriers called MOSE (MOdulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, Experimental Electromechanical Module) that will be completed by 2021. The barriers will depend on accurate storm surge forecasting to control their operation. In this paper, the physics behind the flooding of Venice is discussed, and the state of the art of storm surge forecasting in Europe is reviewed. The challenges for the surge forecasting systems are analyzed, especially in view of uncertainty. This includes consideration of selected historic extreme events that were particularly difficult to forecast. Four potential improvements are identified: (1) improve meteorological forecasts, (2) develop ensemble forecasting, (3) assimilation of water level measurements and (4) develop a multimodel approach.","[Umgiesser, Georg; Bajo, Marco; Ferrarin, Christian] CNR, Inst Marine Sci, ISMAR CNR, Venice, Italy; [Umgiesser, Georg] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Res Inst, Klaipeda, Lithuania; [Cucco, Andrea] CNR, Inst Study Anthrop Impacts & Sustainabil Marine E, IAS CNR, Oristano, Italy; [Lionello, Piero] DiSTeBA Univ Salento, Lecce, Italy; [Zanchettin, Davide] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Papa, Alvise; Tosoni, Alessandro] Ctr Previs & Segnalaz Maree Protez Civile, CPSM, Venice, Italy; [Ferla, Maurizio; Coraci, Elisa; Morucci, Sara; Crosato, Franco; Bonometto, Andrea] ISPRA, Italian Inst Environm Protect & Res, Venice, Italy; [Valentini, Andrea] Arpae SIMC Reg Agcy Prevent Environm & Energy Emi, Hydrometeo Climate Serv, Bologna, Italy; [Orlic, Mirko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Geophys, Zagreb, Croatia; [Haigh, Ivan D.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Nielsen, Jacob Woge] DMI Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bertin, Xavier] La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, UMR 7266 LIENSs, 2 Rue Olympe Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Fortunato, Andre Bustorff] Lab Nacl Engn Civil, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomez, Begona Perez; Alvarez Fanjul, Enrique] Puertos Estado, Madrid, Spain; [Paradis, Denis] Meteo France, Dept Marine & Oceanog, Direct Operat Previs, Toulouse, France; [Jourdan, Didier; Pasquet, Audrey] Shom Serv Hydrograph & Oceanograph Marine, Toulouse, France; [Mourre, Baptiste; Tintore, Joaquin] SOCIB, Balearic Isl Coastal Observing & Forecasting Syst, Mallorca, Spain; [Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); Klaipeda University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per lo Studio degli Impatti Antropici Sostenibilita in Ambiente Marino (IAS-CNR); University of Salento; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); Regional Environmental Protection Agency - Italy; University of Zagreb; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); National Civil Engineering Laboratory; Puertos del Estado; Meteo France; University of East Anglia,"Umgiesser, G (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Marine Sci, ISMAR CNR, Venice, Italy.;Umgiesser, G (corresponding author), Klaipeda Univ, Marine Res Inst, Klaipeda, Lithuania.",georg.umgiesser@ismar.cnr.it,"lionello, piero/B-4370-2010; cucco, andrea/B-4553-2012; Estuários, NEC/D-5086-2009; Fortunato, André B./B-9494-2008","lionello, piero/0000-0002-0779-5681; cucco, andrea/0000-0002-4469-2286; Fortunato, André B./0000-0003-4667-1945; Umgiesser, Georg/0000-0001-9697-275X",STREAM project (strategic development of flood management) - European Union under the V-A Interreg Italy-Croatia CBC program [10249186]; Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2018-01-9849],STREAM project (strategic development of flood management) - European Union under the V-A Interreg Italy-Croatia CBC program; Croatian Science Foundation,"This work was partially supported by the STREAM project (strategic development of flood management, project ID 10249186) funded by the European Union under the V-A Interreg Italy-Croatia CBC program.

The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) could play an important role in this transformation of today's energy systems. The ORC is able to convert low-temperature heat sources into electrical power by utilizing refrigerants as working fluids. Many of these refrigerants have a significant global warming potential (GWP) and recent legislations therefore increasingly limit their use. In recent years a new generation of refrigerants has been developed. These refrigerants are characterized by low global warming potentials and are considered as replacements for the old high-GWP refrigerants. In this paper R1224yd(Z), R1233zd(E) and R1336mzz(Z) are investigated as possible replacements for the state of the art high-GWP refrigerant R245fa. These novel fluids have quite similar thermophysical properties and can thus potentially be used as drop-in replacements for R245fa. For the application as drop-in replacement and the correct interpretation of measurement data, the interaction of the refrigerant with the used lubricant is important. Therefore, the interaction of all four refrigerants with a typical lubricant oil is experimentally investigated first. A novel model based on Raoult's law is introduced and validated with experimental data. The model allows the computation of the liquid and vapor phase composition of refrigerant/oil-mixtures using pressure and temperature measurements. In the next step, the performance of the four investigated refrigerants is evaluated experimentally in an ORC test rig. Therefore, the same experimental program was repeated for every refrigerant in order to ensure a fair comparison. To conclude the evaluation of the refrigerants, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is conducted for a theoretical geothermal power plant operated with the four considered refrigerants. The experimental results show, that R1224yd(Z) as well as R1233zd(E) are very suitable low-GWP alternatives for R245fa and could be used as drop-in replacements. R1336mzz(Z) on the other hand shows significantly lower system efficiencies and power outputs compared to the other refrigerants. The highest power output and system efficiency is however still achieved by the state of the art refrigerant R245fa, but these quantities are only slightly lower for R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z) . The LCA based on the experimental results for a hypothetical large-scale geothermal ORC application reveals, that despite the slight performance decrease, the application of low-GWP fluids decreases the CO2-equivalent of the system significantly. The usage of R1233zd(E) could decrease the CO2-equivalent by 67% compared to R245fa.","[Dawo, Fabian; Fleischmann, Jonas; Kaufmann, Florian; Schifflechner, Christopher; Eyerer, Sebastian; Wieland, Christoph; Spliethoff, Hartmut] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Syst, Garching, Germany; [Spliethoff, Hartmut] Bavarian Ctr Appl Energy Res, Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Dawo, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Syst, Garching, Germany.",fabian.dawo@tum.de,"Schifflechner, Christopher/N-7291-2019","Schifflechner, Christopher/0000-0002-8930-7214; Dawo, Fabian/0000-0002-4582-9993","Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts","Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts","Funding from the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts in the framework of the project Geothermal-Alliance Bavaria is gratefully acknowledged.",,46,15,15,6,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

Commercially available reactors commonly used in aquaculture were compared; tubular photobioreactors (TPBR) and bubble-columns (BC) in two placement possibilities; using artificial light in an indoor facility (AL) and utilizing sunlight in a greenhouse (GH) under Dutch climate conditions. Data from commercial microalgae facilities in the Netherlands are used to model reference scenarios describing the cost price of microalgae production with state of the art technology in aquaculture for a biomass production capacity of 125 kg year(-1). The reference cost price for algae biomass (on the basis of dry matter) is calculated at (sic)290,- kg(-1) and 329 kg(-1) for tubular reactors under artificial light and a greenhouse, respectively and (sic)587,- kg(-1) and (sic)573 kg(-1) for bubble-columns under artificial light and a greenhouse, respectively. The addition of more artificial light will significantly reduce production costs (by 33%) in all small-scale systems modelled. Biomass yield on light (Y-x,Y- Ph) showed the largest effect on cost price when not considering a different scale of the production process. Process parameters like temperature control should be aimed at optimizing Y-x,Y- ph rather than other forms of cost reduction. The scale of a microalgae production facility has a very large impact on the cost price. With state of the art technologies a cost price reduction of 92% could be achieved by changing the scale from 25m(2) to 1500m(2), resulting in a cost price of (sic)43,- kg(-1), producing 3992 kg year(-1) for tubular reactors in a greenhouse. The presented techno-economic model gives valuable insights in the cost price distribution of microalgae production in aquaculture. This allows to focus research efforts towards the most promising cost reduction methods and to optimize existing production facilities in aquaculture companies to achieve economically sustainable microalgae production for live feed in hatcheries.","[Oostlander, P.

Using the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data, the geometrical properties of 572 fresh impact craters with rim diameters between 2.5 and 102 km were compiled in lowland and highland plains. The data reveal a class of fresh craters with anomalously high ejecta volumes preferentially located in Utopia Planitia. These fresh, excess ejecta'' craters have volumes of material above the preimpact surface larger than the crater cavity volumes by factors of 2.5 to 5.8. The excess volume corresponds to an excess thickness of ejecta of about 20 to 100 m averaged over the continuous ejecta blanket. The excess material cannot be accommodated by ejecta bulking alone and requires an external process to increase the apparent volume of the ejecta and/or the uplifted surface. On the basis of the geologic setting, ejecta morphology, and calculations of increased ice stability with burial, we conclude that the most likely origin of the excess ejecta volume is the presence of an ice-rich layer tens of meters thick at the time of impact. The icy layer or a lag deposit is partially preserved beneath the ejecta blanket today. In this scenario, the icy layer has since been removed from areas unprotected by ejecta blankets, creating an apparent preimpact surface lower than the original elevation. The statistical occurrence of excess ejecta craters is consistent with climate model predictions of recent glacial periods on Mars.","[Black, Benjamin A.; Stewart, Sarah T.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Black, BA (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sstewart@eps.harvard.edu,,"Black, Benjamin/0000-0003-4585-6438; Stewart, Sarah/0000-0001-9606-1593",,,,,69,30,30,0,4,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9097,2169-9100,,J GEOPHYS RES-PLANET,J.

The approach is based on a detailed analysis of 56 Twin-Disc experiments in combination with existing knowledge from the literature. The model considers the thickness of the damaged layer caused by severe plastic shear deformations in the near-surface layer of wheel or rail and the maximum shear stress in the contact as the main influencing factors responsible for the observed wear behaviour. In this way, a much better prediction quality can be reached for varying test and contact conditions compared to the state of the art energy dissipation or sliding based approaches.

The CJ program at the University of Winnipeg began as a distributed and interdisciplinary major, but through a process of self-reflection and discovery, CJ faculty attempted to build a program that was theoretically oriented while not losing sight of its applied roots. The journey can best be described as a mitigation of the protective-services orientation - a somewhat pejorative description of CJ levelled by critical scholars of crime, law, and society. We situate the development of a CJ program at the University of Winnipeg alongside shifts in the traditional liberal arts model of post-secondary education in Canada and reflect upon some of the emerging challenges that face similar departments in the current socio-economic and political climate. The article attempts to open up debate and dialogue about the nature of CJ education in Canada and offers the University of Winnipeg as a case study of the development of the discipline in Canada in a post-secondary context.

However, this test method requires high effort in material, time, and manpower, making it less practical for routine quality control. This study aims to partially substitute the performance-based tests on asphalt mix level with a practical test method on asphalt mastic level. The tests on asphalt mastic level were carried out with a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) by time sweep tests on hyperbolic specimens. Fourteen different asphalt mixtures and the corresponding asphalt mastic mixtures were tested. We used a wide range of different asphalt binders and types of aggregates to extend the validity range of the developed model. Correlations between the asphalt mastic performance and asphalt mix performance were investigated using simple and multiple linear regression models. The correlations show that the dynamic modulus vertical bar E*vertical bar(30H)(z) at asphalt mix level can be linked to the complex shear modulus vertical bar G*vertical bar(i)(nitial) at mastic level by a simple linear regression model. On the other hand, no correlation could be found between the phase angles of both mix levels. However, the characteristic fatigue value of the asphalt mix 86 can be linked with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.92) to the characteristic fatigue value 16 and complex shear modulus vertical bar G*vertical bar(initial )of the asphalt mastic using a multiple linear regression model. In summary, a reliable prediction of the fatigue behavior and stiffness of an asphalt mixture through simple fatigue tests with the DSR on asphalt mastic is feasible.","[Steineder, Michael; Donev, Valentin; Hofko, Bernhard; Eberhardsteiner, Lukas] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Transportat, Gusshausstr 28-E230-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Steineder, M (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Transportat, Gusshausstr 28-E230-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",micheal.steineder@tuwien.ac.at,,,"Austrian Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs","Austrian Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs","The study reported in this paper is part of the research project on Simplified Assessment of Asphalt Mix Performance (Vereinfachung der pruftechnischen Ansprache des Gebrauchsverhaltens von Asphalt)  funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology and the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs.",,38,1,1,4,9,AMER SOC TESTING MATERIALS,W CONSHOHOCKEN,"100 BARR HARBOR DR, W CONSHOHOCKEN, PA 19428-2959 USA",0090-3973,1945-7553,,J TEST EVAL,J.

It is therefore important to find an optimal design that balances their orientation, dimension and shadowing. This paper presents a methodology for the parametric study of a window optimal dimension, based on the thermal performance of a reference room located in the climate region of Coimbra, Portugal. First, the parameters of opening type, orientation, and size are evaluated. During a second stage, the impact of using overhangs is assessed, with one of the most common window types in Portugal. The thermal assessment is carried out by calculating the degree-hours of discomfort using dynamic simulation. Results show that for this location, triple glazing has better performance than single and double glazing, especially for the north orientation. The worst opening orientation is northeast and northwest, independent of the window type. It is observable that optimum window dimension does not imply equal space cooling and heating needs. Results also demonstrate that overhangs do not significantly improve the room's thermal performance but allow windows to have a wider interval of admissible sizes without compromising performance.

Among the sensors supporting the observations of the troposphere, one can distinguish the Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (RO) technique, which provides accurate and high-quality meteorological profiles. However, external knowledge about temperature is essential to estimate other physical atmospheric parameters. To overcome this constraint, I trained and evaluated four different machine learning models comprising Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest regression algorithms, where no auxiliary meteorological data is needed.To develop the models, I employed 150,000 globally distributed (45 degrees S-45 degrees N) RO profiles between October 2019 and December 2020. Input vectors consisted of bending angle or refractivity profiles from the Formosa Satellite-7/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-2 mission together with the month, hour, and latitude of the RO event. While temperature, pressure, and water vapor profiles derived from the modern ERAS reanalysis and interpolated to the RO location served as the models'targets. Evaluation on the testing data set revealed a good agreement between all model outputs and ERAS targets, where slightly better statistics were noted for ANN and refractivity inputs.Vertically averaged root mean square error (RMSE) did not exceed 1.7 K for the temperature and reached around 1.4 hPa and 0.45 hPa for the total and water vapor pressures. Additional validation with 477 co-located radiosonde observations and the operational one-dimensional variational product showed slightly larger discrepancies with the mean RMSE of around 1.9 K, 1.9 hPa, and 0.5 hPa for the temperature, pressure, and water vapor, respectively.","[Lasota, Elzbieta] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Grunwaldzka 53, PL-50356 Wroclaw, Poland",Institute of Geodesy & Cartography; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Lasota, E (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Grunwaldzka 53, PL-50356 Wroclaw, Poland.",elzbieta.lasota@upwr.edu.pl,"Lasota, Elżbieta/AAF-6125-2021","Lasota, Elżbieta/0000-0002-6276-2188",Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences,Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences,This research was conducted under the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science.

We used state-of-the-art satellite-based products to estimate spatial and temporal variations and trends in annual precipitation, evapotranspiration and total water storage change across eastern TP, which were then used to reconstruct an annual runoff variability series for 2003-2014. The basin-scale reconstructed streamflow variability matched well with gauge observations for five large rivers. Annual runoff increased strongly in dry part because of increases in precipitation, but decreased in wet part because of decreases in precipitation, aggravated by noticeable increases in evapotranspiration in the north of wet part. Although precipitation primarily governed temporal-spatial pattern of runoff, total water storage change contributed greatly to runoff variation in regions with wide-spread permanent snow/ice or permafrost. Our study indicates that the contrasting runoff trends between the dry and wet parts of eastern TP requires a change in water security strategy, and attention should be paid to the negative water resources impacts detected for southwestern part which has undergone vast glacier retreat and decreasing precipitation.","[Wang, Yuanyuan] China Meteorol Adm LRCVES CMA, Key Lab Radiometr Calibrat & Validat Environm Sat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanyuan] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Satellite Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yongqiang; Chiew, Francis H.

Marine microbes are the base of the Antarctic food chain, and the nature of their response to elevated pCO(2) is important as they are key determinants of the biogeochemical cycles that affect global climate. We studied the response of a natural community of Antarctic marine microbes from near-shore waters off Davis Station, Antarctica, to pCO(2) ranging from the concentration in the water column at the time the experiment began (ambient, 84 mu atm) to that predicted by the year 2300 (2423 mu atm) using 6 gas-tight, environmentally controlled tanks (minicosms; 650 l) to which CO2-saturated seawater was added. The microbial community showed little difference between 84 and 643 mu atm CO2 (0.2 to 1.7 times present), indicating that they can tolerate the large seasonal range in pCO(2) in Antarctic coastal waters. Concentrations >= 1281 mu atm reduced the accumulation rate of chlorophyll and particulate carbon, changed the microbial community, and enhanced the relative abundance of small phytoplankton. If our results are indicative of the future responses of Antarctic marine microbes, elevated CO2 could profoundly affect the structure and function of the Antarctic food web by reducing the availability of food for higher trophic levels and decreasing the efficiency of the biological pump.","[Davidson, Andrew T.; McKinlay, John; Westwood, Karen; van den Enden, Rick; Wright, Simon] Dept Environm & Water Resources, Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia; [Davidson, Andrew T.; Westwood, Karen; Wright, Simon] Univ Tasmania, ACE CRC, Private Bag 80, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Davidson, Andrew T.; Westwood, Karen; Wright, Simon; Johnson, Robert] Univ Tasmania, IMAS, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Thomson, Paul G.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Environm Syst Engn, Mailstop M470,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Thomson, Paul G.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Mailstop M470,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [de Salas, Miguel] Tasmanian Museum & Art Gallery, Tasmanian Herbarium, Coll Rd, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, Australia; [Berry, Kate] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res Labs, CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res CMAR, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Australian Antarctic Division; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Davidson, AT (corresponding author), Dept Environm & Water Resources, Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia.;Davidson, AT (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, ACE CRC, Private Bag 80, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.;Davidson, AT (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, IMAS, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",andrew.davidson@aad.gov.au,"; Johnson, Robert/E-7321-2012","Westwood, Karen/0000-0003-1060-7140; McKinlay, John/0000-0003-4858-2604; Johnson, Robert/0000-0002-5915-5416","Australian Antarctic Science at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) [AAS 40, 4026]; Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centre's Program through the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC)","Australian Antarctic Science at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD); Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centre's Program through the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC)(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","This work was supported by the Australian Antarctic Science projects AAS 40 and 4026 at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centre's Program through the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC).

Estimates of shortwave absorption in the atmosphere are obtained by combining surface clear-sky and all-sky climatologies derived from the ground observations with collocated top of atmosphere (TOA) clear-sky and all-sky fluxes from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). It is shown that the atmospheric absorption in the cloud-free atmosphere is on average 12 Wm(-2) too low in the GCMs. GCMs which include state-of-the-art radiation schemes and aerosol effects may be able to eliminate a large part of this clear-sky bias. The model-calculated absorption in the cloudy (all-sky) atmosphere is generally not significantly enhanced compared to the cloud-free atmosphere. This is in line with the observational estimates which are similar under all-sky and clear-sky conditions, indicating that the presence of clouds does not substantially alter the absorption of solar radiation within the atmospheric column. The observations therefore do not support recent arguments that clouds in GCMs absorb insufficient solar radiation.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Climate Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Wild, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Climate Res, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012",,,,,,22,16,17,0,1,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Spatial smoothing, such as Gaussian smoothing, not only reduces the noise but also attenuates the real signals. Here we investigate possible amplitude attenuations and phase changes of seasonal water storage variations in four drainage basins (Amazon, Mississippi, Ganges and Zambezi) using an advanced global land data assimilation system. It appears that Gaussian smoothing significantly affects GRACE-estimated basin-scale seasonal water storage changes, e.g., in the case of 800 km smoothing, annual amplitudes are reduced by about 25-40%, while annual phases are shifted by up to 10 degrees. With these effects restored, GRACE-estimated water storage changes are consistently larger than model estimates, indicating that the land surface model appears to underestimate terrestrial water storage change. Our analysis based on simulation suggests that normalized attenuation effects (from Gaussian smoothing) on seasonal water storage change are relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the true signal. This study provides a numerical approach that can be used to restore seasonal water storage change in the basins from spatially smoothed GRACE data.","Univ Texas, Ctr Space Res, Austin, TX 78759 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Chen, JL (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Ctr Space Res, 3925 W Braker Lane,Suite 200, Austin, TX 78759 USA.",chen@csr.utexas.edu; crwilson@mail.utexas.edu; jfamigli@uci.edu; Matthew.Rodell@nasa.gov,"Famiglietti, James S/G-7383-2017; Rodell, Matthew/E-4946-2012","Famiglietti, James S/0000-0002-6053-5379; Rodell, Matthew/0000-0003-0106-7437; Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441",,,,,21,85,96,3,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0949-7714,1432-1394,,J GEODESY,J.

Total annual riverine N (P) loads into the lagoon raised at the 20th century from approximately 14,000 t TN (1,000 t TP) to 115,000 t TN (10,500 t TP) in the 1980ties and declined to about 56,750 t TN (2,800 t TP) after 2010. Nutrient concentrations, water transparency (Secchi depth) and chlorophyll-a showed a positive response to the reduced nutrient loads in the Polish eastern lagoon. This was not the case in the German western lagoon, where summer Secchi depth is 0.6 m and mean chlorophyll-a concentration is four times above the threshold for the Good Ecological Status. Measures to improve the water quality focused until now purely on nutrient load reductions, but the nutrient load targets and Maximal Allowable Inputs are contradicting between EU Water Framework Directive and EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. According to the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, the thresholds of the annual riverine nutrient inputs to the lagoon would be about 48,850 t N (1,570 t P). Actions in the river basins that would allow meeting these targets are hardly achievable. Even if the load targets would be fully implemented, they are not sufficient to transfer the lagoon into a non-eutrophic state. The implementation of EU Water Framework Directive is further hampered, as consistent water quality thresholds for the two parts of Szczecin Lagoon are missing. An approach to harmonize them is presented, which incorporates the spatial differences. By implementing consistent water quality targets, Szczecin Lagoon could serve as blueprint for other trans-boundary waters. In the western lagoon, nutrient load reductions in the past decades had no effect on the water quality. High water residence times, frequent sediment resuspension and the missing submerged vegetation inhibit the load reduction effects on the water quality. Internal measures in the western lagoon are necessary, which aim at removing nutrients and increasing water transparency to overcome the hysteresis effect and to initiate a recovery of macrophytes. Cultivation of zebra mussels seems the most promising approach.","[Friedland, Rene; Schernewski, Gerald; Grawe, Ulf; Palazzo, Dalila] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Rostock, Germany; [Schernewski, Gerald] Klaipeda Univ Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Klaipeda, Lithuania; [Greipsland, Inga] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, As, Norway; [Palazzo, Dalila] STA Engn, Pinerolo, Italy; [Pastuszak, Marianna] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Gdynia, Poland",Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; National Marine Fisheries Research Institute,"Friedland, R (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Rostock, Germany.",rene.friedland@io-warnemuende.de,"Friedland, Rene/AFK-5229-2022","Friedland, Rene/0000-0002-3690-666X",BONUS BALTCOAST [03F0717A]; KUNO project MOSSCO-Synthese [03F0740B]; BONUS (Art. 185) - EU; BONUS (Art. 185) - Baltic Sea national funding institutions,BONUS BALTCOAST; KUNO project MOSSCO-Synthese; BONUS (Art. 185) - EU; BONUS (Art. 185) - Baltic Sea national funding institutions,"The work was supported by BONUS BALTCOAST (03F0717A) and partly by KUNO project MOSSCO-Synthese (03F0740B).

The recent development of single-camera-one-shot techniques for hyperspectral imaging allows multiple spectral bands to be captured simultaneously (3 x 3, 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 mosaic), opening up a wide range of applications. Examples include intraoperative imaging, agricultural field inspection and food quality assessment. To capture images across a wide spectrum range, i.e. to achieve high spectral resolution, the sensor design sacrifices spatial resolution. With increasing mosaic size, this effect becomes increasingly detrimental. Furthermore, demosaicing is challenging. Without incorporating edge, shape, and object information during interpolation, chromatic artifacts are likely to appear in the obtained images. Recent approaches use neural networks for demosaicing, enabling direct information extraction from image data. However, obtaining training data for these approaches poses a challenge as well. This work proposes a parallel neural network based demosaicing procedure trained on a new ground truth dataset captured in a controlled environment by a hyperspectral snapshot camera with a 4 x 4 mosaic pattern. The dataset is a combination of real captured scenes with images from publicly available data adapted to the 4 x 4 mosaic pattern. To obtain real world ground-truth data, we performed multiple camera captures with 1-pixel shifts in order to compose the entire data cube. Experiments show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-art networks.","[Wisotzky, Eric L.; Daudkane, Charul; Hilsmann, Anna; Eisert, Peter] Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Inst, Comp Vis & Graph, Berlin, Germany; [Wisotzky, Eric L.; Eisert, Peter] Humboldt Univ, Inst Informat, Visual Comp, Berlin, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Wisotzky, EL (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Inst, Comp Vis & Graph, Berlin, Germany.;Wisotzky, EL (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Informat, Visual Comp, Berlin, Germany.",eric.wisotzky@hhi.fraunhofer.de,,"Hilsmann, Anna/0000-0002-2086-0951; Eisert, Peter/0000-0001-8378-4805",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16SV8061]; German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWi) [01MK21003],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWi),"This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Grant No. 16SV8061 (MultiARC) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWi) under Grant No. 01MK21003 (NaLamKI).

These and various other aspects influence the delay of transmitting data and therefore of out-of-order data occurrences. This turns into a crucial problem in time-sensitive applications where data must be processed promptly and decisions must be reliable. In this article, we research dynamic buffer sizing algorithms for multiple, distributed, and independent sources, which reorder event streams, thus enabling subsequent time-sensitive applications to work correctly. To be able to evaluate such algorithms, we had to record datasets first. Five novel dynamic buffer sizing algorithms were implemented and compared to state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. The evaluation has shown that the use of a dynamic time-out buffering method is preferable over a static buffer. The higher the variation of the network or other influences in the environment, the more necessary it becomes to use an algorithm that dynamically adapts its buffer size. These algorithms are universally applicable, easy to integrate in existing architectures, and particularly interesting for time-sensitive applications. Dynamic time-out buffering is still a trade-off between reaction time and out-of-order event compensation.","[Weiss, Wolfgang; Zeiner, Herwig] JOANNEUM RES Forsch Gesell MbH, DIGITAL Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Steyrergasse 17, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Jimenez, Victor J.

We infer a calibrated phylogeny of the genus based on nuclear ultraconserved element (UCE) sequences and using Bayesian estimation of divergence times, and use this phylogeny to investigate geographic patterns of diversification with GeoSSE. The southeastern species have hybridized to form hemiclonal lineages, and we also resolve relationships of hemiclones and compare their phylogenetic placement in the UCE phylogeny with a hypothesis based on complete mitochondrial genomes. We then use phased SNPs extracted from the UCE sequences for population structure analysis among the southeastern species and hemiclones. Results Hypseleotris cyprinoides, a widespread euryhaline species known from throughout the Indo-Pacific, is resolved outside the remainder of the species. Two Australian radiations comprise the bulk of Hypseleotris, one primarily in the northwestern coastal rivers and a second inhabiting the southeastern region including the Murray-Darling, Bulloo-Bancannia and Lake Eyre basins, plus coastal rivers east of the Great Dividing Range. Our phylogenetic results reveal cytonuclear discordance between the UCE and mitochondrial hypotheses, place hemiclone hybrids among their parental taxa, and indicate that the genus Kimberleyeleotris is nested within the northwestern Hypseleotris radiation along with three undescribed species. We infer a crown age for Hypseleotris of 17.3 Ma, date the radiation of Australian species at roughly 10.1 Ma, and recover the crown ages of the northwestern (excluding H. compressa) and southeastern radiations at 5.9 and 7.2 Ma, respectively. Range-dependent diversification analyses using GeoSSE indicate that speciation and extinction rates have been steady between the northwestern and southeastern Australian radiations and between smaller radiations of species in the Kimberley region and the Arnhem Plateau. Analysis of phased SNPs confirms inheritance patterns and reveals high levels of heterozygosity among the hemiclones. Conclusions The northwestern species have restricted ranges and likely speciated in allopatry, while the southeastern species are known from much larger areas, consistent with peripatric speciation or allopatric speciation followed by secondary contact. Species in the northwestern Kimberley region differ in shape from those in the southeast, with the Kimberley species notably more elongate and slender than the stocky southeastern species, likely due to the different topographies and flow regimes of the rivers they inhabit.","[Thacker, Christine E.] Barbara Museum Nat Hist, Vertebrate Zool, 2559 Puesta del Sol, Santa Barbara, CA 93105 USA; [Thacker, Christine E.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dept Ichthyol, 900 Exposit Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Shelley, James J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Shelley, James J.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, 123 Brown St, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [McCraney, W.

The state-ofthe-art in monitoring changes in grassland species composition is to conduct repeated plot-based vegetation surveys that assess the occurrence and cover of plants. These plot-based surveys are typically limited to comparably small areas and the quality of the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience and performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the possibility of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover estimates, by analyzing the applicability of very high spatial resolution hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at the level of individuals. This individual-oriented approach is seen as an alternative to community oriented remote sensing depicting canopy reflectance as the total of mixed species reflectance. An AISA + imaging spectrometer mounted on a scaffold was used to scan 1 m(2) grassland plots and assess the impact of four sources of variation on the predicted species cover: (1) the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e. species number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover and (4) the share of functional types (graminoids and forbs). Classifications were conducted using a support vector machine classification with a linear kemel, obtaining a median Kappa of 0.8. Species cover estimations reached median r(2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.6 and 6.2% respectively. We found that the spatial resolution and diversity level (mainly structural diversity) were the most important sources of variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A spatial resolution below 1 cm produced relatively good models for estimating species-specific coverages (r(2) = similar to 0.6; RMSE = similar to 7.5%) while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed in this individual-oriented approach (r(2) = similar to 0.17; RMSE = similar to 20.7%). Areas with low inter-species overlap were better suited than areas with frequent inter-species overlap. We conclude that the application of very high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing in environments with low structural heterogeneity is suited for individual-oriented mapping of grassland plant species.","[Lopatin, Javier; Fassnacht, Fabian E.; Kattenborn, Teja; Schmidtlein, Sebastian] KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Lopatin, J (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",javier.lopatin@kit.edu,"Kattenborn, Teja/I-7457-2019; Lopatin, Javier/P-5200-2015; Fassnacht, Fabian/AAL-5524-2020; Schmidtlein, Sebastian/Q-2919-2016; Fassnacht, Fabian/F-3860-2017","Kattenborn, Teja/0000-0001-7381-3828; Lopatin, Javier/0000-0002-5540-7428; Schmidtlein, Sebastian/0000-0003-1888-1865; Fassnacht, Fabian/0000-0003-1284-9573",Graduate School for Climate and Environment of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology [VH-GS-304],Graduate School for Climate and Environment of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"This investigation was funded by the Graduate School for Climate and Environment of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology [VH-GS-304].

The results show that PCM 29 degrees C and 5 air change natural ventilation rate reduce annual energy consumption by 15%. This means that while for 38 days in spring and 29 days in autumn, the mechanical equipment can be turned off. The thermal performance of PCM 25 degrees C is very well in spring.

The data set was used to assess cloud droplet closure using ( 1) a detailed adiabatic cloud parcel model and ( 2) a state-of-the-art cloud droplet activation parameterization. A unique feature of the data set is the sampling of highly polluted clouds within the vicinity of power plant plumes. Remarkable closure was achieved ( much less than the 20% measurement uncertainty) for both parcel model and parameterization. The highly variable aerosol did not complicate the cloud droplet closure, since the clouds had low maximum supersaturation and were not sensitive to aerosol variations ( which took place at small particle sizes). The error in predicted cloud droplet concentration was mostly sensitive to updraft velocity. Optimal closure is obtained if the water vapor uptake coefficient is equal to 0.06, but can range between 0.03 and 1.0. The sensitivity of cloud droplet prediction error to changes in the uptake coefficient, organic solubility and surface tension depression suggest that organics exhibit limited solubility. These findings can serve as much needed constraints in modeling of aerosol-cloud interactions in the North America; future in situ studies will determine the robustness of our findings.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; CALTECH, Dept Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Naval Postgrad Sch, Ctr Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft S, Monterey, CA 93933 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Fountoukis, C (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",nenes@eas.gatech.edu,"Sorooshian, Armin/E-5035-2010; Nenes, Athanasios/ABE-6478-2020","Sorooshian, Armin/0000-0002-2243-2264; Nenes, Athanasios/0000-0003-3873-9970; Meskhidze, Nicholas/0000-0001-5628-8777",,,,,56,78,79,2,22,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

In this work, we proposed a novel passive double-heating and double-cooling system, and integrated it into the residential buildings within this climate zone, aiming at improvement of the building energy efficiency. The proposed passive system includes a passive double-heating system (i.e., solar heating and water-to-air heating) and a passive double-cooling system (i.e., vegetation transpiration cooling and water-to-air cooling). Furthermore, a stand-alone residential building was selected as the study building, to evaluate its energy efficiency by applying the proposed passive system. Due to the passive system with double-heating and double-cooling functions, the indoor thermal comfort in the study building can be improved more significantly, in comparison with the base case. Moreover, a novel hydraulic-driven ventilation device was designed as an air-driven apparatus for the proposed passive system. Through air movement driven by the solar chimney and the hydraulic-driven ventilation device, the proposed passive system can be run without energy supply, under both the clear and rainy weather conditions.

Greenhouses constitute a major energy consumer of the agricultural sector in the European Union. Although strictly speaking, greenhouses differ from buildings in several ways, such as the construction, the building systems and the use, the principles used to analyse the energy consumption of greenhouses, as well as the strategies to control their energy performance are quite similar with those of the building sector. This study aims to present the recent advancements in the analysis of the energy performance of greenhouses, with a special focus on next generation greenhouses, also known as intelligent greenhouses. The main energy consumption sources in greenhouses, as well as their normalized intensity is presented. State-of-the-art automations to control the energy performance of greenhouses, as well as intelligent systems used to achieve the required thermal conditions in greenhouses, such as automation systems, infrared heating and advanced covering materials are presented.

Rainfall reconstructions in China have revealed changing patterns of rainfall during the Little Ice Age (LIA), but limited hydroclimate reconstruction around Japan have hindered detailed understanding of physical processes associated with the atmospheric system in the western North Pacific. Here, we report relative humidity variations in the Meiyu/Baiu season from 1600-1959 CE by using tree-ring cellulose oxygen isotopes from central Japan; this is the first record of the LIA from the easternmost regions of the East Asian monsoon domain. Our data suggest that the wettest period occurred around 1780-1880 CE corresponding to the final stage of the LIA. This shift was concurrent with sea surface temperature negative (positive) anomalies around the Philippines (off eastern Japan).

Severe floods have occurred in Europe over the last decade, causing loss of life, displacement of people and heavy economic losses. Flood disasters are growing in frequency as a consequence of many factors, both climatic and non-climatic. Indeed, the current increase of water-related disasters can be mainly attributed to the increase of exposure (elements potentially at risk in flood-prone area) and vulnerability (i.e. economic, social, geographic, cultural and physical/environmental characteristics of the exposure). Besides these factors, the undeniable effect of climate change is projected to strongly modify the usual pattern of the hydrological cycle by intensifying the frequency and severity of flood events at the local, regional and global scale. Within this context, the need for developing effective and pro-active strategies, tools and actions which allow one to assess and (possibly) to reduce the flood risks that threatens different relevant receptors becomes urgent. Several methodologies to assess the risk posed by water-related natural hazards have been proposed so far, but very few of them can be adopted to implement the last European Flood Directive (FD). This paper is intended to introduce and present a state-of-the-art Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology to appraise the risk posed by floods from a physical-environmental perspective. The methodology, developed within the recently completed FP7-KULTURisk Project (Knowledge-based approach to develop a cULTUre of Risk prevention - KR) is flexible and can be adapted to different case studies (i.e. plain rivers, mountain torrents, urban and coastal areas) and spatial scales (i.e. from catchment to the urban scale). The FD compliant KR-RRA methodology is based on the concept of risk being function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. It integrates the outputs of various hydrodynamic models with site-specific bio-geophysical and socio-economic indicators (e.g. slope, land cover, population density, economic activities etc.) to develop tailored risk indexes and GIS-based maps for each of the selected receptors (i.e. people, buildings, infrastructure, agriculture, natural and semi-natural systems, cultural heritage) in the considered region. It further compares the baseline scenario with alternative scenarios, where different structural and/or non-structural mitigation measures are planned and eventually implemented. As demonstrated in the companion paper (Part 2, Ronco et al., 2014), risk maps, along with related statistics, allow one to identify and classify, on a relative scale, areas at risk which are more likely to be affected by floods and support the development of strategic adaptation and prevention measures to minimizing flood impacts. In addition, the outcomes of the RRA can be eventually used for a further socio-economic assessment, considering the tangible and intangible costs as well as the human dimension of vulnerability.","[Ronco, P.; Gallina, V.; Zabeo, A.; Semenzin, E.; Critto, A.; Marcomini, A.] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Ronco, P.; Torresan, S.; Critto, A.; Marcomini, A.] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Impacts Soil & Coast Div, Lecce, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy.",marcom@unive.it,"Zabeo, Alex/D-6715-2014; Zabeo, Alex/O-4573-2019","Zabeo, Alex/0000-0001-7162-5364; Zabeo, Alex/0000-0001-7162-5364; Semenzin, Elena/0000-0001-8032-8687; TORRESAN, Silvia/0000-0002-9758-7084; Critto, Andrea/0000-0001-8868-9057","European Commission [FP7-ENV-2010, 265280]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was found by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission within the collaborative project Knowledge-based approach to develop a culture of risk prevention (KULTURisk), FP7-ENV-2010, project 265280; www.kulturisk.eu.

While satellites can provide a snapshot of current conditions at the overpass time, models are necessary to simulate temporal variations in both particle and cloud properties. However, poor model accuracy limits the reliability with which these tools can be used to predict future climate. Here, we leverage the comprehensive ocean ecosystem and atmospheric aerosol- cloud dataset obtained during the third deployment of the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES3). Airborne and ship-based measurements were collected in and around a cold-air outbreak during a 3 d (where d stands for day) intensive operations period from 17-19 September 2017. Cold-air outbreaks are of keen interest for model validation because they are challenging to accurately simulate, which is due, in part, to the numerous feedbacks and sub-grid-scale processes that influence aerosol and cloud evolution. The NAAMES observations are particularly valuable because the flight plans were tailored to lie along Lagrangian trajectories, making it possible to spatiotemporally connect upwind and downwind measurements with the state-of-the-art FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) Lagrangian particle dispersion model and then calculate a rate of change in particle properties. Initial aerosol conditions spanning an east-west, closed-cell-to-clear-air transition region of the cold-air outbreak indicate similar particle concentrations and properties. However, despite the similarities in the aerosol fields, the cloud properties downwind of each region evolved quite differently. One trajectory carried particles through a cold-air outbreak, resulting in a decrease in accumulation mode particle concentration (-42 %) and cloud droplet concentrations, while the other remained outside of the cold-air outbreak and experienced an increase in accumulation mode particle concentrations (+62 %). The variable meteorological conditions between these two adjacent trajectories result from differences in the local sea surface temperature in the Labrador Current and surrounding waters, altering the stability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Further comparisons of historical satellite observations indicate that the observed pattern occurs annually in the region, making it an ideal location for future airborne Lagrangian studies tracking the evolution of aerosols and clouds over time under cold-air outbreak conditions.","[Sanchez, Kevin J.; Gallo, Francesca; Wiggins, Elizabeth B.] Univ Space Res Assoc, NASA, Postdoctoral Program, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Sanchez, Kevin J.; Brown, Matthew D.; Crosbie, Ewan C.; Gallo, Francesca; Hair, Johnathan W.; Hostetler, Chris A.; Jordan, Carolyn E.; Robinson, Claire E.; Scarino, Amy Jo; Shingler, Taylor J.; Shook, Michael A.; Thornhill, Kenneth L.; Wiggins, Elizabeth B.; Winstead, Edward L.; Ziemba, Luke D.; Moore, Richard H.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA; [Zhang, Bo; Liu, Hongyu; Jordan, Carolyn E.] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA USA; [Brown, Matthew D.; Crosbie, Ewan C.; Robinson, Claire E.; Scarino, Amy Jo; Thornhill, Kenneth L.; Winstead, Edward L.] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA USA; [Saliba, Georges; Lewis, Savannah L.; Russell, Lynn M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Quinn, Patricia K.; Bates, Timothy S.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Bates, Timothy S.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bell, Thomas G.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Porter, Jack; Bell, Thomas G.; Saltzman, Eric S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Gaube, Peter] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Air Sea Interact & Remote Sensing Dept, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Behrenfeld, Michael J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; National Institute for Aerospace; Science Systems and Applications Inc; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Oregon State University,"Sanchez, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Space Res Assoc, NASA, Postdoctoral Program, Columbia, MD 21046 USA.;Sanchez, KJ; Moore, RH (corresponding author), NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA.",kevin.j.sanchez@nasa.gov; richard.h.moore@nasa.gov,"Moore, Richard/ABI-4522-2020","Moore, Richard/0000-0003-2911-4469; Liu, Hongyu/0000-0002-2164-6383; Sanchez, Kevin/0000-0003-4456-0918; Jordan, Carolyn/0000-0001-8164-5967","National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX15AE66G, NNX15AF30G, NNX15AF31G]; Division of Ocean Sciences [NSFOCE-1537943]",National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Division of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This research has been supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (grant nos.

Most prominent precipitation anomalies occur over the ocean in the North Atlantic, where in winter a quadrupole-like pattern is found with centers in the western tropical Atlantic, sub-tropical Atlantic, high-latitude eastern Atlantic and over the Labrador Sea. The extent of the subtropical and high-latitude center and the amount of explained variance (over 50%) are quite remarkable. However, the tropical Atlantic center is probably the most intriguing feature of this pattern apparently linking the NAO with ITCZ variability. In summer, the pattern is tripole-like with centers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea/Baltic Sea and in the sub-polar Atlantic. In the eastern Indian Ocean, the correlation is positive in winter and negative in summer, with some link to ENSO variability. The sensitivity of these patterns to the choice of the NAO index is minor in winter while quite important in summer. Interannual NAO precipitation anomalies have driven similar fresh water variations in these key regions. In the sub-tropical and high-latitude Atlantic in winter precipitation anomalies have been roughly 15 and 10% of climatology per unit change of the NAO, respectively. Decadal changes of the NAO during the last 50 years have also influenced precipitation and fresh water flux at these time-scales, with values lower (higher) than usual in the high-latitude eastern North Atlantic (Labrador Sea) in the 1960s and the late 1970s, and an opposite situation since the early 1980s; in summer the North Sea/Baltic region has been drier than usual during the period 1965-1975 when the NAO was generally positive.","Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; ENEA, Rome, Italy",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Mariotti, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, ESSIC, 2207 Comp & Space Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",amariott@essic.umd.edu,"Arkin, Phillip/F-5808-2010","Arkin, Phillip/0000-0002-5769-7107",,,,,65,24,24,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Tephra deposits also provide spatially widespread, high-resolution time-stratigraphic markers across a range of sedimentary settings and thus are used in numerous disciplines (e.g., volcanology, climate science, archaeology). Nonetheless, the study of tephra deposits is challenged by a lack of standardization that inhibits data integration across geographic regions and disciplines. We present comprehensive recommendations for tephra data gathering and reporting that were developed by the tephra science community to guide future investigators and to ensure that sufficient data are gathered for interoperability. Recommendations include standardized field and laboratory data collection, reporting and correlation guidance. These are organized as tabulated lists of key metadata with their definition and purpose. They are system independent and usable for template, tool, and database development.

Here, we analyse the available published literature to assess whether it may be possible to estimate SOC using data from sensors mounted on satellites and airborne systems. This is complemented with research using a series of semi-structured interviews with experts in soil health and policy areas to understand the level of accuracy that is acceptable for MRV approaches for SOC. We also perform a cost-accuracy analysis of the approaches, including the use of EO techniques, for SOC assessment in the context of the new UK Environmental Land Management scheme. We summarise the state-of-the-art EO techniques for SOC assessment and identify 3 themes and 25 key suggestions and concerns for the MRV of SOC from the expert interviews. Notably, over three-quarters of the respondents considered that a 'validation accuracy' of 90% or better would be required from EO-based techniques to be acceptable as an effective system for the monitoring and reporting of SOC stocks. The cost-accuracy analysis revealed that a combination of EO technology and in situ sampling has the potential to offer a reliable, cost-effective approach to estimating SOC at a local scale (4 ha), although several challenges remain. We conclude by proposing an MRV framework for SOC that collates and integrates seven criteria for multiple data sources at the appropriate scales.","[Andries, Ana; Morse, Stephen; Murphy, Richard J.; Lynch, Jim] Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Mota, Bernardo; Woolliams, Emma R.] Natl Phys Lab, Climate & Earth Observat Grp, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England",University of Surrey; National Physical Laboratory - UK,"Andries, A (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",a.andries@surrey.ac.uk; s.morse@suney.ac.uk; rj.murphy@surrey.ac.uk; j.lynch@surrey.ac.uk; bernardo.mota@npl.co.uk; emma.woolliams@npl.co.uk,"; Woolliams, Emma/A-2404-2014","Andries, Ana/0000-0002-6042-269X; Woolliams, Emma/0000-0003-3517-1486; MURPHY, Richard/0000-0002-3063-515X",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) SCENARIO Doctoral Training Partnership [NE/L002566/1]; CASE award partner the National Physical Laboratory (NPL); UKRI/Research England SPF via the University of Surrey; University of Surrey,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) SCENARIO Doctoral Training Partnership(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); CASE award partner the National Physical Laboratory (NPL); UKRI/Research England SPF via the University of Surrey; University of Surrey,"This research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) SCENARIO Doctoral Training Partnership, Grant/Award NE/L002566/1, CASE award partner the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and by UKRI/Research England SPF funding via the University of Surrey.

The maximum problem size achievable was limited by the storage requirements of the block tree structure. To mitigate this limitation, we have added multi-threaded OpenMP parallelization to the previous pure MPI implementation. We opted to use a coarse-grained approach by making the loops over grid blocks multi-threaded and have succeeded in making BATS-R-US an efficient hybrid parallel code with modest changes in the source code while preserving the performance. Good weak scalings up to hundreds of thousands of cores were achieved both for explicit and implicit time stepping schemes. This parallelization strategy greatly extended the possible simulation scale from 16,000 cores to more than 500,000 cores with 2GB/core memory on the Blue Waters supercomputer. Our work also revealed significant performance issues for some of the compilers when the code is compiled with the OpenMP library, probably related to the less efficient optimization of a complex multi-threaded region.

This review discusses the prevailing status of research and development of BCLG in terms of production of high-quality syngas and negative carbon emissions based on the latest experi-mental and modelling studies. In particular, the design of the BCLG process and reactors is compared with conventional gasification. This review suggests that the BCLG process could be 10-25 % more efficient than the conventional combustion and gasification system in terms of economical H-2-production cost (3.37 USD/kg H-2 -produced) and negative life cycle emissions of CO2 (-14.58 kg-CO(2)e/ kg-H-2 produced). This review has extensively considered the effects of process parameters and oxygen carriers (OCs) on gasification chemistry and reaction engineering during BCLG experiments. More specifically, the properties of OCs have been holistically analysed from technological, economic, and environmental perspectives to screen appropriate and affordable OCs for BCLG. In addition, the state-of-the-art modelling studies on BCLG are compared in terms of thermody-namic equilibrium, kinetics, and integrated processes. Technological challenges and research gaps in experi-ments and modelling have been highlighted in order to advance the BCLG process for industrial applications. In particular, further experimental work is needed to tackle issues related to stability and deactivation of OCs, fluidisation and circulation, the mechanical strength of OCs, the optimisation of feed conversion, and the inte-gration and management of various thermal reactors. It is also desired to enhance the accuracy of models by incorporating optimisation of integrated processes and a more detailed reaction mechanism. Overall, BCLG is a promising negative emissions technology for renewable energy production, yet more innovative efforts in experimental and modelling studies are imperative to move towards more practical applications.","[Goel, Avishek; He, Chao; Konttinen, Jukka] Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Mat Sci & Environm Engn, Tampere, Finland; [Moghaddam, Elyas M.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Mech, Maritime & Mat Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Liu, Wen] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Chem & Biomed Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Tampere University; Delft University of Technology; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"He, C (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Mat Sci & Environm Engn, Tampere, Finland.",avishek.goel@tuni.fi; chao.he@tuni.fi,"He, Chao/O-6384-2015","He, Chao/0000-0001-7869-7627; Goel, Avishek/0000-0001-9640-607X","Academy Research Fellowship - Academy of Finland [341052, 346578]; Tampere University research platform on Climate Neutral Energy Systems and Society (CNESS)",Academy Research Fellowship - Academy of Finland; Tampere University research platform on Climate Neutral Energy Systems and Society (CNESS),"Acknowledgement This work is supported by the Academy Research Fellowship and its research project funded by the Academy of Finland (decision numbers: 341052, 346578) , Tampere University research platform on Climate Neutral Energy Systems and Society (CNESS) .",,188,2,2,13,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

To mitigate their occurrences and impact, many approaches are being adopted, with varying successes. Because of their increased versatility and increasing efficiency, Artificial Intelligence-based methods have been experiencing a significant level of adoption. The present work extensively reviews the literature on intelligent systems incorporating sensor technologies and/or machine learning methods to mitigate WVCs. Included in our review is an investigation of key factors contributing to human-wildlife conflicts, as well as a discussion of dominant state-of-the-art datasets used in the mitigation of WVCs. Our study combines a systematic review with bibliometric analysis. We find that most animal detection systems (excluding autonomous vehicles) are relying neither on state-of-the-art datasets nor on recent breakthrough machine learning approaches. We, therefore, argue that the use of the latest datasets and machine learning techniques will minimize false detection and improve model performance. In addition, the present work covers a comprehensive list of associated challenges ranging from failure to detect hotspot areas to limitations in training datasets. Future research directions identified include the design and development of algorithms for real-time animal detection systems. The latter provides a rationale for the applicability of our proposed solutions, for which we designed a continuous product development lifecycle to determine their feasibility.","[Nandutu, Irene; Atemkeng, Marcellin; Okouma, Patrice] Rhodes Univ, Dept Math, Artillery Rd, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Atemkeng, M (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Math, Artillery Rd, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa.",irenenanduttu@gmail.com; m.atemkeng@ru.ac.za; p.okouma@ru.ac.za,,"Nandutu, Irene/0000-0003-0356-7080; OKOUMA, Patrice/0000-0002-3314-6474; Atemkeng, Marcellin Teufack/0000-0002-9020-3885",Rhodes University,Rhodes University,This study was carried out with financial support from Rhodes University.,,148,2,2,8,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2022,7,,,,,,2478,10.3390/s22072478,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22072478,,,47,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,0K0TF,35408093,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000780509100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the limitations and measurement errors of real perception sensors need to be simulated realistically in order to generate useful sensor data for the ADAS/AD function under test. In this paper, a novel sensor modeling approach for automotive perception sensors is introduced. The novel approach combines kernel density estimation with regression modeling and puts the main focus on the position measurement errors. The modeling approach is designed for any automotive perception sensor that provides position estimations at the object level. To demonstrate and evaluate the new approach, a common state-of-the-art automotive camera (Mobileye 630) was considered. Both sensor measurements (Mobileye position estimations) and ground-truth data (DGPS positions of all attending vehicles) were collected during a large measurement campaign on a Hungarian highway to support the development and experimental validation of the new approach. The quality of the model was tested and compared to reference measurements, leading to a pointwise position error of 9.60% in the lateral and 1.57% in the longitudinal direction. Additionally, the modeling of the natural scattering of the sensor model output was satisfying. In particular, the deviations of the position measurements were well modeled with this approach.","[Genser, Simon; Muckenhuber, Stefan; Solmaz, Selim; Reckenzaun, Jakob] Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21a, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Muckenhuber, Stefan] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Genser, S (corresponding author), Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21a, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",simon.genser@v2c2.at; stefan.muckenhuber@v2c2.at; selim.solmaz@v2c2.at; jakob.reckenzaun@v2c2.at,"Solmaz, Selim/I-4973-2019","Solmaz, Selim/0000-0003-0686-1306; Reckenzaun, Jakob/0000-0002-7105-4554; Genser, Simon/0000-0002-7537-2058; Muckenhuber, Stefan/0000-0003-1920-8437",COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),"This research received financial support within the COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK), the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), the Province of Styria (Dept. 12), and the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG).",,48,3,3,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2021,22,,,,,,7583,10.3390/s21227583,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21227583,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,XI1MY,34833657,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000725886200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It suggests related biological and technological mechanisms for explaining the paucity of genetic or fossil evidence for extensive hybridisation between both early and recent Homo sapiens sapiens ('Moderns'), on the one hand, and northern and western 'classic' Neanderthals, on the other. Its 'insulation hypothesis' includes an explanation of why a population resulting from an admixture of Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans may have been constrained to the Levant between at least c. 120-92 ka BP (H. sapiens sapiens at Skhul and Qafzeh) and c. 45 ka (H. sapiens sapiens at Geula).

This paper investigates the effectiveness of both deterministic and stochastic models in reproducing window openings, using a Post-Occupancy evaluation (POE). A summer monitoring campaign in offices settled in Mediterranean climate was performed to acquire experimental data. Results highlight that deterministic approaches poorly reflect real behaviours. Probabilistic models seem to represent effective users' actions. Findings demonstrate the urgent need of behavioural approaches in simulations. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In Mediterranean areas, where many environmental and economic factors often reduce rural areas to marginal conditions, the search for new crop opportunities has become one of the newest topics in agricultural research. In this review, we focus on the state-of-the-art cultivation of essential oil crops, in Mediterranean environments with a special interest in herbs. The following are the major points of our analysis. (1) Growing such crops as specialized cultivations, especially for species native to the selected environments, is the only practical and sustainable way to obtain naturally derived raw matter for both industrial and domestic purposes. (2) Most essential oil crops are suitable for many different uses, and fully adaptable for transformation even by small, local manufacturers. (3) In many cases, they may be grown with environmentally friendly or organic techniques; this enhances their environmental compatibility and also gives them an additional economical advantage, raising their chances to be addressed in the emerging market sector of natural products. Our conclusion is that crops grown for the extraction of economically valuable essential oils may be a strategic resource for many environments, even marginal, and that there is scope for farmers to improve the cultivation of such species on arable land. There is room, however, for many agronomic and economic questions to be studied in future experimentation and research.","[Carrubba, Alessandra; Catalano, Caterina] Univ Palermo, DAAT, Dept Environm & Land Agron, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Carrubba, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, DAAT, Dept Environm & Land Agron, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",acarr@unipa.it,"Carrubba, Alessandra/B-2424-2012","Carrubba, Alessandra/0000-0003-3276-0074",,,,,221,31,31,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-90-481-2715-3,,,,2009,,,,,137,187,,10.1007/978-90-481-2716-0_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-2716-0_8,10.1007/978-90-481-2716-0,,51,Agronomy; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Soil Science,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BLX03,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000271246800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

These extinctions have been variably attributed to the impacts of climate change and human interference. However, until relatively recently, research has been largely restricted to the Americas, Europe, and Australasia. We present the oldest Middle-Late Pleistocene stratified and numerically dated faunal succession for the Indian subcontinent from the Billasurgam cave complex. Our data demonstrate continuity of 20 of 21 identified mammalian taxa from at least 100,000 y ago to the present, and in some cases up to 200,000 y ago. Comparison of this fossil record to contemporary faunal ranges indicates some geographical redistribution of mammalian taxa within India. We suggest that, although local extirpations occurred, the majority of taxa survived or adapted to substantial ecological pressures in fragmented habitats. Comparison of the Indian record with faunal records from Southeast and Southwest Asia demonstrates the importance of interconnected mosaic habitats to long-term faunal persistence across the Asian tropics. The data presented here have implications for mammalian conservation in India today, where increasing ecological circumscription may leave certain taxa increasingly endangered in the most densely populated region of the world.","[Roberts, Patrick; Ditchfield, Peter; Petraglia, Michael D.] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Delson, Eric] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Delson, Eric] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Anthropol, Bronx, NY 10468 USA; [Delson, Eric; Gilbert, Christopher C.; Gunnell, Gregg F.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, PhD Program Anthropol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Delson, Eric; Gilbert, Christopher C.; Gunnell, Gregg F.; Harrison, Terry] New York Consortium Evolutionary Primatol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Miracle, Preston] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Cambridge CB2 3DZ, England; [Roberts, Richard G.; Jacobs, Zenobia] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Blinkhorn, James] Univ Bordeaux 1, Lab Prehist Actuel Culture Environm & Anthropol, F-33405 Talence, France; [Ciochon, Russell L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Anthropol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Ciochon, Russell L.] Univ Iowa, Museum Nat Hist, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Fleagle, John G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Stony Brook, NY USA; [Frost, Stephen R.] Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, Eugene, OR 97132 USA; [Gilbert, Christopher C.] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Gunnell, Gregg F.] Duke Lemur Ctr, Div Fossil Primates, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Harrison, Terry] NYU, Dept Anthropol, Ctr Study Human Origins, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Korisettar, Ravi] Karnatak Univ, Dr DC Pavate Chair Art & Archaeol, Dharwad 580003, Karnataka, India; [Petraglia, Michael D.] Smithsonian Inst, Human Origins Program, Washington, DC 20560 USA",University of Oxford; American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; University of Cambridge; University of Wollongong; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; University of Iowa; University of Iowa; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Oregon; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); New York University; Karnatak University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History,"Petraglia, MD (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",michael.petraglia@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021; Roberts, Richard Graham/B-8245-2013; Jacobs, Zenobia/B-2721-2012","Roberts, Richard Graham/0000-0002-0128-4119; Jacobs, Zenobia/0000-0001-5424-5837; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727; Roberts, Patrick/0000-0002-4403-7548; Blinkhorn, James/0000-0002-9399-5515; Delson, Eric/0000-0002-4062-7567; Gilbert, Christopher/0000-0001-8768-3171",British Academy; Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council [295719]; Australian Research Council,British Academy; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank Miriam Belmaker, John de Vos, and Chris Stimpson for suggestions regarding faunal continuity in the Levant, Southeast Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula, respectively.

With this in mind, the daily temperature and relative humidity (RH) cycles within the Brown Gallery at Knole House, Kent, have been reconstructed for the period 1605-2015 enabling the study of low-cycle environmental fatigue on a set of seventeenth century panel paintings. By establishing a relationship between the temperature in the Brown Gallery and the Hadley Centre Central England Temperature (HadCET) dataset over a sixteen year period (2000-2015), it is possible to use the full HadCET dataset to obtain the daily minimum and maximum temperatures in the Brown Gallery for the period 1878-2015. Using a Fourier series to fit the periodic data it is then possible to extrapolate back to 1605. Furthermore, correction factors derived using the HadCET average daily temperature in the period 1772-1877 and average monthly temperature in the period 1659-1771 are applied to the temperature data to increase the model accuracy. The daily minimum and maximum RH for the period 1605-2015 are obtained using the Brown Gallery maximum and minimum temperatures respectively, and assuming that the daily dew point temperature at Knole is calculated by subtracting a monthly-dependent constant from the daily minimum temperature at Knole, thus enabling the calculation of the daily actual water vapour pressure of air. Changes in RH are a result of the daily temperature cycle changing the saturation vapour pressure of air in the gallery. This data is valuable as it enables a study of the effects of low-cycle fatigue on the seventeenth century panel paintings housed in the Brown Gallery at Knole House, Kent due to these temperature and relative humidity cycles. Furthermore, the method presented offers a technique that can be utilised to replicate the internal environment for any unheated monument building so that the effects of past and future temperature and humidity cycles on cultural heritage can be examined.

Previous work that addressed future challenges of urban water management focused mainly on climate change. This article develops a comprehensive index for forward-looking decisions about urban water management, to assess the extent to which, and how, Dutch municipalities anticipate the future with their investment decisions on urban water infrastructure. Results are based on a systematic comparison of investment decisions of 40 Dutch municipalities (about 10% of the population). Findings show that: 1) the extent to which municipalities anticipate the future differs largely; 2) only half of the municipalities adopt a long time perspective; 3) there are no commonly applied robustness tests; 4) flexibility is not explicitly adopted; rather, different flexible measures are applied; and 5) a minority of municipalities develop strategic visions or scenarios for urban water management to support decisions. These results highlight important areas of attention for municipalities worldwide. First, the need to invest in ageing water infrastructure can be seized as an opportunity to establish futureproof urban water management. Furthermore, climate change should be integrated with other future uncertainties into water management decisions. Third, transboundary cooperation could potentially increase municipalities' capacity to address uncertain futures and enhance learning. And last, increasing the use of scenario analysis and envisioning could help municipalities to prepare for the future. The index provided can be used for ex ante development and ex post assessment of investment decisions, to increase municipalities' preparedness for the future.","[Pot, Wieke] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Pot, W (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",wieke.pot@wur.nl,,"Pot, Wieke/0000-0001-8925-7539","NWO, the Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research [869.15.012]","NWO, the Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research","The author would like to thank Robbert Biesbroek, Art Dewulf, Maarten van der Vlist, and Evrim Tan for comments on previous versions of this article.

We theorise the student researcher community interactions from two case studies and offer insights into the ways that student researchers employ cultural capital in efforts to build local momentum for EfS and enhance community wellbeing. The first case study explores a student researcher's entanglements with a school's cultural arts class which took its weekly rug-making sessions into the local community centre. Students taught others how to latch hook a rug, positioning students in a different light-as cultural producers and contributors to their community. The second case study investigates a student researcher led community engagement event, 'Don't Mess with Burnie', which was designed to involve students in taking action to address marine litter. Activities included a beach clean-up, explorations of the water cycle, and found-object art. Through this event school students were empowered to make a difference to the local beach foreshore where they play. Through a discussion of student researcher cultural capital, this paper offers theoretical insights into the `living laboratory possibilities' of university research and community collaborations more generally.","[Emery, Sherridan; Beasy, Kim; Coleman, Bianca] Univ Tasmania, Fac Educ, Newnham Dr, Newnham 7250, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Emery, S (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Fac Educ, Newnham Dr, Newnham 7250, Australia.",sherridan.emery@utas.edu.au; kim.beasy@utas.edu.au; bianca.coleman@utas.edu.au,"Beasy, Kim/F-7375-2015; Emery, Sherridan/I-9336-2014","Beasy, Kim/0000-0002-5998-1419; Emery, Sherridan/0000-0003-2949-2793",,,,,19,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2199-7373,2199-7381,978-3-030-15604-6; 978-3-030-15603-9,WORLD SUSTAIN SER,,,2020,,,,,435,447,,10.1007/978-3-030-15604-6_27,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15604-6_27,,,13,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Education & Educational Research,BQ3OC,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000587294100027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The empirical part of the study aimed to conduct scientific research amongst the civil engineering students in Croatia, as a part of the Millennial generation that will be tomorrow's decision-makers. Findings suggest that Millennials from the tested sample in Croatia are aware of the environmental issues as well as the green roof concept, willing to consider including green roofs in their future urban environment whilst believing that they can make a personal, positive contribution on a local level in the reduction of climate risks. However, while praising very highly the presence of green infrastructure in the immediate living environment, they are almost indifferent to its absence and ranked this criterion very low when making employment decisions. Since Millennials are also rightfully concerned with the cost of green roofs design, construction and maintenance, authors find financial aspects of green infrastructure and green roofs in particular as an important direction of future research.","[Rogina, Danijela; Nukic, Ivana Sandrk] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Rogina, D (corresponding author), Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",drogina@gfos.hr; isandrknukic@gfos.hr,,,,,,,53,0,0,2,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2020,,,,,1338,1352,,,,,,15,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BS5EP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000728402200098,View Full Record in Web of Science

Downward tracer transport in the northern midlatitude stratosphere is found to be faster than at southern midlatitudes. The global mean downward transport to the troposphere from stratosphere mainly occurs during northern winter and the downward cross-tropopause transport is weakest from August to October. The maximum troposphere mean (TM) age-of-air, derived from an age tracer released near the stratopause (around 1 hPa), can reach 13 years and is much larger than the maximum stratosphere mean (SM) age-of-air derived from an analogous age tracer released in the troposphere, with the SM age-of-air in the Northern Hemisphere being younger than in the Southern Hemisphere. Increased SSTs tend to accelerate upward transport through the stratosphere and slow downward transport in midlatitudes and the tropical stratosphere. In the context of effects of GHG increases and the associated SST increases on the stratosphere mean age-of-air, the GHG effects dominate, i.e., changes in the stratospheric mean age-of-air caused by SST increases only are smaller than those caused by combined changes in SSTs and GHGs. An increase in SSTs enhances the upward Eliasen-Palm (EP) flux in the extratropics. A 7.7% enhancement of tropical upwelling can be caused by a uniform 1.5 K SST increase. When both SST and GHG values are increased to the 2100 conditions, the meridional heat flux decreases in both winter hemispheres (and statistically significantly in the Southern Hemisphere). Meanwhile, the EP flux in the Northern Hemisphere increases significantly and the tropical upwelling is enhanced by 15% compared to the present-day conditions.","[Shu, Jianchuan; Tian, Wenshou; Xie, Fei; Wang, Wuke] Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Minist Educ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Tian, Wenshou; Chipperfield, Martyn P.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, ICAS, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Austin, John] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA",Lanzhou University; University of Leeds; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Shu, JC (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Minist Educ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",wstian@lzu.edu.cn,"Xie, Fei/I-9766-2016; Chipperfield, Martyn/H-6359-2013","Xie, Fei/0000-0003-2891-3883; Chipperfield, Martyn/0000-0002-6803-4149",National Science Foundation of China [40730949]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB428604]; Education Ministry of China,"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Education Ministry of China(Ministry of Education, China)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (40730949) and National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB428604).

Metabarcoding relies on high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies, which yield millions of DNA sequences in parallel and allow large-scale analysis of environmental samples. Metabarcoding studies of marine zooplankton have used various regions of nuclear small- (18S) and large-subunit (28S) rRNA, which allow accurate classification of novel sequences and reliable amplification with consensus primers, but-due to their relatively conserved nature-may underestimate species diversity in a community. To discriminate species, more variable genes are needed. A limited number of metabarcoding studies have used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), which ensures detection of species-level diversity, but may require group-specific primers and thus result in inconsistent amplification success rates. Reference databases with sequences for accurately-identified species are critically needed to allow taxonomic designation of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) and comparison with previous studies of zooplankton diversity. Potential and promising applications of metabarcoding include rapid detection of impacts of climate change, monitoring and assessment of ecosystem health, calculation of biotic indices, characterization of food webs and detection of introduced, non-indigenous species.","[Bucklin, Ann] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Lindeque, Penelope K.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara] AZTI, Div Marine Res, Sukarrieta 48395, Bizkaia, Spain; [Albaina, Aitor] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Genet Phys Anthropol & Anim Physiol, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Lehtiniemi, Maiju] Finnish Environm Inst, Ctr Marine Res, Helsinki 00251, Finland",University of Connecticut; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; AZTI; University of Basque Country; Finnish Environment Institute,"Bucklin, A (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA.",ann.bucklin@uconn.edu,"Lindeque, Penelope/AAE-9193-2019; Albaina, Aitor/E-6267-2015; Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara/B-7138-2014; Lehtiniemi, Maiju/AAN-6012-2020","Albaina, Aitor/0000-0003-3353-6090; Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara/0000-0001-6735-6755; Bucklin, Ann/0000-0003-3750-9348; Lindeque, Penelope/0000-0003-1789-7515","International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES); NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research [NA15OAR0110209]; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [NE/L003279/1]; DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing Good Environmental Status) project - European Union (EU) 7th Framework Program [308392]; Basque Government [IT558-10]; BONUS BIO-C3 project; BONUS [Art 185]; EU; Finnish Academy [273660]; UK Natural Environment Research Council; NERC [pml010009, NE/L003279/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Division Of Polar Programs [1044982] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L003279/1, pml010009] Funding Source: researchfish","International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES); NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing Good Environmental Status) project - European Union (EU) 7th Framework Program; Basque Government(Basque Government); BONUS BIO-C3 project; BONUS; EU(European Commission); Finnish Academy(Academy of Finland); UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Division Of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We acknowledge support from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for WGIMT, as well as conferences and symposia related to the Working Group's mission.

Pearson's correlation and multiple regression analyses indicated that eco-geographical variables have significant effects on isoenzyme genetic diversity. Landraces that have desirable agronomical and immunological resistance traits that makes them adaptable to climate change and different eco-geographical conditions are important genetic resources to utilise for the improvement of future crops of modern wheat varieties. There is a need to assess the genetic structure and genetic composition of important agronomical characters and to determine the magnitude of the genetic diversity currently conserved in the germplasm of landraces, both in farm fields and in ex situ collections and finally, strategies for the effective use of landraces, particularly of emmer wheat, should be planned and implemented in Turkey were discussed.","[Ozbek, O.] Hitit Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Art & Sci, Corum, Turkey; [Taskin, B.

Resistance to fatigue, especially thermomechanical fatigue and the associated implications for material selection, lifetime and its assessment, are issues not considered adequately by the power engineering materials community yet. This paper investigates the principal microstructural evolution, damage and failure of two steels in thermomechanical fatigue loading: Ferritic-martensitic grade 91 steel, a state of the art 9 wt % Cr power engineering grade and the 22 wt % Cr, ferritic, stainless Crofer(R)22 H (trade name of VDM Metals GmbH, Germany; under license of Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH) steel. While the ferritic-martensitic grade 91 steel suffers pronounced microstructural instability, the ferritic Crofer(R)22 H provides superior microstructural stability and offers increased fatigue lifetime and more forgiving failure characteristics, because of innovative stabilization by (thermomechanically triggered) precipitation of fine Laves phase particles.

Recent studies have reported that more than three-quarters of the people in India are exposed to pollution levels higher than the limits recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India and significantly higher than those recommended by theWorld Health Organization. Despite the poor air quality, the monitoring of air pollution levels is limited even in large urban areas in India and virtually absent in small towns and rural areas. The lack of data results in a minimal understanding of spatial patterns of air pollutants at local and regional levels. This paper presents particulate air pollution trends monitored over one year in three small cities in India.

Time-lapse seismic investigations commonly use conventional broadband seismic data, considered low to moderate resolution in our context. We have developed the first comprehensive time -lapse analysis of high-resolution seismic data by assessing the repeatability of P-cable 3D seismic data (approximately 30-350 Hz) with short offsets and a high density of receivers. P-cable 3D seismic data sets have for decades been used to investigate shallow fluid flow and gas-hydrate systems. We analyze P-cable high-resolution 4D (HR4D) seismic data from three different geologic settings in the Arctic Circle. The first two are test sites with no evidence of shallow subsurface fluid flow, and the third is an active seepage site. Using these sites, we evaluate the reliability of the P-cable 3D seismic technology as a time-lapse tool and establish a 4D acquisition and processing workflow. Weather, waves, tide, and acquisition-parameters such as residual shot noise are factors affecting seismic repeatability. We achieve reasonable quantitative repeatability measures in stratified marine sediments at two test locations. However, repeatability is limited in areas that have poor penetration of seismic energy through the seafloor, such as glacial moraines or rough surface topography. The 4D anomalies in the active seepage site are spatially restricted to areas of focused fluid flow and might likely indicate changes in fluid flow. This approach can thus be applied to detect migration of fluids in active leakage structures, such as gas chimneys.","[Waage, Malin; Bunz, Stefan; Plaza-Faverola, Andreia; Waghorn, Kate A.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Ctr Arctic Gas Hydrates Environm & Climate, CAGE, Dept Geosci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Landro, Martin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Dept Elect Syst, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Waage, M (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Ctr Arctic Gas Hydrates Environm & Climate, CAGE, Dept Geosci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",malin.waage@uit.no; stefan.bunz@uit.no; martin.landro@ntnu.no; andreia.a.faverola@uit.no; kate.a.waghorn@uit.no,"Waghorn, Kate/AAE-7684-2021; Landro, Martin/I-7118-2013","Waghorn, Kate/0000-0002-6771-7685; Landro, Martin/0000-0003-4556-2667; Bunz, Stefan/0000-0002-9215-7325; Waage, Malin/0000-0002-6924-2273",Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters; Statoil; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [223259]; DECO Geophysical; CGG HampsonRussell; GeoTeric; Schlumberger,Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters; Statoil; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme; DECO Geophysical; CGG HampsonRussell; GeoTeric; Schlumberger(Schlumberger),"The project is funded by VISTA - a basic research program in collaboration between the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and Statoil.

Because of sampling errors caused by a finite ensemble and the errors related to model biases associated with the physical parameterizations, dynamic core, model resolution, and so on, a state-of-the-art inflation method is commonly used in the standard EnKF to increase the prior variance so as to avoid filter divergence. However, the optimal inflation factor is almost prohibitive in reality because of vast computational cost. An adaptive EnKF and multigrid analysis hybrid approach without inflation is presented to compensate for the abovementioned limitations of the standard EnKF. In this study, the adaptive approach is applied to an intermediate coupled model for ENSO prediction. Gridded observations of daily-mean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) during January 1982-December 2012 are assimilated into the model to initialize a 2-yr ENSO hindcast. Results show that compared to the standard EnKF that uses multiplicative variance inflation, the adaptive method can reduce analysis errors by 63% for both the daily SST anomaly and the Nino-112 SST anomaly. The prediction skill of Nino-112 SST anomaly is consistently enhanced, especially for phase forecast. For SST anomaly forecasting, the advantage of the adaptive method mainly occurs in the eastern equatorial Pacific and the northern boundary of the intermediate coupled model.","[Wu, Xinrong] Natl Marine Data & Informat Serv, SOA, Key Lab Marine Environm Informat Technol, Tianjin, Peoples R China",National Marine Data & Information Service; State Oceanic Administration,"Wu, XR (corresponding author), 93 Liuwei Rd, Tianjin 300171, Peoples R China.",xinrong_wu@yahoo.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation [41306006, 41376015, 41376013, 41541041, 41506039]; National Basic Research Program [2013CB430304]; National High-Tech RD Program [2013AA09A505]; Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction of China [GASI-IPOVAI-04]",National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program(National Basic Research Program of China); National High-Tech RD Program(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction of China,"This research is sponsored by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation (41306006, 41376015, 41376013, 41541041, and 41506039), the National Basic Research Program (2013CB430304), the National High-Tech R&D Program (2013AA09A505), and the Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction (GASI-IPOVAI-04) of China.",,46,5,5,0,13,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

The particular environment of stony desert, the flat surface and the contrast between the dark-brown flint stones and the white yellowish limestone provide the optimal conditions for pebble drawing. Climate fluctuations in the area allowed life during a long pluvial period between 70,000 and 28,000 years BP, which corresponded to an intense frequentation of the site during the Middle and early Upper Paleolithic. Interestingly, the finding of a Paleolithic 'Sanctuary' dating back to 40,000 years BP and a kind of proto-art related to it witness the early start of expression of conceptual ideas and the capability to create symbols of spirituality during the very early Upper Paleolithic period. A second, shorter pluvial period started around 10,000 BP and lasted until the end of 4,000 BP. In correspondence with this humid period, an agriculture economy started to flourish in the area all around Har Karkom and remains of hundreds of villages reveal the improved climatic conditions, mostly during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages. During the fourth and third millennia BCE, the Har Karkom mountain became an enormous, unique worship place. At that period, only rock art, funerary sites and worshipping activities are seen on top of the mountain. The role of a funerary site continued during the Roman and Islamic times and the villages were placed on the terraces along the wadis. As a result, Har Karkom plateau was never settled, which contributed to preserving the ancient sites, and erosive phenomena have revealed to us the ancient remains on the plateau surface. Geoglyphs at Har Karkom were made by various techniques, either by putting stones in alignments, or by clearing the brown stones from the ground surface, thus allowing the brilliant, clear loess appear. At least 25 sites have been found on the plateau, an area of 8 sq. km, representing animals, rarely humans, geometric figures or imaginary, figures. Some of them are very large, even 30 in or 60 in long, and were performed by completing with stone alignments some natural limestone outcrops which suggested particular shapes. Interestingly, large mammals are represented, including a rhinoceros, two elephants and maybe a phacocerus. A figure of an elephant was later disturbed by a cyst grave during the Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age. Another figure, interpreted as a hippopotamus, was disturbed by a later figure of an ostrich, made by a different technique. There is no way to date the geoglyphs, but relative dating may be proposed for some of them. In fact, large mammals such as those represented on the top of Har Karkom lived in the area during the Pleistocene, and were extinct before 28,000 BP. Thus, at least some of the geoglyphs of Har Karkom date back to the Paleolithic period, which makes them the oldest pebble drawings known so far. Geoglyphs may be interpreted as a less durable form of figurative art than painting and sculpture, and this finding is not surprising. The discovery of Paleolithic geoglyphs on Har Karkom plateau suggests a number of questions: why the early humans represented their figures by pebble drawing, and what is the message left by the ancestors to modern people? The geoglyphs on Har Karkom plateau are witness to the early start of expression of conceptual ideas during early Upper Paleolithic",,,,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,ARCHAEOPRESS,OXFORD,"GORDON HOUSE, 276 BANBURY ROAD, OXFORD, OX2 7ED, ENGLAND",0143-3067,,978-1-4073-0947-7,BAR INT SER,,,2012,,,,,29,36,,,,,,8,Archaeology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Archaeology,BBN45,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000307489600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, a lithium-bromine rechargeable fuel cell using highly concentrated bromine catholytes is demonstrated with comparable specific energy, improved power density, and higher efficiency. The cell is similar in structure to a hybrid-electrolyte Li-air battery, where a lithium metal anode in nonaqueous electrolyte is separated from aqueous bromine catholytes by a lithium-ion conducting ceramic plate. The cell with a flat graphite electrode can discharge at a peak power density around 9 mW cm(-2) and in principle could provide a specific energy of 791.8 Wh kg(-1), superior to most existing cathode materials and catholytes. It can also run in the regenerative mode to recover the lithium metal anode and free bromine with 80-90% voltage efficiency, without any catalysts. Degradation of the solid electrolyte and the evaporation of bromine during deep charging are challenges that should be addressed in improved designs to fully exploit the high specific energy of the liquid bromine. The proposed system offers a potential power source for long-range electric vehicles, beyond current Li-ion batteries yet close to envisioned Li-air batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Krcma, E",,,,"Krcma, Ed",,,Wols and Smallness,OXFORD ART JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper examines the work of the German-born artist Wols in relation to questions of scale. It focuses upon the very small, intricate drawings that Wols made in the mid-1940s, but also bears upon his close-up photographs of kitchen detritus from the late 1930s, as well as his poems and aphorisms. Situating Wols within the artistic and intellectual climate of post-war France (and with particular reference to the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre and Gaston Bachelard), I explore how the teeming detail of his drawings, by encouraging very close looking into unfamiliar pictorial worlds, induces a sense of proximity and exposure. This, together with Wols' obsessive, agitated facture, can usefully be analysed in terms of what Eric Santner has called 'creaturely life'. In this respect, Wols' work aligns not with the gestural abstraction of the New York School, but rather with the mescaline drawings of Henri Michaux and the microscripts of Robert Walser, for example. Furthermore, I argue that the dramatization of the human rendered 'creaturely' not only has a particular purchase on the conditions of life in France in the 1940s, but also on the fate of the artwork set adrift from the form of life from which it emerged.","Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Krcma, E (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland.",,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6540,1741-7287,,OXFORD ART J,Oxf.

In the heterostructure, separate phases of Co(9)S(8)and MoS(2)are formed, but they are connected by Co-S-Mo type covalent bonds. The charge redistribution from Co to Mo occurring at the interface enhances the electron-doped characteristics of MoS(2)to generate electron-rich Mo atoms. Besides, reductive annealing during the synthesis forms S defects that activates adjacent Mo atoms for further enhanced HER activity as elucidated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Eventually, the covalent Co9S8-MoS(2)heterostructure shows amplified HER activity as well as stability in all pH electrolytes. The synergistic effect is pronounced when the heterostructure is coupled with a porous Ni foam (NF) support to form Co9S8-MoS2/NF that displays superior performance to those of the state-of-the-art non-noble metal electrocatalysts, and even outperforms a commercial Pt/C catalyst in a practically meaningful, high current density region in alkaline (>170 mA cm(-2)) and neutral (>60 mA cm(-2)) media. The high HER performance and stability of Co9S8-MoS(2)heterostructure make it a promising pH universal alternative to expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts for practical water electrolyzers.","[Kim, Minkyung; Lee, Jae Sung] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Dept Energy Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza] Pakistan Inst Nucl Sci & Technol PINSTECH, Directorate Sci, Chem Div, Islamabad 45650, Pakistan; [Choi, Min] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Chem, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Jeong, Hu Young] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, UNIST Cent Res Facil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Choi, Sun Hee] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Pohang Accelerator Lab PAL, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Park, Noejung] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Phys, Ulsan 44919, South Korea",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Lee, JS (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Dept Energy Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.;Choi, SH (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Pohang Accelerator Lab PAL, Pohang 37673, South Korea.;Park, N (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol UNIST, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Phys, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",shchoi@postech.ac.kr; noejung@unist.ac.kr; jlee1234@unist.ac.kr,"Park, Noejung/G-2017-2011; Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza/N-5398-2016; Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza/N-6441-2015","Park, Noejung/0000-0002-2359-0635; Anjum, Mohsin Ali Raza/0000-0002-6995-6428; Lee, Jae Sung/0000-0001-6432-9073","Climate Change Response project - MSIT [NRF-2015M1A2A2074663, NRF-2019M1A2A2065612]; Korea-China Key Joint Research Program - MSIT [2017K2A9A2A11070341]; MOTIE of Republic of Korea [10050509, KIAT N0001754]; Basic Science Grant - MSIT [NRF-2018R1A2A1A05077909]","Climate Change Response project - MSIT; Korea-China Key Joint Research Program - MSIT(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); MOTIE of Republic of Korea(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea); Basic Science Grant - MSIT","This work was supported by the Climate Change Response project (NRF-2015M1A2A2074663 and NRF-2019M1A2A2065612), the Basic Science Grant (NRF-2018R1A2A1A05077909), and Korea-China Key Joint Research Program (2017K2A9A2A11070341) funded by MSIT, and Project No. 10050509 and KIAT N0001754 funded by MOTIE of Republic of Korea.",,61,65,67,37,286,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1616-301X,1616-3028,,ADV FUNCT MATER,Adv.

However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure. We verify theoretical compatibility through a meta-analysis of a state-of-the-art bibliographic database on energy policy, narratives and computational social science. Furthermore, we establish a proof-of-concept using a narrative-based case study on energy externalities in slum rehabilitation housing in Mumbai, India. We find that the nested application contributes to the literature gap on the need for multidisciplinary methodologies that can systematically include qualitative evidence into policymaking.","[Debnath, Ramit; Bardhan, Ronita; Sunikka-Blank, Minna] Univ Cambridge, Martin Ctr Architectural & Urban Studies, Dept Architecture, Behav & Bldg Performance Grp, Cambridge CB2 1PX, England; [Debnath, Ramit; Mohaddes, Kamiar] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Darby, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Energy Program, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Mohaddes, Kamiar] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Oxford; University of Cambridge,"Debnath, R (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Martin Ctr Architectural & Urban Studies, Dept Architecture, Behav & Bldg Performance Grp, Cambridge CB2 1PX, England.",rd545@cam.ac.uk,"Bardhan, Ronita/Q-7316-2019","Bardhan, Ronita/0000-0001-5336-4084",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1144],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the grant number [OPP1144].,,74,11,11,5,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

We develop and test a general method for probabilistic forecasting and PU estimation that is based on a theoretical and practical analysis of the actual nature of the model residuals, which reveals that the residual mean, standard deviation, and distributional form can all vary with time. Our approach is to condition the nature of the residual distribution on the magnitude of the corresponding streamflow value, but other kinds of conditioning are also possible. Using real data, we illustrate seven progressively more realistic sets of assumptions regarding the model residuals, ranging from homogenous Gaussian to fully heterogeneous non-Gaussian. Our results show that the estimated probabilistic predictions become progressively better as the assumptions better conform to the actual properties of the residuals. As benchmarks, we compare against results from the state-of-the-art power transformation approach. Our method is generally applicable to any situation where a deterministic model is used to generate predictions, and where empirical probabilistic predictions are required without developing a stochastic version of that model.","[Jiang, Xiaolei; Liang, Zhongmin; Li, Binquan] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Gupta, Hoshin, V] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Hohai University; University of Arizona,"Liang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Gupta, HV (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",hoshin@email.arizona.edu; zmliang@hhu.edu.cn,"Gupta, Hoshin V/D-1642-2010; Gupta, Hoshin V/CAG-5323-2022","Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839; Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839; Liang, zhongmin/0000-0002-1079-1075",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402709]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41730750]; Australian Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science,"Data used in this study are available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335174779_Data_for_ Towards_Improved_Probabilistic_ Predictions_for_Flood_Forecasts_ Generated_using_Deterministic_ Models.

This paper attempts to study the interaction of urban heating and the local topographic-induced flow circulation for a tropical coastal city, Greater Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia. The role of sea-and-valley-breeze-orientated synoptic flow (SBOS) on the interaction is determined by comparing two intermonsoon periods. A state-of-the-art numerical model, Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model, is used to identify the influence of urbanization through modification of urban surfaces. The model reasonably reproduces the vertical sounding data and near-surface weather parameters. The diurnal urban heating pattern is attributed to three predominant factors: (i) weak under calm and clear-sky condition (morning heating), (ii) weak under larger atmospheric moisture content (late afternoon convection), and (iii) largest (1.4 degrees C) due to differential cooling rate of urban and rural surface at night. The interaction of urban thermals and upper level SBOS affects the effect of urbanization on local circulation during the day. The urban thermals reduce the weak opposing SBOS (< 2 ms(-1)) and enhance the inflow of moisture-rich sea breeze passage. This increases the intensity of downwind convective precipitation during late afternoon. On contrary, the strong opposing SBOS (> 2 ms(-1)) suppresses the vertical lifting of urban thermals and decelerates the sea breeze front. It is discovered that the interaction of urban heating and topographic-induced flow is interdependent while the synoptic flow plays a critical role in modifying both factors, respectively.","[Ooi, M.

Tambora in 1815 was the largest volcanic eruption of the past 500 years. The eruption had significant climatic impacts, leading to the 1816 year without a summer, and remains a valuable event from which to understand the climatic effects of large stratospheric volcanic sulfur dioxide injections. The eruption also resulted in one of the strongest and most easily identifiable volcanic sulfate signals in polar ice cores, which are widely used to reconstruct the timing and atmospheric sulfate loading of past eruptions. As part of the Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP), five state-of-the-art global aerosol models simulated this eruption. We analyse both simulated background (no Tambora) and volcanic (with Tambora) sulfate deposition to polar regions and compare to ice core records. The models simulate overall similar patterns of background sulfate deposition, although there are differences in regional details and magnitude. However, the volcanic sulfate deposition varies considerably between the models with differences in timing, spatial pattern and magnitude. Mean simulated deposited sulfate on Antarctica ranges from 19 to 264 kg km(-2) and on Greenland from 31 to 194 kg km(-2), as compared to the mean ice-core-derived estimates of roughly 50 kg km(-2) for both Greenland and Antarctica. The ratio of the hemispheric atmospheric sulfate aerosol burden after the eruption to the average ice sheet deposited sulfate varies between models by up to a factor of 15. Sources of this inter-model variability include differences in both the formation and the transport of sulfate aerosol. Our results suggest that deriving relationships between sulfate deposited on ice sheets and atmospheric sulfate burdens from model simulations may be associated with greater uncertainties than previously thought.","[Marshall, Lauren; Schmidt, Anja; Carslaw, Ken S.; Mann, Graham W.; Dhomse, Sandip] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Toohey, Matthew] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Toohey, Matthew; Timmreck, Claudia; Niemeier, Ulrike] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Mann, Graham W.] Univ Leeds, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Sigl, Michael] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Environm Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Khodri, Myriam; Poulain, Virginie] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC, UMR CNRS IRD MNHN, Lab Oceanog Climat Experimentat & Approches Numer, F-75005 Paris, France; [Zanchettin, Davide] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Ball, William T.; Rozanov, Eugene; Stenke, Andrea; Tummon, Fiona] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ball, William T.; Rozanov, Eugene; Sukhodolov, Timofei] PMO DWRC, Davos, Switzerland; [Bekki, Slimane] UVSQ Paris Saclay, UPMC Paris Sorbonne, CNRS INSU, LATMOS IPSL, Paris, France; [Brooke, James S.

Here, we consider the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to portray a range of plausible futures for the region's forests, employing a state-of-the-art land change modelling procedure and remotely sensed data. We find that by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, SSP 3 (regional rivalry/a rocky road), the region's forests would shrink by 5.2 million ha. The region's aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) would decrease by 790 Tg C, 21% of which would be due to old-growth forest loss. Conversely, under the best-case scenario, SSP 1 (sustainability/taking the green road), the region is projected to gain 19.6 million ha of forests and 1651 Tg C of AFCS. The choice of the pathway is thus critical for the future of the region's forests and their ecosystem functions and services.","[Estoque, Ronald C.; Ooba, Makoto; Hijioka, Yasuaki; Togawa, Takuya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Avitabile, Valerio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [DasGupta, Rajarshi] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Murayama, Yuji] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Tsukuba,"Estoque, RC (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",estoque.ronaldcanero@nies.go.jp,"DasGupta, Rajarshi/AAX-2695-2021; Dasgupta, Rajarshi/AAF-7822-2021; Estoque, Ronald C./Q-3769-2016; Murayama, Yuji/B-3161-2014; Hijioka, Yasuaki/AAQ-7586-2020; Murayama, Yuji/V-3578-2019","DasGupta, Rajarshi/0000-0003-0051-5090; Estoque, Ronald C./0000-0001-9681-492X; Murayama, Yuji/0000-0003-4397-6882; Murayama, Yuji/0000-0003-4397-6882","Ministry of Environment, Japan [S2-1708]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [18H00763]; Climate Change Adaptation Program of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan","Ministry of Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Climate Change Adaptation Program of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan","This work was supported by the Ministry of Environment, Japan, through Research Grant S2-1708, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), through Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) 18H00763.

However, at 'La Sentinella' (Serra Scoris Hill), they are composed of Girvanella, Razumovskia, Botomaella and Renalcis, with Epiphyton and archaeocyaths as accessory components. This association forms two unusual types of crust boundstone, consisting of stacked flat or curved crusts and saucer-like archaeocyaths delimiting shelter cavities. Dendrolitic Renalcis archaeocyath-cement boundstone caps the bioherm. Analysis of the La Sentinella reef complex and comparison with similar constructions from Mongolia (Zuune Arts, Salaany Gol), Nevada (Stewart's Mill, Battle Mountain), Mexico (Sonora) and China (Tianheban Formation) suggest that episodic deposition of tine-grained siliciclastic or carbonate sediment followed by periods of non-deposition enabled the calcimicrobial rafts and crusts to colonize the substrate and then provide synoptic relief for the development of a dendrolitic Renalcis-cement framework. 'La Sentinella' is one of the rare examples of Cambrian reef complex displaying community replacement, from an initial stage of thrombolitic and/or flat-stacked microbial crusts on a muddy substrate to an arched microbial crust system, to a more resistant Renalcis-cement boundstone. Such bioherms reflect an open-shelf, shallow-marine environment of increasing energy.","[Gandin, Anna] Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Debrenne, Francoise] CNRS, UMR 5143, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Gandin, A (corresponding author), Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",gandin@unisi.it; debrenne@club-internet.fr,,,,,,,26,10,11,0,6,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBLISHING HOUSE,BATH,"UNIT 7, BRASSMILL ENTERPRISE CTR, BRASSMILL LANE, BATH BA1 3JN, AVON, ENGLAND",0305-8719,,978-1-86239-221-2,GEOL SOC SPEC PUBL,Geol.

This study examines the effects of Paraloid B-72 and Butvar B-98, two common consolidants used in field and museum conservation, on C-13, N-15, and O-18 values from bone collagen and hydroxyapatite. The effects of solvent removal (100% acetone, 100% ethanol, 9:1 acetone:xylenes, 9:1 ethanol:xylenes) and drying methods (ambient air, vacuum, oven drying at 80 degrees C) were also examined to determine if bones treated with these consolidants can successfully be cleaned and used for stable isotope analyses. Results show that introduction of Paraloid B-72 or Butvar B-98 in 100% acetone or 100% ethanol, respectively, with subsequent removal by the same solvents and drying at 80 degrees C facilitates the most successful removal of consolidants and solvents. The C-13 values in collagen, N-15 in collagen, O-18 in hydroxyapatite phosphate, and C-13 in hydroxyapatite structural carbonate were unaltered by treatments with Paraloid or Butvar and subsequent solvent removal. The O-18 in hydroxyapatite structural carbonate showed nonsystematic variability when bones were treated with Paraloid and Butvar, which is hypothesized to be a result of hydroxyl exchange when bones are exposed to consolidants in solution. It is therefore recommended that O-18 in hydroxyapatite structural carbonate should not be used in stable isotope studies if bones have been treated with Paraloid or Butvar.

Changes in drought characteristics (e.g. frequency, duration, intensity, severity, and spatial extent) were detected for six distinct climatic regions delineated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results suggest a statistically significant increase in the frequency and severity of drought during the past four decades. Nonetheless, drought exhibited pronounced decadal variability, with more frequent and severe droughts occurring after 1997/1998. Also, results demonstrate that the areas influenced by extreme and very extreme droughts witnessed a statistically significant increase on the order of 0.13% and 0.18%/decade, respectively, compared to - 0.06%/decade for the areas impacted by mild droughts. Spatially, there has been a prevalent drying trend in central and eastern regions of Oman, while a tendency towards wetter conditions was observed in northern Oman (especially in the Batinah plain). This study also investigates the time-varying dependency between climatic drivers of drought and large-scale circulation patterns using the cumulative annual mean (CAM) method. Results indicate an acceleration of drying after 1997/ 1998, mainly due to the warming sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Atlantic Ocean in recent decades and also the shift of the Pacific Ocean circulation patterns (e.g. PDO and El Nino) from the positive to the negative mode at the end of the 1990s. These configurations are favorable for significant changes in the thermodynamic drivers of drought (i.e. air temperature and relative humidity), but have less influence on aerodynamic drivers (i.e. wind speed). The significant temperature rise in recent decades, combined with a significant decline of rainfall and relative humidity, can explain the prolonged drought episode lasting from 1998 to 2014. A comprehensive assessment of drought variability in a poorly-studied water-stressed region like Oman is of particular concern for stakeholders and policy-makers. This study provides meaningful conclusions and a basis for water resources management, agricultural and energy production, ecological protection, and contribute to more reliable drought mitigation strategies at the regional and national scales.","[El Kenawy, Ahmed M.; Al Buloshi, Ali; Al-Awadhi, Talal; Al Nasiri, Noura; Alhatrushi, Salim] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Geog, Muscat, Oman; [El Kenawy, Ahmed M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Navarro-Serrano, Francisco; Lopez-Moreno, Juan I.; Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.] Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Campus Aula Dei,Avda Montanana, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Robaa, S.

The highest point of this mountainous mass is the Karatas hill. The purpose of this study is to determine the geomorphological and ecological origins of air quality on and around Mount Ida. To that end, parameters such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity, and geomorphological features such as inclination, elevation, and aspect, and other ecological conditions were determined. Then, these data were linked together and evaluated in terms of their effects on air quality. Mount Ida is a landform consisting of parts that rise in small distances starting from the sea. This landform is split by narrow and deep valleys. These valleys function as a corridor used by air currents because of temperature differences between day and night. Thus, due to the influence of parameters such as orographic features, geographical location, climate, flora and density, and geomorphological features, a strong and constant air circulation occurs on and around Mount Ida. Air circulation in the fieldwork area continually cleans the air, and the lack of industrial facilities contributes to air quality. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The original sequential version of the code was parallelized in order to reduce the execution time of high-resolution configurations using state-of-the-art high-performance computing (HPC) systems. A distributed memory approach was used, based on the MPI. Optimized numerical libraries were used to partition the unstructured grid (with a focus on load balancing) and to solve the sparse linear system of equations in parallel in the case of semi-to-fully implicit time stepping. The parallel implementation of the model was validated by comparing the outputs with those obtained from the sequential version. The performance assessment demonstrates a good level of scalability with a realistic configuration used as benchmark.","[Micaletto, Giorgio; Barletta, Ivano; Mocavero, Silvia; Federico, Ivan; Epicoco, Italo; Verri, Giorgia; Coppini, Giovanni; Schiano, Pasquale; Aloisio, Giovanni] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change Fdn, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Epicoco, Italo; Aloisio, Giovanni] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Barletta, Ivano; Pinardi, Nadia] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Salento; University of Bologna,"Epicoco, I (corresponding author), Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change Fdn, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.;Epicoco, I (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",italo.epicoco@unisalento.it,"; Pinardi, Nadia/M-2364-2015","Epicoco, Italo/0000-0002-6408-1335; Barletta, Ivano/0000-0003-2472-1358; Pinardi, Nadia/0000-0003-4765-0775",,,,,64,0,0,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Simulations at the continental level,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; TEMPERATE; SOILS,"[1] We apply a simulation model in order to quantify the patterns of carbon and nitrogen cycling within European grasslands. We map the fluxes of CO(2), N(2)O and CH(4) exchanged with the atmosphere as controlled by climate and management conditions. We distinguish between grazing and cutting practice. Because geo-referenced management information for grasslands does not exist at the scale of Europe, we develop a new and robust set of rules defining some management variables. We then perform realistic simulations in term of N fertilization using a national level data set. The model results at European scale are compared with agricultural statistics (yield, animal stocks), which shows that our very simple management calculation is reasonably realistic. We also compare the simulated seasonal cycle of grassland phenology as calculated by PASIM with remote sensing observations from the EOS-TERRA-MODIS satellite, which shows a good general agreement. Emission factors for soil N(2)O and grazing animals CH(4) emissions are diagnosed from the model runs and shown to be comparable to those of previous experimental surveys. We investigate impact of N fertilization on NPP and C storage potential, N(2)O emissions by soils and CH(4) emissions by ruminants. We conclude that, for different time horizon, CH(4) and N(2)O sources are lower than the potential sink of CO(2), on a carbon equivalent basis. This result is independent of fertilization intensity but assumes that the current soil C stocks are below the long-term equilibrium values.","CEA, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon, Res Stn ART Air Pollut & Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; INRA, UR874 Grassland Ecosyst Res, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; INRAE,"Vuichard, N (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Sci & Environm, Via Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",vuichard@unitus.it,"Soussana, Jean-Francois/P-2094-2016; Soussana, Jean-Francois/E-2543-2012; Viovy, Nicolas/S-2631-2018; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Vuichard, Nicolas/A-6629-2011; Soussana, Jean-Francois/M-2814-2017","Soussana, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1932-6583; Viovy, Nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Vuichard, Nicolas/0000-0002-3397-7948",,,,,27,38,38,0,26,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

Sentinel species included are common eider, white-tailed eagle, harbour porpoise, harbour seal, ringed seal and grey seal. The review represents the first attempt of summarizing available information and baseline data for these bio-monitoring key species exposed to industrial hazardous substances focusing on anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants (POPs). There was only limited information available for white-tailed eagles and common eider while extensive information exist on POP exposure and health effects in the four marine mammal species. Here we report organ-tissue endpoints (pathologies) and multiple biomarkers used to evaluate health and exposure of key species to POPs, respectively, over the past several decades during which episodes of significant population declines have been reported. Our review shows that POP exposure affects the reproductive system and survival through immune suppression and endocrine disruption, which have led to population-level effects on seals and white-tailed eagles in the Baltic. It is notable that many legacy contaminants, which have been banned for decades, still appear to affect Baltic wildlife. With respect to common eiders, changes in food composition, quality and contaminant exposure seem to have population effects which need to be investigated further, especially during the incubation period where the birds fast. Since new industrial contaminants continuously leak into the environment, we recommend continued monitoring of them in sentinel species in the Baltic, identifying possible effects linked to climate change, and modelling of population level effects of contaminants and climate change.","[Sonne, Christian; Desforges, Jean-Pierre; Eulaers, Igor; Galatius, Anders; Dietz, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci, Arct Res Ctr ARC, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Sonne, Christian; Lam, Su Shiung; Peng, Wanxi] Henan Agr Univ, Sch Forestry, Henan Prov Engn Res Ctr Biomass Value Added Prod, CN-450002 Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Siebert, Ursula; Gonnsen, Katharina; Gross, Stephanie; Lakemeyer, Jan; Lehnert, Kristina] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Busum, Germany; Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Environm Res & Monitoring, Frescativagen 40, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Persson, Sara; Roos, Anna; Backlin, Britt-Marie] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Luke Itainen Pitkakatu 4, FI-20520 Turku, Finland; [Kauhala, Kaarina] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Gen, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Olsen, Morten Tange] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Box 463, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Harding, Karin C.] German Environm Agcy, Sect Chem, Worlitzer Pl 1, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany; [Treu, Gabriele] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Dyrlaegevej 16, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Andersen-Ranberg, Emilie] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Aquaculture & Fisheries Akuatrop, Pyrolysis Technol Res Grp, MY-21030 Terengganu, Malaysia; [Lam, Su Shiung] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Biodivers & Sustainable Dev BioD Trop, MY-21030 Terengganu, Malaysia","Aarhus University; Henan Agricultural University; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation; Swedish Museum of Natural History; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Copenhagen; University of Gothenburg; University of Copenhagen; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu","Sonne, C (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci, Arct Res Ctr ARC, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",cs@bios.au.dk; Ursula.siebert@tiho-hannover.de; Katharina.Gonnsen@tiho-hannover.de; jpd@bios.au.dk; ie@bios.au.dk; sara.persson@nrm.se; anna.roos@nrm.se; britt-marie.backlin@nrm.se; kaarina.kauhala@luke.fi; morten.olsen@bio.ku.dk; karin.harding@bioenv.gu.se; Gabriele.Treu@uba.de; agj@bios.au.dk; emilie.ranberg@sund.ku.dk; Stephanie.gross@tiho-hannover.de; Jan.Helge.Carl.Lakemeyer@tiho-hannover.de; Kristina.Lehnert@tiho-hannover.de; lam@umt.edu.my; rdi@bios.au.dk,"Lam, Su Shiung/K-7436-2012; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/B-9217-2016; Sonne, Christian/I-7532-2013; Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; Galatius, Anders/AGG-7831-2022; Olsen, Morten Tange/J-4783-2013","Lam, Su Shiung/0000-0002-5318-1760; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/0000-0002-6816-7697; Sonne, Christian/0000-0001-5723-5263; Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; Harding, Karin/0000-0003-1527-0903; Olsen, Morten Tange/0000-0001-6716-6345; Gross, Stephanie/0000-0002-7734-1466","BONUS - EU [6180-00001B, 6180-00002B]; BONUS - Innovation Fund Denmark [6180-00001B, 6180-00002B]; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03F0767A]; Academy of Finland [311966]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); Henan Agricultural University; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu under Golden Goose Research Grant Scheme (GGRG) [Vot 55191]",BONUS - EU; BONUS - Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); Henan Agricultural University; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu under Golden Goose Research Grant Scheme (GGRG),"BONUS BALTHEALTH has received funding from BONUS (Art. 185), funded jointly by the EU, Innovation Fund Denmark (grants 6180-00001B and 6180-00002B), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant FKZ 03F0767A), Academy of Finland (grant 311966) and Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA).

In addition to their historical interest, cultural heritage buildings and landscapes are valuable because they contribute significantly to the economy by providing key attractions at a time when tourism and leisure are major industries. Herein, the great Iranian tradition is as yet little known in the West and there is much to be learnt both from it and the building techniques which are integral with it. Meanwhile, not only is the Iranian vernacular building tradition itself still alive, but there is much to be gained from the knowledge of a highly developed technology which makes such ingenious use of natural resources without the consumption of additional power. This article is a study of the artisanship involved in the construction of the mud brick vernacular architecture of Iran, and the cultural aspects of a traditional architecture that incorporates an understanding of buildings that date back centuries. Expanding the existing knowledge of these earthen heritage properties, examining their behaviour in the local climate and explaining their current condition in order to express the need for the preservation of traditional artisanship as part of a sustainable conservation future are the other prominent concerns of this work. Among different Iranian Vernacular constructions, Ice-houses, cisterns, water-mills and wind-catchers are the subject of the main body of this article.","[Okhovat, Hanie] Univ Tarbiat Modares, Fac Art, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Okhovat, H (corresponding author), Univ Tarbiat Modares, Fac Art, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",h.okhovat@yahoo.com,"Okhovat, Hanie/ABH-2348-2021","Okhovat, Hanie/0000-0002-9534-1339",,,,,29,4,4,0,3,UNIV POLITECNICA CATALUNYA,BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 649, BARCELONA, 08028, SPAIN",1886-4805,,,ACE-ARCHIT CITY ENVI,ACE-Archit.

J,"Mancilla, A",,,,"Mancilla, Alejandra",,,From Sovereignty to Guardianship in Ecoregions,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,ANTARCTICA,"Recent scientific studies suggest that the destabilisation of the earth's climate and biodiversity loss are not separate, but interdependent phenomena. In this context, some have proposed the creation of a 'Global Safety Net' of ecoregions that should be preserved to stop further biodiversity loss, preventing at the same time the growth of CO2 emissions produced by deforestation and allowing natural carbon removal. In this article, I suggest that a first step to achieve this might be to replace permanent sovereignty over natural resources in these areas with permanent guardianship. I propose to take some inspiration from a model that has already been implemented over an entire continent with a fair degree of success. In 1959, the Antarctic Treaty froze the sovereign claims of seven countries over Antarctica. However, these countries plus 47 others today have been remarkably successful at jointly preserving the continent for peace, science, and the protection of the environment, especially since the signature of the Environmental Protocol in 1991. After outlining some principles that could give form to a Global Environmental Protocol for Ecoregions, I address a series of objections and offer some concluding remarks.","[Mancilla, Alejandra] Univ Oslo, Fac Humanities, Inst Philosophy Class Hist Art & Ideas, Blindernveien 31, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Mancilla, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Fac Humanities, Inst Philosophy Class Hist Art & Ideas, Blindernveien 31, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",alejandra.mancilla@ifikk.uio.no,,,Polar Programme of the Research Council of Norway [14446]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [948964],Polar Programme of the Research Council of Norway; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the Polar Programme of the Research Council of Norway (grant no. 14446), and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant no. 948964).

TES is also important in view of the increasing utilisation of solar energy. Although sensible heat storage systems and latent heat storage systems have been heavily researched and are widely used domestically and industrially, thermochemical heat storage (THS) systems are currently undergoing,a surge in research and development. Recent studies suggest that THS has significant advantages when compared with the other heat storage methods including higher storage density, lower volume requirements, low heat loss (approaching zero), and lower charging temperature. On the other hand the complexity and higher investment costs remain the main obstacles to rolling out these systems commercially. A comprehensive review has been presented here into all aspects of the current, state of the art THS research. It includes comparisons with other storage methods, description of absorption/adsorption cycles, the materials used in these systems and open/closed storage methods, as well as chemical heat pumps. Recent advances in the field are also investigated and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we use a state-of-the-art AR tracking database, and reanalysis and observational datasets to investigate the climatology (1979-2017) and influences of these ARs in snowmelt season (March-April). The Red Sea and northeast Africa are found to be the major source regions of these ARs, which are typically associated with the eastern Mediterranean trough positioned over the Balkan Peninsula and a blocking anticyclone over the NE-Caspian region, triggering southwesterly air flow toward the NE's highlands. Approximately 8% of the ARs are relatively strong (integrated water vapor transport >similar to 275 kg m(-1) s(-1)). AR days exhibit enhanced precipitation over the crescent-shaped orography of the NE region. Mean AR days indicate wetter (up to + 2 mm day(-1)) and warmer (up to + 1.5 degrees C) conditions than all-day climatology. On AR days, while snowpack tends to decrease (up to 30%) in the Zagros Mountains, it can show decreases or increases in the Taurus Mountains depending largely on elevation. A further analysis with the observations and reanalysis indicates that extreme ARs coinciding with large scale sensible heat transport can significantly increase the daily discharges. These results suggest that ARs can have notable impacts on the hydrometeorology and water resources of the region, particularly of lowland Mesopotamia, a region that is famous with great floods in the ancient narratives.","[Bozkurt, D.] Univ Valparaiso, Dept Meteorol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bozkurt, D.] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Santiago, Chile; [Sen, O.

Here we assess the multimodel predictive skill over Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and midlatitudes using four state-of-the-art forecast systems. Our main goal was to quantify the impact of the Arctic sea ice state during November on the sea level pressure (SLP), surface temperature, and precipitation skill during the following winter. Interannual variability of the November Barents and Kara Sea ice is associated with an important fraction of December to February (DJF) prediction skill in regions of Eurasia. We further show that skill related to sea ice in these regions is accompanied with enhanced skill of DJF SLP in western Russia, established by a sea ice-atmosphere teleconnection mechanism. The teleconnection is strongest when atmospheric blocking conditions in Scandinavia/western Russia in November reduce a systematic SLP bias that is present in all systems.","[Acosta Navarro, J.

We precisely characterize the geomagnetic reversal and perform global chemistry-climate modeling and detailed radiocarbon dating of paleoenvironmental records to investigate impacts.

A physical-mathematical model is developed to simulate the dynamic thermal behaviour of the system, and numerical simulations are carried out for different climates (Venice, Helsinki and Abu Dhabi) in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution. The numerical model combines different validated codes for the simulation of optical, thermal, and electrical behaviour of PCM, PV and DSF. The model is then coupled with the indoor air heat balance equation to evaluate the impact of the proposed facade system on the heating and cooling energy demand. The adoption of a PCM layer in the DSF cavity, in combination with a semi-transparent PV layer, leads to a reduction in the monthly cooling energy demand in the 20-30% range. This result is particularly relevant for hot climates - where cooling loads are seen throughout the year. The improvement in terms of heating load in more cold-dominated locations is limited. The smoothing of the PV module temperature leads to an increase in the electrical energy converted by the PV, with peak values of improvement in the range of 5-8% when the DSF is equipped with the PCM-PV configuration. Ventilation strategies of the facade cavity, coupled with the correct selection of PCM (and of its transition-phase temperature range), are the key aspects to ensure effective management of the proposed technology.

The instrument operates in the frequency range of similar to 10-240 MHz and is used for a variety of astrophysical science cases. While it is not heliophysics or space weather dedicated, a new project entitled LOFAR for Space Weather (LOFAR4SW) aims at designing a system upgrade to allow the entire array to observe the Sun, heliosphere, Earth's ionosphere, and Jupiter throughout its observing window. This will allow the instrument to operate as a space weather observing platform, facilitating both space weather science and operations. Part of this design study aims to survey the existing space weather infrastructure operating at radio frequencies and show how LOFAR4SW can advance the current state-of-the-art in this field. In this paper, we survey radio instrumentation and facilities that currently operate in space weather science and/or operations, including instruments involved in solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric studies. We furthermore include an overview of the major space weather service providers in operation today and the current state-of-the-art in the radio data they use and provide routinely. The aim is to compare LOFAR4SW to the existing radio research infrastructure in space weather and show how it may advance both space weather science and operations in the radio domain in the near future.","[Carley, Eoin P.; Gallagher, Peter T.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Carley, Eoin P.; Gallagher, Peter T.] Dublin Inst Adv Studies, Sch Cosm Phys, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Baldovin, Carla; Benthem, Pieter; Fallows, Richard A.; Vermeulen, Rene; LOFAR4SW Consortium] Netherlands Inst Radio Astron, ASTRON, Oude Hoogeveensedijk 4, NL-7991 PD Dwingeloo, Netherlands; [Bisi, Mario M.; Barnes, David] RAL, STFC, RAL Space, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; [Olberg, Michael] Chalmers Univ Technol, OSO, Dept Space Earth & Environm, S-43992 Onsala, Sweden; [Rothkaehl, Hanna] Polish Acad Sci, Space Res Ctr, 18A Bartycka, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland; [Vilmer, Nicole] Univ Paris, Sorbonne Univ, Observ Paris, LESIA,Univ PSL,CNRS, 5 Pl Jules Janssen, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Vilmer, Nicole] Univ Orleans, CNRS, Observ Paris, Stn Radioastron Nancay,PSL Res Univ, F-18330 Nancay, France","Trinity College Dublin; Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC); STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; Chalmers University of Technology; Centrum Badan Kosmicznych, Polish Academy of Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Observatoire de Paris; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Observatoire de Paris; Universite de Orleans","Carley, EP (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 2, Ireland.;Carley, EP (corresponding author), Dublin Inst Adv Studies, Sch Cosm Phys, Dublin 2, Ireland.",eoincarley@gmail.com,"Gallagher, Peter T./AAP-4152-2021; Carley, Eoin/AAP-9942-2020","Fallows, Richard/0000-0002-5186-8040; Barnes, David/0000-0003-1137-8220",European Commission Horizon 2020 INFRADEV-1-2017 LOFAR4SW project [777442]; STFC [ST/M001083/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Commission Horizon 2020 INFRADEV-1-2017 LOFAR4SW project; STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),This work was supported by the European Commission Horizon 2020 INFRADEV-1-2017 LOFAR4SW project number 777442.

However, these are rarely assessed in total in the scientific literature. Thus, the aim of this study was to summarize the different impacts of water-based transport on aquatic and nearshore ecosystems and to identify knowledge gaps and areas for future research. The review identified several environmental and ecological consequences within the main impact categories of water discharges, physical impacts, and air emissions. However, although quantitative data on these consequences are generally scarce the shipping contribution to acidification by SOx- and NOx-emissions has been quantified to some extent. There are several knowledge gaps regarding the ecological consequences of, for example, the increasing, amount of chemicals transported on water, the spread of non-indigenous species coupled with climate change, and physical impacts such as shipping noise and artificial light. The whole plethora of environmental consequences, as well as potential synergistic effects, should be seriously considered in transport planning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To avoid uncertainties associated with the inversion of satellite-measured radiances into water vapor quantity, profiles of temperature and humidity observed from in situ, ground-based, and airborne instruments are inserted into a radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperature that the GOES-8 would have observed under those conditions (i.e., profile-to-radiance approach). Comparisons showed that Vaisala RS80-H radiosondes and Meteolabor Snow White chilled-mirror dewpoint hygrometers are systemically drier in the upper troposphere by similar to 30%-40% relative to the GOES-8 measured upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH). By contrast, two ground-based Raman lidars (Cloud and Radiation Test Bed Raman lidar and scanning Raman lidar) and one airborne differential absorption lidar agree to within 10% of the GOES-8 measured UTH. These results indicate that upper-tropospheric water vapor can be monitored by these lidars and well-calibrated, stable geostationary satellites with an uncertainty of less than 10%, and that correction procedures are required to rectify the inherent deficiencies of humidity measurements in the upper troposphere from these radiosondes.","[Chung, Eui-Seok; Soden, Brian J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",University of Miami,"Soden, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",bsoden@rsmas.miami.edu,"Chung, Eui-Seok/A-5757-2011; Soden, Brian/ABC-3659-2021","Soden, Brian/0000-0001-9693-8236",DOE/ARM Program; NOAA Climate Program Office,DOE/ARM Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank Dave Tobin for providing the NAST-I radiances, Rich Ferrare and David Whiteman for providing the lidar moisture profiles, and the DOE/ARM Program for supporting and distributing data from the AFWEX program.

In this time, volcanology has seen major advances in understanding, modelling and predicting volcanic hazards and, recently, an interest in techniques for reducing and mitigating volcanic risk. This paper provides a synthesis of literature relating to this last aspect, specifically the communication of volcanic risk, with a view to highlighting areas of future research into encouraging risk-reducing behaviour. Evidence suggests that the current 'multidisciplinary' approach within physical science needs a broader scope to include sociological knowledge and techniques. Key areas where this approach might be applied are: (1) the understanding of the incentives that make governments and communities act to reduce volcanic risk; (2) improving the communication of volcanic uncertainties in volcanic emergency management and long-term planning and development. To be successful, volcanic risk reduction programmes will need to be placed within the context of other other risk-related phenomena (e.g. other natural hazards, climate change) and aim to develop an all-risks reduction culture. We suggest that the greatest potential for achieving these two aims comes from deliberative inclusive processes and geographic information systems.","[Barclay, Jenni; Darnell, Amii; Crosweller, H.

However, biomass burning emissions and smoke remain among the largest sources of uncertainties in air quality forecasts. In this study, we evaluate the smoke emissions and plume forecasts from 12 state-of-the-art air quality forecasting systems during the Williams Flats fire in Washington State, US, August 2019, which was intensively observed during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign. Model forecasts with lead times within 1 d are intercompared under the same framework based on observations from multiple platforms to reveal their performance regarding fire emissions, aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface PM2.5, plume injection, and surface PM2.5 to AOD ratio. The comparison of smoke organic carbon (OC) emissions suggests a large range of daily totals among the models, with a factor of 20 to 50. Limited representations of the diurnal patterns and day-to-day variations of emissions highlight the need to incorporate new methodologies to predict the temporal evolution and reduce uncertainty of smoke emission estimates. The evaluation of smoke AOD (sAOD) forecasts suggests overall underpredictions in both the magnitude and smoke plume area for nearly all models, although the high-resolution models have a better representation of the fine-scale structures of smoke plumes. The models driven by fire radiative power (FRP)-based fire emissions or assimilating satellite AOD data generally outperform the others. Additionally, limitations of the persistence assumption used when predicting smoke emissions are revealed by substantial underpredictions of sAOD on 8 August 2019, mainly over the transported smoke plumes, owing to the underestimated emissions on 7 August. In contrast, the surface smoke PM2.5 (sPM(2.5)) forecasts show both positive and negative overall biases for these models, with most members presenting more considerable diurnal variations of sPM(2.5). Overpredictions of sPM(2.5) are found for the models driven by FRP-based emissions during nighttime, suggesting the necessity to improve vertical emission allocation within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Smoke injection heights are further evaluated using the NASA Langley Research Center's Differential Absorption High Spectral Resolution Lidar (DIAL-HSRL) data collected during the flight observations. As the fire became stronger over 38 August, the plume height became deeper, with a day-today range of about 2-9 km a.g.l. However, narrower ranges are found for all models, with a tendency of overpredicting the plume heights for the shallower injection transects and underpredicting for the days showing deeper injections. The misrepresented plume injection heights lead to inaccurate vertical plume allocations along the transects corresponding to transported smoke that is 1 d old. Discrepancies in model performance for surface PM2.5 and AOD are further suggested by the evaluation of their ratio, which cannot be compensated for by solely adjusting the smoke emissions but are more attributable to model representations of plume injections, besides other possible factors including the evolution of PBL depths and aerosol optical property assumptions. By consolidating multiple forecast systems, these results provide strategic insight on pathways to improve smoke forecasts.","[Ye, Xinxin; Arab, Pargoal; Saide, Pablo E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Arab, Pargoal; Ahmadov, Ravan] CU Boulder, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USA; [Ahmadov, Ravan; James, Eric; Grell, Georg A.] NOAA Global Syst Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Pierce, Bradley; Kumar, Aditya] Univ Wisconsin, Madison Space Sci & Engn Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Makar, Paul; Chen, Jack] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Downsview, ON, Canada; [Davignon, Didier] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Meteorol Ctr Operat, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Carmichael, Greg R.; Ferrada, Gonzalo] Univ Iowa, Coll Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [McQueen, Jeff; Huang, Jianping] NOAA NWS Natl Ctr Environm Predict, Boulder, CO USA; [Kumar, Rajesh] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res NCAR, Res Applicat Lab RAL, Boulder, CO USA; [Emmons, Louisa] NCAR, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling ACOM Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Herron-Thorpe, Farren L.] Washington State Dept Ecol, Washington, DC USA; [Parrington, Mark; Engelen, Richard; Peuch, Vincent-Henri] European Ctr Med Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [da Silva, Arlindo; Lyapustin, Alexei; Wang, Yujie; Holben, Brent; Giles, David M.] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Soja, Amber] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA USA; [Soja, Amber; Gargulinski, Emily; Wiggins, Elizabeth; Hair, Johnathan W.; Fenn, Marta; Shingler, Taylor] NASA Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA USA; [Kondragunta, Shobha] NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Boulder, CO USA; [Saide, Pablo E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Fenn, Marta] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Iowa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Institute for Aerospace; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Science Systems and Applications Inc,"Ye, XX; Saide, PE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;Saide, PE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",xinxinye@ucla.edu; saide@atmos.ucla.edu,"Kondragunta, Shobha/F-5601-2010; James, Eric/C-7713-2015; Engelen, Richard/ABE-8175-2020; Ahmadov, Ravan/F-2036-2011","Kondragunta, Shobha/0000-0001-8593-8046; James, Eric/0000-0002-6507-4997; Ahmadov, Ravan/0000-0002-6996-7071; Gargulinski, Emily/0000-0002-3949-6627; Chen, Jack/0000-0002-3764-1149; Ye, Xinxin/0000-0001-8558-1294","National Aeronautics and Space Administration [80NSSC18K0629, 80NSSC18K0685, 80NSSC18K0681]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4310107]; National Science Foundation [2013461]",National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research has been supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (grant nos. 80NSSC18K0629, 80NSSC18K0685, and 80NSSC18K0681), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (grant no.

While their combination can be challenging to the understanding of nanoscopic processes, there has been limited attempts on bringing these two together. While summarizing the state of the art and open questions in these fields, several major advances are presented with a perspective on the next steps in the investigations of ionic-liquid filled nanopores, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint. By analogy to aqueous solutions, it is argued that ionic liquids and nanopores can be combined to provide new nanofluidic functionalities, as well as to help resolve some of the pertinent problems in understanding transport phenomena in confined ionic liquids and providing better control of the speed of translocating analytes.","[Marion, Sanjin; Radenovic, Aleksandra] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Engn, Inst Bioengn, Lab Nanoscale Biol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Vucemilovic-Alagic, Natasa; Spadina, Mario; Smith, Ana-Suncana] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Phys Chem, Grp Computat Life Sci, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Vucemilovic-Alagic, Natasa; Smith, Ana-Suncana] FAU Erlangen Nurnberg, PULS Grp, Dept Phys, Interdisciplinary Ctr Nanostruct Films, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Rudjer Boskovic Institute; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Radenovic, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Engn, Inst Bioengn, Lab Nanoscale Biol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Smith, AS (corresponding author), Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Phys Chem, Grp Computat Life Sci, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.;Smith, AS (corresponding author), FAU Erlangen Nurnberg, PULS Grp, Dept Phys, Interdisciplinary Ctr Nanostruct Films, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",aleksandra.radenovic@epfl.ch; smith@physik.fau.de,"Radenovic, Aleksandra/AAZ-5582-2021; Radenovic, Aleksandra/C-5350-2011; Smith, Ana-Suncana/C-7349-2013","Radenovic, Aleksandra/0000-0001-8194-2785; Smith, Ana-Suncana/0000-0002-0835-0086; Marion, Sanjin/0000-0002-9892-7378","Ministry of Science and Education, Republic of Croatia [Klasa640-02/19-04/00145 URBROJ 533-03-19-0002]; EIT Climate - KIC; Croatian Science Foundation [DOK-2015-10-9140]; German Science Foundation at the FAU [SFB 1543]; Swiss National Science Foundation [BIONIC BSCGI0 157802]","Ministry of Science and Education, Republic of Croatia; EIT Climate - KIC; Croatian Science Foundation; German Science Foundation at the FAU; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission)","S.M. and N.V.-A. contributed equally to this work.

Although sewer system failures are spatiotemporal in nature, previous studies analyzed failure risk from a unidimensional aspect (either spatial or temporal), not accounting for bidimensional spatiotemporal complexities. This is owing to the insufficiency of good-quality data, which ultimately leads to under-/overestimation of failure risk. Here, we propose a generalized methodology/framework to facilitate a robust spatiotemporal analysis of urban sewer system failure risk, overcoming the intrinsic challenges of data imperfections-e.g., missing data, outliers, and imbalanced information. The framework includes a two-stage data-driven modeling technique that efficiently models the highly right-skewed sewer system failure data to predict the failure risk, leveraging a bidimensional space-time approach. We implemented our analysis for Bogota, the capital city of Colombia. We train, test, and validate a battery of machine learning algorithms-logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost-and select the best model in terms of goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the framework in planning/scheduling sewer system maintenance operations using state-of-the-art optimization techniques. Our proposed framework can help stakeholders to analyze the failure-risk models' performance under different discrimination thresholds, and provide managerial insights on the model's adequate spatial resolution and appropriateness of decentralized management for sewer system maintenance.","[Fontecha, John E.; Agarwal, Puneet; Mukherjee, Sayanti; Walteros, Jose L.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 411 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Torres, Maria N.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Struct Civil & Environm Engn, Buffalo, NY USA; [Rodriguez, Juan P.] Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bogota, Colombia",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Mukherjee, S (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 411 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",johnedga@buffalo.edu; sayantim@buffalo.edu,"; Walteros, Jose L./F-4297-2016; Rodriguez Sanchez, Juan Pablo/A-2872-2013","Agarwal, Puneet/0000-0002-0768-1094; Walteros, Jose L./0000-0002-8258-7532; Fontecha, John Edgar/0000-0001-5725-8422; Mukherjee, Sayanti/0000-0002-5833-1617; Rodriguez Sanchez, Juan Pablo/0000-0001-5647-4385",,,,,97,10,10,8,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,DEC,2021,12,,,,2356,2391,,10.1111/risa.13742,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.13742,,21-May,36,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",YN7VV,34056745,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000656090800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, the threat posed by climate change and the increasing investment from cities on creating and repurposing open spaces and infrastructure, is feeding a renovated interest in landscape design.

Environmental or safety applications and the growing area of fleet management all benefit from accident detection contributions by minimizing the risk vehicles and drivers are subject to, improving their service and reducing overhead costs. Some solutions have been proposed in the past literature for automated accident detection that are mainly based on traffic data or external sensors. However, traffic data can be difficult to access, while external sensors can end up being difficult to set up and unreliable, depending on how they are used. Additionally, the scarcity of accident detection data has limited the type of approaches used in the past, leaving in particular, machine learning (ML) relatively unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we propose a ML framework for automated car accident detection based on mutimodal in-car sensors. Our work is a unique and innovative study on detecting real-world driving accidents by applying state-of-the-art feature extraction methods using basic sensors in cars. In total, five different feature extraction approaches, including techniques based on feature engineering and feature learning with deep learning are evaluated on the strategic highway research program (SHRP2) naturalistic driving study (NDS) crash data set. The main observations of this study are as follows: (1) CNN features with a SVM classifier obtain very promising results, outperforming all other tested approaches. (2) Feature engineering and feature learning approaches were finding different best performing features. Therefore, our fusion experiment indicates that these two feature sets can be efficiently combined. (3) Unsupervised feature extraction remarkably achieves a notable performance score.","[Pour, Hawzhin Hozhabr; Wismueller, Roland] Univ Siegen, Res Grp Operating Syst & Distributed Syst, Holderlinstr 3, D-57076 Siegen, Germany; [Li, Frederic; Trense, Christian; Grzegorzek, Marcin] Univ Lubeck, Inst Med Informat, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Wegmeth, Lukas] Univ Siegen, Intelligent Syst Grp ISG, Holderlinstr 3, D-57076 Siegen, Germany; [Doniec, Rafal] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biosensors & Biomed Signal Proc, Roosevelta 40, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland; [Grzegorzek, Marcin] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Knowledge Engn, Bogucicka 3, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",Universitat Siegen; University of Lubeck; Universitat Siegen; Silesian University of Technology; University of Economics in Katowice,"Pour, HH (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Res Grp Operating Syst & Distributed Syst, Holderlinstr 3, D-57076 Siegen, Germany.",hawzhin.hozhabrpour@uni-siegen.de; fr.li@uni-luebeck.de; lukas.wegmeth@uni-siegen.de; christian.trense@student.uni-luebeck.de; rafal.doniec@polsl.pl; marcin.grzegorzek@uni-luebeck.de; roland.wismueller@uni-siegen.de,"Doniec, Rafal Jan/AAU-6286-2021","Doniec, Rafal Jan/0000-0002-2535-3932; Li, Frederic/0000-0003-2110-4207; Grzegorzek, Marcin/0000-0003-4877-8287; Wegmeth, Lukas/0000-0001-8848-9434; Trense, Christian/0000-0003-4095-7758; Hozhabr Pour, Hawzhin/0000-0003-4404-7313; Wismueller, Roland/0000-0002-2860-2447",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01IS15048B]; German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) [01MT20001L],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK),Research and development activities leading to this article have been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project LEICAR (grant number: 01IS15048B) and German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) within the project GEMIMEG-II (grant number: 01MT20001L).,,74,2,2,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAY,2022,10,,,,,,3634,10.3390/s22103634,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22103634,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,1R5ZT,35632039,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000803448600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The UNASM combines information from state-of-the-art US STATSGO2 and Soil Landscape of Canada (SLCs) databases. The area not covered by these datasets is filled by using the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.21 (HWSD1.21). The UNASM contains maximum soil depth derived from the data source as well as seven soil attributes (including sand, silt, and clay content, gravel content, organic carbon content, pH, and bulk density) for the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) and the subsoil layer (30-100 cm), respectively, of the spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees in latitude and longitude. There are pronounced differences in the spatial distributions of soil properties and soil organic carbon between UNASM and HWSD, but the UNASM overall provides more detailed and higher-quality information particularly in Alaska and central Canada. To provide more accurate and up-to-date estimate of soil organic carbon stock in North America, we incorporated Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) into the UNASM. The estimate of total soil organic carbon mass in the upper 100 cm soil profile based on the improved UNASM is 365.96 Pg, of which 23.1% is under trees, 14.1% is in shrubland, and 4.6% is in grassland and cropland. This UNASM data will provide a resource for use in terrestrial ecosystem modeling both for input of soil characteristics and for benchmarking model output.","[Liu, S.; Wei, Y.; Post, W. M.; Cook, R.

A well-insulated home should keep your space warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and this in turn cuts down carbon emissions linked to global climate change. In terms of energy efficiency, investing in high levels of insulation materials for your home is more cost-effective than investing in expensive heating technologies. Insulation materials work by resisting heat flow, measured by an R-value (the higher the R-value, the greater the insulation). R-value depends on the type of insulation, its thickness, and its density. In this sight, this study draws attention to the importance of building insulation materials in green buildings' sustainable energy performance.","[Bayer, Ozgur] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Bayer, O (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ankara, Turkey.",,"BAYER, Ozgur/CAF-6447-2022","BAYER, Ozgur/0000-0003-0508-2263",,,,,77,0,0,2,2,INST ENGINEERING TECH-IET,STEVENAGE,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE, STEVENAGE, HERTS SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78561-948-9; 978-1-78561-947-2,IET ENERG ENG,,,2019,,,,,149,172,,,,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics,BS4TJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000722573200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Colobanthus quitensis dispersion by seeds and establishment are limited to years with sufficiently high summer temperatures. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of increased growth temperature on the germination ability of C. quitensis. Individuals were collected from King George Island and grown at two different thermoperiods: 5/2 and 11/5 A degrees C, day/night. Mature seeds produced under both growth temperatures were tested for viability and incubated under a range of temperatures from 5A degrees to 35 A degrees C. Seed viability was not significantly different between growth temperatures. Germination for C. quitensis was highly temperature dependent. Germination was modulated by temperatures over 10 A degrees C. Seeds from 5/2 A degrees C showed significant higher germination (> 80 %) between 10 and 15 A degrees C. Seed developed at 11/5 A degrees C showed a broader range of temperature for germination between 10 and 25 A degrees C. Higher growth temperature (11/5 A degrees C) reduced the germination time significantly. Our results suggest that annual production of seeds leads to a high probability of germination at warmer environmental conditions because dormancy would be reduced at higher temperatures. Therefore, higher environmental temperatures, as those predicted to occur because of global warming, would increase the propagation of C. quitensis by germination.","[Sanhueza, C.; Cavieres, L.

The SiO2-like layer interposed between a deposited protective oxide film and its Si substrate plays a key role as a tunnel oxide that can dominate the total device impedance. In this report, we investigate the effects of changes in interfacial SiO2 resistance and capacitance in the oxide bilayer through both solid state leakage current and capacitance-voltage measurements and through electrochemical methods applied to water splitting cells. Modelling is performed to describe both types of data in a simple and intuitive way, allowing for insights to be developed into the connections among both the dielectric (charge storage) and conductive (charge transport) properties of bilayer protective oxides and their effects on oxygen evolution performance. Finally, atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 is studied as an insulator layer with conductivity intermediate between that of tunnel oxide SiO2 and the more conductive ALD-TiO2, to further generalize this understanding.","[Scheuermann, A.

How trait clines evolve has recently received increased attention because of anticipated climate change and the importance of rapid evolution in invasive species. This issue is particularly relevant for clines in growth and defense of plants, because both sets of traits are closely tied to fitness and because such sessile organisms experience strong local selection. Yet despite widespread recognition that growth and defense traits are intertwined, the general issue of their joint clinal evolution is not well resolved. To address heritable clinal variation and adaptation of growth and defense traits of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), we planted seed from 22 populations encompassing the species' latitudinal range in common gardens near the range center (New York) and toward the range edges (New Brunswick and North Carolina). Populations were differentiated in 13 traits, and six traits showed genetically based latitudinal clines. Higher-latitude populations had earlier phenology, lower shoot biomass, more root buds and clonal growth, higher root-to-shoot ratio, and greater latex production. The cline in shoot biomass was consistent in all three locations. Selection on phenology was reversed in New Brunswick and North Carolina, with early genotypes favored in the north but not the south. We found no clines in foliar trichomes or toxic cardenolides. Annual precipitation of source populations explained variation in phenology, clonal growth, root-to-shoot ratio, and latex. Across four traits measured in New Brunswick and North Carolina, we found garden-by-latitude (and garden-by-precipitation) interactions, indicating plasticity in genetically based trait clines. In the two gardens with substantial herbivory (New York and North Carolina), northern populations showed higher resistance to insects. Resistance to aphids was driven by trichomes and water content, while resistance to monarch caterpillars was driven by latex. However, surveys of natural populations indicated that leaf damage and insect diversity on milkweed are low at the geographical extremes (New Brunswick and North Carolina) and higher toward the range center. We speculate that milkweed plants evolved clines in growth traits in response to climate, and that this set the template for tolerance to herbivory, which subsequently shaped the evolution of defensive traits.","[Woods, Ellen C.; Hastings, Amy P.; Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Turley, Nash E.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Heard, Stephen B.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Fredericton, NB E3B 1R3, Canada; [Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; University of New Brunswick; Cornell University,"Agrawal, AA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",agrawal@cornell.edu,"Agrawal, Anurag A/Y-2497-2019","Agrawal, Anurag A/0000-0003-0095-1220","NSF-DEB [0447550, 0950231]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada); NSF",NSF-DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Robin Bingham, Daisy Johnson, Alexis Erwin, and Majorie Weber for help with field and lab work, and especially Marc Johnson for facilitating the North Carolina common garden.

The development of genetic sampling enables retrieval of genetic material even from historical records, extending potential uses of herbarium collections. However, the use of adhesives might be detrimental to dried plant specimens, contributing to their degradation on many levels. The use of the appropriate adhesive has always been the subject of discussion and one of the important issues concerning herbarium making. This paper discusses current practices of the use of adhesives in herbaria collections, regarding their long-term quality in terms of aging behaviour and appropriateness for the use with herbarium material. Health and safety of herbarium staff are also addressed.

The proxy records were derived from a 5-m-thick stratigraphic section exposed by cut bank incision. We interpreted ecosystem dynamics from changes in the stable carbon isotopic ratio of sedimentary organic material compared to delta C-13 ratios of contemporary carbon sources. Sedimentary organic material had delta C-13 values ranging from -29.715 to -15.291. We derived a record of paleo-erosion rates in the catchment from the concentration of meteoric Be-10 in layers of the floodplain sediments. Paleo-erosion rates ranged from 13 to 356 mm ky(-1). The chronology of the sediments was constrained with the radiocarbon ages of organic deposits, the oldest age was calibrated to similar to 22.4 ky BP (thousand years before present) and retrieved at 440 cm depth. We collected grain size data, clay mineralogies, and analyzed geochemical indices including the chemical weathering index, salinization, and base cation loss down profile. This stratigraphic sequence captures major shifts in the Caribbean climate, the intensification of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and the arrival of humans on the island. During the last glacial and early Holocene epochs both biotic (delta C-13) and abiotic proxies (Be-10(met) and geochemical data) indicated dynamic equilibrium with climate. The past five thousand years (ky) of record are characterized instead by pulsed responses to disturbances in both systems. Colonial-era land use drove changes that significantly exceeded natural variability in any proxy over the period of record. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We define the term biogeochemical functional group to refer to groups of organisms that mediate specific chemical reactions in the ocean. Thus, according to this definition, functional groups have no phylogenetic meaning-these are composed of many different species with common biogeochemical functions. Substantial progress has been made in the last decade toward quantifying the rates of these various functions and understanding the factors that control them. For some of these groups, we have developed fairly sophisticated models that incorporate this understanding, e.g. for diazotrophs (e.g. Trichodesmium), silica producers (diatoms) and calcifiers (e.g. coccolithophorids and specifically Emiliania huxleyi). However, current representations of nitrogen fixation and calcification are incomplete, i.e., based primarily upon models of Trichodesmium and E huxleyi, respectively, and many important functional groups have not yet been considered in open-ocean biogeochemical models. Progress has been made over the last decade in efforts to simulate dimethylsulfide (DMS) production and cycling (i.e., by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes) and denitrification, but these efforts are still in their infancy, and many significant problems remain. One obvious gap is that virtually all functional group modeling efforts have focused on autotrophic microbes, while higher trophic levels have been completely ignored. It appears that in some cases (e.g., calcification), incorporating higher trophic levels may be essential not only for representing a particular biogeochemical reaction, but also for modeling export. Another serious problem is our tendency to model the organisms for which we have the most validation data (e.g., E huxleyi and Trichodesmium) even when they may represent only a fraction of the biogeochemical functional group we are trying to represent. When we step back and look at the paleo-oceanographic record, it suggests that oxygen concentrations have played a central role in the evolution and emergence of many of the key functional groups that influence biogeochemical cycles in the present-day ocean. However, more subtle effects are likely to be important over the next century like changes in silicate supply or turbulence that can influence the relative success of diatoms versus dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids and diazotrophs. In general, inferences drawn from the paleo-oceanographic record and theoretical work suggest that global warming will tend to favor the latter because it will give rise to increased stratification. However, decreases in pH and Fe supply could adversely impact coccolithophorids and diazotrophs in the future. It may be necessary to include explicit dynamic representations of nitrogen fixation, denitrification, silicification and calcification in our models if our goal is predicting the oceanic carbon cycle in the future, because these processes appear to play a very significant role in the carbon cycle of the present-day ocean and they are sensitive to climate change. Observations and models suggest that it may also be necessary to include the DMS cycle to predict future climate, though the effects are still highly uncertain. We have learned a tremendous amount about the distributions and biogeochemical impact of bacteria in the ocean in recent years, yet this improved understanding has not yet been incorporated into many of our models. All of these considerations lead us toward the development of increasingly complex models. However, recent quantitative model intercomparison studies suggest that continuing to add complexity and more functional groups to our ecosystem models may lead to decreases in predictive ability if the models are not properly constrained with available data. We also caution that capturing the present-day variability tells us little about how well a particular model can predict the future. If our goal is to develop models that can be used to predict how the oceans will respond to global warming, then we need to make more rigorous assessments of predictive skill using the available data.

Our description principally relies on the anatomy of the ovuliferous scales, revealed through X-ray synchrotron microtomography (SRXMT) performed at the Diamond Light Source (UK). This study represents the first application of SRXMT to macro-scale silicified plant fossils, and demonstrates the significant advantages of this approach, which can resolve cellular structure over lab-based X-ray computed microtomography (XMT). The method enabled us to characterize tissues and precisely demarcate their boundaries, elucidating organ shape, and thus allowing an accurate assessment of affinities. The cones are broadly spherical (ca. 1.3 cm diameter), and are structured around a central axis with helically arranged bract/scale complexes, each of which bares a single ovule. A three-lobed ovuliferous scale and ovules enclosed within pocket-forming tissue, demonstrate an affinity with Cheirolepidiaceae. Details of vascular sclerenchyma bundles, integument structure, and the number and attachment of the ovules indicate greatest similarity to P. patagonica and P. carrii. This fossil develops our understanding of the dominant tree element of the Purbeck Fossil Forest, providing the first evidence for ovulate cheirolepidiaceous cones in Europe. Alongside recent discoveries in North America, this significantly extends the known palaeogeographic range of Pararaucaria, supporting a mid-palaeolatitudinal distribution in both Gondwana and Laurasia during the Late Jurassic. Palaeoclimatic interpretations derived from contemporaneous floras, climate sensitive sediments, and general circulation climate models indicate that Pararaucaria was a constituent of low diversity floras in semi-aridMediterranean-type environments.","[Steart, David C.; Munt, Martin C.; Kenrick, Paul] Nat Hist Museum, Invertebrates & Plants Div, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Steart, David C.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Agr Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Spencer, Alan R.

Here, we report a poly(fluorenyl aryl piperidinium) (PFAP) ionomer that enables high power of AEMFC with low hydrogen flow rate (<= 100 mL min(-1) for 5 cm(2) cell). The high water permeability of the ionomer is beneficial to prevent anode flooding under moderate relative humidity. The relationship between hydrogen flow rate and limiting current density is revealed based on PFAP copolymers. Specifically, the peak power density of AEMFC is 1.77 W cm(-2) with a H-2 flow rate of 75 mL min(-1), retaining >70% power density from the H-2 flow rate of 1000 mL min(-1) (2.42 W cm(-2)). Importantly, the present AEMFCs display much higher hydrogen utilization efficiency above 90% and hydrogen fuel power (similar to 30 W cm(-2) L-1) than previously reported AEMFCs (<30% and 0.4-3.5 W cm(-2) L-1). Moreover, the present AEMFCs show stable cell performance with a low hydrogen flow rate at 70 degrees C for >110 h.","[Chen, Nanjun; Kim, Sun Pyo; Hu, Chuan; Wang, Ho Hyun; Park, Jong Hyeong; Kim, Hae Min; Lee, Young Moo] Hanyang Univ, Dept Energy Engn, Coll Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Lee, YM (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Energy Engn, Coll Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",ymlee@hanyang.ac.kr,"Lee, Young Moo/G-5920-2015","Lee, Young Moo/0000-0002-5047-3143; Chen, Nanjun/0000-0003-4074-5229; HU, CHUAN/0000-0002-6373-8067","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Change through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2018M1A2A2061979]; Material Component Technology Development through the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) - Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, South Korea [20010955]","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Change through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT; Material Component Technology Development through the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) - Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, South Korea","This research was supported by the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Change through the National ResearchFoundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2018M1A2A2061979) and by the Material Component Technology Development (20010955) through the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, South Korea.",,37,2,2,17,60,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-7753,1873-2755,,J POWER SOURCES,J.

About two decades ago flood risk was managed from a limited perspective predominantly by means of structural measures aimed at flood control. In contrast integrated flood risk management incorporates the complete management cycle consisting of the phases prevention, protection and preparedness. In theory it is a well described concept. In the stage of implementation, however, there is often a lack of support although a consistent policy framework exists. Consequently, the degree of implementation must be rated as inadequate in many cases. In particular this refers to the elements which focus on preparedness and prevention. The study to which this paper refers emphasises the means and potentials of scenario technique to foster the implementation of potentially appropriate measures and new societal arrangements when applied in the framework of integrated flood risk management. A literature review is carried out to reveal the state-of-the-art and the specific problem framework within which scenario technique is generally being applied. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that scenario technique is transferable to a policy making process in flood risk management that is integrated, sustainable and interactive. The study concludes with a recommendation for three applications in which the implementation of measures of flood damage prevention and preparedness is supported by scenario technique.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Hydraul & Water Resources Engn, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Winterscheid, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Hydraul & Water Resources Engn, Petersenstr 13, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",winterscheid@ihwb.tu-darmstadt.de,,,,,,,13,3,3,3,11,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0273-1223,,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

It was also the gateway through which waves of immigrants, travelers, and invaders entered the subcontinent. As a result, a great deal of diversity and tolerance marks the road. Between 1988 and 1991, Raghubir Singh (1942-1999), one of India's renowned documentary photographers, traveled and photographed the Indian stretch of the Road. Ninety-six photographs from his journeys appear in the publication, The Grand Trunk Road: A Passage Through India (1995). Singh used the pictorial style of street photography that he is known for to capture everyday life along the path. Further, he emphasized the tremendous diversity he witnessed along the road through the selections he made for inclusion in the book and the specific manner in which he arranged many of them. By underscoring the heterogeneity, Singh provided a critical visual commentary on the political climate in India during the 1980s and early nineties. This period coincided with the rise of Hindu nationalism, which aimed to erase the subcontinent's diverse past and promote instead the idea of a homogenous/Hindu India. By documenting the road in his uniquely pictorial style and arranging the photographs in his book to draw attention to differences and tolerance witnessed along the path, Singh demonstrated that India was not monolithic, as the politics of the time claimed, but a rich interwoven fabric of many varied strands.","[Chandrasekhar, Chaya] Marietta Coll, Art Hist, Marietta, GA 45750 USA",,"Chandrasekhar, C (corresponding author), Marietta Coll, Art Hist, Marietta, GA 45750 USA.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,OPEN LIBRARY HUMANITIES,CAMBRIDGE,"SALISBURY HOUSE, STATION RD, CAMBRIDGE, CB1 2LA, ENGLAND",,1943-9946,,ASIANETWORK EXCH,ASIANetwork Exch.,SPR,2013,2,,,,61,73,,,,,,13,Asian Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Asian Studies,V7M9P,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000421106400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ongoing research between Australian theatre makers and academics seeks to address these manifold concerns, combining qualitative and practice-led approaches in an effort to produce a new framework to support the creation of sustainable, tourable intermedial theatre. We suggest the key to this framework lies in a new conception of 'scale' in scenography - the capacity of a production to contract and expand to its surroundings without the need for change in the original design, to be physically and aurally flexible throughout its lifespan. This article presents the initial findings from our multi-year research, and the first step towards the final framework: a new design methodology, grounded in the notion of scale, designed to shift intermedial practice towards a more sustainable, flexible model of touring complex technical theatre. Contextualised by ongoing discussions of the performative scenographic model and grounded in a pragmatic view of technology as solution to the climate crisis, this article shares the nascent design methodology that emerged from Dead Puppet Society's Ishmael (2021) and its impact on scenographic process and product.","[Rixon, Tessa; Brumpton, Anthony] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Creat Ind Educ & Social Justice, Sch Creat Practice, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Brumpton, Anthony; Morton, David] Dead Puppet Soc, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Rixon, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Creat Ind Educ & Social Justice, Sch Creat Practice, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",tessa.rixon@qut.edu.au,,"Brumpton, Anthony/0000-0002-0328-5836",Glass Half Full Productions; Australian Government through the Australia Council; Queensland Government; Queensland University of Technology Innovation Grant,Glass Half Full Productions; Australian Government through the Australia Council; Queensland Government; Queensland University of Technology Innovation Grant,"Ishmael is presented by Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Dead Puppet Society, and Brisbane Festival in association with Screen Queensland.

Due consideration should, therefore, be given to processes that ensure critical architectural solutions that limit the perception of historical contexts as static resources and design solutions as binary responses. Through a theoretical lens of architectural post-structuralism, based on binaries, it will be argued that architectural heritage practice was initiated in a dichotomous manner and that its processes and resultant architectural design approaches have been similarly polarised. This article will briefly formulate a relevant architectural post-structuralist critique while highlighting and describing the general binary oppositions present in heritage practice and design. Then, crucial project phases that provide a range of possibilities for those working in historical contexts will be presented, to limit heritage practice only operating at the extremes of its current, inherent, binary oppositions.","[Barker, Arthur] Univ Pretoria, Dept Architecture, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Barker, A (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Architecture, Pretoria, South Africa.",arthur.barker@up.ac.za,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG,PRETORIA,"ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG, PRETORIA, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-3542,,,SOUTH AFR J ART HIST,South Afr.

In such a virtual test environment, a perception sensor is replaced by a sensor model. A major challenge for state-of-the-art sensor models is to represent the large variety of material properties of the surrounding objects in a realistic manner. Since lidar sensors are considered to play an essential role for upcoming automated vehicles, this paper presents a new lidar modelling approach that takes material properties and corresponding lidar capabilities into account. The considered material property is the incidence angle dependent reflectance of the illuminated material in the infrared spectrum and the considered lidar property its capability to detect a material with a certain reflectance up to a certain range. A new material classification for lidar modelling in the automotive context is suggested, distinguishing between 7 material classes and 23 subclasses. To measure angle dependent reflectance in the infrared spectrum, a new measurement device based on a time of flight camera is introduced and calibrated using Lambertian targets with defined reflectance values at 10%, 50%, and 95%. Reflectance measurements of 9 material subclasses are presented and 488 spectra from the NASA ECOSTRESS library are considered to evaluate the new measurement device. The parametrisation of the lidar capabilities is illustrated by presenting a lidar measurement campaign with a new Infineon lidar prototype and relevant data from 12 common lidar types.","[Muckenhuber, Stefan; Holzer, Hannes] Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21A, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Bockaj, Zrinka] Infineon Technol Austria AG, Babenbergerstr 10, A-8020 Graz, Austria",Infineon Technologies,"Muckenhuber, S (corresponding author), Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Inffeldgasse 21A, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",stefan.muckenhuber@v2c2.at; hannes.holzer@v2c2.at; zbockaj@hotmail.com,,"Muckenhuber, Stefan/0000-0003-1920-8437",COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),"This research received financial support within the COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK), the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), the Province of Styria (Dept. 12) and the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG).",,34,8,8,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN,2020,11,,,,,,3309,10.3390/s20113309,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20113309,,,25,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,MQ2OZ,32532072,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000552737900302,View Full Record in Web of Science

The variability of these properties during the winter season is also captured by the model. We also show that the simulated scaling exhibits a space-time coupling, a suggested property of brittle deformation at geophysical scales. The ability to reproduce the multi-fractality of this scaling is crucial in the context of downscaling model simulation outputs to infer sea ice variables at the sub-grid scale and also has implications for modeling the statistical properties of deformation-related quantities, such as lead fractions and heat and salt fluxes.","[Rampal, Pierre; Dansereau, Veronique; Olason, Einar; Williams, Timothy; Korosov, Anton] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Rampal, Pierre; Dansereau, Veronique; Olason, Einar; Williams, Timothy; Korosov, Anton] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Samake, Abdoulaye] Univ Bamako, Bamako, Mali; [Bouillon, Sylvain] NUMECA, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bamako,"Rampal, P (corresponding author), Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway.;Rampal, P (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.",pierre.rampal@nersc.no,"Ólason, Elnar/AAY-1708-2021; Samaké, Abdoulaye/GQY-8164-2022","Ólason, Elnar/0000-0001-7911-5713; Samaké, Abdoulaye/0000-0003-3800-6339; Korosov, Anton/0000-0002-3601-1161","Research Council of Norway [263044, 231179, 244001]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This research has been supported by the Research Council of Norway (grant nos. 263044, 231179 and 244001).",,63,30,30,0,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1994-0416,1994-0424,,CRYOSPHERE,Cryosphere,23-Sep,2019,9,,,,2457,2474,,10.5194/tc-13-2457-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2457-2019,,,18,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,JA6ZF,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000487989600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results show that monosilicates exhibit a lower recession in contact with CMAS than their disilicate counterparts. The recession of the ytterbium silicates is far lower than the recession of the yttrium silicates under CMAS attack. Investigation of the ytterbium silicate mixtures exposes their superior resistance to CMAS, which is even higher than the resistance of the pure monosilicate. Also their decreased CTE suggests they will display better performance than the pure monosilicate.","[Wolf, Markus; Mack, Daniel Emil; Guillon, Olivier; Vassen, Robert] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Julich, Germany; [Guillon, Olivier] Julich Aachen Res Alliance JARA Energy, Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Wolf, M (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Julich, Germany.",m.wolf@fz-juelich.de,,"Mack, Daniel Emil/0000-0002-0365-4582",MTU Aero Engines AG [Z0609.21.18],MTU Aero Engines AG,The authors acknowledge financial support from MTU Aero Engines AG under contract Z0609.21.18.,,61,17,17,12,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-7820,1551-2916,,J AM CERAM SOC,J.

Peering into this realm of physical extremity, chemists have extracted detailed knowledge of the fundamental chemistry of actinide elements and how they contribute to bonding, structure formation and intricate properties in compounds under such conditions. The last decade has resulted in some of the most significant contributions to actinide chemical science and this holds true for ex situ chemical studies of actinides resulting from HP/HT conditions of over 1 GPa and elevated temperature. Often conducted in tandem with ab initio calculations, HP/HT studies of actinides have further helped guide and develop theoretical modelling approaches and uncovered associated difficulties. Accordingly, this perspective article is devoted to reviewing the latest advancements made in actinide HP/HT ex situ chemical studies over the last decade, the state-of-the-art, challenges and discussing potential future directions of the science. The discussion is given with emphasis on thorium and uranium compounds due to the prevalence of their investigation but also highlights some of the latest advancements in high pressure chemical studies of transuranium compounds.

The different material types are discussed on the basis of the properties they can attribute to the resulting sensors, including their limit of detection, sensitivity, and response time. Limitations induced by cracking and the hysteresis effect, which reduce the repeatability and reliability of the sensors, as well as by CO poisoning that deteriorates their performance in the long run, are also discussed together with an overview of manufacturing approaches (e.g., tailoring the composition and/or applying functionalizing coatings) for addressing these issues.","[Sousanis, Andreas; Biskos, George] Cyprus Inst, Climate & Atmosphere Res Ctr, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Biskos, George] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Biskos, G (corresponding author), Cyprus Inst, Climate & Atmosphere Res Ctr, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus.;Biskos, G (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",a.sousanis@cyi.ac.cy; g.biskos@cyi.ac.cy,"Biskos, George/D-9142-2013","Biskos, George/0000-0003-0512-6115",Research Innovation Foundation of Cyprus,Research Innovation Foundation of Cyprus,The authors are grateful to the Research Innovation Foundation of Cyprus for funding the NANO2LAB project under the grant INFRASTRUCTURES/1216/0070.,,104,4,4,20,53,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-4991,,NANOMATERIALS-BASEL,Nanomaterials,NOV,2021,11,,,,,,3100,10.3390/nano11113100,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano11113100,,,23,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,XF9MU,34835864,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000724389100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it does not meet the present-day challenges of rapidly growing populations, food insecurity, and pressures from climate change. To transform the current framework and apply modern evaluation strategies that better support sustainable agriculture, the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) assembled a technical committee to reframe the safety evaluation of crop-protection products. The committee is composed of international experts from regulatory agencies, academia, industry and nongovernmental organizations. Their mission is to establish a framework that supports the development of fit-for-purpose agrochemical safety evaluation that is applicable to changing global, as well as local needs and regulatory decisions, and incorporates relevant evolving science. This will be accomplished through the integration of state-of-the-art scientific methods, technologies and data sources, to inform safety and risk decisions, and adapt them to evolving local and global needs. The project team will use a systems-thinking approach to develop the tools that will implement a problem formulation and exposure driven approach to create sustainable, safe and effective crop protection products, and reduce, replace and refine animal studies with fit-for-purpose assays. A new approach necessarily will integrate the most modern tools and latest advances in chemical testing methods to guarantee the robust human and environmental safety and risk assessment of agrochemicals. This article summarizes the challenges associated with the modernization of agrochemical safety evaluation, proposes a potential roadmap, and seeks input and engagement from the broader community to advance this effort.

Concrete seawalls are a common category of coastal protection structures, designed with the primary objectives of absorbing wave action, preventing coastline erosion, and alleviating flooding. Much research has been carried out on improving concrete seawall performance. This work is a review of the current state-of-the-art in concrete seawalls focusing on design aspects including wave loading and innovative seawall designs, ecological considerations, and durability performance. Different conventional seawalls and their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed. Wave loads on seawalls have received significant attention; and multiple approaches for the quantification for the different types of loads are presented. However, wave load quantification remains a challenging task, especially for novel designs, and performance under load for such designs must be quantified through testing in wave tanks. Drawing inspiration from natural shorelines, modification of surface complexity at a multitude of scales can improve the otherwise poor ecological performance of seawalls. Ecological performance can also be improved by the incorporation of natural materials or structures in seawalls although the exact influence of concrete and other material chemistry on benthic diversity is unclear. The corrosion of the steel is a major durability concern, and the use of non-corrosive reinforcement can increase seawall durability toward corrosion. Other durability concerns include alkali silica reaction and sulfate attack, which can be mitigated through proper mixture design, including through the use of supplementary cementitious materials. Examples of innovative seawall designs and systems which have the capability to outperform conventional seawalls are discussed. Advances in structural design, ecological engineering, and infrastructure materials science will drive the development of multi-functional seawalls which are sustainable, durable, and resilient.","[Hosseinzadeh, Nima; Ghiasian, Mohammad; Andiroglu, Esber; Rhode-Barbarigos, Landolf; Suraneni, Prannoy] Univ Miami, Civil & Architectural Engn, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Lamere, Joel] Univ Miami, Architecture, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Sobczak, James] Univ Miami Lib, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Sealey, Kathleen Sullivan] Univ Miami, Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami,"Suraneni, P (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Civil & Architectural Engn, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",suranenip@maimi.edu,"Ghiasian, Mohammad/ABA-5255-2021","Ghiasian, Mohammad/0000-0001-7116-6014; Sobczak, James/0000-0001-7598-2836",University of Miami; Knight Foundation Endowment in the College of Engineering (University of Miami),University of Miami; Knight Foundation Endowment in the College of Engineering (University of Miami),"This research was supported by the University of Miami U-LINK Phase 2 funding to the authors for the project Next generation of coastal structures: Feasibility, quantification, and optimization.

Vitrivius's 'Utilitas, Firmitas, Venustas' dictum may be now occasionally translated as the 'Copy, Paste, Print' approach. It is at this point that we as architects, planners and designers need to look back, reevaluate our role in bringing comfort, beauty and order to the Planet Earth. Architecture and urban design have gone through many stylistic periods such as Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance, Art Deco, New Brutalism, Modernism, Post Modernism, Constructivism, Neo Classicism and the like. However, there has always been one overall classification of design and the built world encompassing and overriding all stylistic periods and approaches: The Universalism and the Regionalism. Myself, I favor the latter approach since I do not believe in what is called globalization. Our Planet Earth is appealing and meaningful through the variety and richness of cultures and identities, through the infinite vocabulary of vernacular and traditional architecture. The Balkan countries and its people share a common history, geography. They enjoy a similar culture, climate behavior, common folklore and traditions, a typical architectural heritage enhanced by local variations. Diverse religions and languages further enrich the shared qualities. A common denominator, a standardization and cooperation between Balkan countries in building, making and urban design efforts as well as in services, education, health care, the environment, logistics, food, goods, agriculture, measurements, accreditation and certification, management and economy, and finally in science and technology in general are therefore imperative.

However, at present, the number of working days calculated is based on the results of Ro (1969) which are more than 40 years old. In addition, in recent years, the work environment has changed a lot because of state-of-the-art construction equipment and extreme weather conditions due to global warming. Therefore, it is necessary to recalculate workable days to estimate critical limits of marine construction. The purpose of this study is to analyze the critical limits of work types for the construction of seawall using daily field work sheets and the meteorological conditions at Sinseondae in Busan, Korea. Also, the measurements of damaged seawall by high waves and one small typhoon were carried out, and days spent on disaster recovery were recorded. Finally, the working hours for each kind of construction equipment at each stage were collected, and the utilization rate of the major equipments was calculated. The results of estimated weather conditions for workable days and non-workable days between September, 2006 and November, 2008 monthly average 26.1 and 4.3 days, respectively (as shown in the worksheet below). Moreover, workable and non-workable days compared with Ro (1969) are estimated to increase 129.1% and decrease 42.2%, respectively. The result clearly shows that workable days have increased by about 30% over the past 40 years. The duration of damaged seawall with reconstruction totals 62 days out of 317 workable days in 2007.

The use of computational and networking resources is thus unavoidable. As the datasets become bigger and the acquisition technology more refined, the biologist is empowered to ask deeper and more complex questions. These, in turn, drive a runoff effect where large research consortia emerge that span beyond organizations and national boundaries. Thus the need for reliable, robust, certified, curated, accessible, secure and timely data processing and management becomes entrenched within, and crucial to, 21(st) century biology. Furthermore, the proliferation of biotechnologies and advances in biological sciences has produced a strong drive for new informatics solutions, both at the basic science and technological levels. The previously unknown situation of dealing with, on one hand, (potentially) exabytes of data, much of which is noisy, has large experimental errors or theoretical uncertainties associated with it, or on the other hand, large quantities of data that require automated computationally intense analysis and processing, have produced important innovations in web and grid technology. In this paper we present a trace of these technological changes in Web and Grid technology, including details of emerging infrastructures, standards, languages and tools, as they apply to bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology. A major focus of this technological review is to collate up-to-date information regarding the design and implementation of various bioinformatics Webs, Grids, Web-based grids or Grid-based webs in terms of their infrastructure, standards, protocols, services, applications and other tools. This review, besides surveying the current state-of-the-art, will also provide a road map for future research and open questions.","[Shah, Azhar A.; Barthel, Daniel; Krasnogor, Natalio] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, ASAP Grp, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Lukasiak, Piotr; Blazewicz, Jacek] Poznan Univ Tech, Inst Comp Sci, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland; [Lukasiak, Piotr; Blazewicz, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Bioorgan Chem, Lab Bioinformat, PL-61704 Poznan, Poland",University of Nottingham; Poznan University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Krasnogor, N (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, ASAP Grp, Jubliee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",Natalio.Krasnogor@Nottingham.ac.uk,"Lukasiak, Piotr/K-9458-2014; Blazewicz, Jacek/L-5597-2014","Blazewicz, Jacek/0000-0001-8326-1094; Lukasiak, Piotr/0000-0003-4012-9135",,,,,116,8,9,0,27,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1574-8936,2212-392X,,CURR BIOINFORM,Curr.

Iran's hot and cold climatic regions are vast, and significant amount of energy is consumed in these areas for heating, cooling, and ventilation. However, with the same climatic conditions in the past, multiple effective strategies had been used in vernacular residences to confront the harsh circumstances. These strategies have a high potential for getting reused and revived in a way that the fossil energy used in contemporary architecture is minimized. Although lots of strategies taken from the past such as wind towers have been reused in most sustainable structures, and most of them have been perfectly studied one by one, but the relationship between these strategies in different levels of the space working together to make a comfortable environment has not been perceived precisely. This paper aims to classify almost all climatic strategies into different levels of space which has been separated based on air temperature difference, such as roof level, wall level, ground and under ground level, and plan strategies together, so that they could be seen all in one pattern in different levels of the space. The final pattern of strategies relationship with true emplacement, as the conclusion of analyzing mentioned levels in three case studies in this paper, could give environment designers more awareness to utilize climatic strategies in more appropriate way in contemporary architecture.

Detailed investigation of five sites on the Holocene floodplain of the Exe River, southwest England, has extended our knowledge of channel change and fluvial sedimentation in this area. New dating from optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) has been combined with previous radiocarbon dates from the Upper and Lower Exe, and the resulting chronology is in approximate agreement with the phases of fluvial change described from southern Britain that appear to relate to Holocene climate shifts. Over the mid-late Holocene, avulsion and reoccupation of former channels have occurred, while in historic time, channel systems have been relatively stable, with some oscillation around channel bars or islands. The recognition of this change in channel behavior in the very late Holocene at a classic site has solved what had been a floodplain paradox-a contradiction between the rates of historical channel lateral migration and archaeology found on, and in, UK floodplains. The reoccupation of former channels allows lateral deposits to be stacked and is part of floodplain aggradation by overbank and bed sedimentation. This has significant implications for the preservation of archaeological material, including artifacts. Mesolithic artifacts have been found on the valley floors within the Exe catchment; their preservation has, to a large extent, been controlled by the style of Late Glacial and Holocene floodplain development.","[Bennett, Jenny A.] Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter EX4 1RJ, Devon, England; [Brown, Antony G.] Univ Southampton PLUS, Palaeoecol Lab, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Brown, Antony G.] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Schwenninger, Jean-Luc] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Rhodes, Edward J.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England",University of Exeter; University of Southampton; University of Oxford; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Bennett, JA (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter EX4 1RJ, Devon, England.",,,,Claude F.

The first is the craft of putting up a roof, the second the typology that results from the crafted roof and the third the memories associated with the typologies. The climate and materials available for roofing in the central part of southern Africa influenced builders in the first instance, which resulted in the particular early typologies of housing. Imported materials opened up other possibilities and craftspeople reacted to that. Later, Postmodernist designers communicated nostalgic identities by referring to the typologies common in the area in an earlier age. The paper investigates the roof as a critical element of shelter in architecture and questions the Modernist axiom that the plan is the generator. It might however not be true in all circumstances and undue focus on the plan is limiting our understanding of the full spectrum of architecture.","[du Preez, J.

We capture this continuing influence, which can collide with the exiting state's intended goal of regaining control over specific issues, with a theoretical framework based on juridification as a socio-legal concept of systems theory in the international legal context. The aim is to explain the endogenous process of legal growth within the IO via bureaucratisation and expert rule, which eventually affects the norms of the wider legal regime where the IO operates. With three case studies of IO exits, we illustrate the continuation of normative structures promoted directly or indirectly by the IO, according to two legal techniques of juridification: third-party interpretation on the one hand, and the extended reach of norms and processes through the work of non-state actors on the other. Overall, widening the theoretical perspective on state exits under systems theory can lead to more complete judgements on the tensions between domestic and supranational systems in the expansion of global normative regimes.","[Kang-Riou, Nicolas; Rossati, David] Univ Salford, Law, Salford, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Kang-Riou, N (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Law, Salford, Lancs, England.",n.kang-riou@salford.ac.uk; d.rossati@salford.ac.uk,"Kang-Riou, Nicolas/AAR-5201-2021","Kang-Riou, Nicolas/0000-0002-8688-2336",,,,,102,0,0,0,3,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1572-3739,1572-3747,,INT ORGAN LAW REV,Int.

Thermal decomposition of zinc stearate and gallium nitrate after hot injection of the precursors in a mixture of organic amines leads to nanocrystals with tunable properties according to gallium amount. Substitutional Ga3+ ions trigger a plasmonic resonance in the infrared region resulting from an increase in the free electrons concentration. These nanocrystals can be deposited by spin coating, drop casting, and spray coating resulting in homogeneous and high-quality thin films. The optical transmission of the Ga-ZnO nanoparticle assemblies in the visible is greater than 90%, and at the same time, the near-infrared absorption of the nanocrystals is maintained in the films as well. Several strategies to improve the films electrical and optical properties have been presented, such as UV treatments to remove the organic compounds responsible for the observed interparticle resistance and reducing atmosphere treatments on both colloidal solutions and thin films to increase the free carriers concentration, enhancing electrical conductivity and infrared absorption. The electrical resistance of the nanoparticle assemblies is about 30 k Omega/sq for the as-deposited, UV-exposed films, and it drops down to 300 Omega/sq after annealing in forming gas at 450 degrees C, comparable with state of the art tin-doped indium oxide coatings deposited from nanocrystal inks.","[Della Gaspera, Enrico; Bersani, Marco; Cittadini, Michela; Guglielmi, Massimo; Martucci, Alessandro] Univ Padua, Dept Ingn Ind, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Pagani, Diego] IRCCS Ctr Ric Ambientali, Fdn Salvatore Maugeri, I-35127 Padua, Italy; [Noriega, Rodrigo] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mehra, Saahil; Salleo, Alberto] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Padua; Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri IRCCS; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Martucci, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Ingn Ind, Via Marzolo 9, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",alex.martucci@unipd.it,"SPIEL, CSIRO/C-2809-2013; Martucci, Alessandro/AAM-6138-2021; Gaspera, Enrico Della/H-3085-2013","Martucci, Alessandro/0000-0001-9601-8640; Gaspera, Enrico Della/0000-0001-9948-5893; bersani, marco/0000-0002-0619-2387; Guglielmi, Massimo/0000-0002-8032-2653",Global Climate energy Project at Stanford University; Center for Advanced Molecular Photovoltaics by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) [KUS-C1-015-21],Global Climate energy Project at Stanford University; Center for Advanced Molecular Photovoltaics by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST),"This work was done in the framework of collaborative research activities of Technical Committee 16 (on Nanostructured Glasses), of the International Commission on Glass (ICG).

Further, it is compatible with Julia's machine learning libraries and allows for the utilization of these methods for dynamical optimization and parameter fitting. The package comes with a number of predefined models for synchronous machines, transmission lines and inverter systems. However, the strict open-source approach and a macro-based user-interface also allows for an easy implementation of custom-built models which makes it especially interesting for the design and testing of new control strategies for distributed generation units.

However, there is little data available on these soils, and understanding of the influence of environmental factors on soil organic matter (SOM) turnover is limited. We extracted 30 cm deep cores from five grassland sites along a small elevation gradient from 2285 to 2653 ma.s.l. in the central Swiss Alps. Our aim was to determine the quantity, allocation, degree of stabilization and mean residence time (MRT) of SOM in relation to site factors such as soil pH, vegetation, and SOM composition. Soil fractions obtained by size and density fractionation revealed a high proportion of labile C in SOM, mostly in the uppermost soil layers. Labile C in the top 20 cm across the gradient ranged from 39.6-57.6% in comparison to 7.2-29.6% reported in previous studies for lower elevation soils (810-1960 ma.s.l.). At the highest elevation, MRTs measured by means of radiocarbon dating and turnover modelling, increased between fractions of growing stability from 90 years in free POM (fPOM) to 534 years in the mineral associated fraction (mOM). Depending on elevation and pH, plant community data suggested considerable variation in the quantity and quality of organic matter input, and these patterns could be reflected in the dynamics of soil C. C-13 NMR data confirmed a relationship of SOM composition to MRT. While low temperature in alpine environments is likely to be a major cause for the slow turnover rate observed, other factors such as residue quality and soil pH, as well as the combination of all factors, play an important role in causing small scale variability of SOM turnover. Failing to incorporate this interplay of controlling factors into models may impair the performance of models to project SOM responses to environmental change.","[Budge, K.; Leifeld, J.; Fuhrer, J.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hiltbrunner, E.] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; University of Basel,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",Swiss National Science Foundation [200021-115891/1],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"We would like to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation, project number 200021-115891/1 for funding the project, which contributes to the NCCR Climate.

They are often based on broad IgE cross-reactivities to pollen panallergens belonging to highly conserved protein families: 1. profilins, 2. polcalcin (calcium-binding proteins in pollen), 3. cyclophilins. They represent highly conserved cross-reactive minor allergens present in all pollen species [1, 2, 3], but also plant foods [1. 3] and other organisms [1. 2. 3]. Despite being rarely clinically relevant they can hamper allergy diagnostic tests with extracts. In this situation molecular allergy diagnosis is able to distinguish broad cross-reactivity due to allergen-specific IgE to pollen panallergens (i.e. profilins Bet v 2 or Phl p 12, polcalcins Bet v 4 or Phl p 7, in the future cyclophilins Bet v 7 or Ole e 15) from primary IgE sensitizations to so-called marker allergens represented by important pollen major allergens: Bet v 1 for the birch and beech family (Fagales), Ole e 1 for olive and ash (Oleaceae), Phl p 1 for temperate climate grasses (Poaceae), Art v 1 for mugwort (Artemisia), Amb a 1 for Ambrosia species (Ambrosia). Five typical cases (A - E) with positive skin prick test results to tree, grass, and weed pollen extracts demonstrate typical patterns of IgE sensitization with a variable impact of pollen panallergens: A - profilins, B - polcalcins, C - profilins and polcalcins, D - presumably cyclophilins, E - primary polysensitization to tree, grass, and weed pollen without interference from profilins or polcalcins.

Catalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been put forward as a viable strategy. While thermocatalytic routes of producing CO, methanol, methane, and higher hydrocarbons from CO2 have been the focus of considerable research efforts, photocatalytic conversion is an emerging approach. Photoactivation of CO2 has potential as a greener process because it could be carried out at lower temperatures and pressures, decreasing the energy consumption. The recent advent of available computational power and tools has made it possible to study the reaction in silico for catalyst prediction and mechanism elucidation. In this Review, we thus focus on ab initio research of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and comparison with experiments. The most commonly used materials are variously doped TiO2, g-C3N4, and perovskites, which have favorable optical properties on their own. Their efficiency is mostly governed by the band gap, charge separation, and charge transfer. Their characteristics can be improved, and the catalysts can be tailored for a specific use by doping, introduction of defects (such as oxygen vacancies or geometric effects), cocatalysts, or using Z-scheme catalysts. Most theoretical studies focus on the calculations of conduction and valence bands, band gap, and adsorption energies. Some studies try to describe the reaction mechanism. Few studies go beyond the hybrid-functional DFT approach and try to explicitly model the effect of electron excitation. While a theoretical description of the excited states is possible with post-DFT methods, it has yet to be applied to the problem of CO2 photoreduction on a larger scale. We conclude the Review with an outlook on how the current state-of-the-art can be used for improving the existing catalysts.","[Kovacic, Zan; Likozar, Blaz; Hus, Matej] Natl Inst Chem, Dept Chem React Engn, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Hus, Matej] Assoc Tech Culture Slovenia ZOTKS, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",National Institute of Chemistry - Slovenia,"Likozar, B; Hus, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Chem, Dept Chem React Engn, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia.;Hus, M (corresponding author), Assoc Tech Culture Slovenia ZOTKS, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",blaz.likozar@ki.si; matej.hus@ki.si,,,"Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0152, N2-0135, I0-0039]; European Commission [814416]",Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors would like to thank the Slovenian Research Agency fur funding (Core Grant P2-0152 and Grant N2-0135).

It is the evidence of 1,000 years of past generation evolution, to adapt our living condition to environment. Cultural heritage can be intangible (e.g. tradition, custom) and tangible, the latter including various physical objects, from historic landscapes and human transformed landscapes to sacred sites, archaeological sites, monumental sculpture, monumental painting, architecture and town planning. The above sites and remains are clearly not in equilibrium with environment. They are continuously impacted and weathered by several internal and external factors, both natural and human, with rapid and slow onset. Natural hazards are a clear example of such factors as well as long term weathering decay of rocks, until the effect of climate change, without disregarding the role of men, especially in war areas. In this context, an essential role on conservation and management of cultural properties has been identified by engineering geology and earth science in general. This approach was not very evident in the past, and now more attention to the integration of different sciences is demanded. Indeed, it is possible to affirm that the protection of the cultural heritage represents an interdisciplinary process (and not multi-disciplinary) at the border-line among art, history, science, policies for management and exploitation. In recent decades, many significant sites of cultural heritage have suffered damage, occasionally irreversible, from natural processes.

Motivated by the slow deployment of large-scale underground storage of CO2 or simply the availability of large amounts of suitable minerals, progress on mineral sequestration is being steadily made and reported by an increasing number of research teams and projects worldwide. Other well-documented advantages of the method are that it offers leakage-free CO2 fixation that does not require post-storage monitoring and an overwhelmingly large capacity is offered by mineral resources available worldwide, besides the feature that the chemical conversion releases significant amounts of heat. As recognized more recently, it also offers the possibility to operate with a CO2-containing gas directly, removing the expensive CO2 separation step from the CCS process chain. Moreover, the solid products can be used in applications ranging from land reclamation to iron- and steelmaking. With the technology overview given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on CCS (2005) as a reference point, the method is reviewed and its capacity, weaknesses, and strengths are re-assessed. The state-of-the-art after twenty years of R&D work as reflected by ongoing development work inside and outside laboratories is summarized, illustrating the future prospects of CO2 mineralization within a portfolio of CCS technologies under development worldwide.

Those limitations motivated the development of an automated spectral unmixing approach based on, a comprehensive analysis of vegetation and soil spectral variability resulting from biogeophysical variation in arid and semiarid regions. A field spectroscopic database of bare soils, green canopies, and litter canopies was compiled for 17 arid and semiarid sites in North and South America, representing a wide array of plant growth forms and species, vegetation conditions, and soil mineralogical-hydrological properties. Spectral reflectance of dominant cover types (green vegetation, litter, and bare soil) varied widely within and between sites, but the reflectance derivatives in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR2: 2,100-2,400 nm) were similar within and separable between each cover type. Using this result, art automated SWIR2 spectral unmixing algorithm was developed that includes a Monte Carlo approach for estimating errors in derived subpixel cover fractions resulting from endmember variability. The algorithm was applied to SWIR2 spectral data collected by the Airborne Visible and infrared Imaging Spectrometer instrument over the Sevilleta and Jornada Long-Term Ecological Re-search sites. Subsequent comparisons to field data and geographical information system (GIS) maps were deemed successful. The SWIR2 region of the reflected solar spectrum provides a robust means to estimate the extent of bare soil and vegetation covers in arid and semiarid regions. The computationally efficient method developed here could be extended globally using SWIR2 spectrometer data to be collected from platforms such as the NASA Earth Observing-1 satellite.

The charm and beauty of coral reefs attract tourists, and they play a vital role in preserving biodiversity, ceasing coastal erosion, and promoting business trade. However, they are declining because of over-exploitation, damaging fishery, marine pollution, and global climate changes. Also, coral reefs help treat human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), heart disease, and coastal erosion. The corals of Australia's great barrier reef have started bleaching due to the ocean acidification, and global warming, which is an alarming threat to the earth's ecosystem. Many techniques have been developed to address such issues. However, each method has a limitation due to the low resolution of images, diverse weather conditions, etc. In this paper, we propose a bag of features (BoF) based approach that can detect and localize the bleached corals before the safety measures are applied. The dataset contains images of bleached and unbleached corals, and various kernels are used to support the vector machine so that extracted features can be classified. The accuracy of handcrafted descriptors and deep convolutional neural networks is analyzed and provided in detail with comparison to the current method. Various handcrafted descriptors like local binary pattern, a histogram of an oriented gradient, locally encoded transform feature histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and completed joint scale local binary pattern are used for feature extraction. Specific deep convolutional neural networks such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception v3, and CoralNet are being used for feature extraction. From experimental analysis and results, the proposed technique outperforms in comparison to the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed technique achieves 99.08% accuracy with a classification error of 0.92%.

Many factors influence crop yield, such as soil, amount of water, climate, and genotype. Determining factors that significantly influence yield prediction and identify the most appropriate predictive methods are important in yield management. It is critical to consider and study the combination of different crop factors and their impact on the yield. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to use advanced data analytic techniques to precisely predict the soybean crop yields, (2) to identify the most influential features that impact soybean predictions, (3) to illustrate the ability of Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) sub-systems, which are self-organizing, self-learning, and data-driven, by using the recently developed Autonomous Learning Multiple-Model First-order (ALMMo-1) system, and (4) to compare the performance with other well-known methods. The ALMMo-1 system is a transparent model, which stakeholders can easily read and interpret. The model is a data-driven and composed of prototypes selected from the actual data. Many factors affect the yield, and data clouds can be formed in the feature/ data space based on the data density. The data cloud is the key to the IF part of FRB sub-systems, while the THEN part (the consequences of the IF condition) illustrates the yield prediction in the form of a linear regression model, which consists of the yield features or factors. In addition, the model can determine the most influential features of the yield prediction online. The model shows an excellent prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0883, and Non-Dimensional Error Index (NDEI) of 0.0611, which is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.","[Alghamdi, Mona] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Comp Sci, Jubail Ind City, Saudi Arabia; [Angelov, Plamen; Rufino, Mariana] Univ Lancaster, Comp & Commun, Lancaster, England; [Gimenez, Raul; Soares, Eduardo] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England",Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University; Lancaster University; Lancaster University,"Alghamdi, M (corresponding author), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Comp Sci, Jubail Ind City, Saudi Arabia.",msmalghamdi@iau.edu.sa; p.algelov@lancaster.ac.uk; gimenezgea@gmail.com; m.rufino1@lancaster.ac.uk; e.almeidasoares@lancaster.ac.uk,"Soares, Eduardo/AAU-8358-2020; Angelov, Plamen/AAE-8284-2019; Rufino, Mariana/D-8380-2013","Soares, Eduardo/0000-0002-2634-8270; Angelov, Plamen/0000-0002-5770-934X; Rufino, Mariana/0000-0003-4293-3290",,,,,26,3,3,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-2946-4,,,,2019,,,,,441,446,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BO7YE,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000526061400065,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, for large area applications, the high cost and delicate manufacturing processes are the major challenges faced by the prior-art technologies. This paper reports a development of cost effective PC coatings with effective reduction of visible light transmission and total energy transmittance at tinted states. The coating material was prepared by embedding organic PC dyes, 1,2-b Naphthopyran, in sol-gel based organic-inorganic mesoporous coating matrix. The degree of crosslinking of coating matrix and types of organic groups can effectively influence the visible light transmittance and bleaching speed. Visible light transmission reduction at tinted state can be tuned from 30% to 60% by varying the dye concentration in coating and coating thickness. The thermal properties of the PC coatings are evaluated by UV-Vis-NIR and FTIR measurements and further calculation to obtain solar heat gain coefficient (G value) and thermal transmittance (U value). For a glass in thickness of 3 mm coated with a PC layer in thickness of 12 pm, the G value at tinted state was reduced to 0.78 as compared with a G value of 0.87 for an uncoated glass. A double glazed smart window prototype consisting of a commercial low-E glass and a PC coated glass showed G value of 026, and U value of 1.58 as compared to the G value of 0.87 and U value of 5.2 of a single uncoated glass. This demonstrates a significant reduction of energy transmittance through the smart window resulting in high potential energy saving for end users especially in tropical climate.

Effective preconditioning of the linear operators inherent in the semi-implicit models lies at the heart of the state-of-the-art multiscale-flow simulation. This is especially evident in simulations of global weather and climate-posed on a thin spherical shell-where some form of direct tridiagonal inversion of the operator in the vertical is crucial to relax the often enormous stiffness of the problem. The documented preconditioners stem from the Richardson's (1910) idea of augmenting an elliptic BVP with a transient diffusion equation. Exploiting this idea for mixed explicit-implicit pseudo-time-stepping schemes leads to a broad suite of stationary-iteration solvers, including the many classical algorithms. Here, the high-performance all-scale EULAG model (Smolarkiewicz et al. (2014) [58]), with a flexible three-dimensional decomposition of MPI tasks, is furnished with the preconditioners akin to the classical alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) algorithms, generalized to optional permutations of parallel tridiagonal inversions. The utility of various options is found to be problem dependent, in terms of computational accuracy as well as efficiency. The main thrust of the work is on the long-range forecasts using large anisotropic grids. The relative efficiency and/or accuracy gains attainable with the developed preconditioners are illustrated for idealized scenarios representative of atmospheric flows from planetary to a single-cloud and laboratory scales. The key insight that best encapsulates the significance and novelty of the present work is that there is no single super-preconditioner  that will perform best in all cases, yet the suite as a whole offers substantial gains in the model performance.

The active involvement of microbes in these processes is commonly underestimated in the literature due to general oligotrophic conditions in caves, except in particular cave conditions, such as sulfidic caves and moonmilk deposits, where the presence of microbes likely plays a key role in mineral deposition. Here, we study the possible involvement of microbes from Postojna Cave, Slovenia, in carbonate dissolution (litholysis) and precipitation (lithogenesis). Microbes were sampled from small pools below hydrologically diverse drip sites and incubated on polished limestone tablets at 10 and 20 degrees C for 2 and 14 weeks under cave-analogue conditions. The tablets were then observed under scanning electron microscope to investigate microbe-rock interactions. Our experiments showed the presence of various microbial morphotypes, often associated with extracellular polymeric substances, firmly attached on the surfaces. Unfortunately, our surface sterilization method using 96% and 70% ethanol could not establish the complete aseptic conditions in deep natural cracks in the experimental limestone tablets. Nonetheless, our results emulate the interaction of environmental microbes with limestone rock. Conspicuous calcite dissolution and precipitation were observed in association with these microbes. Furthermore, we show evidence of entombment of microbes in a Si-rich precipitate during nutrient-depleted growth conditions and we suggest that microbial involvement in silica mobilization under ambient conditions may be a widespread and often overlooked phenomenon. Our findings have important implications for microbial-mediation of cave carbonate dissolution and precipitation, including the preservation of past climate proxy signals in speleothems and prehistoric cave art. Improvements to the methodology and further work are suggested to enable more robust ex-situ cultivation experiments in the future, facilitating better and more detailed research into this topic.","[Johnston, Vanessa E.; Martin-Perez, Andrea] Slovenian Acad Sci & Arts, Ivan Rakovec Inst Palaeontol, Res Ctr, Novi Trg 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Johnston, Vanessa E.; Skok, Sara; Mulec, Janez] Slovenian Acad Sci & Arts, Res Ctr, Karst Res Inst, Titov Trg 2, Postojna 6230, Slovenia; [Mulec, Janez] Univ Nova Gorica, UNESCO Chair Karst Educ, Glavni Trg 8, Vipava 5271, Slovenia","Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Karst Research Institute, SASA; University of Nova Gorica","Johnston, VE (corresponding author), Slovenian Acad Sci & Arts, Ivan Rakovec Inst Palaeontol, Res Ctr, Novi Trg 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.;Johnston, VE (corresponding author), Slovenian Acad Sci & Arts, Res Ctr, Karst Res Inst, Titov Trg 2, Postojna 6230, Slovenia.",vanessa.johnston@zrc-sazu.si,,,,,,,60,3,3,0,6,SOCIETA SPELEOLOGICA ITALIANA,BOLOGNA,"VIA ZAMBONI 67, BOLOGNA, 40126, ITALY",0392-6672,1827-806X,,INT J SPELEOL,Int.

Such a transition also comes with the prospect of smart vehicles and shared transportation schemes. An electric vehicle relies solely on stored electric energy to propel the vehicle and maintain comfortable driving conditions. This dependence signifies the need for good energy management predicated on optimization of the design and operation of the vehicle's energy system, namely energy storage and consumption systems. Through the analysis of the relevant literature this paper aims to provide a comprehensive discussion that covers the energy management of the whole electric vehicle in terms of the main storage/consumption systems. It describes the various energy storage systems utilized in electric vehicles with more elaborate details on Li-ion batteries. It then, focuses on the detailed analysis of the prevalent intercalation batteries but also offers a limited discussion on new-generation batteries and their development path. Furthermore, it discusses electric vehicle energy consumption and points out the major energy consumption systems within a typical electric vehicle. It first unpacks the cabin cooling system in terms of its types and energy consumption. Then it proceeds to unpacks the battery thermal management system and classifies it according to working fluid, thermal cycle and power consumption. It discusses as well the widely adopted cooling systems in terms of advantages, disadvantages and describes related studies. Finally, it puts together the relevant state-of-the-art numerical models with special attention focused on equivalent circuit models and discusses associated simulation resources and software packages. It also presents an illustrative case-study to elaborate on the thermal modeling and simulation of Li-ion batteries using the equivalent circuit model.","[Ibrahim, Amier; Jiang, Fangming] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Energy Convers, CAS Key Lab Renewable Energy, Lab Adv Energy Syst,Guangdong Key Lab New & Renew, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ibrahim, Amier] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Jiang, FM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Energy Convers, CAS Key Lab Renewable Energy, Lab Adv Energy Syst,Guangdong Key Lab New & Renew, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fm_jiang2000@yahoo.com,,"Ibrahim, Amier/0000-0002-6738-3785","China National Key RD Project [2018YFB0905300, 2018YFB0905303]; Guangdong Science and Technology Department [2017B010120003, 2015A030308019, 2016A030313172]; Guangzhou Scientific and Technological Development Plan [201804020020]",China National Key RD Project; Guangdong Science and Technology Department; Guangzhou Scientific and Technological Development Plan,"Financial support received from the China National Key R&D Project (2018YFB0905300, 2018YFB0905303), the Guangdong Science and Technology Department (2017B010120003, 2015A030308019, 2016A030313172), and the Guangzhou Scientific and Technological Development Plan (201804020020) is gratefully acknowledged.",,275,16,16,18,87,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

The potential deleterious effects on fertility are a significant worry of women and trans gender men, and the rising trend in delaying childbearing and the higher proportion of patients who have not completed their family at the time of diagnosis increases the demand for an optimised fertility-preservation service. Fertility preservation for this group following a diagnosis of cancer is a rapidly expanding area of reproductive medicine, although provision for such treatment often varies by region. In the past, there were few treatment options, but with dramatic improvements in oocyte cryopreservation and, more recently, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, this area of fertility care has broadened substantially. This review will be exploring areas that apply to all cisgender women, but not necessarily all trans men and non-binary individuals. There are specific considerations in fertility preservation for trans people, which are beyond the scope of this paper. All individuals with female reproductive organs should be offered the opportunity to discuss fertility preservation prior to starting potential gonadotoxic treatment. Failure to do this may negatively influence their anticancer treatment choices and adherence to treatment regimens. There are currently few networks streamlined around offering this service and as demand for these treatment options increases, it is recognised that these complex patients require specialist management within recognised care pathways. Here we are looking to describe some of the unique challenges associated with providing a state-of-the-art service, particularly in a financially unpredictable climate in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Around 3,000 MW of coal fired power plants are planned by the government, but the proposal was put on hold due to the resistance of local communities and civil society groups. Besides this, coal fired power plants are not only large CO2 emitters, thus intensifying the on-going climate change processes, but also require lengthy environmental impact assessments, and their technology costs remain stagnant at comparable high levels. Solar and wind energy can be produced at far lower costs than coal, however, their shares on the renewable energy mix are comparable small in Thailand, but with a steady increase. A disadvantage of solar and wind energy production is that the production is not constant due to day/night and weather, respectively. These disadvantages can be compensated by adding geothermal energy, as this energy from deeper geological sources is continuously reaching the Earth's surface. This allows the continuous feed to geothermal power plants which by this can act as a backbone of a renewable energy mix. In Southern Thailand hot springs from the north to the south are the surface expressions of active geothermal systems at depth. Surface exit temperatures can reach up to 80 degree Celsius, thus considered as low enthalpy resources, which can be utilized applying state-of-the-art binary power plant technology. In the current renewable power plan of the government geothermal energy is not considered due to the low availability of this resource. However, recent research has shown that Southern Thailand holds promising quantities of geothermal resources; with further scientific investigations needed. Finally, the only current geothermal power plant in Thailand located in Fang, Northern Thailand, is situated close to a national park in a beautiful landscape and environment, thus acting as a positive example for Southern Thailand.","[Duerrast, Helmut] Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Phys, Geophys Res Ctr, Fac Sci, Hat Yai 90112, Thailand",Prince of Songkla University,"Duerrast, H (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Phys, Geophys Res Ctr, Fac Sci, Hat Yai 90112, Thailand.",helmut.j@psu.ac.th,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

The knowledge accumulated by explaining observed failures in the practice of construction slowly formed a basis for moving toward a predictive capability and to an integration of modeling and testing. Furthermore, we have learned that interactions between energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and moisture management are so critical that the three issues must be considered simultaneously. Effectively, a change in the low energy is needed to ensure durability of materials and cost considerations for these buildings. At this stage, one could observe a clear change in the mind-set of the scientific community. Forty years after construction of the first 10 passive homes, we made a shocking observation-an adequate technology has been developed, but our lack of vision prevents effective use of this technology. Again, we need to modify our vision and change the design paradigm to balance comfort, building durability, and cost-effectiveness. If the quest for sustainable buildings is our ultimate objective, then we should learn more from the surrounding nature; termites appear to master the art of hygrothermal control better than humans because they can optimize transient conditions to maintain a stable interior comfort zone. Thus, in the article to follow a new compact building envelope design package is proposed, applicable to different climates with specific modifications of critical hygrothermal material properties. This approach is called the Environmental Quality Management. This will be the second step for a building science (physics) needed to become a leading force in the transition to sustainable built environments.","[Yarbrough, David W.] Tennessee Technol Univ, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Yarbrough, David W.] R&D Serv Inc, Cookeville, TN USA; [Bomberg, Mark] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Romanska-Zapala, Anna] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Krakow, Poland",Tennessee Technological University; McMaster University; Cracow University of Technology,"Bomberg, M (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, C-O 2022 Deerhurst Crt, Ottawa, ON K1J8H1, Canada.",mark.bomberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,13,13,2,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1744-2591,1744-2583,,J BUILD PHYS,J.

The article ended with the teachers' unsatisfactory effort to characterise the features of a distinctively modern waltz style in response to a widespread discourse to recover and adapt the dance for the contemporary English ballroom. Part Two investigates the role of club and national competitions and exhibition dancers in changing and stabilising a waltz form and style that integrated preferred aspects of both old and new techniques, as advocated by leading waltz advocate and judge, Philip Richardson. This article brings into critical focus not only choreographic contributions by Victor Silvester and Josephine Bradley but also those of models such as Maurice Mouvet, G. K. Anderson, Georges Fontana, and Marjorie Moss whose direct influence in England outweighed that of the more famous American couple Irene and Vernon Castle. The dance backgrounds, training and inter-connections of these individuals are examined in identifying choreological and aesthetic continuities that relate to prevalent and inter-related notions of style, Englishness, art and modernity as expressed through the dancing. Taken as a whole, the two parts provide a case study of innovative shifts in popular dancing and meaning that are led through imitation and improvisation by practitioners principally from the middle class. The study also contributes to dance scholarship on cultural appropriation through concentrating on an unusual example of competition in dance being used to promote simplicity rather than virtuosity. In conclusion, greater understanding of creativity and transmission in popular social dancing may arise from identifying and interrogating the practice of agents of change and their relationships within and across their choreographic and socio-cultural contexts.","[Buckland, Theresa Jill] Univ Roehampton, London, England",Roehampton University,"Buckland, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Roehampton, London, England.",,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,6,EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS,EDINBURGH,"THE TUN-HOLYROOD RD, 12 2F JACKSONS ENTRY, EDINBURGH EH8 8PJ, SCOTLAND",0264-2875,1750-0095,,DANCE RES,Dance Res.,NOV,2018,2,,,,138,172,,10.3366/drs.2018.0236,http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/drs.2018.0236,,,35,Dance,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Dance,GZ6BK,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000449517000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

A xerophyte, which is adapted to survive and thrive in very harsh desert environments, it is a major boon for impoverished people subsisting in those environments as it provides them with badly needed shelter, reduces erosion, improves micrometeorology, and is a source of food, feed, fuel, medicines and cosmetics. Attempts made during the 19th and 20th centuries to exploit these virtues of P. juliflora has led to its introduction in many regions which had less harsh climate and better availability of soil and water than existed in the native habitat of P. juliflora. The relatively more favorable conditions resulted in P. juliflora growing and spreading much faster than it could be utilized. Soon it became a serious weed in all exotic regions where it was introduced, growing so explosively that it even enters roads and homes, driving humans out of their dwellings. The resulting damage to biodiversity is enormous. The present paper highlights the dual role of P. juliflora and itemizes the facets that make it a blessing in some contexts and a bane in other contexts. Beginning with a review of the special attributes which give invasive plants competitive advantage, the paper briefly recapitulates the systematics, origin, and spread of P. juliflora. It then dwells upon the morphology and other attributes of P. juliflora which have enabled it to invade and colonize so much of the world's landmass so rapidly. Detailed state-of-the-art is then presented on the beneficial and harmful impacts of P. juliflora. The paper concludes with a summary of assessments that have balanced the costs of destroying P. juliflora stands or utilizing them, with the possible benefits of either.","[Patnaik, Pratiksha; Abbasi, Tasneem; Abbasi, S.

At the same time, the efficient consumption of energy is vital for avoiding the impacts from increasing fuel prices. A significant part of this challenge may be dealt with in the way space heating, space cooling, and domestic hot water production which is provided to residential and commercial buildings. Air source heat pumps (ASHP) are widely used conversion technologies for providing building thermal energy services; cooling, heating, and water heating. ASHP does not have a constant temperature for the primary source like: soil, ground water, or surface water heat pumps. In result, laboratoty experiments and tests are faced by the problem of having to handle a wide range of conditions under which the evaporator is operated. In order to cover various climate conditions, petfornzance and behavior must be tested for temperatures ranging from -30 degrees C to 40 degrees C and for various humidit), levels. This paper presents a state of-art experimental stand, named controlled lab environment (CLE or climatic box), for testing ASHP under controlled evaporator ambient conditions. A main purpose of the CLE is to test and verify the performance and behavior of a theoretical model of the ASHP as a basis for optimization and efficiency improvements. Together with thermal storage technologies and intelligent control system this technology may come to play a key role in the development of Smart Buildings in future energy systems. While experimental results are not yet available the paper presents the design considerations and schematics of the CLE.

These areas also deliver important ecosystem services and are central to tourism, amenity, and leisure in many countries. However, they are also major sources of pollution of waterways and of greenhouse gas emissions. In this review, we focus on how the genetic improvement of some of the major crop species of temperate grasslands can contribute to reduced environmental impacts and climate change mitigation including the enhancement of carbon sequestration. The main species considered are the ryegrasses and fescues and the clovers. With regard to diffuse pollution of waterways, increasing the efficiency with which the plant utilizes nitrogen and phosphorus has significant potential to reduce the amounts available for leaching and overland flow. This also allows reduced fertilizer use, in itself representing a significant saving of greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in the composition of the plant diet have the potential to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use in the rumen and reduce the amount of methane produced by enteric fermentation. Carbon sequestration in temperate grasslands may potentially be enhanced by understanding and altering root architecture and turn over and also litter composition. The role of forage breeding in improving soil quality and flood defense is also considered and wider aspects of the role of persistent perennial species discussed. To fully realize the potential of genetic improvement, breeding programs need to incorporate state-of-the-art genomics and also to be guided by modeling studies.

This is reflected within the EU 2030 agenda, that envisions a future where there is universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. One of the challenges to achieve this vision lies on the low reliability of certain renewable sources. While both particulars and public entities try to reach self-sufficiency through sustainable energy generation, it is unclear how much investment is needed to mitigate the unreliability introduced by natural factors such as varying wind speed and daylight across the year. In this sense, a tool that aids predicting the energy output of sustainable sources across the year for a particular location can aid greatly in making sustainable energy investments more efficient. In this paper, we make use of Open Data sources, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and installations distributed across Europe to create such tool through the application of Artificial Neural Networks. We analyze how the different factors affect the prediction of energy production and how Open Data can be used to predict the expected output of sustainable sources. As a result, we facilitate users the necessary information to decide how much they wish to invest according to the desired energy output for their particular location. Compared to state-of-the-art proposals, our solution provides an abstraction layer focused on energy production, rather that radiation data, and can be trained and tailored for different locations using Open Data. Finally, our tests show that our proposal improves the accuracy of the forecasting, obtaining a lower mean squared error (MSE) of 0.040 compared to an MSE 0.055 from other proposals in the literature.","[Manuel Barrera, Jose; Reina, Alejandro; Mate, Alejandro; Carlos Trujillo, Juan] Univ Alicante, Dept Software & Comp Syst, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Manuel Barrera, Jose; Reina, Alejandro; Mate, Alejandro; Carlos Trujillo, Juan] Lucentia Lab, C Pintor Perez Gil N-16, Alicante 03540, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Barrera, JM (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Software & Comp Syst, Alicante 03690, Spain.;Barrera, JM (corresponding author), Lucentia Lab, C Pintor Perez Gil N-16, Alicante 03540, Spain.",jm.barrera@ua.es; alejandro.reina@ua.es; amate@dlsi.ua.es; jtrujillo@dlsi.ua.es,"Maté, Alejandro/H-5963-2015; Maté, Alejandro/AAG-7809-2021","Maté, Alejandro/0000-0001-7770-3693; Maté, Alejandro/0000-0001-7770-3693; Trujillo, Juan/0000-0003-0139-6724; Reina Reina, Alejandro/0000-0001-9949-2735; Barrera Arroyo, Jose M./0000-0002-3359-2685","ECLIPSE-UA project from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities [RTI2018-094283-B-C32]; University of Alicante [I-PI 98/18, I-PI 13/20]; Lucentia Lab Spin-off Company","ECLIPSE-UA project from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities; University of Alicante; Lucentia Lab Spin-off Company","This paper has been co-funded by the ECLIPSE-UA (RTI2018-094283-B-C32) project from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities; both Jose M.

Traditionally, life cycle analysis (LCA) approaches are key tools used to assess impacts through product life cycles, but they present limitations regarding the accounting of multiple ecosystem service-related issues, at both the land-use and supply chain levels. Based on a systematic review of empirical articles, this study provides insights on using LCA assessments to account for ecosystem service-related impacts in the context of bioeconomy activities. We address the following research questions: what is the state of the art of the literature performing LCA assessments of forest-based bioeconomy activities, including the temporal distribution, the geographic areas and products/processes at study, and the approaches and methods used? 2. Which impacts and related midpoints are considered by the reviewed studies and what types of ecosystem service- related information do they bear? Out of over 600 articles found through the Scopus search, 155 were deemed relevant for the review. The literature focuses on North-America and Europe. Most of the articles assessed the environmental impact of lower-value biomass uses. Climate change was assessed in over 90% of the studies, while issues related to ozone, eutrophication, human toxicity, resource depletion, acidification, and environmental toxicity were assessed in 40% to 60% of the studies. While the impact categories accounted for in the reviewed LCA studies bear information relevant to certain provisioning and regulating services, several ecosystem services (especially cultural ones) remain unaccounted for. The implications of our study are relevant for professionals working in the ecosystem services, circular bioeconomy, and/or LCA communities. (C) 2019 The Authors.

These travelers wrote their impressions on diaries which present details of these places, as well as of ways of life peculiar to Brazilian people by this time. Maria Graham, Robert Burford, Saint-Hilaire, Spix, and Martius were some of these European travelers who contributed significantly to register aspects of Brazilian urban landscapes, people's behavior and habit from that time. A great part of these travelers was in Brazil in the early half of the 19th century, when the Brazilian city started a process of 're-europeanization' under French and English influence. Notwithstanding their trying to be impartial, there are lots of comparisons throughout their texts between the new and the old continent - which corresponded to their repertoire of images and remembrances. To these travelers, Brazilian houses and gardens were not conceived with Art as it happened in Europe; streets were not paved and did not present a reasonable illumination system; climate was warm and landscape always picturesque. Seen from far away the Brazilian city seemed enchanting to the European eye mainly for being surrounded by nature; however, from its streets, it was heavily criticized for its urban and building aspects. In spite of this, it would ever catch the attention of European people always interested in picturesque, and exotic views, and in everything that was different from the place they came from. We aim here to characterize four Brazilian cities - Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo - in the way they are described and analysed in traveler's writings from the 19th century, emphasizing their critical point of view concerning the urban space.","[de Aragao, Solange] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"de Aragao, S (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",solangedearagao@hotmail.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,UNIV FEDERAL RORAIMA,BOA VISTA,"CAMPUS DO PARICARANA, AVENIDA CAPITAO ENE GARCEZ 2413, BOA VISTA, RR 69304-000, BRAZIL",1980-5772,2177-4307,,REV ACTA GEOGR,Rev.

Very small gas turbines (ie. less than 10 kW) have been investigated periodically over the years, mainly for potential military use, but to date have not found a niche. This could well change with over 20 states now having instigated idling regulations that limit or prohibit heavy duty truck diesel engine idling. With emphasis on reducing emissions and noise levels this essentially implies that in the future a small APU will be required to provide the truck's stationary electrical needs and cabin climate control. While there will be several power source types vying for this potentially large market, a small gas turbine APU is viewed as having attractive features which include low emissions, low acoustic signature, vibration-free operation, compact and light weight package, obviates the need for oil lubrication and liquid coolant systems, ease of cold weather starting, immediate response, and the use of fuel from the truck tank. In this paper a small recuperated gas turbine APU concept rated at 5kW is discussed including component design considerations, layout features, engine performance, and target cost. The conservative design of the APU is based on the use of existing materials and state-of-the-art gas turbine technology, and is amenable to high volume automated manufacturing processes. A competitive cost is projected if the proposed APU of modular construction was fabricated in large quantities like the production of vehicular turbochargers in Europe.","[Rodgers, Colin] ITC, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",,"Rodgers, C (corresponding author), ITC, 3010 N Arroyo Dr, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,3,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4792-3,,,,2007,,,,,383,391,,,,,,9,"Engineering, Mechanical; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Transportation,BHF83,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000252771900039,View Full Record in Web of Science

The federal government considers the use of nuclear power,economically unreasonable irrespective of the fact that nuclear power makes important contributions to the protection of the climate and, above all, to safe, cost-efficient, and non-polluting supplies of power. Opting out of the use of nuclear power raises the question of the consequences this step has for the power economy and the economy as a whole. Giving up nuclear power in electricity generation would affect the objectives of a safe, economic, and non-polluting energy supply. In view of the outstanding importance of energy supply to the whole economy, the - constitutional question arises whether opting out of the use of nuclear power not only jeopardizes the supply of energy, but may result even in a disruption of the balance of the entire economy in the sense of Art. 109, Para.2 of the German Basic Law, under which the federation and the federal states are obliged to bear in mind the requirements of a balanced overall economy. In a differentiated interpretation of Article 109, Para.2 of the Basic Law, the government is required, also outside of budget management aspects, to refrain from measures upsetting the balance of the entire economy. Inter alia, this could have the consequence of not opting out of the peaceful use of nuclear power. It is up to the competent government agencies to decide on measures to control this development. For this purpose, a number of variants are available which may range between stretching out the period of time of the opt-out procedure and giving up this opt-out altogether.","Kanzlei FPS FRITZE PAUL SCHMITT, D-99084 Erfurt, Germany",,"Lippert, M (corresponding author), Kanzlei FPS FRITZE PAUL SCHMITT, Hirschlachufer 7, D-99084 Erfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH,DUSSELDORF,"POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY",1431-5254,,,ATW-INT Z KERNENERG,ATW-Int.

An exceptionally large variation of environmental conditions characterises the Mediterranean countries, where the environment can limit forest growth and succession but can also give rise, more often than it is supposed, to lush, mesic forest ecosystems, similar to those of central Europe. Moreover, Mediterranean forests contain an ample, plant and animal biological diversity, exemplified by the large number of tree species as compared to Nordic forests, and by their relatively high genetic variability due to the survival of many conifer and broadleaf species in southern European refuges, during the glacial periods. Another peculiar aspect of this region is the long-lasting manipulation of trees, forests and landscapes, since ancient times, with the diffusion all over the Mediterranean basin of such species as Pinus pinea, Cupressus sempervirens, Castanea sativa, and Quercus suber. The harsh and unpredictable climate, the difficult socio-economic conditions and the history of over-exploitation of the Mediterranean forests require that a scientifically sound conservation strategy and a locally-tailored sustainable management should be implemented. In particular, the need for identifying those silvicultural and management strategies appropriate for southern European forests should be stressed. Obviously, this consideration will have important effects on the definition of criteria for sustainability and eco-certification, Also, social issues should be considered key factors for effective forest conservation in the Mediterranean region, otherwise it will be impossible to control forest fires and landscape degradation. Based on these considerations a number of research priorities are discussed, with special consideration to possible impacts that global change may have on Mediterranean forest ecosystems.

The next stage of transitions will lead to a shift from large-scale, centralized systems to networks of small-sized, distributed electricity systems, which require distributed or decentralized ledgers for database management for efficient transactions. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) are a form of decentralized ledgers where the transactions (energy, information, and money) among various entities are maintained. One such DLT is blockchain technology which offers several advantages. Data recorded in blockchains are difficult to tamper with; have privacy protection; facilitate fast, accurate, and real-time settlement of financial transactions. Contemporary research has started focusing on their possible applications in energy systems. State-of-the-art suggests that while business and market aspects have been extensively discussed, the electrical constraints and implementation methodologies have not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, all the reviewed projects have implemented only peer-to-peer transactions that are not scalable. To incorporate the new entities like prosumers, inter-microgrid transactions, and interactions with the legacy power grid, new structural and operational frameworks are necessary. The proposed research explores the possibility of developing blockchain enabled smart microgrids (BSMG) with the above frameworks. It aims to build a conceptual framework of BSMG, including the transaction protocols and process flows. It proposes the inclusion of network constraints in a threelevel transaction setup executed over a four-layered architecture. Another practical challenge is that BSMGs may be set up on different blockchain platforms. Hence, this paper also proposes implementing Inter-Blockchain Protocol for the first time to include interoperability and communication between different platforms. Finally, the performance metrics that will be used to validate the BSMGs are outlined.","[Dinesha, Disha L.; Balachandra, P.] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Management Studies, Bengaluru 560012, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Dinesha, DL; Balachandra, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Dept Management Studies, Bengaluru 560012, Karnataka, India.",dishad@iisc.ac.in; patilb@iisc.ac.in,"Patil, Balachandra/AGF-4602-2022","Patil, Balachandra/0000-0002-5218-2112; L Dinesha, Disha/0000-0003-2813-6148",,,,,99,1,1,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

There are many approaches to, and rationales for, catchment classification, with those focused on streamflow often seeking to relate a particular response characteristic to a physical property or climatic driver. Rationales include such topics as prediction in ungauged basins (PUB), and providing guidance for model selection in poorly understood hydrological systems. The annual daily hydrograph (ADH) is a first-order easily visualized integrated expression of catchment function, and over many years the average ADH is a distinct hydrological signature that differentiate catchments from each other. In this study, we use t-SNE, a state-of-the-art technique of dimensionality reduction, to classify 17 110 ADHs for 304 reference catchments in mountainous Western North America. t-SNE is chosen over other conventional methods of dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) as it presents greater separability of ADHs, which are projected on a 2D map where the similarities are evaluated according to their map distance. We then utilize a Deep Learning encoder to upgrade the non-parametric t-SNE to a parametric approach, enhancing its capability to address 'unseen' samples. Results showed that t-SNE successfully clustered ADHs of similar flow regimes on the 2D map and allowed more accurate classification with KNN. In addition, many compact clusters on the 2D map in the coastal Pacific Northwest suggest information redundancy in the local streamflow network. The t-SNE map provides an intuitive way to visualize the similarity of high-dimensional data of ADHs, groups catchments with like characteristics, and avoids the reliance on subjective hydrometric indicators.","[Tang, Weigang; Carey, Sean K.] McMaster Univ, Sch Earth Environm & Soc, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Tang, WG (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Sch Earth Environm & Soc, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",tangw5@mcmaster.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Global Water Futures,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Global Water Futures,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Global Water Futures,,37,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

There are two mainstream ways to derive characterisation factors, i.e. at midpoint level and at endpoint level. To further progress LCIA method development, we updated the ReCiPe2008 method to its version of 2016. This paper provides an overview of the key elements of the ReCiPe2016 method. Methods We implemented human health, ecosystem quality and resource scarcity as three areas of protection. Endpoint characterisation factors, directly related to the areas of protection, were derived from midpoint characterisation factors with included 17 midpoint impact categories. Results and discussion The update of ReCiPe provides characterisation factors that are representative for the global scale instead of the European scale, while maintaining the possibility for a number of impact categories to implement characterisation factors at a country and continental scale. We also expanded the number of environmental interventions and added impacts of water use on human health, impacts of water use and climate change on freshwater ecosystems and impacts of water use and tropospheric ozone formation on terrestrial ecosystems as novel damage pathways. Although significant effort has been put into the update of ReCiPe, there is still major improvement potential in the way impact pathways are modelled. Further improvements relate to a regionalisation of more impact categories, moving from local to global species extinction and adding more impact pathways. Conclusions Life cycle impact assessment is a fast evolving field of research. ReCiPe2016 provides a state-of-the-art method to convert life cycle inventories to a limited number of life cycle impact scores on midpoint and endpoint level.","[Huijbregts, Mark A.

Assuming that the burning of biomass is climate-neutral, we compared the well-to-wheel (WtW) emissions from the use of bio-methane in heavy duty engines with those from currently used fossil alternatives: CNG, LNG, and diesel. The well-to-tank (WtT) analysis of bio-methane is based on the case study of the new GoBiGas plant in Gothenburg (Sweden), which is the largest bio-methane plant in the world currently in operation. Finally, tank-to wheel (TtW) section compares three different state-of-the-art heavy duty gas engines: a spark-ignited (SI) gas engine; a dual fuel (DF) engine; and a high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) engine. The WtT emissions for compressed bio-methane (bio-CNG) and liquefies bio-methane (bio-LNG) were estimated at 21.5 [gCO(2)e/MJ(bioCNG)] and 26.2 [gCO(2)e/MJ(bioLNG)]. As compared to diesel the WtW emissions from bio-methane were reduced by 60-67%, 43-47%, and 64% when used in SI, DF, and HPDI engines, respectively. HPDI and DF are the most efficient technologies for the utilization of biomass, reducing emissions by 39 gCO(2)e and 33-36 gCO(2)e per MJ of biomass, respectively, compared with the diesel case, whereas the SI engine gave an emissions saving of 29-31 gCO(2)e.

The analytical procedure includes a largely simplified chemical separation technique for uranium (U) and thorium (Th) using UTEVA resin. The developed technique permits simultaneous quantification of uranium [U-238] and thorium [Th-232] concentrations and their respective isotopic composition, required for U-series disequilibrium dating. Up to 50 U-Th dates per day can be achieved through ICP-QMS with delta U-234 and delta Th-230 reproducibility (2 sigma) of 3-4 parts per thousand and 1%, respectively. The high sensitivity (>3.0 x 10(5) cpsippb) together with low background (<0.5 cps) on each mass between 228 and 236 amu allowed U-Th dating of ancient deep-water corals (15-260 kyr) and stalagmites (30-85 kyr) at precision levels of less than 2%. Consequently, the combination of simplified chemistry using UTEVA with state-of-the-art ICP-QMS isotopic measurements that do not require a U-Th separation step now provides an extremely rapid and low-cost U-series dating technology. The level of precision is most convenient for numerous geochronological applications, such as the determination of climatic influences on ecosystem development and carbonate precipitation. As a first-example application we present ICP-QMS U-Th dates of North Atlantic deep-water coral fragments retrieved in the southeastern Porcupine Seabight (MD01-2463G.

It includes 3 UV-VIS channels continuously covering the 270-490 rim range, a NIR-channel covering the 710-775 rim range, and a SWIR-channel covering the 2305-2385 rim range. This instrument concept is, named TROPOMI, part of the TRAQ-mission proposal to ESA in response to the Call for Earth Explorer Ideas 2005, and, named TROPI, part of the CAMEO-proposal prepared for the US NRC decadal study-call on Earth science and applications from space. The SWIR-cbannel is optional in the TROPOMI/TRAQ instrument and included as baseline in the TROPI/CAMEO instrument. This paper focuses on derivation of the instrument requirements of the SWIR-channel by presenting the results of retrieval studies. Synthetic detector spectra are generated by the combination of a forward model and an instrument simulator that includes the properties of state-of-the-art detector technology. The synthetic spectra are input to the CO and CH4 IMLM retrieval algorithm originally developed for SCIAMACHY. The required accuracy of the Level-2 SWIR data products defines the main instrument parameters like spectral resolution and sampling, telescope aperture, detector temperature, and optical bench temperature. The impact of selected calibration and retrieval errors on the Level-2 products has been characterized. The current status of the SWIR-channel optical design with its demanding requirements on ground-pixel size, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio will be presented.","[Jongma, Rienk T.; Gloudemans, Annemieke M.

Methanol (MeOH) is a promising candidate to alleviate the challenges faced by hydrogen regarding transportation and storage, with a developed pre-existing infrastructure and a well-known and scalable synthesis process. This study presents a techno-economic assessment of the different avenues for producing MeOH from 1) natural gas and 2) renewable energy with direct air capture (DAC), for effective CO2 removal from the atmosphere. Under European natural gas prices (6.5 euro /GJ), state-of-the-art MeOH production from natural gas reach levelized costs as low as 268.5 euro /ton, while an advanced plant using gas switching reforming attains a cost of 252.2 euro /ton and approximately 60% lower CO2 emissions. Middle Eastern costs can drop as low as 135.2 euro /ton thanks to low natural gas costs (2 euro /GJ). In comparison, renewable MeOH with DAC reach 471.6-784.9 euro /ton using technology assumptions representative of the year 2050, with Saudi Arabia achieving the lowest cost thanks to its outstanding solar resource. Overall, renewable MeOH with DAC required CO2 prices of 121.4-146.7 euro /ton to break even with renewable plants using pipeline CO2, while CO2 prices in the range of 300 euro /ton are required for competitiveness against natural gas routes. Furthermore, a consistent comparison to NH3 as a carbon-free energy carrier showed that blue and green NH3 require CO2 taxes of 49.8 and 274.3 euro /ton to break even with natural gas-based MeOH, respectively. However, NH3 is 14% cheaper than MeOH for renewable pathways, as it avoids the need for DAC. Thus, strong policy support will be required to deploy green MeOH at scale, even in the long-term future.","[Pozo, Carlos Arnaiz del; Alvaro, Angel Jimenez] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Cloete, Schalk] SINTEF Ind, Trondheim, Norway",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; SINTEF,"Cloete, S (corresponding author), SINTEF Ind, Trondheim, Norway.",schalk.cloete@sintef.no,,"Cloete, Schalk/0000-0001-9641-2939","European Union NextGenerationEU, Ministerio de Universidades grant [RD 289/2021]","European Union NextGenerationEU, Ministerio de Universidades grant","The authors would like to acknowledge Honeywell for the free academic license of Unisim Design R481.

SAR can be used for all-day and all-weather Earth observation, but it has the disadvantages of speckle noise and geometric distortion, which are not conducive to human eye recognition. Optical image conforms to the characteristics of human visual observation, but it is easily affected by climate and time. Therefore, to integrate the advantages of the two, researchers have carried out extensive work on SAR-to-optical (S2O) image translation. Most of the existing methods for S2O image translation are supervised and need paired training samples, limiting its large-scale application in remote sensing field. Thus, we give priority to an unsupervised S2O image translation method. Meanwhile, we find that the images generated by unsupervised methods suffer from significant detail deficiencies. To solve this problem, we propose a fine-grained generative adversarial network (FG-GAN) introducing three strategies to enhance the detailed information in generated optical images. First, we design an unbalanced generator (UBG) with complex encoder networks and relatively simple decoder networks. The complex encoder extracts abundant feature information, while the decoder obtains key details by filtering these features. Second, to match the learning ability of the generator, we present a multiscale discriminator (MSD) to enhance the discriminant ability of the network. Third, we propose a comprehensive normalization group (CNG) to promote the physical representation consistency of SAR and optical images. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both subjective and objective evaluation indicators. Moreover, our FG-GAN has a significant improvement on classification accuracy, indicating its potential in facilitating the performance of practical remote sensing tasks.","[Yang, Xi; Wang, Zihan; Zhao, Jingyi] Xidian Univ, Sch Telecommun Engn, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dong] Xian Inst Space Radio Technol, Xian 710100, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Yang, D (corresponding author), Xian Inst Space Radio Technol, Xian 710100, Peoples R China.",yangx@xidian.edu.cn; zihan_w@stu.xidian.edu.cn; zhaojy@stu.xidian.edu.cn; yangd504@126.com,"王, 子晗/GRY-3121-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61976166]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi [2021GY-030]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JB210115]; Open Research Projects of Laboratory of Pinghu,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Open Research Projects of Laboratory of Pinghu,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61976166, in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi under Grant 2021GY-030, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant JB210115, and in part by the Open Research Projects of Laboratory of Pinghu.",,40,0,0,14,17,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

Considering that our blue planet has a finite space, the role of humanity is to understand its ecosystem in order to anticipate the impact of this increase of human beings on the flora, the fauna and on the environment and in order to limit the imbalance of the ecosystem, and risk the extinction of certain species and the loss of biodiversity. In this context, in 2015, 193 countries, which are members of the United Nations Organization, adopted a universal program of sustainable development for the 2030 horizon, called the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is focused on population numbers, the planet prosperity and on peace thanks to its partnerships. Seventeen sustainable development goals were defined. Algae (macro and microalgae) have the potential to respond to some of the world's most pressing challenges. In this chapter, the sustainable development goals will be approached by proposing solutions based on algae and on key players who utilize them in a healthy functioning of the global ecosystem.

In parallel with change in water resource characteristics generated by physical, environmental and socio-economic challenges such as: (1) uncertainties about climate change (flooding and drought) including seasonal and regional variation in precipitation; (2) significant increase in water use caused by rapid urbanization and population growth in industrialized urban areas; (3) inadequate water pricing mechanism which covers only around 80% of the production cost and makes it harder to maintain water systems; and (4) recursive water quality degradation and conflicts over water rights between regions resulting from non-point source pollution in highland versus lowland areas, Korean water policies have been developed through diverse reforms over 100 years. Nevertheless, new challenges for sustainable water management are continuously emerging. To meet those challenges we provide two ideas: (i) provider-gets-principle (payment for ecosystem services) of cost-benefit sharing among stakeholders who benefit from water use; and (ii) water pricing applying full-cost pricing-principle internalizing environmental externalities caused by the intensive water use. Funds secured from the application of those methods would facilitate: (1) support for upstream (rural) low income householders suffering from economic restrictions; (2) improvement in water facilities; and (3) efficient water use and demand management in South Korea's water sectors. We expect that this paper can examine the lessons relevant to challenges that South Korea faces and offer some implications on the formulation of new integration and further reforms of the institutions, laws and organizations responsible for managing water resources in South Korea.","[Choi, Ik-Chang; Tenhunen, John] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Shin, Hio-Jung] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Trung Thanh Nguyen] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of Bayreuth; Kangwon National University; Leibniz University Hannover,"Choi, IC (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",ikchangchoi@gmail.com; hiojung@kangwon.ac.kr; thanh.nguyen@iuw.uni-hannover.de; john.tenhunen@uni-bayreuth.de,"Nguyen, Trung Thanh/D-3448-2009","Nguyen, Trung Thanh/0000-0003-4507-724X; Choi, Ik-Chang/0000-0001-9561-7780; Shin, Hio-Jung/0000-0003-1811-0163","German Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1565/1]; University of Bayreuth, Germany","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Bayreuth, Germany","This study was carried out as part of the International Research Training Group TERRECO (GRK 1565/1) funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the University of Bayreuth in the funding program Open Access Publishing, Germany.",,68,37,37,3,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2017,9,,,,,,717,10.3390/w9090717,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9090717,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FH9WM,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000411567200090,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the facets of diurnal, intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability of the northeast monsoon rainfall (the NEMR) over India have been examined. The analysis of satellite derived hourly rainfall reveals that there are distinct features of diurnal variation over the land and oceans during the season. Over the land, rainfall peaks during the late afternoon/evening, while over the oceans an early morning peak is observed. The harmonic analysis of hourly data reveals that the amplitude and variance are the largest over south peninsular India. The NEMR also exhibits significant intra-seasonal variability on a 20-40 day time scale. Analysis also shows significant northward propagation of the maximum cloud zone from south of equator to the south peninsula during the season. The NEMR exhibits large inter-annual variability with the co-efficient of variation (CV) of 25%. The positive phases of ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are conducive for normal to above normal rainfall activity during the northeast monsoon. There are multi-decadal variations in the statistical relationship between ENSO and the NEMR. During the period 2001-2010 the statistical relationship between ENSO and the NEMR has significantly weakened. The analysis of seasonal rainfall hindcasts for the period 1960-2005 produced by the state-of-the-art coupled climate models, ENSEMBLES, reveals that the coupled models have very poor skill in predicting the inter-annual variability of the NEMR. This is mainly due to the inability of the ENSEMBLES models to simulate the positive relationship between ENSO and the NEMR correctly. Copyright (C) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society","[Sreekala, P.

Solving global and local issues, including food security, water regulation, land degradation, and climate change requires higher quality, more consistent and detailed soil information. Accurate prediction of soil variation over large and complex areas with limited samples remains a challenge, which is especially significant for China due to its vast land area which contains the most diverse soil landscapes in the world. Here, we integrated predictive soil mapping paradigm with adaptive depth function fitting, state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization in a highperformance parallel computing environment to generate 90-m resolution national gridded maps of nine soil properties (pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, cation exchange capacity, bulk density, coarse fragments, and thickness) at multiple depths across China. This was based on approximately 5000 representative soil profiles collected in a recent national soil survey and a suite of detailed covariates to characterize soil-forming environments. The predictive accuracy ranged from very good to moderate (Model Efficiency Coefficients from 0.71 to 0.36) at 0-5 cm. The predictive accuracy for most soil properties declined with depth. Compared with previous soil maps, we achieved significantly more detailed and accurate predictions which could well represent soil variations across the territory and are a significant contribution to the GlobalSoilMap.net project. The relative importance of soil-forming factors in the predictions varied by specific soil property and depth, suggesting the complexity and non-stationarity of comprehensive multi-factor interactions in the process of soil development.

J,"Shah, KLU",,,,"Shah, Kalim U.",,,Preparing public health at the front lines: effectiveness of training received by environmental health inspectors in the Caribbean,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Caribbean; environmental health; frontline workers; health inspectors; public health; standardized training,,"Environmental health departments in the Caribbean continue to contend with environmental determinants of health related to an increasingly complex array of challenges, including climatic change, disasters, pollution, bioterrorism, and global pandemics. Building the human resource capacity to meet these challenges requires access to modernized, context-relevant training, especially for environmental health inspectors who interface with the public. This study focuses on the standardized Three-Step training program delivered by education institutions across the Caribbean, which is the primary training required by ministries of health for entry into the environmental health inspectorate. A total of 22 focus groups were completed in five countries-Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago-with 94 participants drawn from the education institutions delivering training and the inspectors who have received the training. Findings suggest: program strengths in core academic content; weaknesses in faculty experts to deliver advanced subjects; opportunities for enhancing field-training experiences in collaboration with ministries; and threats to program survival due to bottlenecks in public sector hiring that reduce the attractiveness of entering the profession. Interestingly, academic trainers and practitioners differ on the importance of certain knowledge sets, such as legal and court procedural skills and epidemiological data analysis. As ministries of health in these countries contemplate ways to modernize the inspectorates, these findings can guide how ministries and education institutions work together to modernize the Three-Step training program. Points for practitioners Environmental health inspectors interfacing with the public are well placed to contribute perspectives to the public health modernization discourse. Formal training programs must be periodically and frequently recalibrated to societal needs and the state of the art in subject area knowledge. Strengthening the local teaching institutions' capacity to deliver relevant educational programs will translate into better-prepared frontline professionals. Formal training lags in integrating some emergent subject areas, such as climate change and environmental health determinants.","[Shah, Kalim U.] Univ Delaware, Isl Policy Lab, Newark, DE USA; [Shah, Kalim U.] Univ Delaware, Joseph R Biden Jr Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 111 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Shah, KLU (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Joseph R Biden Jr Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 111 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kalshah@udel.edu,,"Shah, Kalim/0000-0002-3318-0170",,,,,36,0,0,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-8523,1461-7226,,INT REV ADM SCI,Int.

Future climate change and population growth will further intensify this threat in more areas in coming decades. Therefore, it is necessary to explore any potential fresh water source, such as offshore fresh groundwater, that could alleviate this fresh water shortage and provide valuable time for adaptation measures implementation and changes in water management strategies. Recent evidence suggests that a disproportionally large portion of human population living in coastal areas relies on groundwater resources stored in underlying unconsolidated groundwater systems. These systems are often very heterogeneous, combining numerous high permeability aquifers interlaid with low permeability aquitards with varying total thickness. This heterogeneity is a major control on the fresh groundwater volume and groundwater salinity distribution within such systems. Thus, the quantification of geological heterogeneity is often the limiting factor when estimating fresh groundwater volumes, both inland and offshore, along the global coastline. To overcome this obstacle, we combine conceptual geological models with available state-of-the-art global datasets to derive a set of geological heterogeneity parameter distributions quantifying geological heterogeneity of coastal unconsolidated groundwater systems (CUGSs) as formed over last 1 Ma. These are then used in an algorithm designed to build synthetic heterogenic parameterizations of CUGSs along the global coastline. These, in turn, provide key input for modeling variable-density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport to analyze changes in groundwater salinities and offshore fresh groundwater volume (OFGV). Such an analysis is performed over one full glacial-interglacial cycle (the last 0.13 Ma) to account for oscillating sea-level conditions and shifts in coast-line positions and salinity incursions. Our simulation results show a close match between the modeling scenarios and values presented by literature sources demonstrating the potential of the hereby presented methodology to be applied in similar future studies.","[Zamrsky, Daniel; Karssenberg, Maria E.; Cohen, Kim M.; Bierkens, Marc F.

With lab-on-a-chip, nanotechnology integrating a variety of the latest methods for a large number of sample types (water, sediment, waste water, food, blood, etc.) it is possible to make a desktop instrument that would have universal applications. There are two major thrusts to this grand challenge that will allow us to take advantage of the latest biotechnological breakthroughs in real time. The first is a bioengineering thrust that will take advantage of the large multidisciplinary laboratories in developing key technologies. Miniaturization will reduce reagent costs and increase sensitivity and reaction kinetics for rapid turnaround time. New and evolving technologies will allow us to port the designs for state-of-the-art microarrays today to completely new nanotechnology inspired platforms as they mature. The second thrust is in bioinformatics to use our existing expertise to take advantage of the rapidly evolving landscape of bioinformatics data. This increasing capacity of the data set will allow us to resolve microbial species to greatly improved levels and identify functional genes beyond the hypothetical protein level. A cheap and portable assay would impact countless areas, including clean water technologies, emerging diseases, bioenergy, infectious disease diagnosis, climate change, food safety, environmental clean-up and bioterrorism. In my opinion it is possible but it will require a very large group of multidiscplenary scientists from multiple institutions crossing many international boundaries and funding over a 5-year period of more than $100 million.

Each year, it causes disease in approximately 515 million people and kills between one and three million people, the majority of whom are young children in sub-Saharan Africa. It is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Due to climate change and the gradual warming of the temperate regions the future distribution of the malaria disease might include regions which are today seen as safe. Currently, malaria control requires an integrated approach comprising of mainly prevention, including vector control and the use of effective prophylactic medicines, and treatment of infected patients with antimalarials. The antimalarial chloroquine, which was in the past a mainstay of malaria control, is now ineffective in most malaria areas and resistance to other antimalarials is also increasing rapidly. The discovery and development of artemisinins from Artemisia annua have provided a new class of highly effective antimalarials. ACTs are now generally considered as the best current treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This review gives a short history of the malaria disease, the people forming a high risk group and the botanical aspects of A. annua. Furthermore the review provides an insight in the use of ART and its derivatives for the treatment of malaria. Its mechanism of action and kinetics will be described as well as the possibilities fora self-reliant treatment will be revealed.

It has important applications for predicting species distributions and how they might respond to environmental perturbations. This paper describes a mechanistic approach to predict past and present distribution of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) on Honshu, Japan. We applied state-of-the-art microclimate and animal biophysical/ behavioral models coupled with climate and vegetation data to estimate the distribution of potential range expansion under protection. We tested the model results against detailed empirical distribution data from the Ministry of the Environment for a five-prefecture area in central Honshu. We also applied the models to time-series land use/ cover maps to investigate the historical transitions in habitat suitability during 1947-1999 in the Arai-Keinan region. This is the first time to our knowledge that mechanistic models have successfully predicted the landscape scale distribution of a mammal species in the absence of other animal species interactions, such as predators. In this case, animal energetics/ behavior-plant interactions seem to be critical. Forest cover appears to be important in summer and winter for suitable serow habitats. The energetics model results indicate that the serow can overheat in some open environments in midday hours in summer. In winter, simulation results suggested that forest cover provides effective refuge to avoid increased metabolic demands of cold temperatures and strong winds. The model simulations suggested that land use/ cover changes documented during 1947-1999 resulted in increased suitable serow habitat due to expanding forest cover from agricultural marginalization and ecological succession. The models provide a unique tool for estimating species' range expansion under protection or for selecting suitable reintroduction sites.","Univ Wisconsin, Gaylord Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Porter, WP (corresponding author), Ecosyst Conservat Soc Japan, Toshima Ku, 2-30-10 Nishiikebukuro, Tokyo 1710021, Japan.",wpporter@wisc.edu,,,,,,,74,51,54,0,34,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In this manner, student co-creation activities have recently become a major research priority in marketing and higher education (HE) research. The purpose of this study is to present a systematic review of the literature on student co-creation roles and behaviors in HE in order to map extant research on this topic and offer a consolidated view of the co-creation process and approaches that can be employed by HEIs to motivate students to co-create their HE experience. Design/methodology/approach A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was followed to classify, select, synthesize, analyze and assess the most relevant studies on student participation in co-creation in HE. Findings This study's analysis has identified that the co-creation process in HE includes dialog, access, risk and transparency. The main approaches used by higher education institutions (HEIs) to motivate students to co-create their HE experience are student involvement, cognitive engagement, university affiliation and emotional engagement. Our review also shows that student co-creation behaviors are mainly participation and citizenship behavior, and their co-creation roles include those of co-producers, participants, change agents and partners. Originality/value This systematic literature review analyses and critically discusses the state of the art in student co-creation roles in HE and the approaches HEIs use. By providing a map of existing research, the paper contributes both to the clarification of student co-creation roles and behaviors in HE and the identification of research gaps and opportunities for further research.","[Zarandi, Negin; Soares, Ana Maria] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Zarandi, Negin] NECE, Braga, Portugal; [Soares, Ana Maria] CICS NOVA UMinho, Braga, Portugal; [Alves, Helena] Univ Beira Interior, Dept Econ & Management, Covilha, Portugal; [Alves, Helena] Univ Beira Interior, NECE, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade da Beira Interior; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Zarandi, N (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal.;Zarandi, N (corresponding author), NECE, Braga, Portugal.",negin.z1987@yahoo.com,"Alves, Helena/K-5775-2014","Alves, Helena/0000-0001-5192-2310",FCT - FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/04630/2020],FCT - FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),"This Research is supported by FCT - FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, reference UIDB/04630/2020.",,171,0,0,2,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0951-354X,1758-6518,,INT J EDUC MANAG,Int.

Examples include down-hole drilling, aerospace, automotive electronics - which may endure high or low operating temperatures during operation. The automotive operating temperature range is -40 degrees C to +125 degrees C. The equipment operating range for defense equipment is -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C. In addition, electronic systems may experience prolonged periods of non-climate-controlled exposure to high and low temperature prior to deployment in the intended application. Materials properties of interconnects at extreme-low temperatures and high strain-rates are not well-studied and there is a scarcity of published data on undoped and doped solder alloys. The current paper fills this void in the state of art through measurements of properties of doped SAC alloys at low temperatures in the range of -65 degrees C to high temperatures up to 200 degrees C, at high strain rates after various durations of thermal aging. Alloys studied include SAC305, SAC-Q, and M758. In each case, the stress-strain curves have been measured at low operating temperatures using impact-hammer based tensile tests with cooling chamber. Anand Viscoplasticity model constants have been computed to model the material behavior over the whole range of temperatures and strain rates in the range of 1-100 per sec. In addition, the evolution of the model constants with the duration of thermal storage at high temperature has been quantified. The computed anand parameters has been used to simulate the drop events for a ballgrid array package on printed circuit board assembly to determine hysteresis loop and plastic work density.","[Lall, Pradeep; Yadav, Vikas; Mehta, Vishal; Suhling, Jeff] Auburn Univ, NSF CAVE3 Elect Res Ctr, Dept Mech Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Locker, David] US Army Combat Capabil Dev Command AvMC, Huntsville, AL USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; National Science Foundation (NSF),"Lall, P (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, NSF CAVE3 Elect Res Ctr, Dept Mech Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",lall@auburn.edu,,,,,,,30,1,1,1,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",0569-5503,2377-5726,978-0-7381-4523-5,ELEC COMP C,,,2021,,,,,830,841,,10.1109/ECTC32696.2021.00142,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ECTC32696.2021.00142,,,12,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS2KH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000702282700130,View Full Record in Web of Science

The second challenge was the location: Antarctica. Boundary conditions, usually taken from codes of practice, must be determined by investigation, engineering judgement and statistics, for example, wind loads, snow, ice and rock conditions. All materials needed to be suitable for Antarctica, which means, resistant to low temperatures, high ultra violet (UV) radiation, air salinity and abrasive ice particles during extreme wind conditions. The third challenge centred around logistical planning. All the materials had to fit into 20 ft International Standards Organisation (ISO) containers for easy transport; however, the containers were also required to be light enough for helicopter transport, since ice conditions made it impossible for the vessel to reach the site on time. The time frame for construction during the Antarctic summer was short. Therefore, construction had to start prior to the arrival of the vessel. All the boundary conditions are reflected in the building and its type of construction; the form and materials are suited for the location, climate and logistics. The research station is located on a small peninsula of Larsemann Hills. The three-storey containerised building, 52 m long and 30 m wide, can accommodate up to 47 people and contains laboratories, a garage, a workshop, living and office areas, a cinema, a fitness room, a library, dining hall and lounge with a view of the Antarctic Ocean.

National Malaria Control Programmes across Africa have access to a range of state-of-the-art malaria risk mapping products that might serve their decision-making needs. The use of cartography in planning malaria control has never been methodically reviewed. Materials and Methods: An audit of the risk maps used by NMCPs in 47 malaria endemic countries in Africa was undertaken by examining the most recent national malaria strategies, monitoring and evaluation plans, malaria programme reviews and applications submitted to the Global Fund. The types of maps presented and how they have been used to define priorities for investment and control was investigated. Results: 91% of endemic countries in Africa have defined malaria risk at sub-national levels using at least one risk map. The range of risk maps varies from maps based on suitability of climate for transmission; predicted malaria seasons and temperature/altitude limitations, to representations of clinical data and modelled parasite prevalence. The choice of maps is influenced by the source of the information. Maps developed using national data through in-country research partnerships have greater utility than more readily accessible web-based options developed without inputs from national control programmes. Although almost all countries have stratification maps, only a few use them to guide decisions on the selection of interventions allocation of resources for malaria control. Conclusion: The way information on the epidemiology of malaria is presented and used needs to be addressed to ensure evidence-based added value in planning control. The science on modelled impact of interventions must be integrated into new mapping products to allow a translation of risk into rational decision making for malaria control. As overseas and domestic funding diminishes, strategic planning will be necessary to guide appropriate financing for malaria control.","[Omumbo, Judy A.; Noor, Abdisalan M.; Snow, Robert W.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Res Programme, Kenya Med Res Inst, Malaria Publ Hlth Dept, Nairobi, Kenya; [Omumbo, Judy A.; Noor, Abdisalan M.; Snow, Robert W.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford, England; [Fall, Ibrahima S.] World Hlth Org, Reg Off Africa, Brazzaville, Rep Congo",Kenya Medical Research Institute; University of Oxford; World Health Organization,"Omumbo, JA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Res Programme, Kenya Med Res Inst, Malaria Publ Hlth Dept, Nairobi, Kenya.",judyomumbo@gmail.com,"Snow, Robert William/AFR-1436-2022","Snow, Robert William/0000-0003-3725-6088; Omumbo, Judy/0000-0002-9475-9346","Wellcome Trust [079080, 095127]",Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission),"RWS is supported by the Wellcome Trust as a Principal Research Fellow (#079080).

In particular, we consider (a) gauge-interpolated datasets (GPCCv8, CRU TS4.01, PREC/L, and CPC-Unified), (b) multi-source products (PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS2.0, MSWEP V2, HydroGFD2.0, and SM2RAIN-CCI), and (c) reanalyses (ERA-Interim, ERA5, CFSR, and JRA-55). The spatiotemporal performance of each product is evaluated against monthly precipitation observations from 155 gauges distributed across the basin during the period 2000-2015. This way, we find that overall the GPCCv8 dataset agrees best with the measurements. Most datasets show significant underestimations, which are largest for the interpolated datasets. These underestimations are usually smallest at low altitudes and increase towards more mountainous areas, although there is large spread across the products. Interestingly, no overall performance difference can be found between precipitation datasets for which gauge observations from Karun basin were used, versus products that were derived without these measurements, except in the case of GPCCv8. In general, our findings highlight remarkable differences between state-of-the-art precipitation products over regions with comparatively sparse gauge density, such as Iran. Revealing the best-performing datasets and their remaining weaknesses, we provide guidance for monitoring and modelling applications which rely on high-quality precipitation input.","[Fallah, Ali; Rakhshandehroo, Gholam Reza] Shiraz Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran; [Fallah, Ali; Berg, Peter] SMHI, Hydrol Res Unit, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Fallah, Ali; Sungmin, O.; Orth, Rene] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany",Shiraz University; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Max Planck Society,"Fallah, A (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran.",alifallah@shirazu.ac.ir,"O, Sungmin/AAQ-8919-2021; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022; Orth, Rene/AAG-7034-2021; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022; Fallah, Ali/AAA-5405-2022","Orth, Rene/0000-0002-9853-921X; O, Sungmin/0000-0002-7364-2122; Fallah, Ali/0000-0001-8273-4638","German Research Foundation [391059971]; Ministry of Science, Research and technology I.R. of Iran; Sveriges Meteorologiska och Hydrologiska Institut","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministry of Science, Research and technology I.R. of Iran; Sveriges Meteorologiska och Hydrologiska Institut","German Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 391059971; Ministry of Science, Research and technology I.R. of Iran; Sveriges Meteorologiska och Hydrologiska Institut",,67,41,43,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Lithium brine has gained much attention as a critical primary lithium resource over mineral sources due to cheaper processing and greater abundance. However, reducing the Mg2+: Li+ ratio of brines remains a challenge, as magnesium contaminates lithium precipitates. Solar evaporation ponds are traditionally employed to concentrate Li and reduce Mg content to tackle this issue, but typically require 1-2 years to process a batch of feed solution, and require much land area disturbing the local environment near brine resources. Here we present a continuous, scalable ion separation technique for reducing the Mg2+:Li+ ratio of brine as an alternative to solar evaporation. The device utilizes ion concentration polarization to induce a locally amplified electric field. The amplified electric field separates ions into streams according to electrophoretic mobility. We demonstrate reduction of a 25:1 Mg2+:Li+ lab brine to below 10:1 Mg2+:Li+, which is an acceptable lithium production purity by industrial standards. Reduction of a 60:1 Mg2+:Li+ to similar to 10:1 and a 100:1 Mg2+:Li+ brine to approximately 20:1 are also demonstrated. The system suffers a high specific energy consumption (8.804 kWh/g Li+ for 25:1 reduction to 9:1) due to low lithium recovery (9.9%) and microfluidic system size. However, an economic scaling analysis shows that this work is within an order of magnitude of the state-of-the-art separation technologies in the literature after various process parameters are normalized. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a potential novel process for continuous lithium extraction from brines, which is a generalizable ion separation tool utilizing differences in electrophoretic mobility.","[Barksdale, Alex Christopher; Yoon, Junghyo; Kwon, Hyukjin J.; Han, Jongyoon] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Han, J (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jyhan@mit.edu,,,Kuwait-MIT Signature Project on Brine Desalination [P31475EC01]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1419807],Kuwait-MIT Signature Project on Brine Desalination; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is made possible by the financial support of the Kuwait-MIT Signature Project on Brine Desalination (Project No. P31475EC01) .

The result of this powerful synergy between these two approaches (technology and CH needs) in view of mitigating effects on cultural heritage, is expected to enormously increase the mitigation of the damages created by climate change disasters. The main question, coming from the experience gained, is how we can capitalize the acquired expertise in the future. This will probably be done using strategies which could rely on local financial support and the possibility to have advanced regulations provided by local authorities. Communication between different actors will play a major role in the future achievements: the project faced a big challenge in establishing good communication among different competences so to say that now, after a three year project, it should be great to start a new experience counting on the level of friendship and communication achieved during the STORM project. But communication is also the key element of emergency management. The recent event which affected the Notre Dame Cathedral (Paris, 15/04/2019), was a matter of discussion between STORM partners and during those discussion we concluded that probably the proper preparedness was not in place. Preparedness could have dramatically reduced the reaction time and the effectiveness of intervention after a disaster.

This new version also has a new set of state-of-the-art physical parameterizations and greater computational parallel and memory usage efficiency. The description of the main model features includes several examples illustrating the quality of the transport scheme for scalars, radiative fluxes on surface, and model simulation of rainfall systems over South America at different spatial resolutions using a scale aware convective parameterization. Additionally, the simulation of the diurnal cycle of the convection and carbon dioxide concentration over the Amazon Basin, as well as carbon dioxide fluxes from biogenic processes over a large portion of South America, are shown. Atmospheric chemistry examples show the model performance in simulating near-surface carbon monoxide and ozone in the Amazon Basin and the megacity of Rio de Janeiro. For tracer transport and dispersion, the model capabilities to simulate the volcanic ash 3-D redistribution associated with the eruption of a Chilean volcano are demonstrated. The gain of computational efficiency is described in some detail. BRAMS has been applied for research and operational forecasting mainly in South America. Model results from the operational weather forecast of BRAMS on 5 km grid spacing in the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies, INPE/Brazil, since 2013 are used to quantify the model skill of near-surface variables and rainfall. The scores show the reliability of BRAMS for the tropical and subtropical areas of South America. Requirements for keeping this modeling system competitive regarding both its functionalities and skills are discussed. Finally, we highlight the relevant contribution of this work to building a South American community of model developers.","[Freitas, Saulo R.; Longo, Karla M.; Rodrigues, Luiz F.; Frassoni, Ariane; Pavani, Claudio A.

This represents a clear gap of knowledge researchers are trying to fill, in light of the evidences of a climate change-driven decline in the nutritional properties of important food crops. Rice represents the staple food for half of the world's population, and this explains the noticeable interest in rice grain quality, because of the direct implications on the economic value of productions, on their market destination, and on food security issues. This paper presents a framework-independent NET software library, i.e., UNIMI CropQuality, implementing models to simulate various aspects of rice quality: amylose, protein, lipids and starch content, viscosity profile, chalkiness, cracking and head rice yield. Alternate approaches for the simulation of the same quality property are included, to allow users to select the most suitable for specific modelling studies. A case study is also presented where the library was linked to the WARM rice model and used to simulate head rice yield and the percentage incidence of cracked and milky white kernels (severely chalky) for two rice varieties in the main European rice district. RRMSE ranged between 4.33% and 6.47% for head rice yield, 21.88% and 32.18% for cracking percentage, 35.92% and 55.01% for milky white chalkiness; modelling efficiency were always positive. The component, developed according to the state-of-the-art of component-oriented software development, is released with a Software Development Kit containing help and code documentation files, as well as sample applications showing how to use the library with different crop simulators.

Benthos is particularly difficult to monitor, and is sensitive to local environmental changes. At the same time, long-term monitoring is complicated by logistical factors. It is therefore urgent to develop advanced instruments to set up autonomous and long-term monitoring programmes to obtain the lacking biological knowledge needed to understand this complex and remote marine environment. We present a pilot study to set up a non-invasive and sustainable autonomous monitoring activity in Antarctica, leveraging on a specifically designed automated camera recording, computer vision and machine learning image processing techniques. We also present and analyse the high-resolution image dataset acquired for an extended period of time encompassing both the summer and the Antarctic night and the corresponding transition periods. The results of this study demonstrate both the effectiveness of such an autonomous imaging devices for acquiring relevant long-term visual data and the effectiveness of the proposed image analysis algorithms for extracting relevant scientific knowledge from such data. The presented results show how the extracted knowledge discloses dynamics of the observed ecosystems that can be obtained only through continuous observations extended in time, not achievable with the state-of-the-art monitoring approaches commonly implemented in Antarctica. The success of this pilot study is a step towards the collection of continuous data near shore in Antarctic areas and in general in all the remote and extreme underwater habitats. Moreover, the presented stand-alone and autonomous imaging device can be used for increasing the number of the monitoring sites in remote environments and when complemented with the acquisition of physical and bio-chemical variables it can be used for obtaining data collections of great scientific value difficult to acquire otherwise.","[Marini, Simone; Bonofiglio, Federico; Corgnati, Lorenzo P.] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Marine Sci, La Spezia, Italy; [Marini, Simone] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy; [Bordone, Andrea; Peirano, Andrea] ENEA Marine Environm Res Ctr, La Spezia, Italy; [Schiaparelli, Stefano] Univ Genoa, DISTAV, Genoa, Italy; [Schiaparelli, Stefano] Italian Natl Antarctic Museum, Sect Genoa, MNA 5, Genoa, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; University of Genoa,"Marini, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Marine Sci, La Spezia, Italy.;Marini, S (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy.",simone.marini@sp.ismar.cnr.it,"Marini, Simone/C-3872-2012; Marini, Simone/AAA-3513-2022","Marini, Simone/0000-0003-0665-7815; Marini, Simone/0000-0003-0665-7815",Italian National Antarctic Program [PNRA 2013/AZ1.16]; ENDURUNS project [Horizon 2020] [824348]; JERICO-S3 project [Horizon 2020] [871153],Italian National Antarctic Program; ENDURUNS project [Horizon 2020]; JERICO-S3 project [Horizon 2020],"The Research leading to these results has received funding from the project 'ICE-LAPSE: Analysis of Antarctic benthos dynamics by using non-destructive monitoring devices and permanent stations', PNRA 2013/AZ1.16, funded by the Italian National Antarctic Program.

Technologically advanced wearable smart systems have been recently developed, which are able to collect physiological parameters and give an alert to workers, if necessary. The body core temperature (CT) represents a key parameter to be monitored, in order to follow the time evolution of the body thermal state for workers exposed to heat or cold stress. State-of-the-art estimation models of CT are based on processing heart rate (HR) data, combining non-invasiveness and prediction accuracy. Because such models make use of a database derived for a sample of army volunteers, the extension of the model to a population of workers must be investigated. In this preliminary study, we present and discuss results found for three healthy women performing three consecutive tasks (descending and ascending a work ladder, lifting a 5-kg-box and walking on a treadmill), in a climate chamber at an air temperature of 32 degrees C, for a total test duration of 24 minutes. Oxygen consumption (VO2), HR and CT data were collected during the tests. Results reveal a different impact of the three tasks on the CT and HR time evolutions. A good overlap was found between the time evolution of VO2 and HR, while CT, due to the body large thermal inertia, showed a much slower increase, resulting in a significant time delay and much smoother overall trend. Model predictions of the CT appear to provide a reasonable approximation to data measured during the work phases, but not during the recovery phase. Future actions are discussed that could improve the model performance in view of a possible application in workplaces.","[Falcone, Tiziana] Lab Ergon & Physiol, Rome, Italy; [Falcone, Tiziana] INAIL Dept Occupat & Environm Med Epidemiol & Hyg, Rome, Italy; [Falcone, Tiziana; Zollo, Loredana] Campus Biomed Univ Rome, Unit Adv Robot & Human Centred Technol, Via Alvaro Portillo 200, Rome, Italy; [Del Ferraro, Simona; Molinaro, Vincenzo] INAIL Dept Occupat & Environm Med Epidemiol & Hyg, Lab Ergon & Physiol, Rome, Italy; [Lenzuni, Paolo] INAIL, Tuscany Reg Res Ctr, Florence, Italy",University Campus Bio-Medico - Rome Italy,"Falcone, T (corresponding author), Lab Ergon & Physiol, Rome, Italy.;Falcone, T (corresponding author), INAIL Dept Occupat & Environm Med Epidemiol & Hyg, Rome, Italy.;Falcone, T (corresponding author), Campus Biomed Univ Rome, Unit Adv Robot & Human Centred Technol, Via Alvaro Portillo 200, Rome, Italy.",t.falcone-sg@inail.it; s.delferraro@inail.it; v.molinaro@inail.it; l.zollo@unicampus.it; p.lenzuni@inail.it,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-1093-9,,,,2022,,,,,60,64,,10.1109/MetroInd4.0IoT54413.2022.9831532,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MetroInd4.0IoT54413.2022.9831532,,,5,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,BT8VM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000855570300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paradigm focuses on the environmental impacts of travel and the imperative for climate change mitigation, however the specific outcomes of transport in terms of trip type and purpose are not robustly conceptualised, with limited intellectual foundations to understand the ethical considerations of transport service provision. This paper critically considers transport strategies recently developed for London's Night Time Economy, including policy discourse and technical approaches that shape of transport services provision at night. The case study evaluates the spatiotemporal dimensions of equity. Analysis of policy discourses revealed how night time transport are conceived as an instrumental means to grow the 'Night Time Economy', drawing from the conventional wisdom linking accessibility improvements with economic expansion. This strategy viewed 'London at night' as a vehicle for economic development, focusing on the consumption-side of the economy and improving individuals' access to entertainment and recreation. Policy discourse recognised the existence of night-time workers in sectors outside arts and recreation, however, attempts to broaden the 'Night Time Economy' agenda to accommodate the travel needs of night-time workers were lost through the narrow selection of accessibility metrics used in transport planning practice. This case demonstrates a missed opportunity to improve transport equity across spatial and temporal dimensions, as night-time workers face severe accessibility barriers, often relying on low-frequency bus services that have inadequate service coverage across Greater London.

Crop production will be affected by many changes in its climatic, agronomic, economic, and societal contexts. Therefore, breeders are challenged to produce cultivars that strengthen both ecological and societal resilience by striving for six international sustainability targets: food security, safety and quality; food and seed sovereignty; social justice; agrobiodiversity; ecosystem services; and climate robustness. Against this background, we review the state of the art in plant breeding by distinguishing four paradigmatic orientations that currently co-exist: community-based breeding, ecosystem-based breeding, trait-based breeding, and corporate-based breeding, analyzing differences among these orientations. Our main findings are: (1) all four orientations have significant value but none alone will achieve all six sustainability targets; (2) therefore, an overarching approach is needed: systems-based breeding, an orientation with the potential to synergize the strengths of the ways of thinking in the current paradigmatic orientations; (3) achieving that requires specific knowledge development and integration, a multitude of suitable breeding strategies and tools, and entrepreneurship, but also a change in attitude based on corporate responsibility, circular economy and true-cost accounting, and fair and green policies. We conclude that systems-based breeding can create strong interactions between all system components. While seeds are part of the common good and the basis of agrobiodiversity, a diversity in breeding approaches, based on different entrepreneurial approaches, can also be considered part of the required agrobiodiversity. To enable systems-based breeding to play a major role in creating sustainable agriculture, a shared sense of urgency is needed to realize the required changes in breeding approaches, institutions, regulations and protocols. Based on this concept of systems-based breeding, there are opportunities for breeders to play an active role in the development of an ecologically and societally resilient, sustainable agriculture.","[van Bueren, Edith T.

Discrete-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density (ACD) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating ACD from ALS data, but discard tree-level information contained within the ALS point cloud. This paper compares area based and tree-centric models for estimating ACD in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm (itcSegment) to locate trees within the ALS canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by ALS, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating ACD than the best-performing area-based model (RMSE 18% vs 13%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice.

However, the current nuclear technology, light water reactors (LWRs), is limited to 300 degrees C, so it cannot be used to decarbonize industrial process heat which accounts for 12% of US greenhouse gas emissions. High temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) can meet the high temperature demand with carbon free nuclear heat. The estimated cost of HTGRs, such as the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), are even higher than state-of-the-art LWRs. In this paper, we expanded our nuclear cost estimating tool to include HTGRs and find that the NGNP overnight capital costs were 32% higher than an advanced LWR per unit capacity. The higher cost will naturally result in larger risk to cost overrun as recently experienced by larger LWRs in western nations. With a design-to-build mindset to minimize cost and construction risk, we introduce the horizontal, compact HTGR (HC-HTGR). The reactor core and steam generator are mounted horizontally on rails and in-line with one another, decreasing the size of the reactor building relative to the power capacity four times when compared to traditional HTGRs. The HC-HTGR reduced overnight civil structure costs by 42%, indirect costs by 38%, and total capital costs by 20% from NGNP. We discussed the required engineering of new systems for the HC-HTGR including vessel supports, the reactor cavity cooling system, and steam generator design. Finally, we estimated the fuel and operations costs of the HC-HTGR, and a survey of low-carbon industrial process heat technology showed the HC-HTGR can deliver a highly competitive levelized cost of heat in the range of $6.13-12.48/GJ.","[Stewart, W.

In the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia, a deeply weathered mantle is commonly capped with 2-10 m of lateritic residuum (residual lateritic gravels and duricrust) and/or ferricrete (Fe oxide-cemented sediment), which formed under seasonally humid tropical and sub-tropical climates during the Cenozoic. The principal constituents of these units are goethite, hematite, maghemite, kaolinite and quartz. They are commonly overlain by younger, 2-10 m thick transported cover, deposited under later semi-arid conditions. Both ferricrete and lateritic residuum may host exploitable secondary gold deposits, typically small (< 500,000 ounces) and of low grade (< 1-5 g/t Au). The lateritic residuum deposits overlie weathered and fresh primary mineralization, whereas ferricrete deposits overlie uneconomic primary mieralization or barren saprolite and bedrock. Despite numerous studies, many questions remain about the behaviour and evolution of Au in the complex polygenetic systems that form lateritic residuum and ferricrete. In particular, why is it difficult to locate significant primary mineralization associated with highly Au-anomalous ferricrete? Understanding the mechanisms of enrichment of Au and pathfinder elements in ferricrete will assist future discovery. Accordingly, to obtain conclusive evidence for processes of anomaly formation, a combination of detailed field observations with state-of-the-art microscopy have been conducted at three of the larger deposits (Moolart Well, Mt Gibson and Bulchina). The aim of this review is to integrate these recent results with the results of earlier studies to trace the path of Au and pathfinder elements and associated dispersion processes in the ferricrete environment.","[Anand, R.

The hunting and food gathering system gradually gave way to food producing systems. Incidentally, some stray references related to tree plantations occur in different texts of the Vedic literature. Archeological excavations corroborate early tree domestication around the settlements in South Asia. In India, organized research in agroforestry was initiated in early 1970s through industry participation in plantation of commercial tree species through Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes. As follow up, the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Agroforestry was established in 1983 by the ICAR through which research work was carried out through Agricultural Universities situated in different agroclimatic zones. Forest Survey of India has reported that about 25 million ha area in the country (8.2 % of the total reported geographical area) is under agroforestry in both irrigated and rainfed agriculture which also includes trees outside forests and scattered trees on and off the agricultural fields. In this publication, the various chapters are compiled in such a way that a clear picture of various agroforestry systems both traditional and improved found in different agroecological regions is presented. Some systems are present across a number of climatic regions (for example salt-affected and waterlogged areas); but the problems are of different nature in different regions. To deal with such cases, separate chapters are included to present agroforestry approaches dealing with specific problems. Agroforestry systems provide excellent opportunities for carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change, hence it needs a special strategy in policy initiatives.","[Dagar, Jagdish Chander; Singh, Anil Kumar; Arunachalam, A.] Indian Council Agr Res, Nat Resource Management Div, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR),"Dagar, JC (corresponding author), Indian Council Agr Res, Nat Resource Management Div, Krishi Anusandhan Bhavan II, New Delhi 110012, India.",dagarjc@gmail.com,"Dagar, Jagdish/AAZ-4824-2021; ARUNACHALAM, AYYANADAR/ABA-4938-2020","ARUNACHALAM, AYYANADAR/0000-0002-0730-8177",,,,,55,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1875-1199,,978-81-322-1662-9; 978-81-322-1661-2,ADV AGROFOR,,,2014,,,,,1,19,,10.1007/978-81-322-1662-9_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-81-322-1662-9_1,10.1007/978-81-322-1662-9,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,BB1LY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000341191700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mesoscale numerical prediction models have matured, and recent advances in computer hardware make this a realizable objective. Two studies were launched to determine if a mesoscale model could be used operationally in theater and to select the model that produced the best forecast under simulated operational conditions. Of prime concern was not whether the model could produce reliable forecasts in data-rich areas, but how well the models operated and thus produced forecasts in data-sparse areas. The first study did an overall review of the available mesoscale numerical weather prediction models resulting in a general ranking of the models by expected forecast ability and operational maturity. At the conclusion of this study it became apparent that a more in-depth analysis was needed to distinguish among the higher-ranking models. Thus, this study was initiated. This study compared four models for quality of forecasts in different climate regions in the world. Two are considered state-of-the-art models that could easily be made operational. These are the Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5) and the Colorado State University Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The third model was the Navy Operational Regional Prediction System Version 6 (NORAPS6), the navy's operational regional forecast model. The fourth model is the current USAF mesoscale model, the Relocatable Window Model (RWM), that was used to provide a baseline of the current USAF capability. The models were scored by comparing the forecast values with observations. The relative ranking of the models varied with parameter, but overall, the rank order was RAMS, MM5, NORAPS6, and RWM.

Sol-Gel Spin-coating technique has been used to create thin films and subsequent characterization of the different sub-surfaces has been undertaken. The substrates are composed of ferritic oxide strengthened Fe-Cr alloy (ITM). A common challenge in coating these supports is their high roughness and porosity in comparison with state-of-the-art ceramic substrates. Here, the nickel and 8mol.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) based anode is made of graded layers, which reduces the roughness and porosity of the metal support. The quality of the thin spin-coated electrolyte-layers depends on the microstructure of the sub-surface. Influencial variables are the surface roughness, the pore size and its depth. To understand the dependencies between these variables and the coating properties, analyses with various optical measurement methods have been carried out prior to coating.

Over the past few decades, a wide range of materials with ice-shedding characteristics have been developed, including surfaces that are non-wetting/hydrophobic, liquid-infused, stress-localized, and those with low interfacial toughness. Although many of these materials have demonstrated low ice adhesion in a laboratory setting, none have achieved widespread practical adoption. This is primarily a result of the fact that they tend to have very low durability, limiting their applicability. Thus, the primary challenge in developing ice-shedding materials is finding materials with both low ice adhesion AND good durability. Here, we introduce the concept of a so-called fracture-controlled surface. Through coordinated mechanical and chemical heterogeneity in the material structure, we affect the interfacial crack nucleation and growth on these surfaces. Through this controlled process, fracture-controlled surfaces exhibit both low ice adhesion and very high mechanical durability. Measurements of the durability of these surfaces indicate performance that is three orders of magnitude greater than other state-of-the-art ice-shedding materials. Physically, via mechanical heterogeneity of the material, we pre-specified the crack nucleation coordinates at the interface and guided the crack growth in an interfacial plane, with no kinking in other directions. This helps to maximize the energy that goes towards crack nucleation and growth. A detailed mathematical model is developed to predict adhesion of external solid objects on these materials. The model suggests that an elastic matching criterion is required to achieve minimal adhesion of solid objects on these materials. Fracture-controlled surfaces provide a rich material platform to guide future innovation of materials with minimal adhesion while having very high durability.","[Nazifi, Sina; Huang, Zixu; Hakimian, Alireza; Ghasemi, Hadi] Univ Houston, Dept Mech Engn, 4726 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Ghasemi, Hadi] Univ Houston, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 4726 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Ghasemi, H (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Mech Engn, 4726 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.;Ghasemi, H (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 4726 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",hghasemi@uh.edu,,"Ghasemi, Hadi/0000-0002-0554-4248; Huang, Zhan/0000-0002-6875-8550; Huang, Zixu/0000-0003-1896-5874; Nazifi, Sina/0000-0002-5166-6959",Advanced Manufacturing Institute (AMI); UH Energy at University of Houston,Advanced Manufacturing Institute (AMI); UH Energy at University of Houston,We acknowledge the funding support by Advanced Manufacturing Institute (AMI) and UH Energy at University of Houston.

The associated perennial sea ice loss has economic and global security implications associated with Arctic Ocean navigability, since sea ice cover dictates whether an Arctic route is open to shipping. Thus, understanding changes in sea ice thickness, concentration and drift is essential for operation planning and routing. However, changes in sea ice cover on scales up to a few days and kilometers are challenging to detect and forecast; current sea ice models may not capture quickly-changing conditions on short timescales needed for navigation. Assimilating these predictive models requires frequent, high-resolution morphological information about the pack, which is operationally difficult. We suggest an approach to mitigate this challenge by using machine learning (ML) to interpret satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this study, we derive ML models for the analysis of SAR data to improve short-term local sea ice monitoring at high spatial resolutions, enabling more accurate analysis of Arctic navigability. We develop an algorithm/classifier that can analyze Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with the potential to inform operational sea ice forecasting models. We focus on detecting two sea ice features of interest to Arctic navigability: ridges and leads (fractures in the ice shelf). These can be considered local extremes in terms of ice thickness, a crucial parameter for navigation. We build models to detect these ice features using machine learning techniques. Both our ridge and lead detection models perform as well as, if not better than, state-of-the-art methods. These models demonstrate Sentinel-1's ability to capture sea ice conditions, suggesting the potential for Sentinel-1 global coverage imagery to inform sea ice forecasting models.","[Reinisch, Elena C.; Ren, Christopher X.; Ziemann, Amanda] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Intelligence & Space Res Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Roberts, Andrew] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Wilson, Cathy] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Eriksson, Patrick B.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, PB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Reinisch, EC (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Intelligence & Space Res Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",ecreinisch@lanl.gov; cren@lanl.gov; afroberts@lanl.gov; cjw@lanl.gov; Patrick.Eriksson@fmi.fi; ziemann@lanl.gov,,,Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory; European Space Agency for making Sentinel-1,Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory; European Space Agency for making Sentinel-1,This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Studying and monitoring plankton distribution is vital for global climate and environment protection. Currently, much research is concentrated on the automated recognition of plankton and several imaging-based technologies have been developed for collecting plankton images continuously using underwater image sensors. In this paper, we present a study about an automated plankton recognition system, which is based on the fusion of different deep learning methods. In this work we study both the fine tuning of several deep learned models and transfer learning from the same models with the aim of exploiting their diversity in designing an ensemble of classifiers, we deal with: (i) the ability of fine-tuning pre-trained CNN for plankton classification, (ii) the possibility of using pre-trained CNN for transfer learning, (iii) the possibility of coupling pre-processing to CNN in order to improve their feature extraction capability. The combination of such different descriptors/methods in a heterogeneous ensemble grants a substantial performance improvement with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches based on feature selection and classification. The experimental evaluation on three large publicly available datasets demonstrates high classification accuracy and f-measure of our ensemble with respect to other classifiers on the same datasets. One of the main contributions of this work is a collection of classification models and a wide experimental evaluation to report performance of both single CNN and ensemble of CNNs in different available plankton datasets with a given testing protocol. Moreover, we show how to combine different CNN in order to improve the performance.

Typical application is to scenarios with multiple height-distributed point-like scatterers, or with volumetric scatterers, allowing the solution of layover in urban or infrastructure areas, and the reconstruction of the vertical structure of forest or ice layers. This new 3-D radar imaging and information extraction ability is very important in complex remote sensing areas such as biosphere and cryosphere monitoring, related to critical environmental problems of global warming and climate change. After first theoretical and experimental investigations started around the 2000, thanks to many developments from several SAR remote sensing groups SAR tomography is now also being applied experimentally to new dedicated spaceborne SAR missions. The 3-D tomographic concept has been also extended to higher output dimension in the more recent differential tomography methods, producing 4-D (3-D + time) images, so bridging the gap between the mature differential interferometry and the advanced SAR tomography. Typical application in this case is to urban or complex infrastructure scenarios for improved deformation monitoring, in terms of density of the measurements, accuracy, and coverage of specific zones for single building application where layover phenomena can impair full deployment of differential interferometry. Application of 4-D differential tomography to forest layers with temporal decorrelation has also been proposed. This paper present an overview of the main state-of-the-art processing methods and typical experimental applications for three-dimensional and higher-dimensional tomographic SAR imaging, developed during the last decade or more, as an extension and updating of previous review papers. New trends for future developments are also pointed out.","[Lombardini, F.] Univ Pisa, Dip Ingn Informaz, Pisa, Italy; [Tebaldini, S.] Politecn Milan, Dip Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Milan, Italy",University of Pisa; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Lombardini, F (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dip Ingn Informaz, Pisa, Italy.",,,"TEBALDINI, STEFANO/0000-0002-1229-3811",,,,,36,3,4,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-6996,,978-1-5090-4951-6,INT GEOSCI REMOTE SE,,,2017,,,,,2460,2463,,,,,,4,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geology; Remote Sensing,BJ6TY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000426954602147,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concerning high resolution remote image images, encoding the spatial features in an efficient and robust fashion is the key to generating discriminatory models to classify them. Even though many visual descriptors have been proposed or successfully used to encode spatial features of remote sensing images, some applications, using this sort of images, demand more specific description techniques. Deep Learning, an emergent machine learning approach based on neural networks, is capable of learning specific features and classifiers at the same time and adjust at each step, in real time, to better fit the need of each problem. For several task, such image classification, it has achieved very good results, mainly boosted by the feature learning performed which allows the method to extract specific and adaptable visual features depending on the data. In this paper, we propose a novel network capable of learning specific spatial features from remote sensing images, with any pre-processing step or descriptor evaluation, and classify them. Specifically, automatic feature learning task aims at discovering hierarchical structures from the raw data, leading to a more representative information. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for urban planning, crop and forest management and climate modelling. The propose convolutional neural network has six layers: three convolutional, two fully-connected and one classifier layer. So, the five first layers are responsible to extract visual features while the last one is responsible to classify the images. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using two datasets: (i) the popular aerial image dataset UCMerced Land-use and, (ii) a multispectral high-resolution scenes of the Brazilian Coffee Scenes.

During recent years, knowledge about hydrochory and its ecological consequences has increased considerably and a substantial body of literature has been produced. Here, we review this literature and define the state of the art of the discipline. A substantial proportion of species growing in or near water have propagules (fruits, seeds or vegetative units) able to disperse by water, either floating, submerged in flowing water, or with the help of floating vessels. Hydrochory can enable plants to colonize sites out of reach with other dispersal vectors, but the timing of dispersal and mechanisms of establishment are important for successful establishment. At the population level, hydrochory may increase the effective size and longevity of populations, and control their spatial configuration. Hydrochory is also an important source of species colonizing recruitment-limited riparian and wetland communities, contributing to maintenance of community species richness. Dispersal by water may even influence community composition in different landscape elements, resulting in landscape-level patterns. Genetically, hydrochory may reduce spatial aggregation of genetically related individuals, lead to high gene flow among populations, and increase genetic diversity in populations receiving many propagules. Humans have impacted hydrochory in many ways. For example, dams affect hydrochory by reducing peak flows and hence dispersal capacity, altering the timing of dispersal, and by presenting physical barriers to dispersal, with consequences for riverine plant communities. Hydrochory has been inferred to be an important vector for the spread of many invasive species, but there is also the potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration by improving or restoring water dispersal pathways. Climate change may alter the role of hydrochory by modifying the hydrology of water-bodies as well as conditions for propagule release and plant colonization.","[Nilsson, Christer; Jansson, Roland] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Grp, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Brown, Rebecca L.] Eastern Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Cheney, WA 99004 USA; [Merritt, David M.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, NRRC, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Merritt, David M.] US Forest Serv, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",Umea University; Eastern Washington University; Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Nilsson, C (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Grp, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",christer.nilsson@emg.umu.se,"Nilsson, Christer/AAI-1354-2019; Jansson, Roland/B-7972-2013; Nilsson, Christer/I-9407-2012","Jansson, Roland/0000-0003-1767-7010; Brown, Rebecca/0000-0001-5726-809X; Nilsson, Christer/0000-0003-1186-8115",Swedish Research Council Formas; Eastern Washington University Foundation; Swedish Research Council; USDA Forest Service,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Eastern Washington University Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"We thank two journal reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript.

Ancient Egyptians built colossal temples and magnificent tombs to honor their gods and religious leaders. Their hieroglyphic language, system of organization, and recording of events give contemporary researchers insights into their daily activities. Based on the record left by their art, the ancient Egyptians documented the presence of dwarfs in almost every facet of life. Due to the hot dry climate and natural and artificial mummification, Egypt is a major source of :information on achondroplasia in the old world. The remains of dwarfs are abundant and include complete and pardal skeletons. Dwarfs were employed as personal attendants, animal tenders, jewelers, and entertainers. Several high-ranking dwarfs especially from the Old Kingdom (2700-2190 BCE) achieved important status and had lavish burial places close to the pyramids. Their costly tombs in the royal cemeteries and the inscriptions on their statutes indicate their high-ranking position in Egyptian society and their close relation to the king. Some of them were Seneb, Pereniankh, Klmumhotpe, and Djeder. There were at least two dwarf gods, Ptah and Bes. The god Ptah was associated with regeneration and rejuvenation. The god Bes was a protector of sexuality, childbirth, women, and children. He was a favored deity particularly during the Greco-Roman period. His temple was recently excavated in the Baharia oasis in the middle of Egypt. The burial sites and artistic sources provide glimpses of the positions of dwarfs in daily life in ancient Egypt. Dwarfs were accepted in ancient Egypt; their recorded daily activities suggest assimilation into daily life, and their disorder was not shown as a physical handicap. Wisdom writings and moral teachings in ancient Egypt commanded respect for dwarfs and other individuals with disabilities.

To save energy, the temperature inside these buildings is allowed to rise after business hours by setting back the thermostat. The objective is to predict the time of the end of thermostat setback (EoS) such that the design temperature inside the building is restored in time for the start of business hours. State-of-the-art building simulation software, ESP-r, was used to generate a database that covered the past 5 years. The software was used to calculate EoS for two office buildings using the climate records in Kuwait. The EoS data for 1995 and 1996 were used for training and testing the neural networks (NNs). The robustness of the trained NN was tested by applying them to a production data set (1997-1999) which the networks have never seen before. A parametric study showed that the optimum GRNN design is one that uses a genetic adaptive algorithm, a so-called City Block distance metric, and a linear scaling function for the input data. External hourly temperature readings were used as network inputs, and the thermostat end of setback (EoS) is the output. The NN predictions were improved by developing a neural control-scheme. This scheme is based on using the temperature readings as they become available. Six NNs were designed and trained for this purpose. The performance of the NN analysis was evaluated using a statistical indicator (the coefficient of multiple determination), and by examination of the error patterns. The results show that the neural control-scheme is a powerful instrument for optimizing air conditioning setback scheduling based on external temperature records. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We review the dynamics of global ocean heat transport variability, with an emphasis on timescales from monthly to interannual. We synthesize relatively simple dynamical ideas and show that together they explain heat transport variability in a state-of-the-art, high-resolution ocean general circulation model. Globally, the cross-equatorial seasonal heat transport fluctuations are close to +/-3 X 10(15) W, the same amplitude as the cross-equatorial seasonal atmospheric energy transport. The variability is concentrated within 20 degrees of the equator and dominated by the annual cycle. The majority of the variability is due to wind-induced current fluctuations in which the time-varying wind drives Ekman layer mass transports that are compensated by depth-independent return flows. The temperature difference between the mass transports gives rise to the time-dependent heat transport. It is found that in the heat budget the divergence of the time-varying heat transport is largely balanced by changes in heat storage. Despite the Ekman transport's strong impact on the time-dependent heat transport, the largely depth-independent character of its associated meridional overturning stream function means that it does not affect estimates of the time-mean heat transport made by one-time hydrographic surveys. Away from the tropics the heat transport variability associated with the depth-independent gyre and depth-dependent circulations is much weaker than the Ekman variability. The non-Ekman contributions can amount to a 0.2- 0.4 X 10(15) W standard deviation in the heat transport estimated from a one-time hydrographic survey.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, WHOI Joint Program Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA USA; Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Jayne, SR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, NOAA, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,"Jayne, Steven/0000-0001-7999-0147",,,,,92,149,150,2,33,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",8755-1209,,,REV GEOPHYS,Rev.

Owing to the capacity to produce toxins as secondary metabolites, cyanobacteria may cause huge economic losses in the fishing and aquaculture industries and poisoning incidents to humans due to their accumulation in the food chain. The conditions which promote toxic blooms have not yet been fully understood, but climate change and anthropogenic intervention are pointed as significant factors. For the detection of toxins in edible marine organisms, the establishment of international regulations and compulsory surveillance has been probed as exceptionally effective. However, not regulation nor monitoring have been settled concerning emergent marine toxins. In the light of this scenario, it becomes essential to apply fast and reliable surveillance methodologies for the early detection of cyanobacterial blooms as well as the occurrence of emergent marine toxins. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has potential to become a powerful diagnostic tool in the fields of food safety and One Health surveillance. This culture-independent approach overcomes limitations of traditional microbiological techniques; it allows a quick and accurate assessment of a complex microbial community, including quantitative identification and functional characterisation, in a single experiment. In the framework of the EU-FORA fellowship, with the final goal of evaluate metagenomics as a promising risk assessment tool, the fellow worked on the development of an innovative workflow through state-of-the-art molecular and chemical analytical procedures. This work programme aims to evaluate the occurrence of emergent marine toxins and the producing organisms in Cabo Verde coastal cyanobacteria blooms. Our results show the outstanding potential of a holistic metagenomic approach for the risk assessment of emergent marine toxins and the producing organisms. Additionally, we have also highlighted its value for the identification and evaluation of secondary metabolites as natural bioactive compounds with biotechnological and industrial interest.","[Garcia-Cazorla, Y.; Vasconcelos, V.] Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMA, Matosinhos, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Garcia-Cazorla, Y (corresponding author), Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMA, Matosinhos, Portugal.",eu-fora@efsa.europa.eu,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",,1831-4732,,EFSA J,EFSA J.,MAY,2022,,,SI,,,,e200422,10.2903/j.efsa.2022.e200422,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2022.e200422,,,9,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,1M2HD,35634545,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000799793900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The associations among individual differences in aesthetic engagement, proneness to aesthetic chill, and the experience of awe were examined in two studies (total N = 1,340). In Study 1, psychometric properties and convergent/discriminant validity of a brief measure of proneness to aesthetic chill experiences across an expanded set of stimulus domains were examined in two samples. The association between reported proneness to aesthetic chill and the Openness to Aesthetics facet was confirmed in both studies. Factor analysis and item-total correlations provide preliminary evidence that proneness to aesthetic chill is not domain specific (i.e., individuals prone to aesthetic chill in one domain [e.g., music] are also prone in other domains [e.g., nature]). In a laboratory study, individual differences in awe response to an aesthetic film clip (vs. other emotion-inducing film clips) were examined. Results indicated that the Aesthetics facet and ratings of proneness to aesthetic chill were related to higher awe ratings and reported chill/goosebumps to the film clip, as well as dispositional awe. Agreeableness was also associated with experimentally induced awe, and extraversion had a modest association with dispositional awe ratings. Across both dispositional and experimental induction, however, individual differences in aesthetic engagement and reported proneness to aesthetic chill demonstrated the strongest, most consistent, and most specific associations with awe.","[Williams, Paula G.; Johnson, Kimberley T.; Bride, Daniel L.; Baucom, Brian R.

Rapeseed and mustard (R&M) is the predominant oilseed crop in Assam and is very much sensitive to climatic factors compared to other crops grown during rabi season. In the context of recent climate variability observed in the Brahmaputra valley, development of efficient yield forecasting models for R&M based on weather parameters would certainly help the policy makers in formulating appropriate policies and decision-making. The present study was undertaken to develop R&M pre-harvest yield forecast models at F1 (flowering), F2 (siliqua formation) and F3 (siliqua development & maturity) stages for 15 districts of Assam using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques by analysing the yield and weather data for 27 years and to investigate the impact of weather factors in determining the yield of R&M. The results were enumerated based on coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) values. ANN models were found to have greater R-2 values over SMLR at all the three stages of forecast except in 2-3 districts. Similarly, profound improvement was observed in RMSE and RMSEn values of the forecast models using ANN technique. Analysing the percent error between observed and forecasted yield, ANN weather-based models were found to give more accurate pre-harvest yield prediction of R&M in the Brahmaputra valley of Assam. Temperature and relative humidity were found to be the most significant parameters in affecting R&M yield in most of the districts during all the three stages of forecast.","[Kakati, Nishigandha; Deka, Rajib Lochan; Das, Parishmita; Khanikar, Punya Gogoi] Assam Agr Univ, Dept Agr Meteorol, Jorhat, Assam, India; [Goswami, Jogesh] Assam Agr Univ, Dept Agron, Jorhat, Assam, India; [Saikia, Hemanta] Assam Agr Univ, Dept Agr Stat, Jorhat, Assam, India",Assam Agricultural University; Assam Agricultural University; Assam Agricultural University,"Deka, RL (corresponding author), Assam Agr Univ, Dept Agr Meteorol, Jorhat, Assam, India.",rldeka2011@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

However, they are at times exposed to accidents, such as fire caused due to natural hazards and human activities. Such unforeseen fire accidents have a social, economic, and environmental impact on mountain towns worldwide. Protecting mountains from such fire accidents is also very challenging in terms of the high cost of fire containment resources, tracking fire spread, and evacuating the people at risk. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a three-fold methodology for fire safety in the mountains. The first part of the methodology is an optimization model for effective fire containment resource utilization. The second part of the methodology is a novel ensemble model based on machine learning, the heuristic approach, and principal component regression for predictive analytics of fire spread data. The final part of the methodology consists of an Internet of Things-based task orchestration approach to notify fire safety information to safety authorities. The proposed three-fold fire safety approach provides in-time information to safety authorities for making on-time decisions to minimize the damage caused by mountain fire with minimum containment cost. The performance of optimization models is evaluated in terms of execution time and cost. The particle swarm optimization-based model performs better in terms of cost, whereas the bat algorithm performs better in terms of execution time. The prediction models' performance is evaluated in terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. The proposed ensemble-based prediction model accuracy for fire spread and burned area prediction is higher than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. It is evident from the results that the proposed fire safety mechanism is a step towards efficient mountain fire safety management.","[Imran; Iqbal, Naeem; Kim, Do Hyeun] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju 63243, South Korea; [Ahmad, Shabir] Univ Engn & Technol Mardan, Software Engn Dept, Mardan 23200, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Shabir] Gachon Univ, Dept IT Convergence Engn, Seongnam Si 461701, South Korea",Jeju National University; Gachon University,"Kim, D (corresponding author), Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju 63243, South Korea.",imranjofficial@jejunu.ac.kr; naeemiqbal@jejunu.ac.kr; shabir@gachon.ac.kr; kimdh@jejunu.ac.kr,"Iqbal, Naeem/ABG-1525-2021; Ahmad, Shabir/N-3850-2018; , Imran/AAW-7117-2020","Iqbal, Naeem/0000-0003-2749-6344; Ahmad, Shabir/0000-0002-8788-2717; , Imran/0000-0002-6197-1025",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1D1A1A090 82919]; Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government(MSIT) [2018-0-01456],"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government(MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2018R1D1A1A090 82919), and this work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.2018-0-01456, AutoMaTa: Autonomous Management framework based on artificial intelligent Technology for adaptive and disposable IoT), Any correspondence related to this paper should be addressed to DoHyeun Kim.",,59,14,14,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,5,,,,,,2461,10.3390/su13052461,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052461,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QW5FO,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000628675700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate control of the environments constitutes a major problem in the hospital field, and it has effects not only in the realization of new facilities, but also in the renovations. The systems must be designed and engineered with a full integration with the global project, which is simple in the case of new construction, more difficult in the event of restructuring, since it is necessary to interact with restrictive constraints conditioning, such a distribution of complex and articulated spaces. In design of the systems of a hospital building, two fundamental aspects must be ensured: total control of the thermo-hygrometric parameters (temperature, humidity and air velocity), and the possibility of the control and adjusting - for the single areas-of flows and air changes within individual rooms. The conditioning systems of the hospitals are supposed to represent the state of arts, in terms of technological research and energy savings, maintaining overall the highest level of welfare, for operators and user. In fact, less than half of modern health facilities are newly built and only 34% have been completed after 1971. In addition, from specific regulatory perspective, for air-conditioning systems in hospital buildings, in Italy there is no real legislative/regulatory corpus.

About five thousand years ago, one of the most ancient, important and enduring civilisations in the historyof Mankind flourished on the banks of the Nile. In Egypt, all the branches of human knowledge attained a high degree of development and today it is considered the mother of medicine. Despite the marked religious component that affected all its activities, the medicine of the Pharaohs was practised in a rational and deductive manner, and the Egyptians were the inventors of clinical observation. Development The desert climate of the Nile Valley has preserved monuments, mummies and papyruses which have enabled us to get a certain idea of the degree of development reached in medical matters. The aim of this work is to analyse them from a neuroscientific point of view. The anatomical discoveries of the Egyptians originated in the inspection of wounds and the practice of embalming. They came to know a large number of diagnoses and were able to prescribe many different forms of treatment. They also attained a certain proficiency in dealing with neurotraumatological patients. They practised anamnesis, prognostics and a regulated surgery that infrequently included trephination. Their conservatism meant that, after the Macedonian domination, the traditional Egyptian medicine was replaced the Greek medicinal arts, which reached their maximum period of splendour in the School of Alexandria, where Herophilus and Erasistratus, pioneers in the study of anatomy and brain circulation, were especially renowned. Conclusions. From the point of view of the neurosciences, the Egyptians were the first to describe the brain, migraine, epilepsy, strokes, tetanus, Bell's palsy and the sequelae of head injuries and of spinal transection. Their artwork sometimes shows neurological patients and, according to Herodotus, there were doctors who were specialised in 'head diseases' and could therefore be considered the precursors of our present-day neurologists.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Hosp del Aire, Neurol Serv, Madrid, Spain; Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Farm, Dept Tecnol Medicamento, Alcala De Henares, Spain; Helwan Univ, Dept Hist & Civilizac Egipcias & Egiptol Faraon, Cairo, Egypt",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de Alcala; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University,,amartina@medynet.com,,,,,,,181,13,13,0,13,REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA,BARCELONA,"C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN",0210-0010,1576-6578,,REV NEUROLOGIA,Rev.

The link between thermal comfort, productivity, and health is common knowledge, and researchers have developed many state-of-the-art thermal-sensation models from dozens of research projects over the last 50 years. In addition to these, the use of intelligent data-analysis techniques, such as black-box artificial neural networks (ANNs), is receiving research attention with the aim of designing building thermal-behavior models from collected data. With the convergence of the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), smart buildings now protect us and keep us comfortable while saving energy and cutting emissions. These types of smart buildings play a vital role in building smart cities of the future. The aim of this study is to help facility managers predict the thermal sensation of the occupants under the given circumstances. To achieve this, we applied a data-driven approach to predict the thermal sensation of occupants of an indoor environment using previously collected data. Our main contribution is to design and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) for predicting thermal sensations with a high degree of accuracy regardless of building type, climate zone, or a building's heating and/or ventilation methods. We used the second version of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Global Thermal Comfort Database to train our model. The hyperparameter-tuning process of the proposed model is optimized using the Bayesian strategy and predicts the thermal sensation of occupants with 78% accuracy, which is much higher than the traditional predicted mean vote (PMV) model and the other shallow and deep networks compared.","[Cakir, Mustafa] Istanbul Kultur Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34158 Istanbul, Turkey; [Akbulut, Akhan] Istanbul Kultur Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34158 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Kultur University; Istanbul Kultur University,"Cakir, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Kultur Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34158 Istanbul, Turkey.",1009112001@stu.iku.edu.tr,,,,,,,38,1,1,8,55,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,,,,,5193,5206,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140951,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,YL2DB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000745706500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal was to exchange experiences, discuss challenges, and consider future directions for further developing these methods and strategies for their use in archaeology. After the event, this special journal issue was arranged to publish papers that are based on the workshop presentations, but also to incorporate work that is produced by other researchers in the field. This paper closes the special issue and further aims to provide current state-of-the-art for the methods represented by the workshop. Here, we introduce the aspects that inspired the organisation of the meeting, a summary of the 12 presentations and eight paper contributions, as well as a discussion about the main outcomes of the workshop roundtables, including the production of two searchable databases (online resources and equipment). We conclude with the position that the 'North', together with its unique cultural heritage and thriving research community, is at the forefront of good practice in the application and development of sensing methods in archaeological research and management. However, further method development is required, so we claim the support of funding bodies to back research efforts based on testing/experimental studies to: explore unknown survey environments and identify optimal survey conditions, as well as to monitor the preservation of archaeological remains, especially those that are at risk. It is demonstrated that remote sensing and geophysics not only have an important role in the safeguarding of archaeological sites from development and within prehistorical-historical research, but the methods can be especially useful in recording and monitoring the increased impact of climate change on sites in the North.","[Cuenca-Garcia, Carmen; Risbol, Ole; Stamnes, Arne Anderson; Skoglund, Fredrik; Odegard, Oyvind] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, NTNU Univ Museum, Dept Archaeol & Cultural Hist, Erling Skakkes Gate 47B, N-7012 Trondheim, Norway; [Bates, C.

This paper presents a framework of a deep neural network (DNN) that improves the accuracy of satellite precipitation products, focusing on reducing the bias and false alarms. The state-of-the-art deep learning techniques developed in the area of machine learning specialize in extracting structural information from a massive amount of image data, which fits nicely into the task of retrieving precipitation data from satellite cloud images. Stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE), a widely used DNN, is applied to perform bias correction of satellite precipitation products. A case study is conducted on the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) with spatial resolution of 0.08 degrees x 0.08 degrees over the central United States, where SDAE is used to process satellite cloud imagery to extract information over a window of 15 x 15 pixels. In the study, the summer of 2012 (June-August) and the winter of 2012/13 (December-February) serve as the training periods, while the same seasons of the following year (summer of 2013 and winter of 2013/14) are used for validation purposes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology outside the study area, three more regions are selected for additional validation. Significant improvements are achieved in both rain/no-rain (R/NR) detection and precipitation rate quantification: the results make 33% and 43% corrections on false alarm pixels and 98% and 78% bias reductions in precipitation rates over the validation periods of the summer and winter seasons, respectively.","[Tao, Yumeng; Gao, Xiaogang; Hsu, Kuolin; Sorooshian, Soroosh] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E4130 Engn Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Ihler, Alexander] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Tao, YM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E4130 Engn Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",yumengt@uci.edu,"Hsu, Kuolin/E-6120-2019; sorooshian, soroosh/B-3753-2008","sorooshian, soroosh/0000-0001-7774-5113; Ihler, Alexander/0000-0002-4331-1015; HSU, KUOLIN/0000-0002-3578-3565",NSF Cyber-Enabled Sustainability Science and Engineering [CCF-1331915]; U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-11-1-0422]; NASA Precipitation Measurement Mission [NNX13AN60G]; NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship [NNX15AN86H]; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1331915] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF Cyber-Enabled Sustainability Science and Engineering; U.S. Army Research Office; NASA Precipitation Measurement Mission; NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"Financial support for this study is made available from the NSF Cyber-Enabled Sustainability Science and Engineering (Grant CCF-1331915), the U.S. Army Research Office (Grant W911NF-11-1-0422), the NASA Precipitation Measurement Mission (Grant NNX13AN60G), and the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (Grant NNX15AN86H).",,39,81,83,7,95,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

In this study we aim to gain insights regarding the ability of positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify and quantify the OA sources accurately. We performed PMF and multilinear engine (ME-2) analysis on the predictions of a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (PMCAMx-SR, Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions - source resolved) during a photochemically active period for specific sites in Europe in an effort to interpret the diverse factors usually identified by PMF analysis of field measurements. Our analysis used the predicted concentrations of 27 OA components, assuming that each of them is chemically different from the others. The PMF results based on the chemical transport model predictions are quite consistent (same number of factors and source types) with those of the analysis of AMS measurements. The estimated uncertainty of the contribution of fresh biomass burning is less than 30% and of the other primary sources less than 40 %, when these sources contribute more than 20% to the total OA. The PMF uncertainty increases for smaller source contributions, reaching a factor of 2 or even 3 for sources which contribute less than 10% to the OA. One of the major questions in PMF analysis of AMS measurements concerns the sources of the two or more oxygenated OA (OOA) factors often reported in field studies. Our analysis suggests that these factors include secondary OA compounds from a variety of anthropogenic and biogenic sources and do not correspond to specific sources. Their characterization in the literature as low- and high-volatility factors is probably misleading, because they have overlapping volatility distributions. However, the average volatility of the one often characterized as a low-volatility factor is indeed lower than that of the other (high-volatility factor). Based on the analysis of the PMCAMx-SR predictions, the first oxygenated OA factor includes mainly highly aged OA transported from outside Europe, but also highly aged secondary OA from precursors emitted in Europe. The second oxygenated OA factor contains fresher secondary organic aerosol from volatile, semivolatile, and intermediate volatility anthropogenic and biogenic organic compounds. The exact contribution of these OA components to each OA factor depends on the site and the prevailing meteorology during the analysis period.","[Drosatou, Anthoula D.; Theodoritsi, Georgia N.; Pandis, Spyros N.] Univ Patras, Dept Chem Engn, Patras, Greece; [Drosatou, Anthoula D.; Skyllakou, Ksakousti; Theodoritsi, Georgia N.; Pandis, Spyros N.] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH ICE HT, Inst Chem Engn Sci, Patras, Greece; [Pandis, Spyros N.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Patras; Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences (ICE-HT); Carnegie Mellon University,"Pandis, SN (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Chem Engn, Patras, Greece.;Pandis, SN (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH ICE HT, Inst Chem Engn Sci, Patras, Greece.;Pandis, SN (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",spyros@chemeng.upatras.gr,"Pandis, Spyros/AAW-3089-2021; Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020","Pandis, Spyros/0000-0001-8085-9795; Skyllakou, Ksakousti/0000-0002-1630-3474","US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center for Air, Climate and Energy Solutions (CACES) [R835873]","US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center for Air, Climate and Energy Solutions (CACES)","This work has been supported by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center for Air, Climate and Energy Solutions (CACES) (grant number R835873).

It focuses on current research trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research. Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified, which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective operation and management strategies of buildings and districts. Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and thus more effectively promotes a cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable environmental assessments.","[Fnais, Abdulrahman; Rezgui, Yacine; Petri, Ioan; Beach, Thomas; Yeung, Jonathan; Ghoroghi, Ali] Cardiff Univ, BRE Trust Ctr Sustainable Engn, Sch Engn, Cardiff, Wales; [Fnais, Abdulrahman] King Saud Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Kubicki, Sylvain] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",Cardiff University; King Saud University; Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology,"Fnais, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, BRE Trust Ctr Sustainable Engn, Sch Engn, Cardiff, Wales.;Fnais, A (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",fnaisas@cardiff.ac.uk; RezguiY@cardiff.ac.uk; PetriI@cardiff.ac.uk; BeachTH@cardiffac.uk; YeungJ@cardiff.ac.uk; Ghoroghi@cardiff.ac.uk; sylvain.kubicki@list.lu,"Rezgui, Yacine/ABE-6712-2020; PETRI, IOAN/E-6136-2017","Rezgui, Yacine/0000-0002-5711-8400; Ghoroghi, Ali/0000-0001-5594-7275; PETRI, IOAN/0000-0002-1625-8247; Kubicki, Sylvain/0000-0003-2985-0378","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK; Fond National de la Recherche (FNR) in Luxembourg [EP/T019514/1, INTER/UKRI/19/14106247]",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Fond National de la Recherche (FNR) in Luxembourg,The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK and Fond National de la Recherche (FNR) in Luxembourg for their financial support for the research under grant agreement (EP/T019514/1; INTER/UKRI/19/14106247).,,200,1,1,22,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

HiRISE, at the L1 Lagrangian point, would provide meter class FUV imaging and spectro-imaging, EUV and XUV imaging and spectroscopy, magnetic fields measurements, and ambitious and comprehensive coronagraphy by a remote external occulter (two satellites formation flying 375 m apart, with a coronagraph on a chaser satellite).

Innovative materials can help to reach these policy goals, but they need to be safe and sustainable themselves. Thus, one aim is to shift the development of chemicals to Safe-and Sustainable-by-Design, and define a new systems approach and criteria for sustainability to achieve this. An online workshop was organised in September 2020 by the Joint Research Centre and the Directorate-General Research and Innovation of the European Commission, with participants from academia, non-governmental organisations, industry and regulatory bodies. The aims were to introduce the concept of Safe-and Sustainable-by-Design, to identify industrial and regulatory challenges in achieving safer and more sustainable Smart Nanomaterials as an example of innovative materials, and to deliver recommendations for directions and actions necessary to meet these challenges. The following needs were identified: (i) an agreed terminology, (ii) a common understanding of the principles of Safe-and Sustainable-by-Design, iii) criteria, assessment tools and incentives to achieve a transition from Safe-by-Design to Safe-and Sustainable-by-Design, and (iv) preparedness of regulators and legislation for innovative chemicals/nanomaterials. This paper presents the authors' view on the state of the art as well as the needs for future activities, based on discussions at the workshop and further considerations. The case of Smart Nanomaterials is used to illustrate the Safe-and Sustainable-by-Design concept and challenges for its implementation. Most of the considerations can be extended to other advanced materials and to chemicals and products in general.","[Mech, Agnieszka; Gottardo, Stefania; Amenta, Valeria; Belz, Susanne; Farcal, Lucian; Jantunen, Paula; Rasmussen, Kirsten; Sintes, Juan Riego; Rauscher, Hubert] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Amodio, Alessia; Bowadt, Soren; Drbohlavova, Jana; Malyska, Aleksandra] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Res & Innovat DG RTD, Brussels, Belgium; [Amodio, Alessia; Bowadt, Soren] European Hlth & Digital Execut Agcy HADEA, Brussels, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Rauscher, H (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy.",hubert.rauscher@ec.europa.eu,,,"European Commission's Joint Research Centre, - EU","European Commission's Joint Research Centre, - EU","The authors wish to convey a heartfelt thanks to the speakers and the participants of the workshop for sharing information, scientific insights and active discussions, which have all contributed to the overview information presented here, and without which the present work would have been impossible, especially the presenters at the workshop (listed in alphabetical order): Astrid Avellan (CESAM, University of Aveiro, Portugal & Carnegie Mellon University, USA), Qasim Chaudhry (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety [SCCS], Belgium), Takis Daskaleros (European Commission, DG SANTE), Mark Falinski (Yale University, USA), Manuela Franchi (Tetra Pak Packaging Solutions S.p.A., Italy), Khara Grieger (Genetic Engineering and Society Center, NC State University, USA), Gloria Guidetti (Tetra Pak Packaging Solutions S.p.A., Italy), Roland Hischier (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology [EMPA]), Arnd Hoeveler (European Commission, JRC), Klaus Kummerer (Leuphana University, Germany), Iraida Loinaz (CIDETEC, Spain), Michael Neaves (European Environmental Citizens' Organisation for Standardisation [ECOS], Belgium), Agnes Oomen (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment [RIVM], the Netherlands), Dmitri Petrovykh (International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory [INL] Portugal), Roberto Scazzola (European Commission, DG GROW), Blanca Suarez (TEMAS Solutions, Switzerland; now Nanotechnology Industries Association [NIA], Belgium), Abdelqader Sumrein (European Chemicals Agency [ECHA], Finland), Jose Tarazona (European Food Safety Authority [EFSA], Italy), Barend Verachtert (European Commission, DG RTD).; We also thank our colleague Vikram Kestens (JRC) for comments to earlier versions of the paper.; This work was funded through the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, which is financed through the EU's Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe).",,87,3,3,6,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0273-2300,1096-0295,,REGUL TOXICOL PHARM,Regul.

Existing machine learning-based SM estimation methods mainly belong to a single model, which may be unstable and probably lacks adaptability when switching to other sites. In addition, the in situ observations are usually inadequate, deteriorating the generalization performance of a single model. To overcome the above issues, we design two novel ensemble learning models based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR) for SM estimation. One is bagging embedded with GPR (BAGGPR), which is a parallel algorithm designed by randomly selecting multiple data subsets to train an ensemble of GPR models. The other is gradient boosting (BOOST) embedded with GPR (GBGPR), which is a sequential algorithm built by iteratively learning the residual between the previous prediction and its true value. In GBGPR, we also propose an improved Huber loss function by applying square loss on different residuals. The proposed methods greatly enhance the stability, adaptability, and generalization performance of a single GPR model. Experiments are conducted in the continental U.S. (CONUS) between April 2015 and March 2016, where BAGGPR and GBGPR are tested to estimate SM based on 11 multisource remote sensing features. The results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform other state-of-the-art models, including thirteen single models and three ensemble models, with R being 0.8958 and 0.9047, and root mean square error (RMSE) being 0.0513 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.0490 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, for BAGGPR and GBGPR. Moreover, the proposed methods can well capture spatial dynamics, and they have higher consistent with the in situ measurements, better generalization performance in terms of training data, and higher adaptability to different in situ networks.","[Xue, Zhaohui; Zhang, Yujuan; Li, Hao] Hohai Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Xue, Zhaohui; Zhang, Yujuan; Li, Hao] Hohai Univ, Jiangsu Prov Engn Res Ctr Water Resources & Envir, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ling] Jiangsu Maritime Inst, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University,"Xue, ZH (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China.",zhaohui.xue@hhu.edu.cn,"Xue, Zhaohui/K-3413-2014","Xue, Zhaohui/0000-0001-6253-2967",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971279]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200202012],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41971279 and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant B200202012.,,71,3,3,14,16,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

The assessment of such losses involves extremely difficult and original tasks because of the scarcity of data in countries with an arid climate. The main objective of this paper is to develop models for the simulation of pan-evaporation with the help of Penman and Hamon's equations, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and the Artificial Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The results from five types of ANN models with different training functions were compared to find the best possible training function. The impact of using various input variables was investigated as an original contribution of this research. The average temperature and mean wind speed were found to be the most influential parameters. The estimation of parameters for Penman and Hamon's equations was quite a daunting task. These parameters were estimated using a state of the art optimization algorithm, namely General Reduced Gradient Technique. The results of the Penman and Hamon's equations, ANN, and ANFIS were compared. Thirty-eight years (from 1980 to 2018) of manually recorded pan-evaporation data regarding mean daily values of a month, including the relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration, and temperature, were collected from three gauging stations situated in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia. The Nash and Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) evaluated the performance of pan-evaporation modeling techniques. The study shows that the ANFIS simulation results were better than those of ANN and Penman and Hamon's equations. The findings of the present research will help managers, engineers, and decision makers to sustainability manage natural water resources in warm-arid regions.","[Ghumman, Abdul Razzaq; Jamaan, Mohammed; Shafiquzzaman, Md; Haider, Husnain; Al Salamah, Ibrahim Saleh] Qassim Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Buraydah 51431, Saudi Arabia; [Ahmad, Afaq] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taxila 47080, Pakistan; [Ghazaw, Yousry Mahmoud] Alexandria Univ, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Alexandria 21544, Egypt; [Ghazaw, Yousry Mahmoud] Onaizah Coll, Coll Engn & Informat Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Onaizah 56447, Saudi Arabia",Qassim University; University of Engineering & Technology Taxila; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University,"Haider, H (corresponding author), Qassim Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Buraydah 51431, Saudi Arabia.",abdul.razzaq@qec.edu.sa; mmaa1413@outlook.com; afaq.ahmad@uettaxila.edu.pk; shafiq@qec.edu.sa; husnain@qec.edu.sa; alsalamah@qec.edu.sa; ghazaw@yahoo.com,"Ahmad, Afaq/O-5277-2019; Ghumman, Abdul/ACR-2406-2022; Ahmad, Afaq/GPK-3966-2022","Ahmad, Afaq/0000-0001-9427-4296; Ghumman, Abdul/0000-0002-4439-2013; Al-Salamah, Ibrahim/0000-0001-7880-8964; Ghazaw, Yousry/0000-0002-5163-2660; Haider, Husnain/0000-0002-8600-8315; Shafiquzzaman, Md./0000-0003-0226-9823",,,,,57,4,4,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2021,6,,,,,,793,10.3390/w13060793,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13060793,,,26,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,SE3LX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000651973400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to examine the entire process, a new parameterization scheme for rain-induced sea surface roughness was incorporated in the two-way atmosphere-ocean wave coupled system Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System (CHAOS). The simulation of the late October 2012 Hurricane Sandy indicates that the complex rain-on-ocean effect primarily modifies sea surface roughness and attenuates both the atmospheric flow and the ocean wave growth. The heterogeneity of roughness variations modulates the asymmetry of the hurricane and affects its central pressure and its track as well. Comparing with in situ and remotely sensed data, the consideration of rain-on-ocean effect reduces the root-mean-square error up to 8% and 11% for wind speed and significant wave height, respectively, and finally improves Sandy's track offshore eastern U.S. coastline. Plain Language Summary The atmosphere and the ocean consist of a coupled system, exchanging mass and energy at the air-sea interface and determining Earth's climate characteristics. Understanding and analyzing to which extent the atmosphere and the ocean actually talk to each other is the subject of air-sea interactions. However, one of the most understudied and less understood processes in air-sea interaction studies is the effect of rain on the sea state, which is not currently incorporated in the state-of-the-art modeling systems. The exact knowledge of this complex effect can potentially improve the forecast skill of the weather and the ocean wave predictions supporting in that manner the natural hazards' preparedness and mitigation planning.","[Katsafados, P.; Varlas, G.; Spyrou, C.] Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Geog, Athens, Greece; [Papadopoulos, A.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Anavissos, Greece; [Korres, G.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, Anavissos, Greece",Harokopio University Athens; Hellenic Centre for Marine Research; Hellenic Centre for Marine Research,"Katsafados, P (corresponding author), Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Geog, Athens, Greece.",pkatsaf@hua.gr,"Varlas, George/L-8082-2019; Spyrou, Christos/ABA-9919-2020; Papadopoulos, Anastasios/L-6578-2013","Varlas, George/0000-0001-7929-9452; Spyrou, Christos/0000-0002-3074-3230; Papadopoulos, Anastasios/0000-0002-4441-3443; KATSAFADOS, PETROS/0000-0001-7452-0138; Korres, Gerasimos/0000-0001-7036-4123",,,,,30,13,13,0,5,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Consequently, a number of countries are currently introducing river basin management, which, besides management along hydrological boundaries, has recently come to include such aspects of governance as stakeholder participation and policy integration. Beginning with a discussion of the goals and limitations of river basin management, this paper describes how the concept has been implemented in South Africa-a country that has been lauded for its state-of-the-art water legislation, but whose water administration is currently struggling to implement it. The example begins by showing the limitations of focusing on the dimension of spatial fit: a perfect spatial fit in basin management is almost impossible owing to the nature of the resource and to social and economic requirements. There are trade-offs between the identification of hydrological boundaries (which sometimes proves difficult) and boundaries of social organization, such as a feasible size for effective management, meaningful stakeholder participation, and financial viability. Furthermore, the improved spatial fit of the institutional arrangement and water resource boundaries causes problems of interplay by increasing the need for coordination and cooperation among water management organizations at different levels and on different scales. The example then considers the relevance of other dimensions of water management. It shows that, besides the focus on spatial fit, there is a need to recognize major defining features or boundaries to the problem other than hydrological boundaries, such as those imposed by water service infrastructure (functional fit) and impacts of climate change (dynamic fit), and a need to acknowledge the political and economic dimensions of water management.","German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Herrfahrdt-Pahle, E (corresponding author), German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,68,9,9,0,20,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

They can be made only from raw milk possessing specific features, which is processed through the 'art of the cheesemaker. In general, the distinctive sensorial traits of PDO cheese cannot be achieved under different environmental-production conditions for two main reasons: (1) some milk features are linked to specific animal production systems: (2) cheese ripening is affected by the interaction between milk (specific) and the traditional technology applied to the transformation process (non-specific). Also, the environment for a good ripening stage can be quite specific and not reproducible. With reference to milk, factors of typicality are species and/or breed, pedoclimatic conditions, animal management system and feeding. Other factors that influence cheese quality are milk treatments, milk processing and the ripening procedures. The technology applied to most cheeses currently known as PDO utilizes only raw milk, rennet and natural lactic acid bacteria, so that milk must be, at its origin, suitable for processing. The specific milk characteristics that ensure a high success rate for PDO cheeses are high protein content and good renneting properties, appropriate fat content with appropriate fatty acid composition and the presence of chemical flavours originating from local feeds. Moreover, an appropriate microflora is also of major importance. The factors that contribute to achieving milk suitable for transformation into PDO cheese are genetics, age, lactation stage, season and climate, general management and health conditions, milking and particularly feeding, which affect nutrient availability, endocrine response and health status, and also the presence of microbes and chemical substances which enrich or reduce the milk-cheese quality. Many of these factors are regulated by the Producer Associations. However, the secret of the success of PDO cheeses is the combination of modem technology and tradition, with the objective of adapting the product to market demand, without losing specificity, originality and authenticity.","Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Agr, Ist Zootecn, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Bertoni, G (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Agr, Ist Zootecn, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy.",bertoni@pc.unicatt.it,,,,,,,162,37,37,2,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0029-6651,1475-2719,,P NUTR SOC,Proc.

It (1) employs state of the art programs and follows best practices in fungal high-throughput metabarcoding; (2) consists of modules and scripts easily modifiable by the user to ensure maximum flexibility with regard to specific needs of a project or future methodological developments; and (3) is straightforward to use, also in classroom settings. We provide detailed descriptions and revision techniques for each step, thus giving the user maximum control over data treatment and avoiding a black-box approach. Employing this pipeline will improve and speed up the tedious and error-prone process of cleaning fungal Illumina metabarcoding data.","[Balint, Miklos; Schmidt, Philipp-Andre; Thines, Marco; Schmitt, Imke] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmidt, Philipp-Andre; Sharma, Rahul; Thines, Marco; Schmitt, Imke] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Okol Evolut & Diversitat, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Schmitt, I (corresponding author), Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",miklos.balint@senckenberg.de; imke.schmitt@senckenberg.de,,"Schmidt, Philipp-Andre/0000-0001-7704-5096","LOEWE - Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlichokonomischer Exzellenz of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","LOEWE - Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlichokonomischer Exzellenz of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","This study was funded by LOEWE - Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlichokonomischer Exzellenz of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts.",,37,83,86,0,170,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The reason why FLUENT can cope with extremely complex terrain, which can not be coped with by mesoscale models, relies on some particular techniques adopted by FLUENT, such as computer-aided design (CAD) technique, unstructured grid technique and finite volume method.

Smaller farms generally have different planted crops, yields, agricultural inputs, and irrigation applications compared to larger farms. However, gridded farm-size-specific data that are moreover crop specific, are currently lacking. This obscures our understanding of differences between smallscale and large-scale farms, e.g., with respect to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, contribution to (local) food security, and water consumption patterns. This study fills a significant part of the current data gap, by developing high-resolution gridded, simultaneously farm-size-specific and crop-specific datasets of harvested areas for 56 countries (i.e., covering about half the global cropland). Hereto, we downscaled the most complete global direct measurements of farm size and crop type by compiling state of the art datasets, including crop maps, cropland extent maps, and dominant field size distribution, representative for the year 2010. Using two different crop map sources, we were able to produce two new 5 arcmin gridded datasets on simultaneously derived farm-size-specific and crop-specific harvested areas: one for 11 farm sizes, 27 crops, and 2 farming systems, and one for 11 farm sizes, 42 crops, and 4 farming systems. In line with previous findings, our resulting datasets show major differences in planted crops and irrigated area (%) between farm sizes. Consistency between our resulting datasets and (i) observations from satellite images on farm-size-specific oil palm, (ii) household surveys on the farm-size-specific irrigated area (%), and (iii) previous studies that mapped noncrop-specific farm sizes and support the validity of our datasets. Although at grid level some uncertainties remain to be overcome, particularly those stemming from uncertainties in crop maps, results at country level seem robust.

We implemented state-of-the-art ecological niche models (ENMs) and niche overlap analysis to investigate climate-occurrence patterns for five flea beetle species of the genus Chaetocnema in South Africa (C. brincki, C. danielssoni, C. darwini, C. gahani, and C. natalensis). ENMs were fitted through Maxent and Random Forests, testing various parameterizations. For each species, tuned ENMs attaining good discrimination on spatially independent test data were selected to predict suitability across the study region and individuate its main climatic drivers. Percentage coverage of climatically suitable areas by seventeen Afrotropical vegetation formations was also computed. Predicted suitable areas do not extend far away from known presence localities, except for C. brincki and C. gahani in north-eastern South Africa. Temperate grasslands and shrublands cover most of suitable areas for C. brincki and C. gahani, along with warm temperate forests, as well as for C. danielssoni, in this case being followed by tropical flooded and swamp forests. Climatic suitability for C. darwini mainly relates to the Mediterranean grasslands and scrublands of the southern coastal region, while suitable areas for C. natalensis encompass various vegetation formations, coherently with its wide distribution. The environmental niche of C. danielssoni significantly overlaps with those of the wide-ranging C. darwini and C. natalensis, suggesting that historical factors, rather than low climatic tolerance, has determined its restricted distribution in the Western Cape Province. Maxent and Random Forests were confirmed to be of great help in disentangling the environment-occurrence relationships and in predicting suitability for the target species outside their known range, but they need to be properly tuned to perform at their best.","[Cerasoli, Francesco; D'Alessandro, Paola; Biondi, Maurizio] Univ Aquila, Dept Life Hlth & Environm Sci, Via Vetoio Coppito, I-67100 Laquila, Italy",University of L'Aquila,"Cerasoli, F (corresponding author), Univ Aquila, Dept Life Hlth & Environm Sci, Via Vetoio Coppito, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",francesco.cerasoli@univaq.it; paola.dalessandro@univaq.it; maurizio.biondi@univaq.it,"Cerasoli, Francesco/AAK-5504-2021","Cerasoli, Francesco/0000-0002-9712-9147",,,,,76,1,1,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,FEB,2022,2,,,,,,100,10.3390/d14020100,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14020100,,,24,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZM0EE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000764039300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As populations increase and economic development progress, energy demand grows, and ultimately the scalability of the problems associated with non-renewable energy resources. Solar energy plays a promising role to solve the problem and it is foreseen as the most promising renewable energy source due to its availability and benefits. Despite the promising effects, only a limited amount of electricity is currently produced globally from solar power. In order to realize the importance of tapping into solar energy, it is crucial to reveal the potential amount of electricity that could be thus produced. Many criteria should be taken into consideration before switching to solar energy. One of the most important criteria is the building location and surrounding environment. For example, a house on a hill or less shaded area will get more direct sunlight and generate more solar energy compared to a house in a shaded area. A multi-criteria methodology based on geographic information systems (GIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) is used in this research to assess community benefits of switching to solar energy by evaluating houses location and surrounding environment. The methodology presented in this research uses a tool for automated extraction of photography from 360 degrees video data at locations of interest. The extracted imagery provides a data set to train a deep learning neural network to predict whether a house location is a good fit for solar energy. This research presents a state-of-the-art methodology to assess community benefits of switching to solar energy by using GIS and deep learning to automate the assessment of buildings location potential to harvest solar energy.","[Alzarrad, M.

The paper presents valuable insights in identifying the gaps, where should the focus be in the mining and mineral processing industries for a sustainable future. Mining and mineral processing industries have been the key focus of research in many countries due to its increasing sustainability concerns that affect global warming and climate change. Use of heavy equipment that consumes electrical energy, mechanical energy, and an enormous amount of process heat is a key contributor to the overall impacts in the industry. Due to the use of heavy equipment and associated energy consumption, these industrial sectors contribute notably to global warming, human health, ecosystems, and resources. Among the various environmental impact assessment tools which are widely used to identify sustainability indicators, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a well-justified approach among the practitioners and researchers. Though state of the art technological tools and resources are being used now a days, there is still a research gap in identifying the key mining processes which need to be the focus of attention. Renewable energy integration in the mineral processing sector and process heating from green energy sources is becoming the emergent field of research. The review results reveal, the assessment indicators in human health and ecosystems are key factors that are mostly missing in the previous studies which are crucial for people or community living nearby mining area. This review paper identifies the research gaps to the existing literature that can form the base for future research direction in the field of LCA and sustainable energy integration in mining and mineral processing industries.

The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods. This survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as well as climate scientists in choosing the proper ML method according to the prediction task.","[Mosavi, Amir; Ozturk, Pinar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Comp Sci IDI, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Chau, Kwok-wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Mosavi, A; Ozturk, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Comp Sci IDI, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",amir.mosavi@ntnu.no; pinar@ntnu.no; dr.kwok-wing.chau@polyu.edu.hk,"Chau, Kwok-wing/E-5235-2011; Mosavi, Amir/I-7440-2018","Chau, Kwok-wing/0000-0001-6457-161X; Mosavi, Amir/0000-0003-4842-0613",Norwegian University of Science and Technology AI Lab; European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM),Norwegian University of Science and Technology AI Lab; European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM),This research was funded by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology AI Lab and the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM).,,228,429,436,148,489,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,11,,,,,,1536,10.3390/w10111536,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10111536,,,40,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HC3XM,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000451736300043,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been published in neither reports or a separate publication. Now, quarter of a century later, the time has come for the fragment to be published, because of it importance in development of the Roman art of portrait and tombstones of the later period (4th century). The paper determines monument and portrait typology and chronology. The hairstyle is after that appearing on the Constantine's triumphal arch in Rome. The portrait appearing on the Salonitan fragment is a reception of early Constantine's appearance and hairstyle that found their way also to this tombstone of a younger, but obviously relatively rich, man of Salona. At that time, between the years 308 an 313, any significant influence of the climate existing at the Constantine's court was quite unlikely. The influence became possible rather from the time when Constantine spread his rule to the territories previously under Galetius, once Constantine averted the Licinius' claiming of Panonia and Dalmatia. The fragment of Salona, thus, testifies influences of the Constantine's court and courtiers to wider territories. This is a proof that at the time the workshops of Salona were still active and that they still produced stele, besides sarcophagi, still following the current social and political trends. Indeed, no conclusion can be made on whether the deceased was a Christian or a pagan, but it is certain he was close to the Constantine's views, who, at the time and in spite of the Edict of Milan of 313, was still ambiguous. On the other hand, this stele fragment indicates architectural forms not to have completely vanished, since they are shown here in their elementary form.",,,"Cambi, N (corresponding author), Zoraniceva 4, HR-21000 Split, Croatia.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ZVONIMIR SOLIN,SOLIN,"KRALJA ZVONIMIRA 50, SOLIN, 21 210, CROATIA",1846-9469,,,TUSCULUM,Tusculum,SEP,2012,1,,,,83,87,,,,,,5,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VE0PS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000438315300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are gaining more and more importance due to the accelerating pace of climate change and the rising cost of limited fossil resources. Against this background, a heating system combining solar thermal collectors. heat pump, stratified thermal storage and water/ice latent heat storage has been investigated. The major advantages of the proposed solar/heat pump heating system are considered to be its flexible application (suitable for new and existing buildings because of acceptable space demand) as well as the improvement of solar fraction (extended solar collector utilisation time, enhanced collector efficiency), i.e. the reduction of electric energy demand for the heat pump. In order to investigate and optimise the heating system, a dynamic system simulation model was developed. On this basis, a fundamental control strategy was derived for the overall coordination of the heating system with particular regard to the performance of the two storage tanks. In a Simulation Study, a fundamental investigation of the heating system configuration was carried out and optimisation derived for the system control as well as the selection of components and their dimensioning. The influence of different parameters on the system performance was identified, where the collector area and the latent heat storage volume were found to be the predominant parameters for system dimensioning. For a modem one-family house, a solar collector area of 301112 and a latent heat store volume of 12.5m(3) are proposed. In this configuration, the heating system reaches a seasonal performance factor of 4.6, meaning that 78% of the building's and users' heat demand are delivered by solar energy. The results show that the solar/heat pump heating system can give an acceptable performance using up-to-date components in a state-of-the-art building.","[Trinkl, Christoph; Zoerner, Wilfried] Ingolstadt Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Excellence Solar Engn, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany",,"Trinkl, C (corresponding author), Ingolstadt Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Excellence Solar Engn, Esplanade 10, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany.",trinkl@fh-ingolstadt.de; vhanby@dmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4320-8,,,,2009,,,,,611,620,,,,,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BJF83,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000265479400068,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper hereunder focuses on a multiphase pump station (2 x 400 kW pump units) which has been put into service early 1998 in Western Siberia. JSC Chernogorneft is a major oil and gas company operating on the Samatlor field. In the mid nineties the Northern part of Samatlor was appraised and showed the existence of significant oil reserves. Consequently there was a need to review the options to develop this new area taking into account the existing infrastructure in the older part of the field. Due to the distance (up to 40 km or 25 miles) it is essential to reduce the well back pressure so as to produce the low pressure oil wells into the existing facilities at a higher pressure. The effluent is a light oil with a moderate GOR (Gas Oil Ratio: 71 vol/vol or 400 Scft/bbl) with some solid content (up to 200 mg/l). Relative to conventional facilities (production separator, oil pumps, compressor, flaring system) the application of multiphase pumps proved to be cost effective, reliable and easy to operate.",,,,,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,2,PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD,WESTMINISTER,"1 BIRDCAGE WALK, WESTMINISTER SW1H 9JJ, ENGLAND",,,1-86058-212-5,BHR GR CONF SER PUBL,,,1999,35,,,,45,54,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Chemical; Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Petroleum; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BN35U,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000081694800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although considerable progress has been made in previous modeling studies on the fate of soil organic matter (SOM), only a few models used a process-based approach for investigating these strongly coupled and complex soil systems, which involve SOM oxidation, transient water flow, and mass transport processes in aqueous and gaseous phases. Typically, physically based models for water flow, as well as solute and gas transport, are not coupled with state-of-the-art SOM degradation models. Reactive transport models (RTMs) provide a flexible framework for implementing different SOM degradation concepts and integrating biogeochemical processes with water flow and mass transport. Given the complex nature of carbon cycling in soils coupled with flow and mass transport, code intercomparison using well-defined benchmarks is in many cases the only practical method of model verification. The benchmark presented in this manuscript focuses on SOM oxidation under variably saturated flow conditions. The benchmark consists of three problems characterized by increasing complexity. The problems were solved using two different reactive transport codes, namely HP1 and MIN3P-THCm. The first supporting problem introduces a batch-type simulation to assess kinetic networks of SOM degradation. In the second supporting problem, transient water flow, solute transport, gas generation, and diffusive gas transport are considered. The principal problem combines the kinetic networks of SOM degradation with reactive transport under variably saturated flow conditions, including CO2 transport from soils to the atmosphere. Simulation results for the benchmark problems demonstrate an overall excellent agreement between the two codes, building confidence in the ability of RTMs to simulate complex C-cycling in dynamic environments.","[Jia, M.; Su, D.; Mayer, K.

The models were forced by atmospheric sea level pressure and 10 m winds. The ensemble forcing for the EHS was generated by temporal-spatial shifting of the operational global control ERA5 reanalysis provided by the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), because the ERA5 associated ensemble shows too little dispersion in this area. EFS was instead based on a lead time of 4 days and forced with the 50-member high-resolution ensemble prediction system of the ECMWF. EHS was evaluated over a long period (the 2000-2010 decade), whereas EFS was evaluated for the ten most extreme surges that occurred during that period: five positive (which caused coastal flooding) and five negative (which affected navigation and drinking water supply) events. Based on traditional statistics (area under the ROC curve and Brier scores), both systems were assessed from a probabilistic point of view. Results show that both EHS and EFS can incorporate more than 90% of the observations in the uncertainty range. They also showed good skill in hindcasting and forecasting surges, particularly extreme events, EHS being about 20% better than the control model and EFS up to 55% better, in agreement with state-of-the-art models developed for other parts of the world. Results also showed that EFS can predict most of the surge peaks with 95% confidence, with a range of uncertainty of about +/- 0.90 m and +/- 9 hr. Therefore, results encourage the implementation of EHS and EFS as useful and robust tools for future climate studies, decision makers and the general public, to improve the quality of risk management decisions by quantifying forecast uncertainty.","[Dinapoli, Matias G.; Simionato, Claudia G.; Moreira, Diego] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat FCEN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Dinapoli, Matias G.; Simionato, Claudia G.; Moreira, Diego] Univ Buenos Aires, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera CIMA, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Dinapoli, Matias G.; Simionato, Claudia G.; Moreira, Diego] UBA, CNRS, CONICET, IRD,UMI 3351,IFAECI, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Simionato, Claudia G.; Moreira, Diego] Univ Buenos Aires, FCEN, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires,"Dinapoli, MG (corresponding author), CIMA, Intendente Guiraldes 2160 Ciudad Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",matias.dinapoli@cima.fcen.uba.ar,,"Dinapoli, Matias/0000-0001-5588-6732",ANPCyT [PICT 2014-2672]; PIDDEF [14-14]; UBACYT [20020150100118BA]; CONICET PhD fellowship,ANPCyT(ANPCyT); PIDDEF; UBACYT; CONICET PhD fellowship,"ANPCyT project PICT 2014-2672, PIDDEF project 14-14, UBACYT project 20020150100118BA, and a CONICET PhD fellowship",,53,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

Published assessments are critically reviewed and compared to the European Union Product Environmental Footprint (EU PEF) standards. No published articles were found to fully meet the standards, but the critical review method was used to classify the articles by their level of compliance. 25 articles partially met the PEF standards, giving 39 fossil-based and 50 bio-based polymer case results. Ultimately, it was possible to compare seven bio-based polymers and seven fossil-based polymers across seven impact categories (energy use, ecotoxicity, acidification, eutrophication, climate change, particulate matter formation and ozone depletion). Significant variation was found between polymer types and between fossil-based and bio-based polymers, meaning it was not possible to conclusively declare any polymer type as having the least environmental impact in any category. Significant variation was also seen between different studies of the same polymer, for both fossil-based and bio-based polymers. In some cases this variation was of the order of 400%. Results suggest that a large part of this variation is related to the Life Cycle Assessment methodologies applied, particularly in the end-of-life treatment, the use of credits for absorbed Carbon Dioxide, and the allocation of multifunctional process impacts. The feedstock source and processing method assumed for bio-based polymers were also major sources of variation. The challenges of Life Cycle Assessment, particularly in a complex, geographically diverse and young industry like bio-based polymers, are recognised. It is proposed that the PEF standards should be adopted more widely in order to homogenise the methods used and allow meaningful comparison between LCA studies on fossil-based and bio-based polymers, and between studies of the same polymers.

The transformation of the current fossil-fuel-based energy system to a more sustainable, renewable and cleaner alternative is desperately required to mitigate climate change. As a carbon-free and clean energy carrier, hydrogen has long been considered as a promising energy option. However, hydrogen does not exist naturally due to its inherently reactive features and has to be cost-effectively produced from hydrogen-containing compounds. Solar or electrochemically driven water splitting is an appealing vision for future sustainable hydrogen production. The state of the art water splitting technology via electro-catalysis is highly dependent on the efficiency of electrocatalysts to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a possible limiting step for the overall reaction. Electro-catalysts are currently dominated by these noble metals. To minimize the production cost, it is vital to develop noble-metal free catalysts for water splitting. In this context, metal nitrides have captured the imagination of academic researchers. This review summarizes the recent research progress made in these nanostructured metal nitrides as efficient and cheap catalysts for electrochemical and photo(electro)chemical water splitting. The various synthetic strategies for the fabrication and functionalization of these nanostructured metal nitrides are first presented followed by the introduction of their unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties and their respective applications in facilitating the HER, OER and the overall water splitting reaction. Some engineering perspectives to further enhance the performances of these nanostructured catalysts for water splitting are also discussed. Finally, opportunities for future development are briefly proposed.","[Jiang, Jing; Ai, Lunhong] China West Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Chem Synth & Pollut Control Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China; [Han, Ning; Liu, Pengyun; Jiang, Jing; Ai, Lunhong; Shao, Zongping; Liu, Shaomin] Curtin Univ, WA Sch Mines Minerals Energy & Chem Engn WASM MEC, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",China West Normal University; Curtin University,"Jiang, J; Ai, LH (corresponding author), China West Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Chem Synth & Pollut Control Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China.;Jiang, J; Ai, LH; Liu, SM (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, WA Sch Mines Minerals Energy & Chem Engn WASM MEC, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",0826zjjh@163.com; ah_aihong@163.com; Shaomin.liu@curtin.edu.au,"Liu, Simin/I-3689-2014; Han, Ning/F-6766-2019; Han, Ning/ABA-5907-2020; Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020; Liu, shaomin/E-3669-2010; Jiang, Jing/Y-1100-2019; shao, zongping/B-5250-2013","Liu, Simin/0000-0003-2098-3844; Han, Ning/0000-0003-0920-9049; Han, Ning/0000-0003-0920-9049; Liu, shaomin/0000-0001-5019-5182; Jiang, Jing/0000-0001-8592-5130; shao, zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51572227, 21771147]; Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation [2013JQ0012]; Major Cultivating Foundation of Education Department of Sichuan Province [17CZ0036]; Meritocracy Research Funds of CWNU [17YC007, 17YC017]; Innovative Research Team of CWNU [CXTD2017-1]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation; Major Cultivating Foundation of Education Department of Sichuan Province; Meritocracy Research Funds of CWNU; Innovative Research Team of CWNU,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51572227 and 21771147), Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation (2013JQ0012), Major Cultivating Foundation of Education Department of Sichuan Province (17CZ0036), Meritocracy Research Funds of CWNU (17YC007 and 17YC017), and Innovative Research Team of CWNU (CXTD2017-1).",,178,272,274,41,695,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7488,2050-7496,,J MATER CHEM A,J.

This demands a major effort by soil scientists in at least four directions by: (i) demonstrating the importance of soils in inter- and transdisciplinary programs focusing on food, water, climate, biodiversity and energy problems, which are environmental issues that are widely acknowledged to be important; (ii) focusing research on the seven soil functions to demonstrate the importance of soil for widely recognized Ecosystem Services (ES) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); (iii) reframing reporting of soil studies by not only including technical data but embedding this in human-interest storylines, building on the deep emotional links between soil and man, and (iv) educating and involving knowledge brokers that can link science with societal partners not only during a given project but also in the preparatory and implementation phase. Scientists can only effectively participate in Communities of Practice when they have first properly organized their own affairs in Communities of Scientific Practice. Two case studies illustrated the proposed procedures, combining results of state-of-the-art quantitative models with a description of aspirations, concerns and frustrations of the various stakeholders involved, including farmers, regulators, citizens and entrepreneurs. The connectivity dimension of soil security was quite important here. Soil scientists would be well advised to return to their roots when field work was effectively coupled with laboratory studies.

European Union policies call for a coordinated approach in increasing the effectiveness of urban mobility planning to achieve climate protection goals. National and local authorities require common guidance on developing and implementing such plans with broad involvement of public authorities, transport professionals and research. Cities in Central and Eastern Europe have a long planning culture with strong focus on public transport. However, the unprecedented increase of private motorisations calls for innovative strategies to offer sustainable transport solutions to people. Two exemplary cities from the region demonstrate how sustainable transport can be maintained and even expanded. Gdynia (Poland) with its developing economy and relatively young population makes considerable efforts to reduce motor traffic demand in the area. The City's transport policy and strategy is focused on solving relevant transport problems of the city in a sustainable way. This covers the increase of bicycle use, an intelligent mix of different transport options and improving the quality of PT services by means of state of the art information and communication technologies and public participation mechanisms. Koprivnica (Croatia) stands exemplary for numerous medium-sized cities in the region with similar transport challenges. Decision makers work towards a participatory strategy for zero CO2 emission planning and management of housing estates and urban transport. With the vision of developing a regional competence centre for sustainable urban mobility planning the city will attract researchers, students and professionals in this field. Long-term vision of both cities and their dedication to actively share their experiences with other cities has the potential for up-take of sustainable urban mobility planning in the region.

We are investigating the flood risks in the eastern Irish Sea posed by extreme storm events. Here, an 11-year simulation (01/01/1996-01/01/2007) including wave-current interaction has been validated. These data can then be used to investigate the potential for coastal flooding in the study area. To accurately model a storm event in the eastern Irish Sea both wave effects and the influence of the external surge need to be considered. To simulate the waves, we have set up a one-way nested approach from a 1 degrees North Atlantic model, to a 1.85 km Irish Sea model, using the state-of-the-art 3rd-generation spectral WAve Model (WAM). This allows the influence of swell to be correctly represented. The Proud-man Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal-Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS) has been used to model the tide-surge interaction. To include the external surge we have set up a one-way nested approach from the 1/9 degrees by 1/6 degrees operational Continental Shelf surge model, to a 1.85 km Irish Sea model. For the high resolution Irish Sea model we use a POLCOMS-WAM coupled model, to allow for the effects of wave-current interaction on the prediction of surges at the coast. Using two classification schemes the coupled model is shown to be good and often very good at predicting the surge, total water elevation and wave conditions. We also find the number of low level surge events has increased in the study area over the past decade. However, this time period is too short to determine any long-term trends in the wave and surge levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Given that the coal-based energy will continue to account for a significant portion of global electricity generation in the coming years, the lack of effective management strategies exacerbates the threat of FA wastes to the surrounding environment and human health. For a sustainable development, green and renewable hydrogen economy and CO2 capture efforts provide appealing opportunities to valorize FA as catalysts and/or sorbents due to their appealing physic-ochemical properties. Hydrogen applications along with carbon neutrality are potential strategies to mit-igate climate change crisis, but high processing costs (catalysts/sorbents) are challenging to realize this purpose. In this context, the utilization of FA not only enhances industrial competitiveness (by reducing manufacturing costs), but also provides ecologically friendly approaches to minimizing this solid waste. This state-of-the-art review highlights a wide-ranging outlook on the valorization of FA as catalysts and sorbents for hydrogen-rich gas production via conventional/intensified processes (CO2/H2O reforming, ammonia decomposition, hydride hydrolysis). The fundamental physicochemical characterizations and hazards/utilization of FA, which significantly affect the FA's utilization in various fields, are first intro-duced. The influence of several factors (like FA types and catalysis/sorption operation conditions) on the activity performance of FA-based materials is then discussed in detail. This critical review aims to open the window to further innovative ideas regarding the application of different FA residues in other catalytic and sorption processes.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 SAR, we monitored the temporal and spatial variability of the frontal positions on the Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica, from 2015 to 2021. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm based on the SO-CFAR strategy and a profile cumulative method for frontal line extraction. To improve the accuracy of the extracted frontal lines, we developed a framework combining the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and morphological image-processing strategies. A visual comparison between the proposed algorithm and state-of-the-art algorithm shows that our algorithm is effective in these cases including rifts, icebergs, and crevasses as well as ice-shelf surface structures. We present a detailed analysis of the temporal and spatial variability of fronts on AIS that we find, an advance of the AIS frontal line before the D28 calving event, and a continuous advance after the event. The study reveals that the AIS extent has been advanced at the rate of 1015 m/year. Studies have shown that the frontal location of AIS has continuously expanded. From March 2015 to May 2021, the frontal location of AIS expanded by 6.5 km; while the length of the AIS frontal line is relatively different after the D28 event, the length of the frontal line increased by about 7.5% during 2015 and 2021 (255.03 km increased to 273.5 km). We found a substantial increase in summer advance rates and a decrease in winter advance rates with the seasonal characteristics. We found this variability of the AIS frontal line to be in good agreement with the ice flow velocity.","[Zhu, Tingting] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xiangbin] Polar Res Inst China, Shanghai 200136, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Wuhan Univ, Chinese Antarctic Ctr Surveying & Mapping, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Polar Research Institute of China; Wuhan University,"Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Chinese Antarctic Ctr Surveying & Mapping, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",ztt_polar_rs@whu.edu.cn; cuixiangbin@pric.org.cn; yuzhang_spl@whu.edu.cn,,"Cui, Xiangbin/0000-0002-4269-8086; Zhang, Yu/0000-0001-9211-861X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801266, 41901275, 41776186, 41531069]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M612512, 2018M632922]; LIESMARS",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); LIESMARS,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFA0603104; the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41801266, 41901275, 41776186, and 41531069); and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2017M612512 and 2018M632922), and LIESMARS special research funding.",,38,0,0,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2021,17,,,,,,3528,10.3390/rs13173528,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13173528,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,UO1OM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000694471400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For commercial production scale, potential alternatives can be based on biomass gasification and water electrolysis via renewable energy, namely biomass- and power-to-ammonia. The former generally uses entrained flow gasifier due to low CO2 and almost no tar, and air separation units are shared by the gasifier and ammonia synthesis. The latter may use solid-oxide electrolyzer due to high electrical efficiency and the possibility of heat integration with the ammonia synthesis process. In this paper, techno-economic feasibility of these two green ammonia production processes are investigated and compared with the state-of-the-art methane-to-ammonia process, considering system-level heat integration and optimal placement of steam cycles for heat recovery. With a reference ammonia production of 50 kton/year, the results show that there are trade-offs between the overall energy efficiency (LHV) and ammonia production cost for all three cases. The biomass-to-ammonia is the most exothermic but is largely limited by the large heat requirement of acid gas removal. The steam cycles with three pressure levels are able to maximize the heat utilization at the system level. The power-to-ammonia achieves the highest system efficiency of over 74%, much higher than that of biomass-to-ammonia (44%) and methane-to-ammonia (61%). The biomass-to-ammonia reaches above 450 $/ton ammonia production cost with a payback time of over 6 years, higher than those of methane-to-ammonia (400 $/ton, 5 years). The power-to-ammonia is currently not economically feasible due to high stack costs and electricity prices; however, it can be competitive with a payback time of below 5 years with mass production of solid-oxide industry and increased renewable power penetration.","[Zhang, Hanfei; Desideri, Umberto] Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, Pisa, Italy; [Wang, Ligang; Van Herle, Jan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne EPFL, Grp Energy Mat, Sion, Switzerland; [Wang, Ligang; Marechal, Francois] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne EPFL, Ind Proc & Energy Syst Engn, Sion, Switzerland",University of Pisa; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Desideri, U (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, Pisa, Italy.;Wang, LG (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne EPFL, Grp Energy Mat, Sion, Switzerland.",ligang.wang@epfl.ch; umberto.desideri@unipi.it,"Desideri, Umberto/G-1394-2011; Marechal, Francois M.

While most of the factors affecting space heating depend on individual choices (e.g. occupants' behaviour, interior building design, heating system efficiency) that are difficult to influence through urban planning, spatial context of individual housing units is within the sphere of influence of planners. Yet the impact of spatial context has hitherto received limited research attention due to the lack of geospatial data and the massive computer processing required to capture the shape and surroundings of individual housing units. Regression analysis was performed in this study to explain the yearly gas consumption of all individual housing units in the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The analysis focused on the impact of spatial context variables at two complementary scales: housing unit and postal code level. State-of-the-art 3D Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were applied for the efficient processing of massive 3D geospatial data for all buildings in the city. Two- and three-dimensional spatial context of individual housing units were described using spatial data processing routines that characterised building shape and its surroundings. The local housing unit level results highlighted the benefits of compact, dense urban forms: denser neighbourhoods with less open space and buildings with higher numbers of housing units and less exposed perimeters have lower heating demand. Trees were found to limit energy consumption when they are located on the colder northwest side of building units. The more aggregate postal code level results showed the importance of demographic composition: (larger) households with children consume most energy. Size and age of the housing unit are important determinants of energy at both scale levels: older houses have a higher energy consumption, but a rebound effect was found for the newest dwellings.","[Rafiee, A.; Dias, E.; Koomen, E.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ SPINlab, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rafiee, A.; Dias, E.] Geodan Res, President Kennedylaan 1, NL-1079 MB Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Rafiee, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ SPINlab, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.rafiee@vu.nl,,"Rafiee, Azarakhsh/0000-0002-2609-2674; Dias, Eduardo/0000-0002-2500-1128; Koomen, Eric/0000-0002-0676-1252",,,,,48,4,4,2,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

With satellite images that can obtain sub-meter spatial resolution, and new hardware, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles and systems, there are many emerging opportunities for improved data acquisition, including variable temporal and spectral resolutions. Combined with the evolution of techniques for aerial remote sensing, such as full wave laser scanners, hyperspectral scanners, and aerial radar sensors, the potential to incorporate this new data in forest management is enormous. Here we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques for large forest areas thousands or tens of thousands of hectares. We examined modern remote sensing techniques used to obtain forest data that are directly applicable to decision making issues, and we provided a general overview of the types of data that can be obtained using remote sensing. The most easily accessible forest variable described in many works is stand or tree height, followed by other inventory variables like basal area, tree number, diameters, and volume, which are crucial in decision making process, especially for thinning and harvest planning, and timber transport optimization. Information about zonation and species composition are often described as more difficult to assess; however, this information usually is not required on annual basis. Counts of studies on forest health show an increasing trend in the last years, mostly in context of availability of new sensors as well as increased forest vulnerability caused by climate change; by virtue to modern sensors interesting methods were developed for detection of stressed or damaged trees. Unexpectedly few works focus on regeneration and seedlings evaluation; though regenerated stands should be regularly monitored in order to maintain forest cover sustainability.","[Surovy, Peter; Kuzelka, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Surovy, P (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",surovy@fld.czu.cz; kuzelka@fld.czu.cz,"Kuzelka, Karel/K-5459-2018","Kuzelka, Karel/0000-0001-7064-5160",OP RDE [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000433]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [QK1920458],"OP RDE; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)","This research was funded by OP RDE, grant number CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000433 (Building up an excellent scientific team and its spatiotechnical background focused on mitigation of the impact of climatic changes to forests from the level of a gene to the level of a landscape at the FFWS CULS Prague)and Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic grant number QK1920458",,194,24,25,13,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,19-Mar,2019,3,,,,,,273,10.3390/f10030273,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10030273,,,29,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,HT3IL,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000464457400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some of the Austroasiatic groups must have migrated to Northeast India at a later date, and whose descendants are today's Munda-speaking people of Northeast, East and Southcentral India. Language is the store-house of one's ancestral knowledge, the community's history, its skills, customs, rituals and rites, attire and cuisine, sports and games, pleasantries and sorrows, terrain and geography, climate and seasons, family and neighbourhoods, greetings and address-forms and so on. Language loss leads to loss of social identity and cultural knowledge, loss of ecological knowledge, and much more. Linguistic hegemony marginalizes and subdues the mother-tongues of the peripheral groups of a society, thereby the community's narratives, histories, skills etc. are erased from their memories, and fabricated narratives are created to replace them. Each social-group has its own norms of extending respect to a hearer, and a stranger. Similarly there are social rules of expressing grief, condoling, consoling, mourning and so on. The emergence of nation-states after the 2nd World War has made it imperative for every social group to build an authentic, indigenous narrative with intellectual rigour to sustain itself politically and ideologically and progress forward peacefully. The present essay will attempt to introduce variants of linguistic-anthropology practiced in the West, and their genesis and importance for the Asian speech communities.

The text, which is meant to be expository in nature, is bound to sketch a short history of Australian English against Schneider's Model of Postcolonial English Evolutionary Scenario, and further on, it aims to depict the status quo of Australian English today as an index for identity construction. And it is also meant to provide the reflective line along with the presentation of relevant aspects in question in terms of the union between spatial and temporal dimensions, thus fulfilling the aspect of English as transported (in its numerous regional and social brands) and transformed into the brand of English in the new territory, also 'travelling' and working its way across the landscapes and the history of new discursive formations accompanying the rise of the new Antipodean identity. I trust these two motivations will merge into a single line as the text develops. It is assumed that language is an organic entity that evolves uniquely in the environment of multiple factors, such as climate, landscape, flora and fauna, indigenous populations and language contact situations, political and social contexts, ideologies, technological progress, lifestyles, etc. All of these resting on the dynamism between the external and internal factors, such as the new setting versus the old country, the new setting versus new external influences, etc. The abundance of variables cutting across the geographical spaces and social spaces along with the historical dimension provide the fertile ground for the emergence of unmatched uniqueness, which gains its utmost quality in the realm of multiple semiotic modes, visual art, music, literary expression among others, all resting on social codes whose growth and development deserves a separate treatment, beyond purely linguistic considerations, and yet not divorced from them. This contribution concentrates on language alone.","[Skrzypczak, Waldemar] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept English, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Skrzypczak, W (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept English, Torun, Poland.",spaceout@umk.pl,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-319-74021-8; 978-3-319-74020-1,SECOND LANG LEARN,,,2018,,,,,99,111,,10.1007/978-3-319-74021-8_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74021-8_9,10.1007/978-3-319-74021-8,,13,Education & Educational Research; Linguistics,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research; Linguistics,BK5DD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000438410300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Large to small organisations throughout the entire construction supply chain continue to be challenged to adequately prevent accidents. Construction worker injuries and fatalities represent significant waste of resources. Although the five C's (culture, competency, communication, controls and contractors) have been focusing on compliance, good practices and best-in-class strategies, even industry leaders have only marginal improvements in recorded safety statistics for many years. Design/methodology/approach - Right-time vs real-time construction safety and health identifies three major focus areas to aid in the development of a strategic, as opposed to tactical, response. Occupational safety and health by design, real-time safety and health monitoring and alerts and education, training and feedback leveraging state-of-the-art technology provide meaningful predictive, quantitative and qualitative measures to identify, correlate and eliminate hazards before workers get injured or incidents cause collateral damage. Findings - The current state and development of existing innovative initiatives in the occupational construction safety and health domain are identified. A framework for right-time vs real-time construction safety and health presents the specific focus on automated safety and health data gathering, analysis and reporting to achieve better safety performance. The developed roadmap for right-time vs real-time safety and health is finally tested in selected application scenarios of high concern in the construction industry. Originality/value - A strategic roadmap to eliminate hazards and accidents through right-time vs real-time automation is presented that has practical as well as social implications on conducting a rigorous safety culture and climate in a construction business and its entire supply chain.","[Teizer, Jochen] RAPIDS Construct Safety & Technol Lab, Ettlingen, Germany",,"Teizer, J (corresponding author), RAPIDS Construct Safety & Technol Lab, Ettlingen, Germany.",jochen@teizer.com,"Teizer, Jochen/AAS-1814-2020","Teizer, Jochen/0000-0001-8071-895X",,,,,112,25,27,5,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1471-4175,1477-0857,,CONSTR INNOV-ENGL,Constr.

Ubiquitary occurring DON as a marker of trichothecenes produced by Fusarium species is considered as an important safety and economical issue. As it stands now with the EU legislation the consumer is unnecessary put at risk. There are, however, ways and means as getting around the problem to protect the consumer by using a novel, fast, non-invasive and cheap acoustic technique to detect DON in cereal grains with in-and on line capabilities. The present paper reports on the application of the acoustic method for the screening of DON in wheat at a point of harvest and on the confirmation of its performance with the state of the art wet chemistry method (ELISA). This technique is completely different from currently applied wet chemistry techniques and is based on acoustic wave's penetrating through and/or reflected by air-filled porous materials such as unconsolidated solid beads of grain. High correlations between DON contaminated wheat samples and the different amounts of shriveled kernels in mixtures determined by acoustic technique have been found. The statistical analysis showed that the acoustic method gives sufficiently precise results in the quantitative determination of DON in grain. Because of its in- and on-line capabilities acoustic method is an excellent tool for monitoring and high throughput analysis of DON in grain. Analysis of wheat samples contaminated with different levels of DON from different years (2004-2006) grown in Lithuania showed that climatic conditions at time of flowering (wet, warm and a high relative humidity) seem to increase the occurrence of DON. It is too premature as to state that the increased amount of DON over three succesive years is related to climate change.","[Juodeikiene, G.; Basinskiene, L.; Vidmantiene, D.] Kaunas Univ Technol, Radvilenu Pl 19, LT-50254 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bartkiene, E.] Lithuanian Vet Acad, LT-47181 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Mankeviciene, A.] Lithuanian Inst Agr, LT-58344 Akademija, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Lithuanian University of Health Sciences; Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture & Forestry,"Juodeikiene, G (corresponding author), Kaunas Univ Technol, Radvilenu Pl 19, LT-50254 Kaunas, Lithuania.",,"Bartkiene, Elena/AAE-8159-2019",,,,,,9,1,1,0,4,J J STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK-CROATIA,OSIJEK,"FAC FOOD TECH, DEPT CEREAL PROC TECH, FRANJE KUHACA 18-20, OSIJEK, HR-31 000, CROATIA",,,978-953-7005-15-3,,,,2008,,,,,90,+,,,,,,2,Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Food Science & Technology,BIC77,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000258429900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, solutions to moisture-induced problems may be difficult when several interacting mechanisms of moisture transport are present. Anew approach to building envelope durability assessment has been introduced in North America, which employs experiments and advanced modeling to predict the long-term performances of building envelope systems. This pen-nits the comparison and ranking of wall systems with respect to total hygrothermal performance. Elaborate experiments to measure the various hygrothermal properties, such as sorption and suction isotherms, vapor permeabilities, liquid diffusivities, and drainage, are combined with full-scale laboratory building envelope testing to determine system and subsystem performances, which are then included in the modeling activity to predict the long-term performances of building envelopes. This approach has been termed moisture engineering. This paper presents detailed results of an application of moisture engineering in North Carolina, where within the first six months of occupancy, some problems were observed in 3200 homes (Nisson 1995). All the homes employed an exterior insulation finish system (EIFS). An extensive laboratory and material testing analysis to determine the cause of failure was undertaken. A state-of-the-art transient two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite difference model was employed to numerically solve the heat, air and moisture transport through various EIFS walls. The drying potential of each system was then numerically analyzed using real weather conditions, and results clearly demonstrated the limited drying potential for the wall system in that climate. From these results, moisture control strategies are identified.","Natl Res Council Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada",National Research Council Canada,"Karagiozis, AN (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",,,1-883413-70-2,ASHRAE SPEC,,,1998,,,,,239,251,,,,,,13,Construction & Building Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology,BT72D,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000173846100025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reliability of solar radiation forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact of mineral dust on the PV-power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak over Germany on 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of the PV-power forecast for 65% of the pyranometer stations in Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For our study, direct effects account for 64%, indirect effects for 20% and synergistic interaction effects for 16% of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.","[Rieger, Daniel; Gasch, Philipp; Deetz, Konrad; Vogel, Bernhard; Vogel, Heike] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Rieger, Daniel; Steiner, Andrea; Bachmann, Vanessa; Foerstner, Jochen] Deutscher Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Rieger, D (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.;Rieger, D (corresponding author), Deutscher Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany.",daniel.rieger@dwd.de,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Foerstner, Jochen/0000-0002-7989-462X",Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy [0325932A],Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy,"Part of this research is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and was conducted within the project PerduS: Photovoltaikertragsreduktion durch Saharastaub, 0325932A (English: forecasting the reduction in photovoltaic power production during Saharan dust outbreaks).

A recent study by Bodas-Salcedo et al. using the Met Office Unified Model highlights that the underprediction of the low/midlevel postfrontal clouds contributes to the largest bias of the surface downwelling shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean (SO). A-Train observations and limited in situ measurements have been used to evaluate the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, version 3.3.1 (WRFV3.3.1), in simulating the postfrontal clouds over Tasmania and the SO. The simulated cloud macro/microphysical properties are compared against the observations. Experiments are also undertaken to test the sensitivity of model resolution, microphysical (MP) schemes, planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration. The simulations demonstrate a considerable level of skill in representing the clouds during the frontal passages and, to a lesser extent, in the postfrontal environment. The simulations, however, have great difficulties in portraying the widespread marine BL clouds that are not immediately associated with fronts. This shortcoming is persistent to the changes of model configuration and physical parameterization. The representation of large-scale conditions and their connections with the BL clouds are discussed. A lack of BL moisture is the most obvious explanation for the shortcoming, which may be a consequence of either strong entrainment or weak surface fluxes. It is speculated that the BL wind shear/turbulence may be an issue over the SO. More comprehensive observations are necessary to fully investigate the deficiency of the simulations.","[Huang, Yi; Siems, Steven T.; Manton, Michael J.] Monash Univ, Monash Weather & Climate, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Thompson, Gregory] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Monash University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Huang, Y (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Sch Math Sci, Clayton Campus,Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",vivian.huang@monash.edu,"Siems, Steven T/C-8339-2013","Siems, Steven T/0000-0002-8478-533X; Huang, Yi/0000-0001-8144-1227",Australian Research Council [LP120100115],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work is supported by Australian Research Council Linkage Project LP120100115.

Proposed SRM schemes aim to increase planetary albedo to reflect more sunlight back to space and induce a cooling that acts to partially offset global warming. Under the auspices of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, we have performed model experiments whereby global temperature under the high-forcing SSP5-8.5 scenario is reduced to follow that of the medium-forcing SSP2-4.5 scenario. Two different mechanisms to achieve this are employed: the first via a reduction in the solar constant (experiment G6solar) and the second via modelling injections of sulfur dioxide (experiment G6sulfur) which forms sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere. Results from two state-of-the-art coupled Earth system models (UKESM1 and CESM2-WACCM6) both show an impact on the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in G6sulfur but not in G6solar. Both models show a persistent positive anomaly in the NAO during the Northern Hemisphere winter season in G6sulfur, suggesting an increase in zonal flow and an increase in North Atlantic storm track activity impacting the Eurasian continent and leading to high-latitude warming over Europe and Asia. These results are broadly consistent with previous findings which show similar impacts from stratospheric volcanic aerosol on the NAO and emphasize that detailed modelling of geoengineering processes is required if accurate impacts of SRM effects are to be simulated. Differences remain between the two models in predicting regional changes over the continental USA and Africa, suggesting that more models need to perform such simulations before attempting to draw any conclusions regarding potential continental-scale climate change under SRM.","[Jones, Andy; Haywood, Jim M.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Haywood, Jim M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Global Syst Inst, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England; [Jones, Anthony C.] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Tilmes, Simone] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Kravitz, Ben] Indiana Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Robock, Alan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter; Met Office - UK; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Jones, A (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",andy.jones@metoffice.gov.uk,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016; Haywood, Jim/GQA-6691-2022; Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014","Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656; Haywood, Jim/0000-0002-2143-6634; Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150","Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government; US National Science Foundation [1852977, CBET-1931641, AGS-2017113]; US National Center for Atmospheric Research; Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute; Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative","Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US National Center for Atmospheric Research; Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute; Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative","D This research has been supported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government, the US National Science Foundation under cooperative agreement 1852977, agreement CBET-1931641 and grant AGS-2017113, the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute and the Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative.",,91,6,6,3,15,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Understanding the nature and role of active sites is essential for designing highly active and selective catalysts. Here, we examine Cu nanoparticles dispersed on TiO2 and Ti-containing SiO2 supports, where the Ti moieties of these materials are reducible to different extents, using a surface organometallic chemistry approach, together with state-of-the-art characterization methods (UV- vis, infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)). Cu nanoparticles are small and well-dispersed on isolated, dimeric, and oligomeric Ti moieities on SiO 2 when reduced or when the material has been oxidized via exposure to air, but they are small only in the latter case for Cu dispersed on the bulk oxide TiO2. Large Cu nanoparticles, present on TiO2 when reduced, redisperse upon exposure to air, likely associated with the facile oxidation of the reduced TiO2 surface, and agglomerate again when reduced in situ within the electron microscope. CH3OH formation rates and selectivities on Cu/TiO2 are low as a result of these large Cu nanoparticles and the ability of TiO2 to catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO. After accounting for the CO formation rates of the support itself, the CH3OH selectivities are similar for all catalysts (and greater than that for Cu/SiO2, where SiO2 is considered as an innocent support), suggesting that Ti sites in all materials have a similar nature and role. These Ti sites act as Lewis acid sites, whose presence is evidenced by pyridine adsorption studies using IR and NMR spectroscopies, that stabilize the same surface intermediates at the interface of Cu nanoparticles and the support, despite differences in the reducibility of these Ti species.","[Noh, Gina; Docherty, Scott R.; Lam, Erwin; Huang, Xing; Mance, Deni; Alfke, Jan L.; Coperet, Christophe] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Huang, Xing] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Sci Ctr Opt & Electron Microscopy, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Coperet, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",ccoperet@ethz.ch,"Docherty, Scott/ABG-8209-2021; Coperet, Christophe/F-1448-2018; Docherty, Scott R/Q-2762-2018; Lam, Erwin/C-7136-2016","Docherty, Scott/0000-0002-8605-3669; Coperet, Christophe/0000-0001-9660-3890; Docherty, Scott R/0000-0002-8605-3669; Lam, Erwin/0000-0002-8641-7928; Noh, Gina/0000-0003-4717-5767; Huang, Xing/0000-0002-8700-0606",SCCER-Heat and Energy Storage program of InnoSuisse; ETH Career Seed Grant [SEED-14 18-2]; ETHZ Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; Marie Curie Actions for People COFUND Program,SCCER-Heat and Energy Storage program of InnoSuisse; ETH Career Seed Grant; ETHZ Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; Marie Curie Actions for People COFUND Program,G.N. and E.L. were supported by the SCCER-Heat and Energy Storage program of InnoSuisse.

Air pollution, primarily due to increased levels of H2S, SOx, NH3, NOx, CO, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere, has a significant impact on public health, and exhaust gases harm the natural sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycles. Similarly, wastewater discharged to the environment with metal ions, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, dyes, and aromatics/organic compounds is a risk for health since it may lead to an outbreak of waterborne pathogens and increase the exposure to endocrine-disrupting agents. Therefore, developing new and efficient air and water quality management systems is critical. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel materials for which the main application areas include gas storage and separation, water harvesting from the atmosphere, chemical sensing, power storage, drug delivery, and food preservation. Due to their versatile structural motifs that can be modified during synthesis, MOFs also have a great promise for green applications including air and water pollution remediation. The motivation to use MOFs for environmental applications prompted the modification of their structures via the addition of metal and functional groups, as well as the creation of heterostructures by mixing MOFs with other nanomaterials, to effectively remove haz-ardous contaminants from wastewater and the atmosphere. In this review, we focus on the state-of-the-art environmental applications of MOFs, particularly for water treatment and air pollution, by highlighting the groundbreaking studies in which MOFs have been used as adsorbents, membranes, and photocatalysts for the abatement of air and water pollution. We finally address the opportunities and challenges for the environmental applications of MOFs.","[Daglar, Hilal; Altintas, Cigdem; Keskin, Seda; Sillanpaa, Mika] Koc Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey; [Erucar, Ilknur] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Nat & Math Sci, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkey; [Heidari, Golnaz] Univ Guilan, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Rasht 4193833697, Iran; [Zare, Ehsan Nazarzadeh] Damghan Univ, Sch Chem, Damghan 3671641167, Iran; [Moradi, Omid] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Shahr Eqods Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Srivastava, Varsha] Univ Oulu, Fac Technol, Res Unit Sustainable Chem, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Iftekhar, Sidra] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Appl Phys, Kuopio 70120, Finland; [Sillanpaa, Mika] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Min Met & Chem Engn, Dept Chem Engn, POB 17011, ZA-2028 Doornfontein, South Africa; [Sillanpaa, Mika] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Phys, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sillanpaa, Mika] Zhejiang Rongsheng Environm Protect Paper Co LTD, 588 East Zhennan Rd,Pinghu Econ Dev Zone, Zhejiang 314213, Peoples R China; [Sillanpaa, Mika] Chandigarh Univ, Univ Ctr Res & Dev, Dept Civil Engn, Mohali, Punjab, India",Koc University; Ozyegin University; University of Guilan; Islamic Azad University; University of Oulu; University of Eastern Finland; University of Johannesburg; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Chandigarh University,"Zare, EN (corresponding author), Damghan Univ, Sch Chem, Damghan 3671641167, Iran.",ehsan.nazarzadehzare@gmail.com,"Srivastava, Varsha/AAN-9776-2020; Keskin, Seda/H-3196-2016; Sillanpaa, Mika/G-1366-2011","Srivastava, Varsha/0000-0003-2275-9168; Keskin, Seda/0000-0001-5968-0336; Sillanpaa, Mika/0000-0003-3247-5337",,,,,221,8,8,102,105,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0045-6535,1879-1298,,CHEMOSPHERE,Chemosphere,SEP,2022,,2,,,,,135082,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135082,,,30,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Y6EO,35618068,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000808235900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experts predict that wildfires will increase in the coming years mainly due to climate change. Early detection and prediction of fire spread can help reduce affected areas and improve firefighting. Numerous systems were developed to detect fire. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were employed to tackle this problem due to their high flexibility, their low-cost, and their ability to cover wide areas during the day or night. However, they are still limited by challenging problems such as small fire size, background complexity, and image degradation. To deal with the aforementioned limitations, we adapted and optimized Deep Learning methods to detect wildfire at an early stage. A novel deep ensemble learning method, which combines EfficientNet-B5 and DenseNet-201 models, is proposed to identify and classify wildfire using aerial images. In addition, two vision transformers (TransUNet and TransFire) and a deep convolutional model (EfficientSeg) were employed to segment wildfire regions and determine the precise fire regions. The obtained results are promising and show the efficiency of using Deep Learning and vision transformers for wildfire classification and segmentation. The proposed model for wildfire classification obtained an accuracy of 85.12% and outperformed many state-of-the-art works. It proved its ability in classifying wildfire even small fire areas. The best semantic segmentation models achieved an F1-score of 99.9% for TransUNet architecture and 99.82% for TransFire architecture superior to recent published models. More specifically, we demonstrated the ability of these models to extract the finer details of wildfire using aerial images. They can further overcome current model limitations, such as background complexity and small wildfire areas.","[Ghali, Rafik; Akhloufi, Moulay A.] Univ Moncton, Percept Robot & Intelligent Machines Res Grp PRIM, Dept Comp Sci, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada; [Mseddi, Wided Souidene] Univ Carthage, SERCOM Lab, Ecole Polytech Tunisie, BP 743, La Marsa 2078, Tunisia",University of Moncton; Universite de Carthage,"Akhloufi, MA (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Percept Robot & Intelligent Machines Res Grp PRIM, Dept Comp Sci, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada.",rafik.ghali@ept.rnu.tn; moulay.akhloufi@umoncton.ca; wided.souidene@ept.rnu.tn,,"Souidene Mseddi, Wided/0000-0002-3002-4033; Akhloufi, Moulay/0000-0002-4378-2669; ghali, rafik/0000-0002-9645-2452",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2018-06233],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This research was enabled in part by support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2018-06233.",,70,4,4,11,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,1977,10.3390/s22051977,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22051977,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,ZW8FO,35271126,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000771442600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Groundwater resources in these areas are the main source for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. Worldwide, deltaic areas are under stress due to climate change, sea level increase and decrease in fresh water availability. In addition, in deltaic coastal areas around mean sea level, the saline groundwater will move toward the ground surface and exflitrate to surface water. This saline surface water will not be appropriate for drinking water production, agricultural and industrial use, and therefore, freshwater diverted from rivers is used for flushing the canals and ditches in coastal areas. Due to decreasing fresh water availability and increasing surface water salinization, current saline-fresh water management strategies have to be reviewed, and new sustainable strategies must be developed. Using real time measurements to see the effect of disturbances to the system and updating the control actions in real time will decrease the use of fresh water for flushing operations. Real time control of salinity in polders will result in more effective water management. Control of surface water salinization in a polder is a multi-objective problem such that water quality and quantity have to be considered. Moreover, the constraints of the system and uncertainties must be taken into account. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a state-of-the-art control technique showing the best performance for these kind of problems. In this study, a MPC configuration for combined water quantity and quality control is discussed on a polder flushing case study for a hypothetical test water course/canal. The exfiltration of saline groundwater to the surface water is also considered and the predictions of saline groundwater exfiltration are used to achieve better control of the local water system.

Timely reductions in urban transportation emissions are critical to reaching climate goals set by international treaties, national policies, and local governments. Transportation emissions also remain one of the largest contributors to both poor air quality (AQ) and to inequities in AQ exposure. As municipal and regional governments create policy targeted at reducing transportation emissions, the ability to evaluate the efficacy of such emission reduction strategies at the spatial and temporal scales of neighborhoods is increasingly important; however, the current state of the art in emissions monitoring does not provide the temporal, sectoral, or spatial resolution necessary to track changes in emissions and provide feedback on the efficacy of such policies at the abovementioned scale. The BErkeley Air Quality and CO2 Network (BEACO(2)N) has previously been shown to provide constraints on emissions from the vehicle sector in aggregate over a similar to 1300 km(2) multicity spatial domain Here, we focus on a 5 km, high-volume, stretch of highway in the San Francisco Bay Area. We show that inversion of the BEACO(2)N measurements can be used to understand two factors that affect fuel efficiency: vehicle speed and fleet composition. The CO2 emission rate of the average vehicle (in grams per vehicle kilometer) is shown to vary by as much as 27 % at different times of a typical weekday because of changes in these two factors. The BEACO(2)N-derived emission estimates are consistent to within similar to 3 % of estimates derived from publicly available measures of vehicle type, number, and speed, providing direct observational support for the accuracy of the EMission FACtor model (EMFAC) of vehicle fuel efficiency.","[Fitzmaurice, Helen L.; Kim, Jinsol; Cohen, Ronald C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turner, Alexander J.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chan, Katherine] Sacramento Metro Air Qual Management Dist, Program Coordinat Div, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Delaria, Erin R.; Newman, Catherine; Wooldridge, Paul; Cohen, Ronald C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Cohen, RC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Cohen, RC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rccohen@berkeley.edu,"Cohen, Ronald C/A-8842-2011","Cohen, Ronald C/0000-0001-6617-7691","NSF; Adolph C. and Mary Sprague Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, UC Berkeley; Koret Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Adolph C. and Mary Sprague Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, UC Berkeley; Koret Foundation","This research has been supported by the NSF, the Adolph C. and Mary Sprague Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, UC Berkeley, and the Koret Foundation.",,37,0,0,4,6,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

It is designed to respond to the European Union Arctic policy. Its channels, incidence angle, precision, and spatial resolutions have been selected to observe the Arctic Ocean with the recommendations expressed by the user communities. In this note, we present the sensitivity analysis that has led to the choice of the CIMR channels. The famous figure from Wilheit (1979), describing the frequency sensitivity of passive microwave satellite observations to ocean parameters, has been extensively used for channel selection of microwave radiometer frequencies on board oceanic satellite missions. Here, we propose to update this sensitivity analysis, using state-of-the-art radiative transfer simulations for different geophysical conditions (Arctic, mid-latitude, tropics). We used the Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) from Meissner and Wentz (2012) for the ocean surface, the Round Robin Data Package of the ESA Climate Change Initiative (Pedersen et al., 2019) for the sea ice, and the RTM from Rosenkranz (2017) for the atmosphere. The sensitivities of the brightness temperatures (TBs) observed by CIMR as a function of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea ice concentration (SIC), ocean wind speed (OWS), total column water vapor (TCWV), and total column liquid water (TCLW) are presented as a function of frequency between 1 and 40 GHz. The analysis underlines the difficulty to reach the user requirements with single-channel retrieval, especially under cold ocean conditions. With simultaneous measurements between 1.4 and 36 GHz onboard CIMR, applying multi-channel algorithms will be facilitated, to provide the user community with the required ocean and ice information under arctic environments.","[Kilic, Lise; Prigent, Catherine; Jimenez, Carlos] Sorbonne Univ, Observ Paris, Univ PSL, CNRS,LERMA, Paris, France; [Prigent, Catherine; Jimenez, Carlos] Estellus, Paris, France; [Donlon, Craig] European Space Agcy, Noordwijk, Netherlands",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Observatoire de Paris; Sorbonne Universite; European Space Agency,"Kilic, L (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Observ Paris, Univ PSL, CNRS,LERMA, Paris, France.",lise.kilic@obspm.fr,,,European Space Agency (CIMR-APE study ESA) [40000125255],European Space Agency (CIMR-APE study ESA),This research has been supported by the European Space Agency (CIMR-APE study ESA Contract 40000125255).,,22,2,2,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1812-0784,,,OCEAN SCI,Ocean Sci.,11-Mar,2021,2,,,,455,461,,10.5194/os-17-455-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-17-455-2021,,,7,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,QX0MW,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000629045700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) airborne mission concepts tested in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 over Monterey Bay, CA, and nearby inland waters have demonstrated the feasibility of improving airborne monitoring and research activities in case-1 and case-2 aquatic ecosystems through the combined use of state-of-the-art above- and in-water measurement capabilities. These competencies have evolved through time to produce a sensor-web approach: imaging spectrometer, microradiometers, and a sun photometer (airborne) with their analogous algorithms, and with corresponding in-water radiometers and ground-based sun photometry. The NASA airborne instrument suite and mission concept demonstrations, leveraging high-quality above- and in-water data, significantly improves the fidelity as well as the spatial and spectral resolution of observations for studying and monitoring water quality in oceanic, coastal, and inland water ecosystems. The goal of this series of projects was to develop and fly a portable airborne sensor suite for NASA science missions focusing on a gradient of water types from oligotrophic to turbid waters addressing the challenges of an optically complex coastal ocean zone and inland waters. The airborne radiometry in this range of aquatic conditions and sites has supported improved results of studies of water quality and biogeochemistry and provides capabilities for research areas such as ocean productivity and biogeochemistry; aquatic impacts of coastal landscape alteration; coastal, estuarine, and inland waters ecosystem productivity; atmospheric correction; and regional climate variability.","[Guild, Liane S.] NASA, Biospher Sci Branch, Earth Sci Div, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Kudela, Raphael M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hooker, Stanford B.] NASA, Ocean Ecol Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Palacios, Sherry L.] Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Dept Marine Sci, Seaside, CA USA; [Houskeeper, Henry F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; California State University System; California State University Monterey Bay; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Guild, LS (corresponding author), NASA, Biospher Sci Branch, Earth Sci Div, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",liane.s.guild@nasa.gov,"Houskeeper, Henry/ACE-6594-2022",,"NASA; NASA Program: HOPE COAST project by NASA Headquarters (HQ) awards from the Science Mission Directorate (SMD); NASA Program: Office of Chief Engineer Hands-On Project Experience (HOPE) 2010 Training Opportunity For NASA Personnel; NASA Program: Remote Sensing of Water Quality [NNH12ZDA001N-WATER A.32]; NASA Program: Earth Science Division (ESD); NASA Program: SMD (High Quality Optical Observations, HQ2O); NASA Program: 2013 NASA-ARC Science Innovation Fund (SIF), NASA HQ Office of Chief Scientist, SMD (OCEANIA mission); NASA Program: 2016 NASA-ARC SIF, NASA HQ Office of Chief Scientist (advancing instrument technology); NASA Program: Airborne Instrument Technology Transition, ESD, SMD (advancing instrument technology, C-HARRIER missions, and data analyses) [NNH16ZDA001N-AITT A.26]","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA Program: HOPE COAST project by NASA Headquarters (HQ) awards from the Science Mission Directorate (SMD); NASA Program: Office of Chief Engineer Hands-On Project Experience (HOPE) 2010 Training Opportunity For NASA Personnel; NASA Program: Remote Sensing of Water Quality; NASA Program: Earth Science Division (ESD); NASA Program: SMD (High Quality Optical Observations, HQ2O); NASA Program: 2013 NASA-ARC Science Innovation Fund (SIF), NASA HQ Office of Chief Scientist, SMD (OCEANIA mission); NASA Program: 2016 NASA-ARC SIF, NASA HQ Office of Chief Scientist (advancing instrument technology); NASA Program: Airborne Instrument Technology Transition, ESD, SMD (advancing instrument technology, C-HARRIER missions, and data analyses)","The authors declare that this study received funding from NASA.

However, the accuracy of satellite-based precipitation products is still insufficient to serve many weather, climate, and hydrologic applications at high resolutions. In this paper, the authors develop a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for precipitation estimation using bispectral satellite information, infrared (IR), and water vapor (WV) channels. Specifically, a two-stage framework for precipitation estimation from bispectral information is designed, consisting of an initial rain/no-rain (R/NR) binary classification, followed by a second stage estimating the nonzero precipitation amount. In the first stage, the model aims to eliminate the large fraction of NR pixels and to delineate precipitation regions precisely. In the second stage, the model aims to estimate the pointwise precipitation amount accurately while preserving its heavily skewed distribution. Stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs), a commonly used deep learning method, are applied in both stages. Performance is evaluated along a number of common performance measures, including both R/NR and real-valued precipitation accuracy, and compared with an operational product, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS). For R/NR binary classification, the proposed two-stage model outperforms PERSIANN-CCS by 32.56% in the critical success index (CSI). For real-valued precipitation estimation, the two-stage model is 23.40% lower in average bias, is 44.52% lower in average mean squared error, and has a 27.21% higher correlation coefficient. Hence, the two-stage deep learning framework has the potential to serve as a more accurate and more reliable satellite-based precipitation estimation product. The authors also provide some future directions for development of satellite-based precipitation estimation products in both incorporating auxiliary information and improving retrieval algorithms.","[Tao, Yumeng; Hsu, Kuolin; Gao, Xiaogang; Sorooshian, Soroosh] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Hydrometeorol & Remote Sensing, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Tao, Yumeng; Hsu, Kuolin; Gao, Xiaogang; Sorooshian, Soroosh] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Ihler, Alexander] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Tao, YM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Hydrometeorol & Remote Sensing, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Tao, YM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",yumengt@uci.edu,"Hsu, Kuolin/E-6120-2019; sorooshian, soroosh/B-3753-2008","sorooshian, soroosh/0000-0001-7774-5113; HSU, KUOLIN/0000-0002-3578-3565; Ihler, Alexander/0000-0002-4331-1015",National Science Foundation Cyber-Enabled Sustainability Science and Engineering program [CCF-1331915]; NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship [NNX15AN86H]; NASA Minority University Research and Education Project [MIRO NNX15AQ06A]; U.S. Department of Energy Clean Energy Research Center for WaterEnergy Technology program (DOE) [DE-IA0000018]; California Energy Commission (CEC) [300-15-005]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1331915] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation Cyber-Enabled Sustainability Science and Engineering program; NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship; NASA Minority University Research and Education Project; U.S. Department of Energy Clean Energy Research Center for WaterEnergy Technology program (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); California Energy Commission (CEC); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"Financial support for this study is made available from the National Science Foundation Cyber-Enabled Sustainability Science and Engineering program (CCF-1331915), the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NNX15AN86H), the NASA Minority University Research and Education Project (MIRO NNX15AQ06A), the U.S. Department of Energy Clean Energy Research Center for WaterEnergy Technology program (DOE Prime Award DE-IA0000018), and the California Energy Commission (CEC Award 300-15-005).",,42,44,45,4,51,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

J,"Kaneda, Y; Mineno, H",,,,"Kaneda, Yukimasa; Mineno, Hiroshi",,,Sliding window-based support vector regression for predicting micrometeorological data,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Predicting micrometeorological data; Data extraction; Dynamic aggregation; Support vector regression; Ensemble learning,MACHINES,"Sensor network technology is becoming more widespread and sophisticated, and devices with many sensors, such as smartphones and sensor nodes, have been used extensively. Since these devices have more easily accumulated various kinds of micrometeorological data, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, an enormous amount of micrometeorological data has been accumulated. In recent years, it has been expected that such an enormous amount of data, called big data, will produce novel knowledge and value. Accordingly, many current applications have used data mining technology or machine learning to exploit big data. However, micrometeorological data has a complicated correlation among different features, and its characteristics change variously with time. Therefore, it is difficult to predict micrometeorological data accurately with low computational complexity even if state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are used. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for predicting micrometeorological data, sliding window-based support vector regression (SW-SVR) that involves a novel combination of support vector regression (SVR) and ensemble learning. To represent complicated micrometeorological data easily, SW-SVR builds several SVRs specialized for each representative data group in various natural environments, such as different seasons and climates, and changes weights to aggregate the SVRs dynamically depending on the characteristics of test data. In our experiment, we predicted the temperature after 1 h and 6 h by using large-scale micrometeorological data in Tokyo. As a result, regardless of testing periods, training periods, and prediction horizons, the prediction performance of SW-SVR was always greater than or equal to other general methods such as SVR, random forest, and gradient boosting. At the same time, SW-SVR reduced the building time remarkably compared with those of complicated models that have high prediction performance. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Assuming that these rotational modulation influences scale linearly over the solar cycle, long-term databases of sunspot and global facular proxies permit estimation of Ii-year cycle amplitudes of the mid-and near-UV solar spectrum, unmeasured at wavelengths longward of 300 nm because of insufficient long-term repeatability (relative accuracy) of state-of-the-art solar radiometers at these wavelengths. Reconstructions of UV irradiances throughout the Ii-year solar cycle indicate variabilities of 0.173 W/m(2) (1.1%) in the integrated radiation from 200 to 300 nm and 0.24 W/m(2) (0.25%) in radiation from 300 to 400 nm, These two UV bands thus contribute about 13% and 18%, respectively, to the 1.54 W/m(2) (0.1%) total (spectrally integrated) radiative output solar cycle. The parameterizations allow customization of UV irradiance time series for specific wavelength bands required as inputs to general circulation model simulations of solar cycle forcing of global climate change, and have practical implications regarding the long-term repeatability required for future solar monitoring.","USN, Res Lab, EO Hulburt Ctr Space Res, Washington, DC 20375 USA; Eppley Lab Inc, Newport, RI 02840 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NOAA, Space Environm Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Lean, JL (corresponding author), USN, Res Lab, EO Hulburt Ctr Space Res, Code 7673L,4555 Overlook Ave SW, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",lean@demeter.nrl.navy.mil,,"Lean, Judith/0000-0002-0087-9639",,,,,79,238,242,0,16,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Consequently, there has been a wider acceptance and deployment of renewable energy sources. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), on the other hand, is a standardized tool that has been deployed to comprehend the environmental effects of these alternative energy systems. Most studies conducted in LCA on renewable energy are mostly featured in regions like Europe, Asia, North and South America. While leaving a substantial gap in the volume of work conducted so far in Africa, especially concerning North African countries, a region that shares the largest energy-related CO2 emissions in the continent. Thus, an in-depth review article is required to discuss the state-of-art on life cycle assessment of renewable energy technologies in North Africa, highlighting the region's peculiarities, outlook, and future prospects. Aspects including the study's overview, goal, scope, kind of renewable energy sources, functional unit, system boundary, and impact categories are included in this review. Results from this review reveal that studies on LCA in this area of work are still at their early stages, accounting for only 2% of the total LCA research in the continent, with solar and bioenergy constituting most of the case studies with 27% and 33% of the total research outlook. In terms of GWP contribution, bioenergy and wind energy recorded the most and least impact in the region, respectively. Findings from this review can help policymakers and researchers have a broader understanding of the environmental contributions of various renewable energy deployed in the region while seeking to improve and regularize the LCA methodology as a standard tool for evaluation.","[Hampo, Chima Cyril] Drexel Univ, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ojo, Damilola Oluwatobi] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Olatunde, Dare Ebenezer] Kwara State Univ, Dept Geol, Malete, Kwara, Nigeria; [Isioma, Obasih Judith] Covenant Univ, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Oni, Oluwatosin Omolola] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Ife, Osun State, Nigeria; [Echendu, Adaku Jane] Queens Univ Kingston, Sch Environm Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Mathew, Musa] Modibbo Adama Univ Technol, Elect & Elect Engn, Yola, Nigeria; [Adediji, Modupeoluwa Abisoluwa] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Agr & Environm Engn, Akure, Nigeria; [Oladipo, Seun Festus] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Forestry & Wood Technol, Akure, Nigeria; [Aro, Peace Oluwatomisin] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Estate Management, Akure, Nigeria","Drexel University; University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; Covenant University; Obafemi Awolowo University; Queens University - Canada","Hampo, CC (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",hampocyril@gmail.com,,"Echendu, Adaku/0000-0003-3697-1274",,,,,56,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1556-7036,1556-7230,,ENERG SOURCE PART A,Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

Distributed energy resources have enabled an expanded role for energy consumers and non-utility third parties to reshape system costs, drawing renewed attention to the potential of reforming electricity rate design based on the further application of cost-causal principals to improve overall system fairness and efficiency. One mechanism to move toward greater application of cost-causal rate design is dynamic pricing, which varies electricity prices across time and location to reflect costs of providing electricity to consumers under specific market conditions and grid operation conditions. While dynamic electricity pricing has penetrated some markets, and it has not been widely implemented, particularly for residential consumers. In this review article, we provide a brief summary of electricity rate design, including the possibility of introducing dynamic prices, and explain why dynamic prices are more reflective of the short-run marginal costs of electricity supply than volumetric rates. We then explore the barriers to the widespread adoption of residential dynamic pricing, emphasizing technical, economic, and political challenges. Our assessment reflects the ability of dynamic prices to engender more equitable and efficient outcomes by achieving the goal of cost-causality, and we argue that a move toward more dynamic pricing can constitute a welfare improvement over volumetric rates. However, dynamic pricing does not completely address the full set of challenges associated with rate design and, alone, is unlikely to enable the full recovery of fixed costs and the fair attribution of the positive and negative externalities of electricity provision. Therefore, electricity rate design requires tradeoffs, making it as much an art as a science. This analysis synthesizes literature across multiple fields and suggests avenues for further research.","[Matisoff, Daniel C.; Beppler, Ross] Georgia Inst Technol, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Chan, Gabriel] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Carley, Sanya] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Matisoff, DC (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",matisoff@gatech.edu,,"Matisoff, Daniel/0000-0003-4575-5282; Chan, Gabriel/0000-0001-9382-919X",National Science Foundation [1069138],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We would like to thank several anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

Their respective ranges have overlapped several times but we tend to ignore the extent to which they have really coexisted because this situation has not occurred in recent times. We provide a state-of-the-art review of all the data covering their chronological distribution, in order to evaluate the extent to which they have coexisted. We include new data from petroglyph analysis in Central Asia. The data set covers two major biogeographical regions: the Palearctic Biogeographic Realm (western Asia and Central Asia) and the Indo-Malaysian Biogeographic Realm in Monsoon Asia. Lions and tigers shared space with a large variety of medium-sized carnivores. We can hypothesise that, due to the plentiful prey and the diversity in habitats within their common range, they lived in sympatry there during the Holocene (although in local allopatry), as long as human interference was low. The Indo-Malaysian Biogeographic Realm offered the best habitats for coexistence due to the tropical climate, the variety of habitats, and the great diversity in prey. In temperate Asia, the carrying capacity was naturally lower due to cold winters and dry summers, except along the coasts. Suitable habitats were limited, in Central Asia, to the tugais of the alluvial valleys and the adjacent steppes.

In response to the European Commission's Communication on Green Infrastructure from 2013, the GREEN SURGE project aimed to further advance the development of UGI in European cities by (i) strengthening the conceptual foundations of UGI, (ii) developing improved methods and tools for assessment of its state, benefits and governance and, (iii) applying these to build a stronger evidence base. This paper aims to provide an overall synthesis of the project's main achievements. GREEN SURGE adopted an inter-and transdisciplinary approach. Urban Learning Labs and focal Learning Alliances in five cities were instrumental for intensive collaboration between disciplines and across science and practice. Pan-European surveys, e.g. of planning and governance practice or human-nature interactions established the state-of-the-art across the continent and identified good practices. The project consolidated green infrastructure planning and governance conceptually, and it mapped opportunities for better linking government-led planning with bottom-up initiatives for creating and managing UGI. It also introduced a framework for knowledge integration to support UGI valuation. Importantly, development and application of the concept of biocultural diversity gave new insights into human-nature relationships in multicultural urban societies. The results strongly call for more context-sensitive development of UGI that addresses the different needs and diverse cultural practices of people engaging with nature. In a nutshell, GREEN SURGE showed that UGI indeed can make a major contribution to sustainable and resilient urbanisation. Transdisciplinary research in urban labs, if well-conceived, has shown to hold great potential to advance UGI concepts, methods, knowledge and practice.","[Pauleit, Stephan; Hansen, Rieke; Rall, Emily] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Ambrose-Oji, Bianca] Ctr Ecosyst Soc & Biosecur, Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; [Andersson, Erik] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 9A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Anton, Barbara] European Secretarial, ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil, Leopoldring, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Buijs, Arjen; Elands, Birgit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Haase, Dagmar] Humboldt Univ, Inst Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Haase, Dagmar] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoser Str 15, D-04275 Leipzig, Germany; [Hansen, Rieke] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Landscape Architecture, Jakobstr 2, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Kowarik, Ingo] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol Ecosyst Sci Plant Ecol, Rothenburgstr 12, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Kowarik, Ingo] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Kronenberg, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Dept Reg Econ & Environm, POW 3-5, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland; [Mattijssen, Thomas; Olafsson, Anton Stahl] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Mattijssen, Thomas] Wageningen Econ Res, Prinses Beatrixlaan 582, NL-2595 BM The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Jagt, Alexander P.

Over a half century of research has produced significant understandings of the biochemistry and eco-physiology of biogenic VOCs. However, VOCs production is highly species-specific, and the impact of changes in species composition and abundance on VOCs emissions is unobservable in the time scales usually seen in field experiments. Prior modelling efforts are based on cases with an aggregate representation of vegetation. Individual-based models of forests simulate the dynamics of complex forest ecosystems based on birth, growth, and death of the individual trees comprising a simulated forest. Here an individual-based forest VOCs emissions model UVAFME-VOC v1.0 is developed from the state-of-the-art individual-based forest gap model, UVAFME, coupled with a canopy VOCs emission model. UVAFME-VOC v1.0 implementation for the temperate deciduous forest in the southeastern United States is tested by comparisons to independent data in the region. A model application tested the hypothesis that the historical collapse of American Chestnut (Castanea dentate) resulted in the dominance of oak trees (Quercus spp.) and enhanced isoprene emissions. The model demonstrated a capability to simulate the forest compositional and structural dynamics and forest isoprene emission dynamics. The simulations show isoprene emissions depend heavily on forest successional stage and species composition, suggesting that environmental change can affect forest VOCs emissions primarily by influencing forest species composition. Prediction of isoprene emissions, of other phytogenic volatile organic compounds, and of impacts on atmospheric chemistry of various global change agents (e.g., warming, rising CO2, ozone elevation, and herbivory) should explicitly consider forest diversity change. This individual-based model could provide widespread applications in addressing these problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Method: A systematic review of the state of the art on facility location problems for perishable agricultural products was conducted. The following databases were searched: Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, JSTOR, Scopus and Google Scholar. From an initial collection of 135 papers obtained with a generic search query for food location, 31 were finally selected for review focusing on food supply chain location model, within a publication date ranging from 2004 to 2015. Results: Based on the review, a typology of variables considered and not considered in models pertinent to conditions relevant to countries such as Colombia, is proposed. Objective functions commonly used, specific restrictions for Food Supply Chain (FSC) and logistical drivers most commonly considered in these models were also identified. Future research, regarding variables to be included in FSC models location for perishables in context of mountainous countries were identified. Conclusions: Strategic decisions such as the location of facilities are of great importance for the design of the fresh food supply chain and its network, given the perishability. However, the issue has been poorly evaluated especially due to the difficulty of modeling and the large number of variables to consider in this type of chain. Models that include the perishability, losses and stochastic behavior of some variables are required. Colombia can benefit from more research in location models of perishable food, particularly the impact on perishability due to its particular conditions of great variety of climates, mountainous landscapes along with a limited transport and road infrastructure.","[Sanabria Coronado, Lizeth Andrea; Peralta Lozano, Andres Mauricio; Orjuela Castro, Javier Arturo] Univ Dist Francisco Jose de Caldas, Fac Ingn, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas,"Coronado, LAS (corresponding author), Univ Dist Francisco Jose de Caldas, Fac Ingn, Bogota, Colombia.",lizeth_asanabria@hotmail.com; amperaltal@hotmail.com; jorjuela@udistrital.edu.co,"Lozano, Andres M/A-5058-2012",,,,,,58,1,1,0,10,"UNIV DISTRITAL FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS, CENTRO INVEST & DESARROLLO CIENT",BOGOTA,"CARRERA 7 NO 40-53, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA",0121-750X,2344-8393,,INGENIERIA-BOGOTA,Ingenieria,JAN-APR,2017,1,,,,23,45,,10.14483/udistrital.jour.reving.2017.1.a02,http://dx.doi.org/10.14483/udistrital.jour.reving.2017.1.a02,,,23,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,GX8SO,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000448061200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In many of these areas, new cutting-edge science goals have been recently proposed requiring simulations and analyses of experimental or observational data at very high resolutions and of unprecedented volumes. Both these aspects pose formidable challenge for the currently existing implementations of the transforms. This paper describes parallel algorithms for computing SHT with two variants of intra-node parallelism appropriate for novel supercomputer architectures, multi-core processors and Graphic Processing Units (GPU). It also discusses their performance, alone and embedded within a top-level, Message Passing Interface-based parallelisation layer ported from the S(2)HAT library, in terms of their accuracy, overall efficiency and scalability. We show that our inverse SHT run on GeForce 400 Series GPUs equipped with latest Compute Unified Device Architecture architecture (Fermi) outperforms the state of the art implementation for a multi-core processor executed on a current Intel Core i7-2600K. Furthermore, we show that an Message Passing Interface/Compute Unified Device Architecture version of the inverse transform run on a cluster of 128 Nvidia Tesla S1070 is as much as 3times faster than the hybrid Message Passing Interface/OpenMP version executed on the same number of quad-core processors Intel Nehalem for problem sizes motivated by our target applications. Performance of the direct transforms is however found to be at the best comparable in these cases. We discuss in detail the algorithmic solutions devised for the major steps involved in the transforms calculation, emphasising those with a major impact on their overall performance and elucidates the sources of the dichotomy between the direct and the inverse operations.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Szydlarski, Mikolaj] INRIA Saclay Ile de France, F-91893 Orsay, France; [Esterie, Pierre; Falcou, Joel] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Grigori, Laura] INRIA Rocquencourt, F-78153 Le Chesnay, France; [Grigori, Laura] Univ Paris 06, CNRS UMR 7598, Lab Jacques Louis Lions, F-75005 Paris, France; [Stompor, Radek] Univ Paris Diderot, Obs Paris, CNRS IN2P3, CEA Irfu,APC,Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Universite Paris Cite; Observatoire de Paris; CEA; Universite Paris Saclay,"Szydlarski, M (corresponding author), INRIA Saclay Ile de France, F-91893 Orsay, France.",mikolaj.szydlarski@inria.fr,,,"French National Research Agency (ANR) through COSINUS program (project MIDAS) [ANR-09-COSI-009]; GENCI-[CCRT] [2011-066647, 2012-066647]; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]",French National Research Agency (ANR) through COSINUS program (project MIDAS)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); GENCI-[CCRT]; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work has been supported in part by French National Research Agency (ANR) through COSINUS program (project MIDAS no.

They offer a promising archive of past oceanic environments given their global distribution, layered growth patterns, longevity and preservation as well as our ability to date them using radiometric techniques. This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in terms of geochemical approaches to using deep-sea coral skeletons to explore the history of the ocean. Deep-sea coral skeletons have a wide array of morphologies (e.g. solitary cup corals, branching colonial corals) and materials (calcite, aragonite and proteins). As such their biomineralization strategies are diverse, leading to complex geochemistry within coral skeletons. Notwithstanding these complications, progress has been made on developing methods for reconstructing the oceanographic environment in the past using trace elements and isotopic methods. Promising approaches within certain coral groups include clumped isotopes and Mg/Li for temperature reconstructions, boron isotopes and radiocarbon for carbon cycling, epsilon Nd, and radiocarbon for circulation studies and delta N-15, P/Ca and Ba/Ca for nutrient tracer studies. Likewise there is now a range of techniques for dating deep-sea corals skeletons (e.g. U-series, radiocarbon), and determining their growth rates (e.g. radiocarbon and Pb-210). Dating studies on historic coral populations in the Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Pacific point to climate and environmental changes being dominant controls on coral populations over millennial and orbital timescales. This paper provides a review of a range of successes and promising approaches. It also highlights areas in which further research would likely provide new insights into biomineralization, palaeoceanography and distribution of past coral populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional Land-Surface Models (LSM) used for numerical weather prediction, climate projection, and as inputs to water management decision support systems, do not treat the lower boundary in a fully process-based fashion. LSMs have evolved from a leaky bucket to more sophisticated land surface water and energy budgets that typically have a so-called basement term to depict the bottom model layer exchange with deeper aquifers. Nevertheless, the LSM lower boundary is often assumed zero flux or the soil moisture content is set to a constant value, an approach that while mass conservative, ignores processes that can alter surface fluxes, runoff, and water quantity and quality. Conversely, models for saturated and unsaturated water flow, while addressing important features such as subsurface heterogeneity and three-dimensional flow often have overly simplified upper boundary conditions that ignore soil heating, runoff, snow, and root-zone uptake. In the present study, a state-of-the-art LSM (CLM) and a variably-saturated groundwater model (ParFlow) have been coupled as a single column model. An initial set of simulations based on data from the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS) and synthetic data demonstrate the temporal dynamics of both of the coupled models. Changes in soil moisture and movement of the water table are used as indicators of conservation of mass between the two models. Sensitivity studies demonstrate the affect of precipitation, evapotranspiration, radiation, subsurface geology, and heterogeneity on predicted watershed flow. Studies demonstrating the effects of watershed flow in uncoupled and coupled modes are presented. The coupled model will ultimately be used to assist in the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs, a surface water quality standard) for a number of pollutants in an urban watershed in southern California in the United States.","Univ Calif Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab L208, Livermore, CA 94550 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Maxwell, RM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab L208, 7000 E Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",,"Maxwell, Reed M/D-7980-2013","Maxwell, Reed M/0000-0002-1364-4441",,,,,16,2,2,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",7108-8070,,0-444-51769-3,DEV WATER SCI,,,2004,,,,,1503,1510,,,,,,8,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Mathematics; Water Resources,BCE93,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000228987900128,View Full Record in Web of Science

AIRS is designed to provide both new and more accurate data about the atmosphere, land and oceans for application to climate studies and weather predictions. Among the important parameters to be derived from AIRS observations are atmospheric temperature profiles with an average accuracy of 1K in 1 kilometer (km) layers in the troposphere and surface temperatures with an average accuracy of 0.5K. The AIRS measurement technique is based on passive infrared remote sensing using a precisely calibrated, high spectral resolution grating spectrometer providing high sensitivity operation over the 3.7 mu m - 15.4 mu m region. To meet the challenge of high performance over this broad wavelength range, the spectrometer is cooled to 155K using a passive two-stage radiative cooler and the HgCdTe focal plane is cooled to 58K using a state-of-the-art long life, low vibration Stirling/purse tube cryocooler. Electronics waste heat is removed through a spacecraft provided heat rejection system based on heat pipe technology. All of these functions combine to make AIRS thermal management a key aspect of the overall instrument design. Additionally, the thermal operating constraints place challenging requirements on the test program in terms of proper simulation of the space environment and the logistics issues attendant with testing cryogenic instruments. The AIRS instrument has been fully integrated and thermal vacuum performance testing is underway. This paper provides an overview of the AIRS thermal system design, the test methodologies and the key results from the thermal vacuum tests, which have been completed at the time of this publication.","Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Syst, Lexington, MA 02173 USA",Lockheed Martin,"Coda, RC (corresponding author), Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Syst, 2 Forbes Rd, Lexington, MA 02173 USA.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3245-8,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999,,,,,266,278,,10.1117/12.372675,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.372675,,,13,Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Optics,BP33S,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000084756500025,View Full Record in Web of Science

An extensive synthesis and characterization study was carried out, which yielded novel processing routes for microporous membranes. Examples in this article include rapid thermal processing (RTP), ink-jet printing, and a route for fabricating metal-supported microporous membranes. Pure SiO2 membranes prepared under optimized cleanroom conditions exhibited a reproducible high selectivity for He and H-2 towards CO2 and N-2 (e.g. average alpha(H2/CO2) > 70; alpha(H2/N2) > 150). Microporous membranes prepared with RTP, with an overall processing time of approximately 1 h for the microporous top layer, showed a similar gas permeance and high selectivity. Another breakthrough compared to the state of the art is the introduction of a gas-selective metal-supported microporous membrane. The first prototypes, which were fabricated with a commercial stainless steel filter material as support material, exhibited a comparably attractive selectivity for H-2 (e.g. alpha(H2/CO2) similar to 50). Ni- and Co-doped membranes were additionally prepared in this study, since they are recognized as a membrane type with improved stability towards water vapour. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is important that we understand how weathering processes in different hydrological zones of a watershed (i.e., surface, unsaturated, and saturated zones) contribute to the total geochemical flux from the watershed. This capability will improve understanding of how geochemical fluxes from these different zones may change in response to climate change. Here, the geochemical flux from weathering processes occurring solely in the saturated zone is investigated. This task, however, remains exceedingly difficult due to the sparsity of subsurface sampling points, especially in large, remote, and/or undeveloped watersheds. In such cases, springflow is often assumed to be a proxy for groundwater (defined as water residing in fully saturated geologic formations). However, springflow generation may integrate different sources of water including, but not limited to, groundwater. The authors' hypothesis is that long-term estimates of geochemical fluxes from groundwater using springflow proxies will be too large due to the integrative nature of springflow generation. Two conceptual models of springflow generation are tested using endmember mixing analyses (EMMA) on observations of spring chemistries and stable isotopic compositions in a large alpine watershed in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. In the total springflow conceptual model, springflow is assumed to be 100% groundwater. In the fractional springflow conceptual model, springflow is assumed to be an integration of different sources of water (e. g., groundwater, unsaturated flow, preferential flow in the soil, etc.) and groundwater is only a fractional component. The results indicate that groundwater contributions in springflow range from 2% to 100% overall and no springs are consistently composed of 100% groundwater; providing support for the fractional springflow conceptual model. Groundwater contributions are not strongly correlated with elevation, spring contributing area, spring discharge, or seasonality. This variability has a profound effect on long-term geochemical fluxes. The geochemical fluxes for total springflow overestimate long-term solute release by 22-48% as compared to fractional springflow. These findings illustrate that springflow generation, like streamflow generation, integrates many different sources of water reflecting solute concentrations obtained along many different geochemical weathering pathways. These data suggest that springs are not always ideal proxies for groundwater. Springs may be integrating very distinct portions of the groundwater flow field and these groundwater contributions may become mixed at the spring emergence with much younger sources of water that have never resided in the groundwater system.

Subsequent analyses of results collected in this way rely on the assumption that specific distances between verbal anchors placed on the scale exist and that relationships between verbal anchors from different dimensions that are assessed (e.g. thermal sensation and comfort) do not change. Another inherent assumption is that such scales are independent of the context in which they are used (climate zone, season, etc.). Despite their use worldwide, there is indication that contextual differences influence the way the scales are perceived and therefore question the reliability of the scales' interpretation. To address this issue, a large international collaborative questionnaire study was conducted in 26 countries, using 21 different languages, which led to a dataset of 8225 questionnaires. Results, analysed by means of robust statistical techniques, revealed that only a subset of the responses are in accordance with the mentioned assumptions. Significant differences appeared between groups of participants in their perception of the scales, both in relation to distances of the anchors and relationships between scales. It was also found that respondents' interpretations of scales changed with contextual factors, such as climate, season, and language. These findings highlight the need to carefully consider context-dependent factors in interpreting and reporting results from thermal comfort studies or post-occupancy evaluations, as well as to revisit the use of rating scales and the analysis methods used in thermal comfort studies to improve their reliability.

Cosmogenic Be-10, produced by galactic cosmic rays and stored in natural archives such as ice cores and lake sediments, has been shown to be the most reliable as an indicator of past solar activity, although reconstructions at a higher, annual, resolution have remained elusive due to dating imprecision and uncertainties concerning the effect of depositional processes. Here, we employ a methodology that facilitates the annual reconstruction of past cosmic-ray and solar activity variations. An annual Be-10 record is assembled from an endogenic travertine in Baishuitai, China, covering the period 2001-2016 CE. We demonstrate that the effect of depositional processes when Be-10 is incorporated into travertine can be accounted for using the associated 9 Be and potassium (K) contents, and that the resulting corrected Be-10 content significantly correlates with the modeled global Be-10 production rates with a time lag of 1.5-2.5 years. Our results from the Baishuitai endogenic travertine suggest that the Be-10 record in such carbonate sediments has considerable potential as a high resolution proxy for past cosmic-ray and solar activity variations.

There is often a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of imagery acquired from current satellite sensors and as such various spatiotemporal image fusion methods have been explored to circumvent the challenges this situation presents (e.g., STARFM). However, some challenges persist in mapping surface water at the desired fine spatial and temporal resolution. Principally, the spatiotemporal changes of water bodies are often abrupt and controlled by topographic conditions, which are usually unaddressed in current spatiotemporal image fusion methods. This paper proposes the SpatioTemporal Surface Water Mapping (STSWM) method, which aims to predict Landsat-like, 30 m, surface water maps at an 8-day time step (same as the MODIS 8-day composite product) by integrating topographic information into the analysis. In addition to MODIS imagery acquired on the date of map prediction and a pair of MODIS and Landsat images acquired temporally close to the date of prediction, STSWM also uses the surface water occurrence (SWO, which represents the frequency with which water is present in a pixel) and DEM data to provide, respectively, topographic information below and above the water surface. These data are used to translate the coarse spatial resolution water distribution representation observed by MODIS into a 30 m spatial resolution water distribution map. The STSWM was used to generate an 8-day time series surface water maps of 30 m resolution in six inundation regions globally, and was compared with several other state-of-the-art spatiotemporal methods. The stratified random sampling design was used, and unbiased estimators of the accuracies were provided. The results show that STSWM generated the most accurate surface water map in which the spatial details of surface water were well-represented.","[Li, Xiaodong; Ling, Feng; Zhang, Yihang; Zhou, Pu; Wang, Yalan; Chen, Rui; Du, Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Key Lab Environm & Disaster Monitoring & Evaluat, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Foody, Giles M.; Boyd, Doreen S.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jiang, Lai] Hubei Water Resources & Hydropower Sci & Technol, Hubei Water Resources Res Inst, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Pu; Wang, Yalan; Chen, Rui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Nottingham; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, XD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Key Lab Environm & Disaster Monitoring & Evaluat, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lixiaodong@whigg.ac.cn,"Ling, Feng/E-4811-2013","Ling, Feng/0000-0002-0685-4897","Natural Science Foundation of China [62071457, 41801292]; Application Foundation Frontier project of Wuhan [2020020601012283]; key scientific research projects of water conservancy in Hubei Province, China [HBSLKY202103]; technology innovation special project of Hubei Province [2019ACA155]; Innovation Group Project of Hubei Natural Science Foundation [2019CFA019]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDBS-LY-DQC034]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2017384]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Application Foundation Frontier project of Wuhan; key scientific research projects of water conservancy in Hubei Province, China; technology innovation special project of Hubei Province; Innovation Group Project of Hubei Natural Science Foundation; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China (62071457, 41801292) , in part by the Application Foundation Frontier project of Wuhan (2020020601012283) , in part by the key scientific research projects of water conservancy in Hubei Province, China (HBSLKY202103) , in part by the technology innovation special project of Hubei Province (2019ACA155) , in part by the Innovation Group Project of Hubei Natural Science Foundation (2019CFA019) , in part by the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Acad-emy of Sciences (ZDBS-LY-DQC034) , and in part by the Youth Innova-tion Promotion Association CAS (2017384) .

Here calculating particle trajectories in a high-resolution, global hindcast, we present new evidence for a direct, subsurface pathway to the SPG from the Gulf Stream (GS) on subannual timescales. The pathway is most evident for particles initially at 200-m depth in the GS and is enhanced after a prolonged period of positive North Atlantic Oscillation. This occurred in the mid-1990s and led to warming and salinification of the western SPG consistent with observations. The more realistic advective pathways and timescales in the high-resolution model enable, for the first time, attribution of temperature and salinity changes in the SPG to a direct influx of GS water. Plain Language Summary The downstream destination of Gulf Stream water is investigated using a technique that tracks water parcels with a state-of-the-art ocean model. This approach allows us to obtain new evidence for a fast pathway by which water starting in the Florida Straits at the subsurface (at about 200 m deep) can reach the subpolar North Atlantic on timescales as short as 4 months. Surface waters were more likely to be recirculated within the subtropical region. The subsurface pathway was found to be enhanced during the 1990s, which led to increased temperature and salinity in the western subpolar North Atlantic, in agreement with observations made at this time. Our results have physical and biological implications and indicate that the connection between the subtropical and subpolar North Atlantic on subannual timescales is a key element of the Atlantic climate system.","[Jacobs, Zoe L.; Grist, Jeremy P.; Josey, Simon A.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Marsh, Robert] Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Jacobs, ZL (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England.",zoe.jacobs@noc.ac.uk,"Jacobs, Zoe/AAG-9557-2020; Jeremy, Grist P/B-4517-2012","Jacobs, Zoe/0000-0001-7348-0699; Jeremy, Grist P/0000-0003-1068-9211; Josey, Simon/0000-0002-1683-8831","Graduate School of the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton; UK National Environmental Research Council (NERC) under the ACSIS programme [NE/N018044/1]; NERC; NERC [noc010010] Funding Source: UKRI","Graduate School of the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton; UK National Environmental Research Council (NERC) under the ACSIS programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","Z.

Climate change and population growth is accelerating the problems further. Solutions are required for improved water management under increasingly complex conditions with competing stakeholder interests. Many organisations have started develop computerised decision support systems to aid the day-to-day management. In collaboration with multiple organisations a general decision support system has been developed, which can be tailored to specific uses. It can be applied both for planning and for real time operation. New Methodologies State-of-the-art simulations models and decision support systems (DSS) for water management and optimization of water allocation have been developed. The tools combine data retrieval and analyses, hydrological and hydraulic simulation models, crop models, GIS, multi criteria optimization and economic analyses. The tools are developed in partnership with water resources authorities around the world to aid their complex management. Application experience: Under the National Hydrology Project in India, the DSS has been implemented for real time management and long term planning and optimization. The 9 riparian countries of the Nile River Basin, represented by the Nile Basin Initiative, have agreed to develop the water resources in a cooperative manner; share socioeconomic benefits, and promote regional peace and security. The development of the shared and accepted Nile Basin DSS is the first important step in achieving the joint vision. The Computer Aided River Management System being developed in Australia adds real time functionalities for optimizing the day to day operation. The DSS includes coupled surface water and groundwater models and uses the full information to meet all water demands with minimum release from the headwater storages. The paper discusses the system requirements and experience from application of this type of systems.","[Havn, Karsten; Sorensen, Henrik Refstrup] DHI Solut, Agern Alle 5, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark",,"Havn, K (corresponding author), DHI Solut, Agern Alle 5, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,1,5,YELLOW RIVER CONSERVANCY PRESS,ZHENGZHOU,"CHENGDONG LU, ZHENGZHOU, HENAN 450004, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5509-0399-9,,,,2015,,,,,106,113,,,,,,8,Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Water Resources,BG7KN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000391414500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main focus is on optimizing the network architecture in order to achieve best performance. To save energy, the temperature inside public buildings is allowed to rise after business hours by setting back the thermostat. The objective is to predict the time of the end of thermostat setback (EoS) such that the design temperature inside the building is restored in time for the start of business hours. State of the art building simulation software, ESP-r, was used to generate a database that covered the years 1995-1999. The software was used to calculate the EoS for two office buildings using the climate records in Kuwait. The EoS data for 1995 and 1996 were used for training and testing the NNs. The robustness of the trained NN was tested by applying them to a production data set (1997-1999), which the networks have never seen before. For each of the six different NN architectures evaluated, parametric studies were performed to determine the network parameters that best predict the EoS. External hourly temperature readings were used as network inputs, and the thermostat end of setback (EoS) is the output. The NN predictions were improved by developing a neural control scheme (NC). This scheme is based on using the temperature readings as they become available. For each NN architecture considered, six NNs were designed and trained for this purpose. The performance of the NN analysis was evaluated using a statistical indicator (the coefficient of multiple determination) and by statistical analysis of the error patterns, including ANOVA (analysis of variance). The results show that the NC, when used with a properly designed NN, is a powerful instrument for optimizing AC setback scheduling based only on external temperature records. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A 6-8 low Earth orbiting satellite constellation will conduct atmospheric limb-sounding using GPS radio occultation. Although not the primary scientific objective, it is envisioned that the initial low altitude orbits (similar to 400 km) of the satellites (some in tandem) will provide unique opportunities for gravity mapping and precision orbit determination experiments. Simulations show that, depending on the orbit evolution scenario, the use of these data can yield at least an order of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art global gravity model EGM96 out to degree and order 20-40 (spatial resolution of 1000-500 km). This improvement would be very useful in anticipation of missions that focus on the temporal variations of the field, such as GRACE, and for current and future altimeter missions. Additionally, useful signals of low-degree temporal variations can be obtained if non-conservative forces remain modelable at the final altitude of above 700 km. Some of the geodetic benefits that can be expected from ROCSAT-3/COSMIC include: (a) simultaneous improvement of the GPS satellites' orbits within a few hours from data collection, essential to all GPS applications (a factor of two improvement can be expected over the current accuracy at 5-10 cm), (b) improved estimation of the global surface pressure fields, useful for geodynamic and altimetric studies such as Earth rotation, geocenter motion, time-varying gravity, and ocean circulation, and (c) inclusion of satellite laser ranging reflectors, proposed as a secondary tracking system will help establish local datum ties to the conventional terrestrial reference frame.","UMBC, JCET, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Pavlis, EC (corresponding author), UMBC, JCET, Code 926, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",,"Pavlis, Erricos C./AAF-4151-2019","Pavlis, Erricos C./0000-0002-9726-7064",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0939-9585,,3-540-67079-3,IAG SYMP,,,2000,,,,,214,217,,,,,,4,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BR53D,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000166722100043,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model by Porter and Heppelmann (2014) serves as a model-based categorization of the digital-based technology used in practice. A quantitative online survey conducted in 2018 in agricultural training farms and registered cooperatives provides the basis for this paper. A response rate of 8.4% meant that 329 questionnaires have been evaluated using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The analysis of the results shows that most farmers surveyed recognize the importance of digitalization and that they expect its importance to increase significantly by 2030. For crop production farms it is currently IT systems (84.5%) and support systems for data capture, data management and the analyzing of data (69.6%) which are most important. Legal structure, the amount of land farmed, and the level of education are structuring parameters in this context. Cattle farms are increasingly relying on sensors to collect process data of technical equipment (43.8%) and for documenting animal activities (42.9%) while pig farms are using automatic ventilation systems (96.0%) and automatic feeder systems (94.0%). It is not possible to define a Germany-wide standard on the state of the art in crop and livestock farming. For this, a location-based differentiation is still necessary. To successfully establish digital approaches in smallscale areas there is a requirement not only for adapted training and further education courses but also for approaches that are conceived on an inter-farm basis, and which are accompanied by research.","[Gscheidle, Von Michael; Munz, Jana; Doluschitz, Reiner] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landwirtschaftl Betriebslehre Fachgebiet Man, Schwerzstr 46, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Gscheidle, V (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landwirtschaftl Betriebslehre Fachgebiet Man, Schwerzstr 46, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",Michael.Gscheidle@Uni-Hohenheim.de; Jana.Munz@Uni-Hohenheim.de; Reiner.Doluschitz@Uni-Hohenheim.de,,,,,,,38,0,0,1,4,BUNDESMINISTERIUM ERNAHRUNG LANDWIRTSCHAFT,BPMM,"DEICHMANNS AUE 29, BPMM, 53179, GERMANY",2196-5099,,,BER LANDWIRTSCH,Ber.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =similar to 130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations.","[Clark, Sierra N.; Toledano, Mireille B.; Nathvani, Ricky; Muller, Emily; Bennett, James] Imperial Coll London, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, England; [Clark, Sierra N.; Ezzati, Majid; Toledano, Mireille B.; Nathvani, Ricky; Muller, Emily; Bennett, James; Beddows, Andrew; Kelly, Frank; Barratt, Benjamin; Beevers, Sean] Imperial Coll London, MRC Ctr Environm & Hlth, London, England; [Alli, Abosede S.; Wang, Jiayuan; Arku, Raphael E.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Brauer, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ezzati, Majid] Imperial Coll London, Abdul Latif Jameel Inst Dis & Emergency Analyt, London, England; [Ezzati, Majid] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Baumgartner, Jill] McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Baumgartner, Jill] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hughes, Allison F.; Nimo, James; Bedford Moses, Josephine; Terkpertey, Solomon] Univ Ghana, Dept Phys, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Vallarino, Jose] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Agyei-Mensah, Samuel; Agyemang, Ernest] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Kelly, Frank; Barratt, Benjamin] Imperial Coll London, NIHR HPRU Environm Exposures & Hlth, London, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of British Columbia; Imperial College London; University of Ghana; McGill University; McGill University; University of Ghana; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

The goal of the ICGEM service is to provide the scientific community with a state-of-the-art archive of static and temporal global gravity field models of the Earth, and develop and operate interactive calculation and visualization services of gravity field functionals on user-defined grids or at a list of particular points via its website. ICGEM offers the largest collection of global gravity field models, including those from the 1960s to the 1990s, as well as the most recent ones, which have been developed using data from dedicated satellite gravity missions, CHAMP, GRACE, GOCE, advanced processing methodologies, and additional data sources such as satellite altimetry and terrestrial gravity. The global gravity field models have been collected from different institutions at international level and after a validation process made publicly available in a standardized format with DOI numbers assigned through GFZ Data Services. The development and maintenance of such a unique platform is crucial for the scientific community in geodesy, geophysics, oceanography, and climate research. In this article, we present the development history and future plans of ICGEM and its current products and essential services.
