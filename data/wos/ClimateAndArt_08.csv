Premised on this fact, urban planners are required to implement proactive energy planning strategies not only to meet these targets but also ensure that future cities development is performed in a way that promotes energy-efficiency. This article gives an overview of the state-of-art of energy planning and forecasting approaches for aiding physical improvement strategies in the building sector. Unlike previous reviews, which have addressed mainly the strengths as well as weaknesses of some of the approaches while referring to some relevant examples from the literature, this article focuses on critically analysing more approaches namely; 2D GIS and 3DGIS (CityGML) based energy prediction approaches, based on their frequent intervention scale, applicability in the building life cycle, and conventional prediction process. This will be followed by unravelling the gaps and issues pertaining to the reviewed approaches. Finally, based on the identified problems, future research prospects are recommended.

However, the v represent a source of errors in many applications, and the presence of cloud contamination can hinder the use of satellite data. This requires a cloud detection process to mask out cloudy pixels from further processing. The trend for remote sensing satellite missions has always been towards smaller size, lower cost, more flexibility, and higher computational power. Reconfigurable Computers (RCs) combine the flexibility of traditional microprocessors with the power of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). There fibre, PCs are a promising candidate for on-board preprocessing. This paper presents the design and implementation of an RC-based real-time cloud detection system. We investigate the potential of using RCs for on-board preprocessing by prototyping the Landsat 7 ETM+ ACCA algorithm on one of the state-of-the art reconfigurable platforms, SRC-6E. Although a reasonable amount of investigations of the ACCA cloud detection algorithm using FPGAs has been reported in the literature, very few details/results were provided and/or limited contributions were accomplished.

Completed in September 1993, it is already showing signs of deterioration, including biological colonization and intense blackening of exterior surfaces, and the breaking off of cladding. In this work we investigated the causes of this premature deterioration. Biological colonization was most intense on the lower areas of shaded walls, the most abundant organisms being the lichens Trapelia coarctata and T. involuta. The blackening was chiefly due to the build up of microorganisms or their remains (no elements indicative of atmospheric pollution were detected). Both the cladding and granite from the source quarry showed signs of severe weathering (fissuration, high porosity, the presence of kaolinite) and had high capillarity, rapidly absorbing large amounts of water and releasing it only slowly. Because of this and the wet climate in Santiago the cladding was almost permanently damp, which, together with its weathered condition, made it highly bioreceptive and, at the same timer reduced its mechanical resistance, making it susceptible to breakage.

The current work analyzes the potential of the application of CSP technology in the country and its particularities. Specifically, the current work examines a CSP plant with parabolic trough collector (PTC) technology and how this technology is affected in its performance depending on the location (inland or coastal) and the refrigeration system (wet, dry, or seawater cooled). The modeling methodology is based on a two-step approach: first, the Rankine steam power cycle is modeled in detail in a state-of-the-art steady-state simulation environment, obtaining the performance of the power cycle for each cooling technology; second, the power cycle performance maps are integrated into a detailed transient system-level simulation model of the complete CSP plant in order to perform annual yield simulations for the different representative locations of the climate of Kuwait. These results provide valuable information on both the potential of this technology for its more immediate application such as electricity generation and other future applications such as the desalination of seawater where the location must necessarily be coastal.","[Sorbet, Javier; Fernandez-Peruchena, Carlos; Zaversky, Fritz; Alotaibi, Sorour A.; Sanchez, Marcelino; Garcia-Barberena, Javier] CENER Natl Renewable Energy Ctr Spain, Dept Solar Energy Technol & Storage, C Ciudad Innovac 7, Sarriguren 31621, Spain; [Chakroun, Walid; Alotaibi, Sorour A.] Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr, Dept Mech Engn, POB 5969, Kuwait 13060, Kuwait; [Ahmed, Mansour] Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Water Res Ctr, POB 24885, Kuwait 13109, Kuwait",Kuwait University; Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research,"Sorbet, J (corresponding author), CENER Natl Renewable Energy Ctr Spain, Dept Solar Energy Technol & Storage, C Ciudad Innovac 7, Sarriguren 31621, Spain.",psorbet@cener.com; cfernandez@cener.com; fzaversky@cener.com; wchakroun@gmail.com; sr.alotaibi@ku.edu.kw; mahmed@kisr.edu.kw; msanchez@cener.com; jgbarberena@cener.com,,"Zaversky, Fritz/0000-0001-6905-3811",Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS) [PP1975EM01],Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)(Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)),The authors would like to express their deepest gratitude to the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS) for funding this research under Grant No. PP1975EM01.,,35,0,0,3,3,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0199-6231,1528-8986,,J SOL ENERG-T ASME,J.

The classification performance of existing techniques was not effectual to accurately mine the interesting spatial data. Furthermore, the amount of time taken for classifying the spatial data location was very higher. In order to resolve the above limitations, an Exponentiated Pareto based linear assorted classification method is introduced to reduce the incorrect classification of spatial data. This paper begins with a discussion of traditional methods of spatial data mining. The algorithm makes an association rule with spatial data objects. The technique conducts the experimental works using metrics such as classification accuracy, time complexity, space complexity and false positive rate with respect to different number of data. The proposed approach takes the forest fire dataset and El Nino dataset as input and predicts the burned area of forest fires and weather and climate conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is able to increase the classification accuracy and reduce the time complexity as well as space complexity and false positive rate of spatial data mining as compared to state-of-the-art works.","[Smart, P.

The roles of the two main contributors to differences between MTL and MSL (the M4 harmonic of the M2 semidiurnal tide, and the combination of the diurnal tides K1 and O1) are described, with a particular focus on the spatial scales of variation in MTL-MSL due to each contributor. Findings from the tide gauge data set are contrasted with those from a state-of-the-art global tide model. The study is of interest within tidal science, but also has practical importance regarding the type of mean level used to define land survey datums. In addition, an appreciation of MTL-MSL difference is important in the use of the historical sea level data used in climate change research, with implications for some of the data stored in international databanks.

This administrative process encompasses the emergence of a change (e.g., a problem or a market-driven feature change), its management approval, and final implementation. Despite strong time pressure, this process cart take several weeks, several months, and, in extreme cases, even over year. Such a long lend time is especially remarkable as the actual processing time for the change typically does not exceed 2 weeks. Based on our case study,, we develop art analytical framework that explains how such an extreme ratio between theoretical processing time and actual lean time is possible. The framework identifies congestion stemming from scarce capacity coupled with processing variability?,, as a major lean time contributor. We outline five improvement strategies that an organization can use in order to reduce ECO lend time, namely, flexible capacity: balanced workloads, merged tasks, pooling, and reduced setups and batching.

Mixed-Mode (MM) buildings utilise both natural and mechanical cooling systems to meet their thermal energy demand. These buildings are able to guarantee that thermal comfort conditions are maintained, whilst exploiting the cooling potential provided by the climate. Effective management of the cooling systems in MM buildings is important to ensure that comfort is maintained and free cooling is exploited when available. While the implementation of hybrid ventilation systems is becoming more common, the current industrial and academic research state-of-the-art provide different and sometimes contrasting approaches to the management and evaluation of MM buildings. The current review provides an overview of studies into MM buildings performed in the last 10 years, analyzing in detail key factors that determine the potential of a building to save energy, including simulations inputs assumption, comfort standard used for evaluation, building and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems typologies and control strategy employed. A detailed analysis of the papers which had a focus on methods for control of hybrid ventilation system was undertaken. This highlighted the importance of coordination between systems to ensure operational effectiveness and showing that while the majority of the studies employed classical control techniques, predictive control methods were the most investigated approaches to fully exploit the potential efficiency of MM buildings.

Upwelling systems support a large proportion of the world's fisheries(5), therefore understanding the links between changes in ocean climate, upwelling-driven hypoxia and ecological perturbations is critical. Here we report on the unprecedented development of severe inner-shelf (<70 m) hypoxia and resultant mass die-offs of fish and invertebrates within the California Current System. In 2002, cross-shelf transects revealed the development of abnormally low dissolved-oxygen levels as a response to anomalously strong flow of subarctic water into the California Current System.

Fodar settles the debate,CRYOSPHERE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FROM-MOTION PHOTOGRAMMETRY; SNOW DEPTH; MOUNTAINS; AIRCRAFT; RANGE; MODEL; LIDAR; UAV,"Though an outstanding achievement for their time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps of the eastern Alaskan Arctic nonetheless contain significant errors, and in this paper we address one of them. Specifically, USGS maps of different scale made in the late 1950s alternate between Mt. Chamberlin and Mt. Isto as the tallest peak in the US Arctic. Given that many of the peaks here are close in height and covered with glaciers, recent climate change may also have changed their height and their order. We resolved these questions using fodar, a new airborne photogrammetric technique that utilizes structure-from-motion (SfM) software and requires no ground control, and validated it using GPS measurements on the peaks as well as airborne lidar. Here we show that Mt. Chamberlin is currently the third tallest peak and that the order and elevations of the five tallest mountains in the US Arctic are Mt. Isto (2735.6m), Mt. Hubley (2717.6m), Mt. Chamberlin (2712.3m), Mt. Michelson (2698.1m), and an unnamed peak (2694.9m); these heights are relative to the NAVD88 GEOID12A vertical datum. We find that it is indeed plausible that this ranking has changed over time and may continue to change as summit glaciers continue to shrink, though Mt. Isto will remain the highest under current climate trends. Mt. Isto is also over 100m taller than the highest peak in Arctic Canada, making it the highest peak in the North American Arctic. Fodar elevations compared to within a few centimeters of our ground-based GPS measurements of the peaks made a few days later and our complete validation assessment indicates a measurement uncertainty of better than +/- 20cm (95% RMSE). By analyzing time series of fodar maps, we were able to detect topographic change on the centimeter level on these steep slopes, indicating that fodar can be used to measure mountain snow packs for water resource availability or avalanche danger, glacier volume change, and slope subsidence, as well as many other applications of benefit to society. Compared to lidar, the current state-of-the-art airborne topographic mapping, we found this SfM technique as accurate, more useful scientifically, and significantly less expensive, suggesting that fodar is a disruptive innovation that will enjoy widespread usage in the future.","[Nolan, Matt] Univ Alaska, Inst Northern Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [DesLauriers, Kit] North Face, Teton Village, WY USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Nolan, M (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Inst Northern Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA.",matt2013@drmattnolan.org,,,National Geographic Society (Expedition Council Grant) [EC0667-14]; Directorate For Geosciences [1418274] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Geographic Society (Expedition Council Grant); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The 2014 climbing expedition and the 22 April 2014 mapping was supported by the National Geographic Society (Expedition Council Grant EC0667-14 to Kit DesLauriers).

Half the EU building stock is prior to energy efficiency standards, thus making it an urgent challenge for the EU to aim at decarbonized cities by 2050. Urban energy retrofitting at cluster level represents a major opportunity, as its current rate is lower than an annual 1%, 3% being the EU desirable rate. This paper presents a bottom-up methodology to assess energy flexibility of building clusters within a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework, applied on a district scale. Energy performance certificates and GIS-based data permit diagnosis and neighborhood selection. The methodology evaluates building cluster energy flexibility via energy demand reduction and PV production. The results show the building cluster hourly load profile for heating and cooling, and thermal comfort indexes. It is expected that this GIS-based methodology will become part of a wider spatial decision support tool for environmental public policies contributing to building stock transformation, from energy consumer to prosumer through deep renovation and renewable energy use.

In doing so, forest education has cultivated human expertise that understands the complexity of ever-changing environments, masters state of the art technologies to manage forests and natural resources, and is capable of creating, communicating and implementing related policies in global communities and societies. In this context, educational technology and online learning enable flexible, accessible, effective, and high-quality forest education.

Key barriers to the adoption of low-energy houses include additional construction costs and uncertainty surrounding actual energy and cost savings. In this paper, we econometrically analyze determinants of low-energy house adoption, including time and risk preferences. We rely on original data from a large survey conducted among households in eight EU countries. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study of low-energy building adoption to rely on a demographically representative sample. Our set of covariates includes parameters of time and risk preferences that were elicited via state-of-the-art incentivized multiple price list experiments and via self-assessment scales. We find mixed results for the effects of time discounting on low-energy house adoption. Risk preferences do appear to matter: as risk proneness increases, so does the adoption of zero net or energy plus building (but not passive houses). Consistent with the low-cost hypothesis about environmental attitude and action, we find no results for environmental attitudes and social norms.","[Olsthoorn, Mark; Schleich, Joachim; Faure, Corinne] Univ Grenoble Alpes ComUE, Grenoble Ecole Managemens, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Schleich, Joachim] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Olsthoorn, M (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes ComUE, Grenoble Ecole Managemens, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",mark.olsthoom@grenoble-em.com,"Faure, Corinne/B-7702-2018; Schleich, Joachim/I-4612-2019","Faure, Corinne/0000-0002-1629-132X; Schleich, Joachim/0000-0001-6079-7240; Olsthoorn, Mark/0000-0003-3789-8611",European Union [649875],European Union(European Commission),Some of this research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme under the project BRISKEE-Behavioral Response to Investment Risks in Energy Efficiency (project number 649875) (www.briskee-cheetah.eu).We thank participants at the 41st International Conference of the International Association of Energy Economics (IAEE 2018) and the 6th World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists (WCERE 2018) for constructive feedback on an earlier version of this work.,,77,13,13,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2019,,,,,1382,1393,,10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.043,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HY3GZ,,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000468012900128,View Full Record in Web of Science

We implement a driving behavior model using a variation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) called Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX). We train our novel context-aware NARX model based on historical behavior of real drivers, their recent driving reactions, and the route average speed retrieved from Google Maps in order to enable driver-specific and self-adaptive driving behavior modeling and long-term estimation. Our methodology shows only 12% error for up to 30-second speed prediction which is improved by 27% compared to the state-of-the-art.

In the modernist period, the term 'rhetoric' was given a conspicuously central role in the heated debate over literary style and its relation to ordinary language, not incidentally after rhetoric's fall from grace as an academic discipline over the course of the 19th century. Scores of writers (e.g. Symons, Yeats, Hofmannsthal, Gourmont, Pound, Eliot) attacked 'rhetoric,' variously (and often vaguely) defined as convoluted poetic diction, moralistic or political preaching, and meaningless abstraction. Yet, the broader cultural context in which this anti-rhetorical discourse was situated reveals a climate of widespread suspicion of language as a sign system, with the term 'rhetoric' functioning as a receptacle for feelings of dissatisfaction with language. In contrast, Jean Paulhan's sophisticated reappropriation of 'rhetoric' in Les fleurs de Tarbes (The Flowers of Tarbes) and other writings reasserted confidence in language and its commonplace expressions, and in the arts of writing. Paulhan's proposed solution helps us to shed light on a demonstrable tendency in modernist poetics to incorporate rather than simply expel rhetoric - a search for a properly modernist rhetoric.","[Somers, Matthias] Univ Leuven, FWO Flemish Fund Sci Res, Fac Arts Literary Studies, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Trudel, Eric] Bard Coll, Div Languages & Literature, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA",KU Leuven,"Somers, M (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, FWO Flemish Fund Sci Res, Fac Arts Literary Studies, Blijde Inkomststr 21,POB 3311, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",matthias.somers@arts.kuleuven.be; trudel@bard.edu,,"Somers, Matthias/0000-0002-1793-6310",,,,,47,1,1,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0003-7982,1613-0642,,ARCADIA,Arcadia,NOV,2015,2,,,,252,270,,10.1515/arcadia-2015-0020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/arcadia-2015-0020,,,19,Literature,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Literature,CV8YA,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000364573000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The overall efficiency of such power plants is 33% due to variations in power plant design, use of wide fuel ranges, different steam turbines, and lack in modeling and control configurations. To improve this efficiency, knowledge on material and energy flows across subsystems, including fuel handling, boiler, turbine, and air management need to be known properly. In addition, there is a widespread lack in measurement and instrumentation systems in power plants across the fleet and operators. This scenario makes the operational adjustments more difficult. Again, the strictness in environmental compliances (sulfur and nitrogen components) is met at the cost of limiting thermal efficiency. Moreover, to comply with faster load change, less fuel consumption and more efficient supercritical boilers have been studied. Hence, to improve the efficiency level, more research starting from the state-ofthe-art review on modeling, identification, and control methods of coal-fired boilers and the integrated plant is aimed in this work. This will also address the issue of global climate change and reduction in emission of greenhouse gases.","[Chandrasekharan, Sreepradha; Panda, Rames Chandra] CSIR CLRI, Dept Chem Engn, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India; [Swaminathan, Bhuvaneswari Natrajan] Easwari Engn Coll, Instrumentat & Elect Dept, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI); Easwari Engineering College,"Panda, RC (corresponding author), CSIR CLRI, Dept Chem Engn, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India.",panda@clri.res.in,"Swaminathan, Bhuvaneswari/T-1020-2019","Swaminathan, Bhuvaneswari/0000-0002-4884-6887; Chandrasekharan, Sreepradha/0000-0002-3787-150X",,,,,97,9,9,3,54,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0167-8299,2191-0235,,REV CHEM ENG,Rev.

The key to desert afforestation is efficient use of scarce water resources and requires innovative, and cost effective, as well as maintenance free technologies for desalination. In this paper, one such methodology is presented. A state of the art solar distillation system is constructed using waste material, which works as an evaporation accelerator, to remove salt from the root zone. The process is optimized with reference to a host of species, conventionally thought to be suitable for deserts and and areas. The process is numerically simulated and experimentally tested under similar environments of Western Australia. The results obtained from one dimensional and two dimensional column experiments to determine the salt and water movement under desert like conditions clearly indicate that the objective of salt leaching in two weeks can be met cost effectively for a plantation without any outside supply of energy sources. After two weeks, proper drip irrigation would be sufficient to maintain the soil moisture for the survival of the plant. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Several studies have reported increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics [4-7], whereas others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias [8, 9] or differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the direction of the latitudinal Specialization gradient remains contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities.","[Schleuning, Matthias; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Dehling, D.

Among various deliberative methods, art-based and embodied practices are particularly important in connecting mind and body of participants and their disparate ways of knowing and meaning making. They can be used to facilitate dialogue and create spaces in which people with different perspectives and experiences can engage in transformative practices. This paper draws on the experience from a sustainability challenge in the central Iran, introduces a collaborative scenariomaking approach called Pathways Theatre. It discusses how using speculative improvisations and embodied experimentation, that is embedded in this approach, can open up new spaces for dialogue and transformative engagement. The research suggests Pathway Theatre can be a useful tool to support researchers and communities in bringing about real dialogue that is needed around controversial topics that may polarize community interests and divide people. This includes conversations on emerging debates around climate change, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnology. The findings from the case study revealed that the theatre represents an opportunity for transformative change at various levels: personal, network (relationships); and institutional.","[Nabavi, Ehsan] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Ctr Publ Awareness Sci CPAS, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Nabavi, Ehsan] Australian Natl Univ, Responsible Innovat Lab, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Nabavi, E (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Ctr Publ Awareness Sci CPAS, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Nabavi, E (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Responsible Innovat Lab, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Ehsan.nabavi@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,142,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2022,,,,,,,103022,10.1016/j.futures.2022.103022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2022.103022,,,20,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,5S1RV,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000874977100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, farmers will need water and arable land to meet this demand. Due to the limited availability of both resources, farmers need a solution that changes the way they operate. Precision irrigation is the solution to deliver bigger, better, and more profitable yields with fewer resources. Several machine learning-based irrigation models have been proposed to use water more efficiently. Due to the limited learning ability of these models, they are not well suited to unpredictable climates. In this context, this paper proposes a deep learning neural network-based Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture (DLiSA). This is a feedback integrated system that keeps its functionality better in the weather of any region for any period of time. DLiSA utilizes a long short-term memory network (LSTM) to predict the volumetric soil moisture content for one day ahead, irrigation period, and spatial distribution of water required to feed the arable land. It is evident from the simulation results that DLiSA uses water more wisely than state-of-the-art models in the experimental farming area.","[Kashyap, Pankaj Kumar; Kumar, Sushil; Jaiswal, Ankita] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Comp & Syst Sci, New Delhi 110067, India; [Prasad, Mukesh; Gandomi, Amir H.] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; University of Technology Sydney","Gandomi, AH (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",pankaj76_scs@jnu.ac.in; skdohare@mail.jnu.ac.in; ankita79_scs@jnu.ac.in; mukesh.prasad@uts.edu.au; gandomi@uts.edu.au,"Gandomi, Amir H/J-7595-2013","Gandomi, Amir H/0000-0002-2798-0104; Prasad, Mukesh/0000-0002-7745-9667","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India","This work was supported in part by Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.

However, a cost-effective commercialization and wide acceptance of electrified transportation necessitates the development of an economical, reliable, and fast charging infrastructure. The incorporation of a well-defined electric vehicle (EV) fast charging infrastructure in the smart grid can offer numerous potential opportunities, particularly from the perspective of vehicle to grid (V2G) technology as well as a solution to the renewable energy intermittency issue. This work reviews the state-of-the-art technology for fast charging of electric vehicles with a comprehensive coverage of the research work done related to the challenges and road blocks to be encountered in its implementation. A comparison of conductive and inductive charging systems is presented followed by an overview of the charging standards and a discussion on the topologies presented in the literature for fast charging stations. A detailed account is presented concerning the issues and opportunities on integration of fast charging infrastructure with grid.

Peri-urban economics require new land-tenure models and innovative forms of agriculture that synthesise agriculture, nature conservation, infrastructure and communities. The chapter also looks at small-scale community innovations including a number of initiatives in Penrith, Western Sydney, such as Out & About in Penrith which explored community activities in local open space, Penrith as a Regional City Garden with diverse models of urban agriculture and the Cooling the Commons project which explores the role that forms of urban agriculture might play in adapting urban environments for liveability in a climate-changed future.

Examples of these applications include making inferences or predictions based on financial data, energy demand and climate data analysis, web usage or sensor network monitoring, and malware/spam detection, among many others. In nonstationary environments, particularly those that generate streaming or multi-domain data, the probability density function of the data-generating process may change (drift) over time. Therefore, the fundamental and rather naive assumption made by most computational intelligence approaches - that the training and testing data are sampled from the same fixed, albeit unknown, probability distribution - is simply not true. Learning in nonstationary environments requires adaptive or evolving approaches that can monitor and track the underlying changes, and adapt a model to accommodate those changes accordingly. In this effort, we provide a comprehensive survey and tutorial of established as well as state-of-the-art approaches, while highlighting two primary perspectives, active and passive, for learning in nonstationary environments.

However, they represent a source of errors in many applications, and the presence of cloud contamination can hinder the use of satellite data. In addition, sending cloudy data to ground stations can result in an inefficient utilization of the communication bandwidth. This requires satellite on-board cloud detection capability to mask out cloudy pixels from further processing. Remote sensing satellite missions have always required smaller size, lower cost, more flexibility, and higher computational power. Reconfigurable Computers (RCs) combine the flexibility of traditional microprocessors with the power of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Therefore, RCs are a promising candidate for on-board preprocessing. This paper presents the design and implementation of an RC-based real-time cloud detection system. We investigate the potential of using RCs for on-board preprocessing by prototyping the Landsat 7 ETM+ACCA algorithm on one of the state-of-the-art reconfigurable platforms, SRC-6.

Here we present a summary of the state of the art about their stratigraphic distribution and diversity across the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. Our data suggest that their differentiation at the genus level was very rapid and reached its maximum in the upper Danian SBZ2. Specific diversification, instead, culminated in the upper Thanetian SBZ4, with a second peak during the Cuisian (=upper Ypresian). Successively, the rotaliid diversity definitely declined, whereas other groups of larger foraminifera, and especially Alveolina and Nummulites, became more widespread and flourished with a large amount of species, up to the lower Bartonian SBZ17, when a final drop in rotaliid diversity is recorded. These major changes appear strictly linked to climate warming events such as Late Danian Event (LDE, generic diversification of rotaliids), Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, faunal turnover followed by abrupt decrease in both generic and specific diversity), Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, increase in number of K-strategists under oligotrophic conditions) and Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO, ultimate drop in diversity and competition with other larger foraminifera).","[Benedetti, Andrea; Papazzoni, Cesare Andrea] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Sci Chim & Geol, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Benedetti, A (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Sci Chim & Geol, Via Campi 103, I-41125 Modena, Italy.",andrea.benedetti@unimore.it; cesareandrea.papazzoni@unimore.it,"Papazzoni, Cesare Andrea/D-9024-2013","Papazzoni, Cesare Andrea/0000-0001-5222-7184; Benedetti, Andrea/0000-0003-4300-8136",Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) [2017RX9XXY],"Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This study was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) , funds PRIN 2017: project Biota resilience to global change: biomineralization of planktic and benthic calcifiers in the past, present and future (prot. 2017RX9XXY) .",,73,7,7,0,2,MICRO PRESS,FLUSHING,"6530 KISSENA BLVD, FLUSHING, NY 11367 USA",0026-2803,1937-2795,,MICROPALEONTOLOGY,Micropaleontology,,2022,2,,,,185,196,,10.47894/mpal.68.2.02,http://dx.doi.org/10.47894/mpal.68.2.02,,,12,Paleontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Paleontology,ZP3KS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000766324700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sudden onset disasters are typically characterized by high stakes, time pressure, and uncertain, conflicting or lacking information. Since the planning and management of response is a complex task, decision makers of aid organizations can thus benefit from decision support methods and tools. A key task is the joint allocation of rescue units and the scheduling of incidents under different conditions of collaboration. The authors present an approach to support decision makers who coordinate response units by (a) suggesting mathematical formulations of decision models, (b) providing heuristic solution procedures, and (c) evaluating the heuristics against both current best practice behavior and optimal solutions. The computational experiments show that, for the generated problem instances, (1) current best practice behavior can be improved substantially by our heuristics, (2) the gap between heuristic and optimal solutions is very narrow for instances without collaboration, and (3) the described heuristics are capable of providing solutions for all generated instances in less than a second on a state-of-the-art PC.","[Schryen, Guido; Rauchecker, Gerhard] Univ Regensburg, Dept Business Informat Syst, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Comes, Tina] Univ Agder, CIEM, Dept ICT, Fac Sci & Engn, N-4898 Grimstad, Norway",University of Regensburg; University of Agder,"Schryen, G (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Business Informat Syst, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",guido.schryen@ur.de; gerhard.rauchecker@wiwi.uni-regensburg.de; tina.comes@uia.no,"Comes, Tina/AAM-2361-2020; Comes, Tina/G-2076-2016; Schryen, Guido/P-7623-2018","Comes, Tina/0000-0002-8721-8314; Comes, Tina/0000-0002-8721-8314; Schryen, Guido/0000-0003-3794-1413",,,,,35,15,15,2,33,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",2363-7005,1867-0202,,BUS INFORM SYST ENG+,Bus.

The current trend towards the reduction in pesticides use has resulted in strong demand for alternative methods to control wireworm populations. This review provides a state-of-the-art of current theory and practice in order to develop new agroecological strategies. The first step should be to conduct a risk assessment based on the production context (e.g., crop, climate, soil characteristics, and landscape) and on adult and/or larval population monitoring. When damage risk appears significant, prophylactic practices can be applied to reduce wireworm abundance (e.g., low risk rotations, tilling, and irrigation). Additionally, curative methods based on natural enemies and on naturally derived insecticides are, respectively, under development or in practice in some countries. Alternatively, practices may target a reduction in crop damage instead of pest abundance through the adoption of selected cultural practices (e.g., resistant varieties, planting and harvesting time) or through the manipulation of wireworm behavior (e.g., companion plants). Practices can be combined in a global Integrated Pest Management (IPM) framework to provide the desired level of crop protection.","[Poggi, Sylvain; Le Cointe, Ronan; Plantegenest, Manuel] Univ Rennes, Inst Genet Environm & Plant Protect IGEPP, Agrocampus ouest, INRAE, F-35650 Le Rheu, France; [Lehmhus, Jorn] Julius Kuhn Inst, Inst Plant Protect Field Crops & Grassland, D-38104 Braunschweig, Germany; [Furlan, Lorenzo] Veneto Agr, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy",INRAE; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; Julius Kuhn-Institut,"Poggi, S (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, Inst Genet Environm & Plant Protect IGEPP, Agrocampus ouest, INRAE, F-35650 Le Rheu, France.",sylvain.poggi@inrae.fr; ronan.le-cointe@inrae.fr; joern.lehmhus@julius-kuehn.de; Manuel.Plantegenest@agrocampus-ouest.fr; lorenzo.furlan@venetoagricoltura.org,,"POGGI, Sylvain/0000-0003-3051-5091; Furlan, Lorenzo/0000-0003-4021-4532","French Office for Biodiversity (STARTAUP project); Groupement National Interprofessionnel des Semences et plants (TAUPIN LAND project); French Ministry for Agriculture and Food [20ART1568739]; Institute for Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection (IGEPP)","French Office for Biodiversity (STARTAUP project); Groupement National Interprofessionnel des Semences et plants (TAUPIN LAND project); French Ministry for Agriculture and Food; Institute for Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection (IGEPP)","This research was supported by the French Office for Biodiversity (STARTAUP project); the Groupement National Interprofessionnel des Semences et plants (TAUPIN LAND project); and the French Ministry for Agriculture and Food for funding the TAUPIC project (CASDAR nffi 20ART1568739).

However, to implement, manage, and execute real-world scientific applications in the form of workflows on multiple infrastructures (servers, clusters, cloud) remains a challenge. In this paper, we present DagOnStar (Directed Acyclic Graph On Anything), a lightweight Python library implementing a workflow paradigm based on parallel patterns that can be executed on any combination of local machines, on-premise high performance computing clusters, containers, and cloud-based virtual infrastructures. DagOnStar is designed to minimize data movement to reduce the application storage footprint. A case study based on a real-world application is explored to illustrate the use of this novel workflow engine: a containerized weather data collection application deployed on multiple infrastructures. An experimental comparison with other state-of-the-art workflow engines shows that DagOnStar can run workflows on multiple types of infrastructure with an improvement of 50.19% in run time when using a parallel pattern with eight task-level workers.

This problem not only concerns the volume of crop production but also the quality and safety of the food industry. Several research studies have proposed deep learning for plant disease detection. However, there is little information about the confidence of the prediction on unseen samples. Therefore, uncertainty in models of plant disease detection is required for effective crop management. In particular, uncertainty arising from sample selection bias makes it difficult to scale automatic plant disease detection systems to production. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic programming approach for plant disease detection using state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning techniques and the uncertainty as a misclassification measurement. The results show that Bayesian inference achieves classification performance that is comparable to the standard optimization procedures for fine-tuning deep learning models. At the same time, the proposed method approximates the posterior density for the plant disease detection problem and quantify the uncertainty of the predictions for out-of-sample instances.

The ionogels are mechanically robust and undergo an LCST-type phase transition with no volume change upon heating accompanied by a switching of optical transmittance. The optical switching temperature is tunable within a wide range between subzero to over 100 degrees C. Molecular dynamic simulation aided molecular design and provided further mechanistic understanding. Apart from the LCST-type transition, these ionogels are absent of freezing point and volatility and demonstrated unprecedented super high optical cyclic stability even after 5000 heating cooling cycles with no detectable liquid leaching. In addition, these ionogels are chemically compatible with a range of additives such as organic dyes and photothermal plasmonic conducting nanoparticles which endow multifunctionality and versatility in terms of applications. A model mini-house affixed with the ionogel-incorporated glazing demonstrates a reduction of indoor temperature by up to 20 degrees C far superior to state-of-the-art tungstate coated glazing. This new class of ionogels marks an important milestone in smart materials development for a range of applications including autonomous and climate-adaptable solar modulation window.","[Lee, Heng Yeong; Mu, Chengzhong; Chang, Chen Jian; Chen, Yi Ling; Song, Yujie; Hu, Xiao Matthew] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Cai, Yufeng; Hu, Xiao Matthew] Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Environm Chem & Mat Ctr, 1 Cleantech Loop, Singapore 637141, Singapore; [Velioglu, Sadiye; Chew, Jia Wei] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Chem & Biol Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Hu, XM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Hu, XM (corresponding author), Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Environm Chem & Mat Ctr, 1 Cleantech Loop, Singapore 637141, Singapore.",ASXHU@e.ntu.edu.sg,"Song, Yujie/L-1409-2017; Chew, Jia Wei/A-7395-2018; Song, Yujie/AFM-6022-2022; Hu, Xiao/A-2227-2011; Velioglu, Sadiye/AAA-3745-2021","Song, Yujie/0000-0001-9600-8530; Chew, Jia Wei/0000-0002-6603-1649; Hu, Xiao/0000-0002-0941-4205; Velioglu, Sadiye/0000-0002-4812-3611",Economic Development Board and Nanyang Technological University [M4061513],Economic Development Board and Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University),"This work is supported by the research fund of Economic Development Board and Nanyang Technological University under grant M4061513.

The main mechanisms that contributed to the growth of the heat wave are still disputed and state-of-the-art climate models have difficulty to realistically simulate the extreme conditions. Here we analyse simulations using recent versions of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts seasonal ensemble forecasting system and present, for the first time, retrospective forecasts which simulate accurately not only the abnormal warmth but also the observed precipitation and mid-tropospheric circulation patterns. It is found that while the land surface hydrology plays a crucial role, the successful simulations also required revised formulations of the radiative and convective parameterizations. We conclude that the predictability of the event was less due to remote teleconnections effects and more due to in situ processes which helped maintain the dry surface anomalies occurring at the beginning of the summer.

This is due to creep deformation, and the rate of degradation is expedited due to exposure to extreme tropical climate. Hence, it is crucial to comprehend the early creep stage, which leads to structural failure. Apart from that, there are several research and industrial application gaps of these cross arms. For instance, creep life analysis of actual cross arms is still unexplored. In this study, the state-of-the-art is related to creep experiments and creep test rig designs, espacially on the creep test of a cantilever beam setup. The experimental methodologies implemented two vital approaches, conventional and accelerated techniques. The specific creep experiments on cantilever beam structure are emphasized and suggested in the manuscript as the building blocks for future design of cantilever creep test rig. This helps to guide future development design of cantilever beam creep test rig by fulfilling the specific criteria related to creep fundamentals, numerical modelling analysis, test operation for data evaluation, and development process. At the end, the challenges and improvements on the criteria existing design of test rigs are elaborated.","[Asyraf, M. R. M.; Ishak, M. R.; Yidris, N.; Shahroze, R. M.; Johari, A.

Anthropogenic climate change, loss of biodiversity, resource peaks, or local air and water pollution are symptoms of this crisis. Social ecology provides an inter-and transdisciplinary take on sustainability research and is well-equipped to respond to the research challenges associated with this crisis. Social ecology comprises different schools of thought, of which two initiated this special issue on State of the Art and Future Prospects for the research field. The approaches to social ecology of the ISOE-Institute for Social-Ecological Research in Frankfurt, Germany, and the Institute of Social Ecology ( SEC) in Vienna, Austria are based on a common understanding of the challenges posed by social-ecological crises. In how these social ecologies tackle their research questions, conceptual differences become evident.

We all process information in ways that are adapted to be consistent with our underlying ideologies. These ideologies can sometimes be framed in terms of particular axes or dimensions, which makes it possible to represent some aspects of an ideology as a region in the kind of vector space that is typical of many generalised quantum models. Such models can then be used to explain and predict, in broad strokes, whether a particular argument or proposal is likely to appeal to an individual with a particular ideology. The choice of suitable arguments to bring about desired actions is traditionally part of the art or science of rhetoric, and today's highly polarised society means that this skill is becoming more important than ever. This paper presents a basic model for understanding how different goals will appeal to people with different ideologies, and thus how different rhetorical positions can be adopted to promote the same desired outcome.

While designing an integrated energy system, optimum unit sizing of the system is one of the important aspects. Different state of the art sizing methodologies such as artificial intelligence, traditional methods, hybrid methods and available software tools have been presented in the paper. Various control strategies for energy management in integrated energy system such as multi agent system (MAS), demand side management (DSM), distributed controller, centralized controller and hybrid controller have been studied in detail. Further, various open issues in integrated renewable energy system have been investigated in the paper along with the possible solutions to address the reported open issues.",,,,gaurav161990@gmail.com,"Saini, Gaurav/AAA-2803-2021","Saini, Gaurav/0000-0001-9593-5180",,,,,195,7,7,9,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

In palaeoecological studies the recognition of vegetation composition (a baseline) just before a new type of disturbance impacted the landscape is already for many years subject of studies with a local to regional focus. A good understanding how the pre-anthropogenic landscape developed to its present degraded status over time is essential to further develop our environment for the needs of the next century and to protect it to devastating expressions of global warming. The book 'Rewilding in Nederland' (Arts et al. 2022) presents the ecological scope, while the 2022 issue of PAGES Magazine shows a palaeoecological view. Both publications are a plea for introducing natural mechanisms in nature conservation and rewilding. As The Netherlands needs a reshape to tackle current problems in climate change, nitrogen deposition and the building environment, there is place for a new academic education programme 'Future Environmental Studies'. Academic studies, such as landscape ecology, historical ecology, physical geo graphy, palaeoecology, population biology and nature conservation, combined with more technical studies such as, geology, hydrology and economics could contribute to a newly designed academic curriculum.","[Hooghiemstra, H.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam IBED, Dept Ecosyst & Landscape Dynam, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hooghiemstra, H (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam IBED, Dept Ecosyst & Landscape Dynam, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",H.Hooghiemstra@uva.nl,,,,,,,18,0,0,2,2,NATL HERBARIUM NEDERLAND,LEIDEN,"UNIV LEIDEN BRANCH, POSTBUS 9514, LEIDEN, 2300 RA, NETHERLANDS",0017-2294,,,GORTERIA,Gorteria,,2022,,,,,47,49,,10.2487/delu.8754,http://dx.doi.org/10.2487/delu.8754,,,3,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,4Z0XT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000861943000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gameful methodologies have progressively been introduced into strategic planning processes, futures research, and transition studies, offering a powerful input to participatory backcasting processes. As gamification is a novel and impactful way to motivate and engage participants to take action during and after the participatory process, this study develops a framework for practitioners to gamify backcasting processes. Developed through state-of-the-art review of extant corpus as well as two cases of gamified participatory backcasting, the framework elucidates how participatory backcasting processes that include gamification elements designed to address engagement do have an impact on the participants, particularly in terms of the process being a positive, co-creative experience, and offer a good foundation for posterior actions.

Regular FARS measurements, which currently total similar to 3000 h of ruby lidar polarization data, have been directed toward basic cloud research, remote sensing techniques development, and to improving satellite cloud property retrieval methods and GCM predictions by providing climatologically representative cloud datasets and parameterizations. Although the initial studies involved mainly the ruby lidar, the facility has steadily evolved to include a range of visible, infrared, and microwave passive remote sensors, and state-of-the-art, high-resolution dual-wavelength scanning lidar and W-band Doppler radar systems. All three active systems display polarization diversity. In this paper are reviewed the specifications of FARS instrumentation and the research programs to which they have been applied. Four multiple remote sensor case studies of various cloud systems are presented to illustrate the research capabilities.

Predicting SST at different temporal scales benefits various applications, from short-term SST prediction for weather forecasting to long-term SST prediction for analyzing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, existing approaches for SST prediction train separate models for different temporal scales, which is inefficient and cannot take advantage of the correlations among the temperatures of different scales to improve the prediction performance. In this work, we propose a unified spatio-temporal model termed the Multi-In and Multi-Out (MIMO) model to predict SST at different scales. MIMO is an encoder-decoder model, where the encoder learns spatio-temporal features from the SST data of multiple scales, and fuses the learned features with a Cross Scale Fusion (CSF) operation. The decoder utilizes the learned features from the encoder to adaptively predict the SST of different scales. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to predict SST at different temporal scales simultaneously with a single model. According to the experimental evaluation on the Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) dataset, MIMO achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance.","[Hou, Siyun; Li, Wengen; Liu, Tianying; Guan, Jihong; Qin, Rufu] Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China; [Hou, Siyun; Liu, Tianying; Wang, Zhenfeng] Tongji Univ, Project Management Off China Natl Sci Seafloor Ob, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shuigeng] Shanghai Key Lab Intelligent Informat Proc, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shuigeng] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Qin, Rufu] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Tongji University; Fudan University; Tongji University,"Li, WG (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China.",housiyun@tongji.edu.cn; Correspondencelwengen@tongji.edu.cn; liutianying@tongji.edu.cn; sgzhou@fudan.edu.cn; jhguan@tongji.edu.cn; qinrufu@tongji.edu.cn; wangzhenfeng@cnsso.edu.cn,"Âàò, Â§©È¢ñ/GZA-7524-2022","Li, Wengen/0000-0002-8768-6740","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1936205, 62172300]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [20PJ1414300]; Open Reseach Program of Shanghai Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing [IIPL201909]; China National Scientific Seafloor Observatory",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Open Reseach Program of Shanghai Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing; China National Scientific Seafloor Observatory,"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants No. U1936205, 62172300, Shanghai Pujiang Program under grants No. 20PJ1414300, Open Reseach Program of Shanghai Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing under grants No. IIPL201909, and China National Scientific Seafloor Observatory.",,36,1,1,13,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2022,10,,,,,,2371,10.3390/rs14102371,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14102371,,,16,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,1R2CT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000803184100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this approach is often guided by the environmental pillar of sustainability, with less focus on the economic and social pillars. The purpose of this paper is to examine this issue in the speculative renewable energy propositions for Freshkills Park in New York City submitted for the 2012 Land Art Generator Initiative (LAGI) competition. This paper first proposes an optimal electricity distribution (OED) framework in and around public spaces based on relevant ecology and energy theory (Odum's fourth and fifth law of thermodynamics). This framework addresses social engagement related to public interaction, and economic engagement related to the estimated quantity of electricity produced, in conjunction with environmental engagement related to the embodied energy required to construct the renewable energy infrastructure. Next, the study uses the OED framework to analyse the top twenty-five projects submitted for the LAGI 2012 competition. The findings reveal an electricity distribution imbalance and suggest a lack of in-depth understanding about sustainable electricity distribution within public space design. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.","[Ozgun, Kaan; Weir, Ian; Cushing, Debra] Queensland Univ Technol, Creat Ind, Sch Design, Dept Landscape Architecture, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Ozgun, K (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Creat Ind, Sch Design, Dept Landscape Architecture, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",k.ozgun@qut.edu.au; ian.weir@qut.edu.au; debra.cushing@qut.edu.au,"Ozgun, Kaan/I-7938-2015","Ozgun, Kaan/0000-0002-3853-1400; Cushing, Debra Flanders/0000-0002-2192-0637",Queensland University of Technology,Queensland University of Technology,Many thanks to Christian Long and two other anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Vertical farming systems (VFS) can meet daily consumer demands for nutritious fresh products, forming a part of resilient food systems-particularly in and around densely populated areas. VFS currently produce a limited range of crops including fruits, vegetables and herbs, but successful implementation of vertical farming as part of mainstream agriculture will require improvements in profitability, energy efficiency, public policy and consumer acceptance. Here we discuss VFS as multi-layer indoor crop cultivation systems, exploring state-of-the-art vertical farming and future challenges in the fields of plant growth, product quality, automation, robotics, system control and environmental sustainability and how research and development, socio-economic and policy-related institutions must work together to ensure successful upscaling of VFS to future food systems. Vertical farming systems have the potential to form a part of resilient food systems through the production of reliable, high-quality crops in urban landscapes. This Review explores how multi-layer indoor crop cultivation systems currently operate and the conditions needed to upscale and support their integration into mainstream agriculture.","[van Delden, S.

However, due to variousness of crowd flows, multiple hidden correlations among urban regions affect the flows. Besides, crowd flows are also influenced by the distribution of Points-of-Interests (POIs), transitional functional zones, environmental climate, and different time slots of the dynamic urban environment. Thus, we exploit multiple correlations between urban regions by considering the mentioned factors comprehensively rather than the geographical distance and propose multi-graph convolution gated recurrent units (MGCGRU) for capturing these multiple spatial correlations. For adapting to the dynamic mobile data, we leverage multiple spatial correlations and the temporal dependency to build an urban flow prediction framework that uses only a little recent data as the input but can mine rich internal modes. Hence, the framework can mitigate the influence of the instability of data distributions in highly dynamic environments for prediction. The experimental results on two real-world datasets in Shanghai show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art methods for crowd flow prediction.","[Zhou, Qiang; Gu, Jing-Jing; Ling, Chao; Li, Wen-Bo; Zhuang, Yi; Wang, Jian] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sei & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Gu, JJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sei & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",zhouqnuaacs@nuaa.edu.cn; gujingjing@nuaa.edu.cn; lingchao@nuaa.edu.cn; liwenbo@nuaa.edu.cn; zhuangyi@nuaa.edu.cn; wangjian@nuaa.edu.cn,"joy, shone/AAR-3728-2020; li, wenbo/GZM-8930-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572253]; Aviation Science Fund of China [2016ZC52030],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Aviation Science Fund of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61572253, and the Aviation Science Fund of China under Grant No. 2016ZC52030.",,35,9,9,1,14,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-9000,1860-4749,,J COMPUT SCI TECH-CH,J.

By focusing on experiencing environments, this collection illuminates empirical realities and highlights people's agency and perspectives as well as their innovative capacities to retain, transform, and (re)create ways of life in their interactions with human and other-than-human entities. It advocates for equal recognition of different worlds and seeks to advance the decolonization and pluralization of scholarship.

We employ a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform end-to-end upsampling, which is trained with data at lower resolution, i.e., from 40 -> 20 m, respectively 360 -> 60 m GSD. In this way, one has access to a virtually infinite amount of training data, by downsampling real Sentinel-2 images. We use data sampled globally over a wide range of geographical locations, to obtain a network that generalises across different climate zones and land-cover types, and can super-resolve arbitrary Sentinel-2 images without the need of retraining. In quantitative evaluations (at lower scale, where ground truth is available), our network, which we call DSen2, outperforms the best competing approach by almost 50% in RMSE, while better preserving the spectral characteristics.

However, it is more feasible to implement the trigeneration system for most commercial and domestic distributed generations as the cooling demand is deliberately high compared to heating demand especially in hot and humid climate locations. Moreover, micro gas turbine is observed to be a beneficial prime mover in cogeneration and trigeneration system based on several criteria such as ability on acquiring high heat to power ratio characteristic as well as lower greenhouse gas emission.

The analysis demonstrates that the academic engagement in this topic is limited, with fewer than sixty publications in the past four decades. Displacement camps are often situated in countries with extreme climates; however the issue of the thermal performance of shelters and their impact on health is found to be further overlooked. In an attempt to rebalance this situation, thermal surveys were conducted in two refugee camps in Jordan. The study found that the refugees were very unsatisfied with the thermal conditions in their shelters, particularly in summer. Internal surface temperatures of 46 degrees C were recorded in September and indoor CO2 concentration levels of 2700 ppm were measured in winter. In addition, the study reported on the adaptation strategies used by refugees to cope with the heat and cold, and on their views on shelter design considerations and satisfaction.","[Albadra, D.; Coley, D.; Hart, J.] Univ Bath, Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Albadra, D (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath, Avon, England.",d.albadra@bath.ac.uk; d.a.coley@bath.ac.uk; hart2@bath.ac.uk,,,EPSRC/GCRF [EP/P510907/1]; EPSRC [EP/P029175/1],EPSRC/GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by EPSRC/GCRF (EP/P510907/1), EPSRC (EP/P029175/1) and was conducted in collaboration with UNHCR Jordan and NRC Jordan.

The current state-of-the-art autonomous underwater vehicles and sensors are mostly powered by primary battery, and therefore have limited capacity and lifetime. Harvesting the ocean thermal energy associated with vertical temperature differentials between the warm surface and cold deep water has the potential to power these autonomous underwater vehicles and sensors indefinitely. Results from the development, deployment and recovery of a prototype thermal recharging underwater float (known as SOLO-TREC) in the ocean will be presented. With eight hours energy harvesting and sampling interval, SOLO-TREC has made more than a thousand dives between the ocean surface and 500 meters water depth over a period of 1.5 years. Recent progress to commercialize this thermal recharging technology in support of several climate and oceanographic initiatives will be presented. Future applications of this thermal energy harvesting technology to power autonomous underwater vehicles such as gliders and propeller-driven AUVs will also be discussed.","[Chao, Yi] Seatrec Inc, 248 E Foothill Blvd,Suite 200, Pasadena, CA 91016 USA",,"Chao, Y (corresponding author), Seatrec Inc, 248 E Foothill Blvd,Suite 200, Pasadena, CA 91016 USA.",yi@seatrec.com,,,,,,,10,17,18,1,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0197-7385,,978-1-4673-9724-7,OCEANS-IEEE,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Marine; Oceanography; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BG0TP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000386521800034,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data were used to test algorithms from the recent literature for their effectiveness at predicting surface DMS concentrations. Dividing the data by research cruise (i.e. year and season) and into biogeochemical provinces aided data interpretation. For this new data set, many of the available algorithms over-predicted the measured DMS concentration. The best fit was found with a dilution model based on the depth of the mixed layer [Aranami, K., Tsunogai, S., 2004.

Meeting these targets is a challenge that calls for innovative research to improve the use of renewable energy sources, new technologies, and holistic tools and methodologies. Such research should integrate the dynamics and main drivers of energy supply and demand in buildings to support new policies, plans and actions towards lowering the built environment burdens. This paper brings together ten research topics concerning the energy and environmental performance of buildings, which can support a shift towards a more sustainable built environment. Background information and state of the art literature on the covered research topics is briefly summarized, gaps are identified and guidelines for future research are provided. The selected topics cover different stages along the lifetime of buildings (from design and operation, to retrofitting and end-of-life), different scale approaches (from building elements/components, to the building, district and urban scales), and different methods to assess the energy and environmental performance of buildings (life-cycle assessment, generative design methods and retrofitting tools). Other topics are discussed such as: nearly zero-energy buildings, the control of domestic energy resources in smart grid scenarios, the need to include end-users' behaviors in the dynamics of energy demand, the advantages of improving thermal storage by using phase change materials, the importance of reducing heating and cooling energy demand (maintaining indoor thermal comfort), and the optimization of heating and cooling fluids, and their system control.","[Soares, N.; Bastos, J.; Pereira, L.

Given that glacial lakes have little area compared with background objects, extracting glacial lakes high precisely is still challenging. Recently, U-Net, a deep learning (DL) method, has shown great potential in glacial lake extraction, due to its elaborate encoder-decoder structure and powerful skip connections. However, the skip connections transmit a lot of information irrelevant to glacial lakes from the low-level appearance features to the high-level semantic features, leading to inefficient utilization of the low-level features. In this letter, we propose a normalized difference water index (NDWI) attention U-Net (NAU-Net) for pixel-wise glacial lake segmentation, which utilizes NDWI as a spatial attention to highlight the signals of water regions in low-level feature maps, thereby making the network pay more attention to glacial lakes. Compared with the classical networks and the state-of-the-art non-DL methods, our NAU-Net shows better performance on glacial lake extraction.

Not only have researchers made fascinating discoveries about their secret lives, these ubiquitous superorganisms have sparked the culture's imagination as well. Trees have recently been the subject of best-selling novels, essays, and high-impact films. While most human beings would be hard pressed to name any species of tree they might encounter in their daily lives, talk about trees is becoming more and more mainstream. And logically so. The more modern technology severs our ties to the physical world-and, no less importantly, the more climate change signals the impending disappearance of that world-the more urgency we feel to reconnect. This article explores how contemporary French culture summons us to do just that. Through an exploration of a few of the most compelling recent works that testify to what I call the arboreal imaginary in contemporary French culture, this article posits that attending to trees in works of art is a necessarily ecological gesture, one that encourages us to think about our stewardship of the environment as much as it invites us to consider novel ways of poetically inhabiting the planet.","[Blatt, Ari J.] Univ Virginia, French, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Blatt, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, French, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1740-9292,1740-9306,,CONTEMP FR FRANCOPH,Contemp.

Exponentially-weighted forecast bias estimates and error covariance matrices are formed at observation sites, aggregated spatially and temporally, and used to formulate a constrained, regularized least squares regression problem that may be solved using quadratic programming. The model is re-trained when new observations arrive, updating the forecast bias estimates and consensus combination weights to adapt to weather regime and input forecast model changes. The algorithm is illustrated for 0-72 hour temperature forecasts at over 1200 sites in the contiguous U.S. based on a 22-member forecast ensemble, and its performance over multiple seasons is compared to a state-of-the-art ensemble-based forecasting system. In addition to weather forecasts, this approach to consensus may be useful for ensemble predictions of climate, wind energy, solar power, energy demand, and numerous other quantities.","[Williams, John K.; Neilley, Peter P.; Koval, Joseph P.; McDonald, Jeff] Weather Co, Andover, MA 01810 USA",,"Williams, JK (corresponding author), Weather Co, Andover, MA 01810 USA.",john.williams@weather.com,,,,,,,18,10,10,0,0,ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PALO ALTO,"2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA",2159-5399,2374-3468,,AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE,,,2016,,,,,3915,3921,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BN6JG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000485474203131,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is involved in relevant climate feedbacks and natural hazards such as avalanches and floods. Monitoring and forecasting snow cover characteristics is challenging. While snow cover extent is relatively easy to retrieve from satellite data, remote sensing retrievals of the snow water equivalent (SWE) is often inaccurate, particularly in complex mountainous terrain. Model-based snow cover estimates, driven by meteorological data, often bear significant uncertainties due to both input data and model errors. Data assimilation can combine both approaches to improve SWE estimates. In this paper, we review current state-of-the-art data assimilation methodologies used to optimally combine measurements with snow cover models in order to reduce uncertainties. The suitability of a given data assimilation method varies with the numerical complexity of snow models as well as the availability and the type of observations. This review describes the issues and challenges associated with data assimilation applied to the mountain snow cover, providing recommendations for existing and upcoming monitoring and prediction systems of snow hydrology in mountainous regions.","[Largeron, Chloe; Dumont, Marie; Morin, Samuel; Lafaysse, Matthieu] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Toulouse, Ctr Etud Neige, Mateo France,CNRS,CNRM, Grenoble, France; [Largeron, Chloe; Boone, Aaron] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Mateo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Metref, Sammy; Cosme, Emmanuel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IGE, CNRS, IRD, Grenoble, France; [Jonas, Tobias; Winstral, Adam] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland; [Margulis, Steven A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Meteo France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Dumont, M (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Toulouse, Ctr Etud Neige, Mateo France,CNRS,CNRM, Grenoble, France.",marie.dumont@meteo.fr,"Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011; Dumont, Marie/R-4507-2019","Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X; Dumont, Marie/0000-0002-4002-5873",CNES (APR MIOSOTIS); MAGELLIUM; ANR program EBONI [ANR-16-CE01-0006]; ANR [ANR-17-CE01-0009-01]; NASA High Mountain Asia Grant [NNX16AQ63G],CNES (APR MIOSOTIS); MAGELLIUM; ANR program EBONI(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); NASA High Mountain Asia Grant,"The CNRM/CEN and IGE are part of Labex OSUG@2020.The research was partly funded by CNES (APR MIOSOTIS), MAGELLIUM and by the ANR program ANR-16-CE01-0006 EBONI.

The water and energy cycles underpin global food and water security and need to be fully understood as the climate changes. In the last few decades, Earth Observation (EO) technology has played an increasingly important role in determining both ET and SSM. This paper reviews the state of the art in the use specifically of operational EO of both ET and SSM estimates. We discuss the key technical and operational considerations to derive accurate estimates of those parameters from space. The review suggests significant progress has been made in the recent years in retrieving ET and SSM operationally; yet, further work is required to optimize parameter accuracy and to improve the operational capability of services developed using EO data. Emerging applications on which ET/SSM operational products may be included in the context specifically in relation to agriculture are also highlighted; the operational use of those operational products in such applications remains to be seen.","[Petropoulos, George P.] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 2DB, Dyfed, Wales; [Petropoulos, George P.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Mineral Resources Engn, Khania 73100, Greece; [Srivastava, Prashant K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Piles, Maria] Univ Valencia, IPL, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Pearson, Simon] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Inst Agrifood Technol, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England",Aberystwyth University; Technical University of Crete; Banaras Hindu University (BHU); University of Valencia; University of Lincoln,"Petropoulos, GP (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 2DB, Dyfed, Wales.;Petropoulos, GP (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Mineral Resources Engn, Khania 73100, Greece.",petropoulos.george@gmail.com; prashant.just@gmail.com; maria.piles@uv.es; SPearson@lincoln.ac.uk,"Petropoulos, George P/F-2384-2013; Petropoulos, George P./N-5810-2019; Piles, Maria/M-1057-2014; Pearson, Simon/G-4035-2019","Petropoulos, George P/0000-0003-1442-1423; Petropoulos, George P./0000-0003-1442-1423; Piles, Maria/0000-0002-1169-3098; Srivastava, Prashant K./0000-0002-4155-630X; Pearson, Simon/0000-0002-4297-4837",FP7-People project ENViSIon-EO [334533]; European Commission; UK Research Council [STFC ST/N006836/1]; STFC [ST/N006836/1] Funding Source: UKRI,FP7-People project ENViSIon-EO; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); UK Research Council; STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),GPP's contribution has been supported by the FP7-People project ENViSIon-EO (project reference number 334533) and the author gratefully acknowledges the financial support provided by the European Commission.

However, state of the art energy optimization algorithms make strong and unrealistic assumptions of energy models, both in simulations and during the operation of smart systems. For instance, simplistic energy models for energy harvesting leads to inaccurate representation and prediction of the true dynamics of energy. Consequently, systems for smart environments are unable to meet expected performance criteria. In this paper, we propose innovative models to overcome the drawbacks of simplistic energy representations in smart environments. We provide the insights of how to generate precise lightweight energy models. Using the physical properties of solar and flow energy harvesting as case studies, the trade-off between energy harvesting inference and real-time measurement of energy generation is explored. To evaluate our proposed energy models against the simplistic versions, we use real measured data from our environmental micro-climate monitoring deployment in an urban park and a 103% improvement is seen. Additionally, to define the trade-offs between inferred and measured energy generation, experiments are conducted utilizing solar and smart water testbeds.","[Jackson, Greg; Kartakis, Sokratis; McCann, Julie A.] Imperial Coll London, London, England",Imperial College London,"Jackson, G (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, London, England.",gregj@imperial.ac.uk; s.kartakis13@imperial.ac.uk; jamm@imperial.ac.uk,,,Intel Collaborative Research Institute (ICRI),Intel Collaborative Research Institute (ICRI),This work is funded by the Intel Collaborative Research Institute (ICRI) for sustainable future cities.,,15,3,3,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6517-2,,,,2017,,,,,148,154,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BI4GU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000411757300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we aim to predict turbulent flow by learning its highly nonlinear dynamics from spatiotemporal velocity fields of large-scale fluid flow simulations of relevance to turbulence modeling and climate modeling. We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call Turbulent-Flow Net (TF-Net), is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility of learned representations. We compare our model, TF-Net, with state-of-the-art baselines and observe significant reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of turbulent flows.","[Wang, Rui; Yu, Rose] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kashinath, Karthik; Mustafa, Mustafa; Albert, Adrian] Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA USA",Northeastern University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Wang, R (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wang.rui4@northeastern.edu; kkashinath@lbl.gov; mmustafa@lbl.gov; aalbert@lbl.gov; roseyu@northeastern.edu,,,Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This research used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Besides this, the complex interrelations between gibberellins and other plant growth regulators are also described, providing an intricate network of interactions that ultimately drives towards precise and specific gene expression. Thus, genes and proteins identified as being involved in gibberellin responses in model and non-model species are highlighted. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms governing the gibberellins' relation to stress responses are also depicted. This review aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art of the current perceptions of the interactions of gibberellins with other phytohormones, and their responses to plant stresses, thus allowing for the identification of the specific mechanisms involved.

Furthermore, the utilization of renewable energy sources for desalination purposes offers additional benefits. Renewable energy based desalination systems could also be used in urban areas, but they are especially attractive for remote areas where there is a limited or no access to fossil fuels sources or an electrical grid. Many renewable energy technologies can be hybridized for desalination purposes to improve productivity, flexibility, reliability, and economic feasibility.

The existence of this acceleration is crucial for coastal protection planning purposes. The absence of the acceleration would enhance the debate on the general validity of current future projections. Methodologically, the evaluation of the acceleration is a controversial and still open discussion, reported in a number of review articles, which illustrate the state-of-art in the field of sea level research. In the present paper, the well-proven direct scaling analysis approach is proposed in order to describe the long-term sea level variability at 12 worldwide-selected tide gauge stations. For each of the stations, it has been shown that the long-term sea level variability exhibits a trimodal scaling behaviour, which can be modelled by a power law with three different pairs of shape and scale parameters.

In this study, we review state-of-the-art research progress on the possible sinks of the Changjiang-derived sediments in the ECS during the late Quaternary. The major sinks of these sediments in the ECS are on the outer shelf and the Okinawa Trough during the last glacial maximum corresponding to a lowstand of sea level. During the deglacial marine transgression, the gently dipping shelf was rapidly inundated and strong tides prevented fine sediment from deposition on the open shelf, resulting in the development of a unique tidal sand ridge system. With sea level reaching the present situation and the modern marine environment being completed in the early Holocene, the Changjiang sediments mostly accumulated in the river's estuary to build a large delta, with only a fraction reaching the inner shelf and coastal embayments. The late-Quaternary changes in monsoon-climate-induced river flux, sea level and oceanic circulation primarily controlled the source-to-sink transport of the Changjiang sediments in the ECS, and further determined the stratigraphic framework and sedimentary facies on the shelf.","[Yang, Shouye; Bi, Lei; Li, Chao] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhongbo; Dou, Yanguang] Qingdao Inst Marine Geol, Key Lab Marine Hydrocarbon Resources & Environm G, Minist Land & Resources, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China",Tongji University; China Geological Survey; Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology (QIMG); Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Yang, SY (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",syyang@tongji.edu.cn,,"Li, Chao/0000-0001-8571-6531",,,,,99,34,34,0,6,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBLISHING HOUSE,BATH,"UNIT 7, BRASSMILL ENTERPRISE CTR, BRASSMILL LANE, BATH BA1 3JN, AVON, ENGLAND",0305-8719,,978-1-86239-740-8,GEOL SOC SPEC PUBL,Geol.

With the launch of the SAR satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, COSMO-SkyMed constellation, Radarsat-2 as well as Sentinel-1a a new class of SAR satellites was introduced providing images with resolution in the meter regime. A paradigm shift is however taking place in spaceborne SAR systems. By means of the development of new digital beamforming and waveform diversity technologies in combination with large reflector antennas, future SAR systems will outperform the imaging capacity of current systems by at least one order of magnitude. This paper will provide an overview of the state of the art in spaceborne SAR technologies and applications, and will describe the innovative techniques and technologies that will shape its future development.","German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Microwaves & Radar Inst HR, D-82230 Wessling Oberpfaffenhofe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Moreira, A (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Microwaves & Radar Inst HR, D-82230 Wessling Oberpfaffenhofe, Germany.",alberto.moreira@dlr.de,"Moreira, Alberto/C-1147-2013; Abrantes, Jose Luis/G-8134-2016","Moreira, Alberto/0000-0002-3436-9653; Abrantes, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0565-7207; Seabra, Claudia/0000-0002-8496-0986",,,,,16,6,6,1,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-83-931525-2-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Physics, Applied; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Physics; Telecommunications,BD4QR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000361018800070,View Full Record in Web of Science

This can only be achieved by representing all responsible physical and chemical processes (sources, sinks, and interactions) in the forecast models. The representation of the sources has been enhanced over the last decade, while the sinks and interactions have received less attention. In particular, aerosol dynamic processes and aerosol-radiation interaction are neglected so far. Here we address this gap by further developing the ICON-ART (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic - Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) global modeling system to account for these processes. We use this extended model for the simulation of volcanic aerosol dispersion after the Raikoke eruption in June 2019. Additionally, we validate the simulation results with measurements from AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager), CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization), and OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite-Limb Profiler). Our results show that around 50 % of very fine volcanic ash mass (particles with diameter d < 30 pm) is removed due to particle growth and aging. Furthermore, the maximum volcanic cloud top height rises more than 6 km over the course of 4 d after the eruption due to aerosol-radiation interaction. This is the first direct evidence that shows how cumulative effects of aerosol dynamics and aerosol-radiation interaction lead to a more precise forecast of very fine ash lifetime in volcanic clouds.","[Muser, Lukas O.; Hoshyaripour, Gholam Ali; Bruckert, Julia; Vogel, Heike; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Horvath, Akos] Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany; [Malinina, Elizaveta; Rozanov, Alexei] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Bremen, Germany; [Wallis, Sandra; von Savigny, Christian] Greifswald Univ, Inst Phys, Greifswald, Germany; [Prata, Fred J.] AIRES Pty Ltd, Mt Eliza, Vic, Australia",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Hamburg; University of Bremen,"Muser, LO (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",lukas.muser@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Horvath, Akos/A-2453-2008","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Horvath, Akos/0000-0002-5860-2368; von Savigny, Christian/0000-0001-7926-3986; Rozanov, Alexei/0000-0003-4525-3223; Malinina, Elizaveta/0000-0002-4102-2877; Muser, Lukas/0000-0002-8453-918X",BMVI [50.0368/2017]; DFG [FOR 2820],BMVI; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research has been supported by BMVI (grant no.

Specifically, this paper assesses the state of the infrastructure of the 88 informal neighborhoods (favelas) improved by the Favela-Bairro-II (FB2) program between 2000 and 2008. The assessment found that, after a decade, the condition of the infrastructure in the upgraded favelas was no better than the infrastructure in the non-upgraded favelas. Climate change and lack of social cohesion undermined the sustainability of the upgrading. The improvements which deteriorated the most were street pavement, street lighting, drainage, and sewerage systems. Greatest deterioration occurred in larger favelas, those located on steep slopes and those with higher levels of violence and crime.

In this paper, we propose a simple deep architecture DeepEddy to detect oceanic eddies automatically and be free of expert knowledge. DeepEddy can learn high-level and invariant features of oceanic eddies hierarchically. It is designed with two principal component analysis (PCA) convolutional layers for eddies feature learning, a binary hashing layer for non-linear transformation, a feature pooling layer using block-wise histograms and spatial pyramid pooling to resolve the complicated structures and poses of oceanic eddies, and a classifier for the final eddies identification.

The novel's satirical and antiheroic portrayal of Michael Beard, the repulsive Nobel-prize-winning scientist who wants to save the world from global environmental disaster but who embodies all the planet-spoiling habits that people develop, serves the author's true intent of debunking current scientific myths and cliches and of voicing his concern with the metanarratives that they generate, with the dangers of conflating fact with fiction and building a whole scientific project on deceit. It is precisely the novelist's questioning of the authority of the global warming debate, and of all scientific discourses and globalising systems for that matter, that thwarts a traditional ecocritical reading of Solar. By challenging two of the major ethical assumptions of ecocriticism (the existence and importance of an environmental crisis and the capacity of art to appease it) rather than affirming them, the novel invites a broadening of the scope of the ecocritical approach and a reconsideration of its premises.","Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Cojocaru, M (corresponding author), Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,346,352,,,,,,7,Literary Theory & Criticism; Literature,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Literature,BC6CH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000353779200040,View Full Record in Web of Science

Calculations are carried out with an implementation of a beam-model (FLEX5) for two types of state-of-the-art wind turbines The authors considered the edgewise and flapwise blade-root bending moments as well as tilt moment at tower top due to the standard wind field models and our new non-Gaussian wind field model. Clear differences in the loads were found.","[Schaffarczyk, A. P.] CEwind, Grenzstr 3, D-24149 Kiel, Germany; [Schaffarczyk, A.

This Art recognizes that any pupil who requires extra support to succeed in a regular classroom is a child who has special education needs. Presently, all pupils who, for whatever reason, do nor cope successfully at school are collectively referred to as children with learning difficulties. The term ''learning difficulties'' reflects a broader spectrum of problems than those characteristically found in the category of learning disabilities used in the United States. In cases of dyslexia, the term ''specific learning difficulties'' (a subgroup of learning difficulties) is also used. All special education provision is based on individual needs. A child's needs are interpreted in relation to a continuum of special education needs and in the contact of his or her unique environment. For pupils with learning difficulties, the needs-assessment process is typically informal and rarely results in an official record of need being opened for them. A description of Grampian Region, one of the larger administrative units in northern Scotland, reveals how special educational practice is organized to respond to pupils with learning difficulties in the current educational climate.","UNIV ABERDEEN,DEPT EDUC,ABERDEEN,SCOTLAND; HAZLEHEAD ACAD,ABERDEEN,SCOTLAND; UNIV TEXAS PERMIAN BASIN,SCH EDUC,ODESSA,TX 79762",University of Aberdeen,,,,,,,,,9,0,0,2,7,PRO-ED INC,AUSTIN,"8700 SHOAL CREEK BLVD, AUSTIN, TX 78757-6897",0022-2194,,,J LEARN DISABIL,J.

The combined dataset provides an extensive record of momentum flux over a wide range of surface conditions spanning the late summer melt and early autumn freeze-up periods, and a wide range of atmospheric stabilities. Surface exchange coefficients are estimated from in situ eddy covariance measurements. The local sea-ice fraction is determined via automated processing of imagery from ship-mounted cameras. The surface drag coefficient, C-D10n, peaks at local ice fractions of 0.6-0.8, consistent with both recent aircraft-based observations and theory.

The development of earth-abundant, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a vital role in the commercialization of water electrolysis. The self-supported electrode is regarded as an effective approach to developing highly active electrocatalysts with exceptional stability, compared to the conventional coated powdery-type electrocatalysts. However, lack of systematic reviews for the development of self-supported electrodes limits its innovation. The one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures are substantially investigated for boosting catalytic activity due to their large surface areas, effective mass transport, and fast electron transfer. Herein, we review the state of-the-art development of self-supported transition-metal-based electrodes with 1D/2D nanostructures for HER, OER, as well as both HER and OER, classify them as general 1D/2D nanoarrays, hierarchical 1D/2D nanostructures, and hollow 1D/2D nanostructures.

In this constantly evolving technological climate, less told is the story of the evolution of diagnostic technology that improved the clinical management of patients with oesophageal disorders. The successful outcome of the laparoscopic treatment of oesophageal disorders is due to a combination of three different factors: the skills and the ability of the foregut surgeon, the high volume of referral, the expertise in the critical evaluation of the oesophageal function tests. This is an art per se, and it is rarely acknowledged in the achievement of the excellent results of surgery. Oesophageal function testing provides the clinician with information that cannot be obtained by the clinical, endoscopic, and radiological evaluation of patients. This expertise, intimately coupled with the other factors, allows the surgeon to better understand the pathophysiology of these diseases and to provide the optimal management. Therefore, it is essential to understand the evolution that this technology is currently undergoing, and how these changes are expanding the current indications for antireflux surgery by identifying additional predictors of successful outcome.

The study is meant to set a theoretical foundation for using microwave limb measurements for cloud monitoring. Information about clouds is required for the validation of climate models. Limb spectra are generated for the frequency bands of the Millimeter wave Acquisitions for Stratosphere/Troposphere Exchange Research (MASTER) instrument. For these simulations, the radiative transfer equation is solved using the Discrete Ordinate ITerative (DOIT) method, which is briefly described. Single scattering properties for the cloud particles are calculated using the T-matrix method. The impact of various cloud parameters is investigated. Simulated brightness temperatures most strongly depend on particle size, ice mass content and cloud altitude. The impact of particle shape is much smaller, but still significant. Increasing the ice mass content has a similar effect as increasing the particle size; this complicates the prediction of the impact of clouds on microwave radiances without exact knowledge of these cloud parameters.

Instead of using superimposed layers of singular purpose mechanisms for sensing, actuation, control and power in the form of high-tech electronic equipment as is emblematic for current approaches to climate responsiveness in architecture, the presented research follows an integrative, no-tech strategy that can be considered to follow biological rather than mechanical principles. In nature plants employ different systems to respond to environmental changes. One particularly promising way is hygroscopic actuation, as it allows for metabolically independent movement and thus provides an interesting model for autonomous, passive and materially embedded responsiveness. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the parameters, variables and syntactic elements that enable the development of such meteorosensitive architectural systems based on the biomimetic transfer of the hygroscopic actuation of plant cones. It provides a summary of five years of research by the authors on architectural systems which utilize the hygroscopic qualities of wooden veneer as a naturally produced constituent within weather responsive composite systems, which is presented through an extensive analysis of research samples, prototypes at various scales, and two comprehensive case studies of full scale constructions.

Consequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from satellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by (1) the > 10 m spatial resolution of public satellite imagery, (2) classification schemes that operate at the pixel level, and (3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the state-of-the-art by (1) using commercial satellite imagery with panchromatic and multispectral resolutions of similar to 30 cm and similar to 1.2 m, respectively, (2) developing multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral properties, and (3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery. This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird-2, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and 1-2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.","[Moortgat, Joachim; Durand, Michael; Howat, Ian] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Moortgat, Joachim] Ohio State Univ, Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Moortgat, Joachim; Durand, Michael; Howat, Ian; Yadav, Bidhyananda] Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Ziwei] Ohio State Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Dai, Chunli] Louisiana State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Moortgat, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Moortgat, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Moortgat, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",moortgat.1@osu.edu,"Durand, Michael/D-2885-2013; Moortgat, Joachim/J-7450-2013","Durand, Michael/0000-0003-2682-6196; Moortgat, Joachim/0000-0002-0259-3597","NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program, USA [80NSSC18K1497]; Polar Geospatial Center, USA under NSF-OPP awards [1043681, 1559691, 1542736]","NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program, USA; Polar Geospatial Center, USA under NSF-OPP awards","The authors acknowledge funding from NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program, USA grant 80NSSC18K1497.

CCLM was nested in ERA-Interim data and used in forecast mode (suite of consecutive 30 h long simulations with 6 h spin-up). We prescribed the sea ice concentration from satellite data and used a thermodynamic sea ice model. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of temperature and wind using data from Antarctic stations, automatic weather stations (AWSs), an operational forecast model and reanalyses data, and lidar wind profiles. For the reference run we found a warm bias for the near-surface temperature over the Antarctic Plateau. This bias was removed in the second run by adjusting the turbulence parametrization, which results in a more realistic representation of the surface inversion over the plateau but resulted in a negative bias for some coastal regions. A comparison with measurements over the sea ice of the Weddell Sea by three AWS buoys for 1 year showed small biases for temperature around +/- 1K and for wind speed of 1ms(-1). Comparisons of radio soundings showed a model bias around 0 and a RMSE of 1-2K for temperature and 3-4 ms(-1) for wind speed. The comparison of CCLM simulations at resolutions down to 1 km with wind data from Doppler lidar measurements during December 2015 and January 2016 yielded almost no bias in wind speed and a RMSE of ca. 2ms(-1). Overall CCLM shows a good representation of temperature and wind for the Weddell Sea region. Based on these encouraging results, CCLM at high resolution will be used for the investigation of the regional climate in the Antarctic and atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions processes in a forthcoming study.","[Zentek, Rolf; Heinemann, Guenther] Univ Trier, Dept Environm Meteorol, Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Zentek, R (corresponding author), Univ Trier, Dept Environm Meteorol, Trier, Germany.",zentek@uni-trier.de,,"Zentek, Rolf/0000-0003-3249-8635","DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [SPP 1158, HE 2740/19]; Open Access Fund of Universitat Trier; German Research Foundation (DFG)",DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Fund of Universitat Trier; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The research was funded by the SPP 1158 Antarctic research of the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) under grant HE 2740/19.

They are promoted by many institutions and companies as a way of addressing climate change challenges by decreasing carbon footprints and providing alternatives for the fossil fuel-based economy. The use of biobased packaging products has started to become widespread, and they are increasingly commercially available. Despite the acknowledged benefits of such products, there are several challenges associated with the use of them. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of biobased packaging products and presents a conceptual framework of the sustainability challenges experienced over their life cycles. The framework categorizes the identified challenges by their environmental, social, and economic impact, as well in terms of the different life cycle stages, from beginning of life to middle of life to end of life. In addition to increasing the understanding of the challenges associated with biobased packaging materials and their use, the proposed framework benefits the analysis of these challenges in different organizations, the identification of potential greenwashing, and the development of mitigation strategies to overcome the challenges. Furthermore, this study reveals gaps in the literature to be considered in future research into biobased packaging products.","[Turkcu, Deniz; Tura, Nina; Ojanen, Ville] LUT Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland",,"Turkcu, D (corresponding author), LUT Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland.",deniz.turkcu@lut.fi,,", Deniz/0000-0002-7391-1062",NordForsk as a part of the research project Citizens as Pilots of Smart Cities,NordForsk as a part of the research project Citizens as Pilots of Smart Cities,This research was funded by NordForsk as a part of the research project Citizens as Pilots of Smart Cities.,,67,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,17,,,,,,10465,10.3390/su141710465,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710465,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4K0DF,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000851631100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, understanding and mitigating the risks of natural hazards have become an essential task for critical infrastructure systems (CISs). Particularly, nuclear power plants (NPPs) exposed to multihazards, which are combinations of more than two natural hazards, can lead to severe outcomes. For example, the Fukushima NPP was damaged because of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami (2011) and is still at its recovery stage. Therefore, considering the significant consequences of these multihazards, it is essential to understand the phenomena and their effects on structure systems in a quantitative and probabilistic manner. However, compared with single hazard phenomena, concurrent and successive multihazards have not been relatively extensively studied because of their inherent complexity and limited availability of data. In this paper, we review multihazards in terms of the types of disaster combinations based on analysis level such as hazard, fragility, and risk assessment. Furthermore, state-of-the-art models have been reviewed and the progress, potential, and challenges in the application of multihazard risk research to NPPs are discussed.","[Choi, Eujeong; Ha, Jeong-Gon; Hahm, Deagi; Kim, Min Kyu] Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Struct Safety & Prognosis Res Div, Daejeon, South Korea",Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI),"Choi, E (corresponding author), Korea Atom Energy Res Inst, Struct Safety & Prognosis Res Div, Daejeon, South Korea.",ejchoi@kaeri.re.kr,,"Choi, Eujeong/0000-0001-5191-5129",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government [NRF-2017M2A8A4015290],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean government (NRF-2017M2A8A4015290).,,114,7,7,9,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The soil microbiome has a main role as a driver of these LSF. Current global developments, like anthropogenic threats to soil (e.g., via intensive agriculture) and climate change, pose a burden on soil functioning. Therefore, it is important to dispose of robust indicators that report on the nature of deleterious changes and thus soil quality. There has been a long debate on the best selection of biological indicators (bioindicators) that report on soil quality. Such indicators should ideally describe organisms with key functions in the system, or with key regulatory/connecting roles (so-called keystone species). However, in the light of the huge functional redundancy in most soil microbiomes, finding specific keystone markers is not a trivial task. The current rapid development of molecular (DNA-based) methods that facilitate deciphering microbiomes with respect to key functions will enable the development of improved criteria by which molecular information can be tuned to yield molecular markers of soil LSF. This review critically examines the current state-of-the-art in molecular marker development and recommends avenues to come to improved future marker systems.","[Schloter, Michael] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Res Unit Comparat Microbiome Anal, D-85758 Oberschleissheim, Germany; [Schloter, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Soil Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Nannipieri, Paolo] Univ Firenze, Dept Agrifood & Environm Sci, Florence, Italy; [Nannipieri, Paolo] Univ Firenze, Florence, Italy; [Sorensen, Soren J.] Univ Copenhagen, Microbiol Sect, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [van Elsas, Jan Dirk] Univ Groningen, Microbial Ecol Grp, GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Technical University of Munich; University of Florence; University of Florence; University of Copenhagen; University of Groningen,"van Elsas, JD (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Microbial Ecol Grp, GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",J.D.van.Elsas@rug.nl,"ÂÆâ, Â¶Æ/AAN-5439-2020; Schloter, 1Michael/H-9151-2013; S√∏rensen, S√∏ren Johannes/N-2120-2019; S√∏rensen, S√∏ren J/J-5015-2014","S√∏rensen, S√∏ren Johannes/0000-0001-6227-9906; S√∏rensen, S√∏ren J/0000-0001-6227-9906",Phyto2Energy European Union's Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways program [610797]; TRAINBIODIVERSE project (EU FP7) [289949],Phyto2Energy European Union's Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways program; TRAINBIODIVERSE project (EU FP7),Michael Schloter acknowledges funding through the Phyto2Energy European Union's Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways program (project: Phyto2Energy; grant agreement 610797).

Because greater than 50% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions come from small, distributed sectors such as homes, offices, and transportation sources, most renewable energy systems and on-site carbon capture technologies for reducing future CO2 emissions cannot be effectively utilized. This problem might be mediated by considering novel materials and technologies for directly capturing/removing CO2 from air. However, compared to materials for capturing CO2 at on-site emission sources, materials for capturing CO2 directly from air must be more selective to CO2, and should operate and be stable at near ambient conditions. In this review article, we briefly summarize the recent developments in materials for capturing carbon dioxide directly from air. We discuss the challenges in this field and offer a perspective for developing the current state-of-art and also highlight the potential of a few recent discoveries in materials science that show potential for advanced application of air capture technology.

Performing spatial queries over such data has applications in many domains, such as climate impact studies, water and wildlife management, and urban planning. Processing those queries is greatly facilitated by the existence of spatial indices. However, I/O transfer is still a major bottleneck in the overall system performance. One of the solutions to this issue is to compress data before sending it over the I/O channel. Therefore, a lossless compression technique that also supports spatial indexing to improve query response time is highly desirable. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose two parallel GPGPU algorithms, called Multi-Block per Tile (MBPT) and One-Block per Tile (OBPT), to compress and index large-scale geospatial raster data using BQ-Trees. Experiments comparing our best performing proposed algorithm, OBPT, against HFPaC, a state-of-the-art geospatial parallel GPGPU compression algorithm, using three real datasets of satellite images, show that our algorithm achieves a compression time speedup of up to 2X, and a 2.5X increment in compression ratio. OBPT also yields a comparable average spatial query response time to HFPaC.","[Kaligirwa, Nathalie; Leal, Eleazar; Gruenwald, Le] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Comp Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhang, Jianting; You, Simin] CUNY, Sch Comp Sci, New York, NY 10021 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Kaligirwa, N (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Comp Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",Nathalie-kaligirwa-1@ou.edu; eleal@ou.edu; ggruenwald@ou.edu; jzhang@cs.ccny; syou@gc.cuny.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1302439, 1302423]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1302439 and 1302423.,,21,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2379-7703,,978-1-5386-1996-4,IEEE INT CONGR BIG,,,2017,,,,,137,144,,10.1109/BigDataCongress.2017.27,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigDataCongress.2017.27,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BJ8EY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000428141800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The decrease of dissolved oxygen levels in the world's oceans, which is becoming increasingly obvious, is expected to have an impact on the whole ecosystem of the Earth, including the carbon cycle, the climate, etc. Dissolved oxygen measurements by sensors are often deemed easy measurements by routine laboratories. In reality, the physical and chemical processes underlying the measurements are complex and these measurements are not at all as robust as often considered. Recently an international in situ interlaboratory comparison measurement of dissolved oxygen concentration took place at the University of Tartu. The results revealed that the routine laboratories as a rule still do not fully master the art of dissolved oxygen concentration measurement: Out of altogether 63 measurement results obtained by the participants 52% were unacceptable according to the En numbers. Based on the analysis of the results of the intercomparison a set of tools and recommendations are given to the participants of how to improve the quality of their results.","[Naykki, Teemu] Finnish Environm Inst, Environm Measurement & Testing Lab, Helsinki 00430, Finland; [Jalukse, Lauri; Helm, Irja; Leito, Ivo] Univ Tartu, Inst Chem, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia",Finnish Environment Institute; University of Tartu,"Naykki, T (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, Environm Measurement & Testing Lab, Hakuninmaantie 6, Helsinki 00430, Finland.",teemu.naykki@ymparisto.fi; lauri.jalukse@ut.ee; irja.helm@ut.ee; ivo.leito@ut.ee,"Leito, Ivo/U-9463-2019; Leito, Ivo/K-8867-2012","Leito, Ivo/0000-0002-3000-4964; Helm, Irja/0000-0002-5964-2361; Naykki, Teemu/0000-0001-8099-2190",European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) [ENV05]; European Union; Estonian Science Foundation [9105]; Tartu University; Tallinn Technical University,European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP); European Union(European Commission); Estonian Science Foundation; Tartu University; Tallinn Technical University,"This work was supported by the European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP), project ENV05 Metrology for ocean salinity and acidity.

Both concepts do not have universal definitions, and literature focuses on building the different fragments of each one to design new ways to understand, analyze and develop policies. Energy poverty is complex and has a multitude of drivers, such as income, energy prices, and buildings/energy efficiency are examples of how different policies are required to erase this problem. Understanding how those policies work together and should be evaluated challenges new perspectives between different fields. Framed in this subject matter, and after an overview of its state of the art, a flexible and systemic framework for policy mix analysis is proposed considering five steps: definition of objectives, instrument selection, single instrument analysis, instruments interaction analysis, and evaluation. The major contribution of the proposed framework is a clear yet adaptable criterion for instruments interaction analysis. Energy poverty literature is reviewed in the optic of how policy mix can help develop and analyze policies for its erasing, and specific criteria for its instruments analysis are suggested.","[Bessa, Salome; Gouveia, Joao Pedro] NOVA Univ Lisbon, Sustainabil Inst, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res & CHANGE Global Cha, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Bessa, S (corresponding author), NOVA Univ Lisbon, Sustainabil Inst, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res & CHANGE Global Cha, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal.",ss.bessa@campus.fct.unl.pt,"Gouveia, Joao Pedro/I-4288-2014","Gouveia, Joao Pedro/0000-0002-7360-1363",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UIDB/04085/2020],Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),The authors acknowledge and are thankful for the support provided to CENSE by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through the strategic project UIDB/04085/2020.,,53,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2160-6544,2160-6552,,J ENVIRON ECON POLIC,J.

Recently the importance of microbial fuel cell (MFC) on this issue has seen profound investigation due to its inherent ability of simultaneous wastewater treatment, and power production. However, the challenges of economy-related manufacturing and operation costs should be lowered to achieve positive field-scale demonstration. Also, a variety of different field de-ployments will lead to improvisation. Hence, this review article discusses the possibility of integration of MFC technology with various technologies of recent times leading to advanced sustainable MFC technology. Tech-nological innovation in the field of nanotechnology, genetic engineering, additive manufacturing, artificial in-telligence, adaptive control, and few other hybrid systems integrated with MFCs is discussed. This comprehensive and state-of-the-art study elaborates hybrid MFCs integrated with various technology and its working principles, modified electrode material, complex and easy to manufacture reactor designs, and the effects of various operating parameters on system performances. Although integrated systems are promising, much future research work is needed to overcome the challenges and commercialize hybrid MFC technology.","[Dwivedi, Kavya Arun; Huang, Song-Jeng] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 43,Sect 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Chin-Tsan] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Ilan, Taiwan; [Wang, Chin-Tsan] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Chem Engn, Gauhati, Assam, India",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Ilan University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati,"Wang, CT (corresponding author), Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Ilan, Taiwan.",ctwang@niu.edu.tw,"Huang, Song-Jeng/ABH-8364-2020","Huang, Song-Jeng/0000-0002-6582-0339",,,,,179,7,7,13,50,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0045-6535,1879-1298,,CHEMOSPHERE,Chemosphere,JAN,2022,,3,,,,,132248,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132248,,21-Sep,16,Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD4YP,34543899,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000704948400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the severity and history of these problems, the situation is unlikely to change in the near future. Yet, schools are supposed to be enabling environments, providing holistic support to learners from communities plagued by severe economic, health and social challenges. A different strategy is clearly needed to promote the health and wellbeing of learners. Youth participatory action research (YPAR) appears to offer a plausible approach to kick start improved, health-promoting responses from within the school. We facilitated a YPAR process with volunteer learners from Grade10 to find out how they could begin to transform their rural school. Using arts-based methods, the learners were successful in raising awareness of the negative effects they were suffering as a result of the poor social-emotional climate in the school, the unsanitary facilities and the lack of opportunities to engage in physical exercise. The actions they took to address these issues were a catalyst for ongoing positive change in the school. The findings add to literature about how YPAR can make schools more enabling spaces.","[Mathikithela, Maite; Wood, Lesley] North West Univ, Fac Educ, Community Based Educ Res, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Wood, L (corresponding author), COMBER, Fac Educ, 11 Hoffman St, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",lesley.wood@nwu.ac.za,"Wood, Lesley/F-8507-2017","Wood, Lesley/0000-0002-9139-1507",National Research Foundation [116261],National Research Foundation,"This research was funded in part by the National Research Foundation (Grant No. 116261) .

This is done by energy efficiency improvement and renewable energy sources exploitation at large scales in the form of centralized systems as well as small-scale systems in the form of microgrids and nanogrids. However, smart grid technology brings new challenges to the big data management of the new power system construction. Additionally, due to the large-scale intermittent distributed renewable resources contribution and stochastic electric vehicles integration, the current energy management systems must undergo some improvements to handle the smart grid requirements. Cloud computing, as an intermittent based on-demand computing model, serves an emerging solution to the aforementioned challenges. As a result, this paper presents a survey study on the smart grid and state of art energy management methods and the necessitation of the cloud computing incorporation in smart grid energy management. Then, the application of the cloud computing in energy management, demand side management programs, building energy management systems, energy hubs, and power dispatching systems have been discussed and associated models are addressed.","[Allahvirdizadeh, Yousef; Shayanfar, Heidarali] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Automat & Operat, Sch Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Moghaddam, Mohsen Parsa] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology; Tarbiat Modares University,"Shayanfar, H (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Automat & Operat, Sch Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran.",hashayanfar@iust.ac.ir,"Shayanfar, Heidar Ali/S-8857-2018","shayanfar, heidarali/0000-0003-0895-934X",,,,,114,13,13,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2050-7038,,,INT T ELECTR ENERGY,Int.

This study provides an overview of the scientific literature on seahorses in the 21st century and critically discusses five major knowledge gaps and research opportunities to advance the state of the art on this research field. The average number of publications per year increased from 10 (2001-2002) to similar to 40 (2001-2015), the majority addressing issues on seahorse ecology, biology, and aquaculture, with the most studied species being Hippocampus kuda, H. guttulatus, H. reidi, H. abdominalis, H. erectus, H. hippocampus, and H. trimaculatus. This study explores the opportunity of using seahorses as flagship species to foster mangrove conservation and decrease trawling fisheries. It also suggests that further scientific studies are needed to better understand and manage the populations of the most heavily traded seahorse species, as well as the need to monitor their vulnerability to emerging pollutants and climate change. Sustainable seahorse aquaculture can play an important role in seahorse conservation, as well as in the development of reliable traceability tools to fight the illegal trade of these highly priced organisms.","[Cohen, Felipe P.

Eliminating one step in the coating process could potentially save time and cost associated with lane closures and traffic control costs. This research paper evaluates several two-coat systems based on the zinc-rich primer and polysiloxane topcoat technology. All samples were conditioned and coated in a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled paint booth, simulating common field ENvironmental CONditions (ENCON) (ENCON 1: 25 degrees C/50% RH, ENCON 2: 10 degrees C/40%RH, and ENCON 3: 32 degrees C/80% RH). Accelerated weathering tests were performed on 435 coated samples (scribed and unscribed). Regardless of the ENCON considered, the performance of the two-coat system is very comparable to the three-coat system. This coating technology offers much improved performance with quicker set time and better adhesion pull-off strength. Considering its durability and ease of application, this two-coat system can be attractive to other public and private agencies to enhance and extend the service life of steel structures.","[Toubia, Elias A.] Univ Dayton, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Engn Mech, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Emami, Sadra] Univ Dayton, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Dayton, OH 45469 USA",University of Dayton; University of Dayton,"Toubia, EA (corresponding author), Univ Dayton, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Engn Mech, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",etoubia1@udayton.edu,,,Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT),Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT),"The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for funding this effort.

Whereas policy makers demand quantifications of uncertainty from these state-of-the-art models, the increasingly complex and inter-dependent scientific domains and spheres of human activity captured by the models means that scientists can rarely provide better than qualitative representations of uncertainty. Using the context of the UK Integrated Assessment Model we present a conceptual framework within which uncertainties in different components of integrated assessment models can be classified. We show how an hierarchy of uncertainties can be identified which will assist policy makers in understanding where an uncertainty arises and to what extent it may impact upon policy development. Policy makers must still make the decisions. This generic conceptual framework will help scientists and modellers to provide policy makers with an understanding of uncertainties involved whilst highlighting that models are only heuristic tools designed to help make the decision and understand the potential impacts of that decision in an inherently uncertain world.","[Oxley, T.; ApSimon, H.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AX, England",Imperial College London,"Oxley, T (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AX, England.",t.oxley@imperial.ac.uk,,"Oxley, Tim/0000-0003-3749-7500",,,,,37,3,3,0,3,MODELLING & SIMULATION SOC AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND INC,CHRISTCHURCH,"MSSANZ, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",,,978-0-9872143-1-7,,,,2011,,,,,1803,1809,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BDU79,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000314989301116,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social-emotional variables like empathy and perspective-taking were considered measurable outcomes, Analysis of pre-to-post change scores revealed that mediators demonstrated significantly higher gains on measures of social-cognitive development F (3,67) = 19.26, p. <.000 when compared to non-mediators. Although mediators and non-mediators (N = 70) scored no differently at pretest, the difference was highly significant at posttest.

Most of these systems are based on powerful tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI methods for high-flow extremes prediction. The review starts with an overview of the state-of-the-art AI techniques and examples of their application, followed by a SWOT analysis to benchmark their predictive capability based on set of criteria. Finally, the most suitable AI methods for short-term and/or long-term prediction, based on a rigorous suitability assessment are proposed. As a result, Fourteen AI methods have been identified. Their evaluation revealed that the methods that averagely behave the best for achieving high-flow extremes prediction are ANNs, SVMs, wavelets and Bayesian methods, at all-time scales. The latter, as stochastic methods, have the privilege by their cheap computation cost, their reliability and ability to handle hydrological uncertainty, and their capacity to perform causal relationships between features. This study also urges researchers to further explore the predictive potential of decision trees, ensembles, CNNs, MARS, GP and agent-based methods for high-flow extremes.","[Hamitouche, Mohamed; Molina, Jose-Luis] Salamanca Univ, High Polytech Sch Engn Avila, IGA Res Grp, Av Hornos Caleros 50, Avila 05003, Spain",,"Molina, JL (corresponding author), Salamanca Univ, High Polytech Sch Engn Avila, IGA Res Grp, Av Hornos Caleros 50, Avila 05003, Spain.",i_hamitouche@usal.es; jlmolina@usal.es,,"HAMITOUCHE, Mohamed/0000-0002-5723-3492; MOLINA, JOSE-LUIS/0000-0002-1001-3601",International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM),International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM),The financial support received to M.H. from the International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM) comprised a scholarship for developing a Master Thesis.,,53,0,0,16,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

From this viewpoint, the authors discuss various approaches deployed to evaluate wildfire danger, from in-situ observations to satellite-based fire prediction systems. Lately, the merit of soil moisture in predicting fuel moisture content and the likelihood of wildfire occurrence has been widely realized. Harmonized soil moisture measurement initiatives via state-of-the-art soil moisture networks have facilitated the use of soil moisture information in developing innovative applications for wildfire prediction and risk management applications. Additionally, the increasing availability of remote-sensing data has enabled the monitoring and modeling of wildfires across various terrestrial ecosystems. When coupled with remotely sensed data, field-based soil moisture measurements have been more valuable predictors of assessing wildfire than alone. However, sensors capable of acquiring higher spectral information and radiometry across large spatiotemporal domains are still lacking. The automation aspect of such extensive data from remote-sensing and field data is needed to rapidly assess wildfire and mitigation of wildfire-related damage at operational scales.","[Sharma, Sonisa; Dhakal, Kundan] Noble Res Inst LLC, 2510 Sam Noble Pkwy, Ardmore, OK 73401 USA",Noble Research Institute,"Sharma, S (corresponding author), Noble Res Inst LLC, 2510 Sam Noble Pkwy, Ardmore, OK 73401 USA.",sonisa@okstate.edu; kdhakal@noble.org,"Sharma, Sonisa/AAE-3859-2019; Dhakal, Kundan/AAD-4563-2019","Sharma, Sonisa/0000-0001-5091-4482; Dhakal, Kundan/0000-0001-5827-378X",,,,,78,0,0,4,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2571-6255,,,FIRE-BASEL,Fire-Switzerland,SEP,2021,3,,,,,,45,10.3390/fire4030045,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire4030045,,,12,Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,UZ6WR,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000702344300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To fill this gap, this work analyzes its spatiotemporal distribution, and its sensitivity to the ensemble size in temperature and precipitation forecasts. Our results indicate that model continues to drift well beyond the first month after initialization, leading to significant, highly space- and time-varying drifts over vast regions of the world. Nevertheless, small ensembles (less than 10 members) are enough to robustly estimate the mean model drift and its year-to-year fluctuations in skillful regions. Differently, in regions of low model skill, larger ensembles are required to appropriately characterize this interannual variability, which is often larger than the drift itself. This points out a necessity to develop new strategies that allow for efficiently dealing with model drift, especially when bias correcting seasonal forecasts-most of the techniques used to this aim rely on the assumption of stationary model errors. We demonstrate here that the use of moving windows can help to remove not only the mean forecast bias but also the unwanted effects coming out from the drift, which can lead to important intraseasonal biases if it is not properly taken into account. The results from this work can help to identify the nature and causes of some of the systematic errors in current coupled models and can have large implications for a wide community of users who need long, continuous unbiased seasonal forecasts to run their impact models.

Aerial images are classified using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect land state variation in real-time. CNNs have been widely used for computer vision applications, such as image classification, image segmentation, and quality enhancement. The proposed CNN model was trained and evaluated on the Arial Image Dataset (AID). Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model has better performance while being suitable for embedded implementation. It has achieved high efficiency with 96.47% accuracy.

Thus, this review aimed to bring the state-of-the-art literature review on the boiling heat transfer characteristics of environmentalfriendly refrigerants with ODP close to 0 and GWP below 2000. In addition to describing the effects of heat flux, mass flow, saturation temperature, and mass transfer resistance on the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop, this review also analyzed the heat transfer mechanism. Moreover, a detailed review of the correlation of boiling heat transfer and pressure drop was provided which might benefit practical applications. Furthermore, prospects and challenges to be addressed were also identified for future research.

This demand must be properly managed in the face of several challenges, including environmental changes and abrupt climate shifts. Plant breeding and breeding innovation is the cornerstone for sustainable supply of biomass. Not only does research and development in this sector aim at providing high yielding crops in order to maximize production, but R&D in this field will also allow to obtain highly specialized plant varieties with new or improved traits that fit to specific applications. At the same time, there is little awareness among the general public of the fact that state-of-the-art R&D is a prerequisite for the production of sufficient biomass of the right quality in a sustainable manner.

In contrast to previous methods, our framework is able to learn a representation of the data in which eddies can be detected and tracked in more objective and robust way.

We show that these methods provide specific, detailed data on particle composition, chemistry, morphology, phase and internal structure. This information is crucial for evaluating hygroscopic properties of aerosols, understanding aerosol aging and reactivity, and correlating the characteristics of aerosols with their optical properties. The manuscript presents a number of analytical advances in methods of electron probe particle analysis along with a brief review of a number of the research projects carried out in the authors' laboratory on the chemical characterization of environmental particles.

The characteristics of retinal abnormalities, which occur as various shapes, sizes, and distribution at different regions, are a challenge in accomplishing these tasks. In addition, the small amount of image-level labelled images in public databases and the unavailability of lesion-level annotations for most of these publicly available images also pose as challenges. These shortcomings motivate our exploration of various CNN architectures to extract multi-scale contextual information, such that we investigate the impact of different arrangements of multi-sized convolutional kernels appended to a modified pre-trained encoder. Additionally, to prevent the loss of detailed information for small lesions, we exploit the advantages of feature map concatenation from the output of these multiscale convolutions to its corresponding decoder layer. A new two-phase training strategy is also implemented to tackle the problem of dataset imbalance between image-level label and lesion-level label classes. The direct comparison between our proposed methods and currently published state-of-the-art methods with the same databases confirms that our best model outperforms is existing published methods.","[Gian, Michelle K.

In this paper, we report on how a recently introduced Parametrized Cognitive Adaptive Optimization - abbreviated as PCAO - can be used toward the design of both model-based and model-free plug-and-play BOC systems, with minimum human effort required to accomplish the design. In the model-based case, PCAO assesses the performance of its control strategy via a simulation model of the building dynamics; in the model-free case, PCAO optimizes its control strategy without relying on any model of the building dynamics. Extensive simulation and real-life experiments performed on a 10-office building demonstrate the effectiveness of the PCAO-BOC system in providing significant energy efficiency and improved thermal comfort. The mechanisms embedded within PCAO render it capable of automatically and quickly learning an efficient HOC strategy either in the presence of complex nonlinear simulation models of the building dynamics (model-based) or when no model for the building dynamics is available (model-free). Comparative studies with alternative state-of-the-art BOC systems show the effectiveness of the PCAO-BOC solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Correct parameterization of these fluxes in climate models is critical. Despite their importance, state-of-the-art observation techniques cannot provide representative areal averages of these fluxes comparable to the model grid. Alternative methods of estimation are thus required. These alternative approaches use (satellite) observables of the land surface conditions. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithm was evaluated in a cold and arid environment, using land surface parameters derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. Field observations and estimates from SEBS were compared in terms of net radiation flux (R-n), soil heat flux (G(0)), sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (lambda E) over a heterogeneous land surface. As a case study, this methodology was applied to the experimental area of the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER) project, located on the mid-to-upstream sections of the Heihe River in northwest China. ASTER data acquired between 3 May and 4 June 2008, under clear-sky conditions were used to determine the surface fluxes. Ground-based measurements of land surface heat fluxes were compared with values derived from the ASTER data. The results show that the derived surface variables and the land surface heat fluxes furnished by SEBS in different months over the study area are in good agreement with the observed land surface status under the limited cases (some cases looks poor results). So SEBS can be used to estimate turbulent heat fluxes with acceptable accuracy in areas where there is partial vegetation cover in exceptive conditions. It is very important to perform calculations using ground-based observational data for parameterization in SEBS in the future. Nevertheless, the remote-sensing results can provide improved explanations of land surface fluxes over varying land coverage at greater spatial scales.","[Ma, W.; Ma, Y.; Hu, Z.; Wang, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Key Lab Land Surface Proc & Climate Change Cold &, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Y.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Z.] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Ishikawa, H.] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cold & Arid Regions Environmental & Engineering Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; University of Twente; Kyoto University","Ma, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Key Lab Land Surface Proc & Climate Change Cold &, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",wqma@lzb.ac.cn,"Su, Z.

Estimations are conducted for the whole economy and for two specific sectors: manufacturing and agriculture. Especially in the agricultural sector, it is important to include non-CO2 GHG emissions because these are the major emissions present. In most of the regions examined, the improvements in GHG intensities achieved in the manufacturing sector are larger than those in the agricultural sector. Compared with developing regions, most developed regions have consistently larger per-capita consumption-based GHG emissions over the whole economy, as well as higher production-based emissions. In the manufacturing sector, differences calculated by subtracting production-based emissions from consumption-based GHG emissions are determined by the regional economic level while, in the agricultural sector, they are dependent on regional production structures that are determined by international trade competitiveness. In the manufacturing sector, these differences are consistently and increasingly positive for the U.S., EU15 and Japan but negative for developing regions. In the agricultural sector, the differences calculated for the major agricultural importers like Japan and the EU15 are consistently positive while those of exporters like the U.S., Australia and New Zealand are consistently negative.

Historically, developed countries have contributed to the climate change problem much more than developing countries and are primarily responsible for high levels of GHG emissions (Kyoto Protocol, 2001). The Kyoto Protocol uses the term common but differentiated responsibilities to distinguish between developed and developing countries and their impact on climate change. In accordance with the Protocol, developed countries need to reduce GHG emissions, while developing countries only need to report their emissions. At the same time, a country's activities that generate growth are associated with an increase in carbon emissions. The challenge for developing countries is to achieve growth at any cost, without taking into account any carbon reductions. Theoretically, reducing carbon emissions in developing countries would imply slowing down growth or reducing the use of energy from fossil fuels, while increasing the use of renewables. This paper gives an overview of current theoretical and empirical findings on a low-carbon economy and growth. It deals with the idea of reducing (carbon) emissions, while increasing growth, thereby decoupling emissions from economic growth.","[Starcevic, Dubravka Pekanov] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Starcevic, DP (corresponding author), Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",dubravka.pekanov@efos.hr,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2020,,,,,1211,1221,,,,,,11,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BS5EP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000728402200088,View Full Record in Web of Science

State-of-the-art numerical spectral wave model simulations with and without surface currents taken from an eddy resolving global ocean reanalysis were compared. As a global average, simulations forced with currents display significantly better agreement with altimeter derived wave heights. The bias and root mean square error in significant wave heights are mostly reduced when including current forcing, especially in the Southern Ocean. An overall improvement in wave periods and wave direction is also seen when comparing model outputs with the Australian and United States buoy network observations. Including surface ocean current forcing in wave simulations reduces the simulated wave heights in most areas of the world, due to a decreased relative wind given by co-flowing winds and currents. Current-induced refraction generates important changes in wave direction in western boundary current and tropical regions. Furthermore, large and broad changes in friction velocity, atmosphere to-ocean energy flux, whitecap cover and Stokes drift velocities are observed in equatorial regions. Finally, the importance of the wave model resolution for representing wave-current interactions was tested by comparing results from eddy-permitting (lower resolution) and eddy-resolving (higher resolution) configurations. We conclude that the main patterns of current-induced refraction are well represented in both cases, albeit that the higher resolution simulation represents these in a more detailed manner. Finally, the implications that the observed wave-current interactions have on several ocean processes are discussed.","[Echevarria, Emilio R.; Hemer, Mark A.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Echevarria, Emilio R.; Holbrook, Neil J.] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Holbrook, Neil J.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Australian Res Council, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Echevarria, ER (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",emilio.echevarria@csiro.au,"Echevarria, Emilio/AFW-5225-2022; Holbrook, Neil J/M-7544-2013","Holbrook, Neil J/0000-0002-3523-6254",UTAS-CSIRO Quantitative Marine Science Program; Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies; CSIRO Office of the Chief Executive topup scholarship; Australian Government National Environmental Science Program Earth Systems and Climate Change (NESP ESCC) Hub; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [CE170100023]; NESP ESCC Hub,UTAS-CSIRO Quantitative Marine Science Program; Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies; CSIRO Office of the Chief Executive topup scholarship; Australian Government National Environmental Science Program Earth Systems and Climate Change (NESP ESCC) Hub; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes(Australian Research Council); NESP ESCC Hub,"The authors wish to thank Claire Trenham for her valuable comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Photovoltaic (PV) generation has attracted much attention in recent years, but it is limited by the uncertain and intermittent nature, which needs promising PV prediction models. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model based on the TabNet, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and linear regression, which is motivated by the ensemble and residual ideas. The models of XGBoost and TabNet are fitted simultaneously based on numeric weather prediction (NWP) information. We adopt the linear regression to combine the results from both TabNet and XGBoost to render the final estimates through ResNet approaches. Besides, the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is incorporated for redundant feature reduction and important feature selection. Meanwhile, the general time features difference (GTFD) is also developed in this work to augment the original feature space and to mine the implicit temporal relationships among features. The proposed model is validated in real-life PV data and the experimental results show that the GTFD-XTNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art forecasting models in the PV field.","[Wang, Qinglun; Chai, Songjian; Wang, Guibin] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Mechatron & Control Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Chai, Songjian] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Phys & Optoelect Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yun] South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power Engn, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; South China University of Technology,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power Engn, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China.",liuyun19881026@gmail.com,,,GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation Project [2022A1515011035],GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation Project,This work was supported by the GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation Project (No. 2022A1515011035).

It is a noxious invasive species that is an important weed in agriculture and a source of highly allergenic pollen. The importance placed on A. artemisiifolia is reflected by the number of international projects that have now been launched by the European Commission and the increasing number of publications being produced on this topic. This review paper examines existing knowledge about ragweed ecology, distribution and flowering phenology and the environmental health risk that this noxious plant poses in Europe. The paper also examines control measures used in the fight against it and state of the art methods for modelling atmospheric concentrations of this important aeroallergen. Common ragweed is an environmental health threat, not only in its native North America but also in many parts of the world where it has been introduced. In Europe, where the plant has now become naturalised and frequently forms part of the flora, the threat posed by ragweed has been identified and steps are being taken to reduce further geographical expansion and limit increases in population densities of the plant in order to protect the allergic population. This is particularly important when one considers possible range shifts, changes in flowering phenology and increases in the amount of pollen and allergenic potency that could be brought about by changes in climate.

Recently, many studies have been carried out based on deep learning and have achieved significant performance improvements. However, their intrinsic characteristics remain unclear and have not been explored. In this paper, we pioneered the exploitation of short lag-times in rainfall-runoff modeling and measured its influence on model performance. The proposed model, long short-term memory with attentive long and short lag-time (LSTM-ALSL), simultaneously and explicitly uses new data structures, i.e., long and short lag-times, to enhance rainfall-runoff forecasting accuracy by jointly extracting better features. In addition, self-attention is employed to model the temporal dependencies within long and short lag-times to further enhance the model performance. The results indicate that LSTM-ALSL yielded superior performance at four mesoscale stations (1846~9208 km(2)) with humid climates (aridity index 0.77~1.16) in the U.S.A., for both peak flow and base flow, with respect to state-of-the-art counterparts.","[Chen, Xi; Huang, Jiaxu; Wang, Sheng; Gao, Hongkai; Liu, Min] East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi; Huang, Jiaxu; Wang, Sheng; Gao, Hongkai; Liu, Min] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi; Huang, Jiaxu] East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Multidimens Informat Proc, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Gongjian] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Affiliated High Sch, Hangzhou 310030, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Ye] Harbin Inst Technol, Key Lab Marine Environm Monitoring & Informat Pro, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Ye; Zheng, Laiwen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingli] Huanghuai Univ, Henan Key Lab Smart Lighting, Zhumadian 463000, Peoples R China; [Qi, Honggang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","East China Normal University; Ministry of Education, China; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; Hangzhou Normal University; Harbin Institute of Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Huanghuai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Gao, HK (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Gao, HK (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",xchen@geo.ecnu.edu.cn; 51183901010@stu.ecnu.edu.cn; ws260308526519@163.com; zhougj@hit.edu.cn; hkgao@geo.ecnu.edu.cn; mliu@geo.ecnu.edu.cn; yuanye_sjtu@sjtu.edu.cn; zhenglaiwen@163.com; qlli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn; hgqi@jdl.ac.cn,"Yuan, Ye/HHN-2166-2022","Yuan, Ye/0000-0002-6967-6856; Li, Qingli/0000-0001-5063-8801",,,,,47,3,3,17,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,697,10.3390/w14050697,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14050697,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ZT7FM,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000769317600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is of great significance to accurately assess the dynamic evolution of the plankton for monitoring the marine environment and global climate change. In this paper, a novel method is introduced for deep-sea plankton community detection in marine ecosystem using an underwater robotic platform. The videos were sampled at a distance of 1.5 m from the ocean floor, with a focal length of 1.5-2.5 m. The optical flow field is used to detect plankton community. We showed that for each of the moving plankton that do not overlap in space in two consecutive video frames, the time gradient of the spatial position of the plankton are opposite to each other in two consecutive optical flow fields. Further, the lateral and vertical gradients have the same value and orientation in two consecutive optical flow fields. Accordingly, moving plankton can be accurately detected under the complex dynamic background in the deep-sea environment. Experimental comparison with manual ground-truth fully validated the efficacy of the proposed methodology, which outperforms six state-of-the-art approaches.","[Wang, Jiaxing; Yang, Mingqiang; Zheng, Qinghe; Wang, Deqiang] Shandong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 266237, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mingqiang] Shandong Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhongjun] China Natl Deep Sea Ctr, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Kpalma, Kidiyo] IETR INSA UMR CNRS 6164, F-35708 Rennes, France; [Ren, Jinchang] Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Excellence Signal & Image Proc, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",Shandong University; Shandong University; University of Strathclyde,"Yang, MQ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 266237, Peoples R China.;Yang, MQ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China.;Ding, ZJ (corresponding author), China Natl Deep Sea Ctr, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.",17854264303@163.com; yangmq@sdu.edu.cn; dzj@ndsc.org.cn; 15005414319@163.com; wdq_sdu@sdu.edu.cn; kidiyo.kpalma@insa-rennes.fr; jinchang.ren@strath.ac.uk,,"KPALMA, Kidiyo/0000-0001-8179-6415; Ren, Jinchang/0000-0001-6116-3194; Zheng, Qinghe/0000-0001-8037-7323",National Key R&D Program of China,National Key R&D Program of China,This research was funded by National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2018YFC0831503.,,29,1,1,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,OCT,2021,20,,,,,,6720,10.3390/s21206720,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21206720,,,17,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,WS4HW,34695933,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000715145000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forest ecosystems present a particular challenge because of their scale, complexity and structural dynamics. Traditional forestry techniques rely on manual measurement of easy-to-measure characteristics such as tree girth and height, along with time-consuming, logistically difficult and error-prone destructive sampling. Much more detailed and accurate three-dimensional measurements of forest structure and composition are key to reducing errors in biomass estimates and carbon dynamics and to better understanding the role of forests in global ecosystem and climate change processes. Terrestrial laser scanners are now starting to be deployed in forest ecology research and, at the same time, new terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technologies are being developed to enhance and extend the range of measurements that can be made. These new TLS measurements provide a tantalizing glimpse of a completely new way to measure and understand forest structure. It is therefore a good time to take stock, assess the state of the art and identify the immediate challenges for continued development of TLS in forest ecology.","[Danson, F.

New sources of data and the falling cost of computation have made possible new approaches to options appraisal. The state of the art has a number of limitations, however. We present a comprehensive but parsimonious framework for computational decision analysis in flood risk management that addresses these issues. At its core is a simple but flexible model of change on the decadal time scale of typical option appraisals, including the management interventions that are the subject of decision along with influences, such as climate change, that are independent of the processes of flood risk management. A fully integrated performance model is developed, estimating both costs and benefits. Uncertainty analysis can thereby be applied to performance metrics of direct interest to stakeholders. We illustrate the framework with an implementation for a hypothetical flood risk management decision. We discuss possible variants of the framework that could be extended to fields other than flood risk management.","[Harvey, Hamish; Peppe, Roger] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hall, Jim] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Oxford,"Harvey, H (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Cassie Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",hamish@hamishharvey.com,"Hall, Jim W/ABF-1407-2020","Hall, Jim W/0000-0002-2024-9191","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F020511/1]; Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs/Environment Agency (Defra/EA); United Kingdom Water Industry Research (UKWIR); Office of Public Works (OPW) Dublin; Northern Ireland Rivers Agency (DARDNI); Amazon Web Services; EPSRC [EP/F020511/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/F020511/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs/Environment Agency (Defra/EA); United Kingdom Water Industry Research (UKWIR); Office of Public Works (OPW) Dublin; Northern Ireland Rivers Agency (DARDNI); Amazon Web Services; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The research reported in this paper was conducted as part of the work of the Flood Risk Management Research Consortium (FRMRC).

Lockdown measures imposed to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial reductions in observed Asian aerosol loadings. Here, we use bottom-up estimates of anthropogenic emissions based on national mobility data from Google and Apple, along with simulations from the ECHAM6-HAMMOZ state-of-the-art aerosol-chemistry-climate model to investigate the impact of the reduced aerosol and gases pollution loadings on the ISM. We show that the decrease in anthropogenic emissions led to a 4 W m(-2) increase in surface solar radiation over parts of South Asia, which resulted in a strengthening of the ISM. Simultaneously, while natural emission parameterizations are kept the same in all our simulations, the anthropogenic emission reduction led to changes in the atmospheric circulation, causing accumulation of dust over the Tibetan plateau (TP) during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. This accumulated dust has intensified the warm core over the TP that reinforced the intensification of the Hadley circulation. The associated cross-equatorial moisture influx over the Indian landmass led to an enhanced amount of rainfall by 4% (0.2 mm d(-1)) over the Indian landmass and 5%-15% (0.8-3 mm d(-1)) over central India. These estimates may vary under the influence of large-scale coupled atmosphere-ocean oscillations (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole). Our study indicates that the reduced anthropogenic emissions caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 restrictions had a favourable effect on the hydrological cycle over South Asia, which has been facing water scarcity during the past decades. This emphasizes the need for stringent measures to limit future anthropogenic emissions in South Asia for protecting one of the world's most densely populated regions.","[Fadnavis, Suvarna; Sabin, T.

However, the agricultural sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and updating the state of virtual world.","[Nasirahmadi, Abozar; Hensel, Oliver] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Nasirahmadi, A (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",abozar.nasirahmadi@uni-kassel.de; agrartechnik@uni-kassel.de,,"Nasirahmadi, Abozar/0000-0001-9163-2799",,,,,91,11,11,55,120,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JAN,2022,2,,,,,,498,10.3390/s22020498,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22020498,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,YN6JL,35062459,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000747362800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, agricultural industries adopted those techniques in order to bring automation to farmers around the globe. One analysis procedure required for automatic visual inspection in this domain is leaf count and segmentation. Collecting labeled data from field crops and greenhouses is a complicated task due to the large variety of crops, growth seasons, climate changes, phenotype diversity, and more, especially, when specific learning tasks require a large amount of labeled data for training. Data augmentation for training deep neural networks is well established, examples include data synthesis, using generative semi-synthetic models, and applying various kinds of transformations. In this paper we propose a data augmentation method that preserves the geometric structure of the data objects, thus keeping the physical appearance of the data-set as close as possible to imaged plants in real agricultural scenes.

The model draws on a diverse body of literature related to organizational change and community psychology, as well as practices evolved as part of several restructuring efforts. Four overlapping phases and related guidelines for scale-up are conceived. The four phases are (a) creating readiness by enhancing a climate/culture for change; (b) initial implementation, whereby replication is carried out in stages using well-designed guidance and support mechanisms; (c) institutionalization, accomplished by ensuring there are mechanisms to maintain and enhance productive changes; and (d) ongoing evolution through use of mechanisms to improve quality and provide continuing support.

Various examples of the adaptive envelopes are analysed and compared with examples of biomimetic envelopes. This paper demonstrates the potential of the broad database of nature to provide solutions that can be implemented in architecture to achieve design solutions that are sustainable, energy efficient, and able to adapt to environmental changes. After an initial critical review of nature's adaptation strategies, a methodological approach has been proposed: the bio-adaptive model (bio-AM). Starting from the definition of the context and the relative abiotic factors, the bio-AM identifies the essential phases to transfer the functions of plants to building technologies, using adaptive materials capable of self-activation in response to environmental factors, thus potentially emulating the adaptation of plants in technological solutions for the future of sustainable buildings.","[Sommese, Francesco; Ausiello, Gigliola] Fed II Univ Naples, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, DICEA, Naples, Italy; [Badarnah, Lidia] Univ West England, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England",University of West England,"Sommese, F (corresponding author), Fed II Univ Naples, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, DICEA, Naples, Italy.",francesco.sommese@unina.it,,"Sommese, Francesco/0000-0002-9720-7520",,,,,85,0,0,11,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

As a consequence of the methodology, many state-of-the-art Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) can not be simulated accurately in HOT2000. A Housing Technology Assessment Platform (HTAP) software was previously developed, using HOT2000 as the simulation engine. HOT2000 was chosen as the simulation engine, because of its wide adoption and acceptance by builders and professionals in Canada. HTAP can run parametric runs, and provide energy demand and costing for a variety of ECMs. However many ECMs require hourly simulations to provide accurate energy demand estimates.

These problems include direct negative influences on people's health, adverse economic effects, negative social impacts, local environmental damage, and risk of catastrophic global climate change. There is a drastic need to develop ways to reduce these emissions and EcoTrec, presented in this paper, is one of these innovative approaches. EcoTrec is a vehicular ad hoc network-based vehicle routing solution designed to reduce vehicle carbon emissions without significantly affecting the travel times of vehicles. The vehicles exchange messages related to traffic and road conditions, such as average speed on the road, road gradient, and surface condition. This information is used to build a fuel efficiency model of the routes, based on which the vehicles are recommended to take more efficient routes. By routing vehicles more efficiently, the greenhouse emissions are reduced while also maintaining low traffic congestion levels. This paper presents results of extensive simulations, which show how EcoTrec outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions with different number of vehicles, vehicle penetration, and compliance rates, and when considering different real world road maps from Dublin and Koln.","[Doolan, Ronan; Muntean, Gabriel-Miro] Dublin City Univ, RINCE Inst, Performance Engn Lab, Dublin 9, Ireland",Dublin City University,"Doolan, R (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, RINCE Inst, Performance Engn Lab, Dublin 9, Ireland.",ronan.doolan2@mail.dcu.ie; gabriel.muntean@dcu.ie,"Muntean, Gabriel-Miro/U-6783-2019","Muntean, Gabriel-Miro/0000-0002-9332-4770","Science Foundation Ireland through LERO, the Irish Software Research Centre [10/CE/I1855]","Science Foundation Ireland through LERO, the Irish Software Research Centre(Science Foundation Ireland)","This work was supported by the Science Foundation Ireland through LERO, the Irish Software Research Centre, under Grant 10/CE/I1855.

This development has put the brewing industry under pressure to reduce production costs by intensifying their production process. Additionally in recent years environmental concerns over green house gas emissions and climate change have arisen amongst consumers and legislative requirements are getting stricter. Because of these developments, small and medium-sized breweries are increasingly forced to apply strategies for economic, environmental and social sustainability, too. This paper gives an overview over the state of the art in the brewing industry commonly realised in large breweries and presents important barriers to efficiency in smaller companies. The production process of a typical medium-sized brewery in the UK was analysed to identify principal measures to reduce energy and water demand. The case study also examines the particular problems preventing the brewery from realising these measures. The analysis of the process shows that even basic and easily applicable efficiency measures have so far been neglected. Improving insulation and implementation of basic heat recovery measures could potentially reduce energy demand by 20% and would result in a payback period of 1.3 years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the classification of urban forms is costly due to its reliance on high-resolution datasets, limited in the Global South's low-income cities. Additionally, the current classifiers are constrained in characterizing urban forms in heterogeneous cities where the built environment has an isomorphic footprint but vary in urban canopy parameters. Existing methodologies have constraints on using unstructured low-resolution datasets like images and portable document formats to classify intra-urban forms. This study breaks ground by forwarding a novel end-to-end multi-channel supervised data fusion framework, GeoInFuse, to classify different urban form typologies in heterogeneous hyper-dense cities. It uses a state-of-the-art deep learning network on open-source image-based datasets to generate urban form classification. Three datasets (two for ground truth and one containing multi-dimensional urban canopy parameters) are used to demonstrate the framework. The parameters as channels were fused to generate urban form classes. Results show that the GeoInFuse could extract the heterogeneous urban form classes with 74.9.","[Bardhan, Ronita] Univ Cambridge, Dept Architecture, Sustainable Design Grp, Cambridge, England; [Gupta, Pooja; Majumdar, Angshul] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Delhi, India; [Bardhan, Ronita] Univ Cambridge, Dept Architecture, 1-5 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge CB2 1PX, Cambs, England",University of Cambridge; Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi; University of Cambridge,"Bardhan, R (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Architecture, 1-5 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge CB2 1PX, Cambs, England.",rb867@cam.ac.uk; poojag@iiitd.ac.in; angshul@iiitd.ac.in,"Bardhan, Ronita/AAG-3032-2020","Bardhan, Ronita/0000-0001-5336-4084",Seed-Funding on Smart Imaging for Development [G113185]; Isaac Newton Trust; Sandpit; Seed-Funding on Smart Imaging for Development; UK Space Agency [G113185],Seed-Funding on Smart Imaging for Development; Isaac Newton Trust; Sandpit; Seed-Funding on Smart Imaging for Development; UK Space Agency,"RB would like to acknowledge thank Sandpit and Seed-Funding on Smart Imaging for Development (grant number [GCIV.GAAB] ) , delivered by Cambridge Global Challenges SRI, University of Cambridge and CamBridgeSens SRN and supported by the Isaac Newton Trust for their funding support.

Moreover, on the grounds of the structure of the Five Elements, Liu Xiang also refers to and integrates monthly climate knowledge, I (Ching) knowledge, yin-yang knowledge, disaster-abnormity theory from the Spring and Autumn Annals, astrology and other Confucian commentaries, as well as divination knowledge, thereby establishing a vast and broad Confucian disaster-abnormity theory system. This system strengthens the correlation between the Five Elements and traditional commentaries, and also encompasses part of the divination knowledge, thereby expanding the traditional Confucian knowledge system. Although several omissions exist in Liu Xiang's systematicity and his philosophy features heterogeneity and internal contradictions, his high accomplishment in the Six Arts and his study style of following various schools still manifest a certain representativeness in the history of Confucianism in the Western Han dynasty and indicate the efforts of Confucian scholars in the Han dynasty to integrate traditional commentaries with divination knowledge, thereby making an important individual case for studying the interaction between the history of Confucianism and the early history of knowledge.","[Cheng, Sudong] Peking Univ, Dept Chinese Language & Literature, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Cheng, SD (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Chinese Language & Literature, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,ACAD SINICA-INST HISTORY PHILOLOGY,TAIPEI,"EDITORIAL COMMITTEE, TAIPEI 11529, TAIWAN",1012-4195,,,B INST HIST PHILOL,Bull.

With the global goal of building a climate-resilient future, strategies towards a greener manufacturing of ferrite magnets are of great interest. A new ceramic processing route for obtaining dense Sr-ferrite sintered magnets is presented here. Instead of the usual sintering process employed nowadays in ferrite magnet manufacturing that demands long dwell times, a shorter two-step sintering is designed to densify the ferrite ceramics. As a result of these processes, dense SrFe12O19 ceramic magnets with properties comparable to state-of-the-art ferrite magnets are obtained. In particular, the SrFe12O19 magnet containing 0.2% PVA and 0.6% wt SiO2 reaches a coercivity of 164 kA/m along with a 93% relative density. A reduction of 31% in energy consumption is achieved in the thermal treatment with respect to conventional sintering, which could lead to energy savings for the industry of the order of 7.10(9) kWh per year.","[Guzman-Minguez, J.

(MO), a fast-growing medium-sized tree, is extensively grown in many countries in Asia, North and South America, Africa, Europe, and Australia/Oceania with a semi-arid climate. The miracle MO has a wide range of culinary, nutraceutical, pharmacological and phytochemical properties and is one of the most extensively researched tree species. Largely, the pharmacological applications of various bioactive phytochemicals from M. oleifera have been based on anecdotes and the mechanistic details governing their activities have been elusive. Therefore, there has been a much-needed paradigm shift from anecdotes to empirical evidence. The draft genome sequence of MO in 2015 was a significant development and a prelude for various basic and applied studies by employing state-of-the-art biotechnological interventions. This review presents a critical analysis of the emerging biotechnological advances made in MO comprising studies on the whole genome and chloroplast genome, identification of transcription factors (TFs), genes involved in metabolic pathways, miRNAs, and novel proteins. These studies provided a fillip for the improvement of commercially viable traits and elucidation of the intricate molecular mechanisms governing a vast repertoire of pharmacological and other attributes in MO.","[Jain, Ajay; Goud, Muddapuram Deeksha; Sharma, Preeti; Gour, Vinod Singh; Kothari, Shanker Lal] Amity Univ Rajasthan, Amity Inst Biotechnol, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Poli, Yugandhar] ICAR Indian Inst Rice Res, Hyderabad 500030, India; [Ravi, R.

Without widespread and accurate BC measurements, it remains difficult to track incomplete combustion sources and reduce BC emissions. Currently commercial BC sensors remain too costly to be deployed widely. In this work, a fast, cost-effective, and easily accessible method based on a smartphone camera was used to quantify color information of PM collected on filters to estimate BC and elemental carbon (EC) loadings. A robust RGB (red, green, blue)-based linear interaction model was built and validated using 1878 PM samples collected in three different regions with collocated BC and EC measurements. After applying image correction methods, this model shows a good predictability with an R-squared (R-2) of 0.904 with state-of-the-art BC measurement techniques, and a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)) of 25.3% despite the complex sources and different reference measurement techniques.

Existing green data center designs often yield suboptimal performance as they only look at a certain specific type of energy source. This article explores data centers powered by hybrid renewable energy systems. We propose GreenWorks, a framework for HPC data centers running on a renewable energy mix. Specifically, GreenWorks features a cross-layer power management scheme tailored to the timing behaviors and capacity constraints of different energy sources. Using realistic workload traces and renewable energy data, we show that GreenWorks could provide a near-optimal workload performance (within 3% difference) on average. It can also reduce the worst-case performance degradation by 43% compared to the state-of-the-art design.

The framework draws upon well-established technical, economic and environmental assessment methods and integrates technical performance, uncertainties, cost estimation and life cycle inventory data to ensure consistency and enhance quality. Results show that for the modelled coal power plant of about 800 MW gross power output, the CO2 capture system lowers the net efficiency by 10.4% efficiency points and results in a 68% increase in the cost of electricity. Environmental performance evaluated on a broad range of 24 impacts and emission categories indicates a 68% reduction in climate change warming potential with 20-90% increase in other impacts. By comparing the quality of the inventory data used for environmental assessment with the state-of-art data in available life cycle assessment literature, it is found that the due diligence analysis brings significant improvement in the quality of data for certain processes in the value chain.

This perception was based on the lack of reference to sightings of giraffe in early colonial literature and the lack of giraffe remains in archaeological sites within KwaZulu-Natal. We have reviewed the literature and found no reliable reference to giraffe in early colonial writings and no reports of rock art featuring giraffe in the area. However, there are recent reports of the recovery of giraffe bones from the Middle Stone Age deposits at Sibudu Shelter, the Holocene hunter-gatherer deposits at Maqonqo Shelter and from the Early Iron Age agriculturist site of KwaGandaganda, all within KwaZulu-Natal. We argue that giraffe were present 1000 BP (date of most recent excavation evidencing giraffe remains), but had died out or been extirpated by c. 220 BID (date of written accounts). The demise of giraffe between 1000 and 220 BP may be linked to disease, climate change or anthropogenic causes. The finding of giraffe remains within KwaZulu-Natal raises the possibility that they should be considered as native to the area.","[Cramer, M.

In this context, synergy assessment between renewable electricity sources is of great significance for local and regional power planning. Here we use synergy metrics (stability coefficient (C-stab) and normalised Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to a state-of-the-art reanalysis product from 2011-2020 to preliminarily assess solar-wind synergies globally on diurnal and seasonal time scales assuming equal installed capacities of solar and wind hybrid system. Our results suggest that medium-to-good diurnal and seasonal complementarities between solar photovoltaic and wind power potential are the norm, rather than the exception, which could help many countries in achieving balanced power mixes based on renewable resources. Our results also suggest that many regions in the tropics and sub tropics may need to explore synergic benefits of other renewables in addition to solar power. An open-access application is now available on the European Copernicus cloud to explore solar and wind synergies on diurnal and seasonal time scales worldwide.","[Nyenah, Emmanuel; Sterl, Sebastian; Thiery, Wim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium; [Sterl, Sebastian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Sterl, Sebastian] Int Renewable Energy Agcy IRENA, Bonn, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; KU Leuven,"Nyenah, E (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium.",emmanuel.nyenah@vub.be; soineade@gmail.com,,"Sterl, Sebastian/0000-0003-1078-5561; Nyenah, Emmanuel/0000-0001-8766-7657; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145","BMBF (Germany); FORMAS (Sweden); BELSPO (Belgium); IFD (Denmark); European Union [690462]; project CIREG (Climate Information for Integrated Renewable Electricity Generation), part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET Co-fund action; JPI Climate","BMBF (Germany)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FORMAS (Sweden)(Swedish Research Council Formas); BELSPO (Belgium)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); IFD (Denmark); European Union(European Commission); project CIREG (Climate Information for Integrated Renewable Electricity Generation), part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET Co-fund action; JPI Climate","S S and W T acknowledge research funding from the project CIREG (Climate Information for Integrated Renewable Electricity Generation), which is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET Co-fund action initiated by JPI Climate, funded by BMBF (Germany), FORMAS (Sweden), BELSPO (Belgium) and IFD (Denmark) with co-funding from the European Union's Horizon2020 Framework Program (Grant 690462).",,45,0,0,3,3,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2515-7620,,,ENVIRON RES COMMUN,Environ.

With recent advances in machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become state-of-the-art algorithms. However, CNNs cannot be easily integrated with OBIA because the processing unit of CNNs is a rectangular image, whereas that of OBIA is an irregular image object. To obtain object-based thematic maps, this study developed a new method that integrates object-based post-classification refinement (OBPR) and CNNs for LULC mapping using Sentinel optical and SAR data. After producing the classification map by CNN, each image object was labeled with the most frequent land cover category of its pixels. The proposed method was tested on the optical-SAR Sentinel Guangzhou dataset with 10 m spatial resolution, the optical-SAR Zhuhai-Macau local climate zones (LCZ) dataset with 100 m spatial resolution, and a hyperspectral benchmark the University of Pavia with 1.3 m spatial resolution. It outperformed OBIA support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). SVM and RF could benefit more from the combined use of optical and SAR data compared with CNN, whereas spatial information learned by CNN was very effective for classification. With the ability to extract spatial features and maintain object boundaries, the proposed method considerably improved the classification accuracy of urban ground targets. It achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 95.33% for the Sentinel Guangzhou dataset, OA of 77.64% for the Zhuhai-Macau LCZ dataset, and OA of 95.70% for the University of Pavia dataset with only 10 labeled samples per class.","[Liu, Shengjie; Qi, Zhixin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xia] East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Yeh, Anthony Gar-On] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; East China Normal University; University of Hong Kong,"Qi, ZX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liushj23@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; qizhixin@mail.sysu.edu.cn; lixia@geo.ecnu.edu.cn; hdxugoy@hkucc.hku.hk,"Liu, Shengjie/AAP-8939-2020; LI, XIA/A-1235-2013","Liu, Shengjie/0000-0003-0253-7410; LI, XIA/0000-0003-3050-8529",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601445]; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2016A030313230]; Young Scholar Research Fund of Sun Yat-sen University [16lgpy05]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Fund [HKU 17209214]; Chan To-Haan Endowed Professorship Fund of the University of Hong Kong; Distinguished Research Achievement Award of the University of Hong Kong; Science and Operational Applications Research - Education International (SOAR-EI) Initiative [5167],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Young Scholar Research Fund of Sun Yat-sen University; Hong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Fund(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Chan To-Haan Endowed Professorship Fund of the University of Hong Kong; Distinguished Research Achievement Award of the University of Hong Kong; Science and Operational Applications Research - Education International (SOAR-EI) Initiative,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41601445), the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2016A030313230), the Young Scholar Research Fund of Sun Yat-sen University (Grant No. 16lgpy05), the Hong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Fund (HKU 17209214), the Chan To-Haan Endowed Professorship Fund and Distinguished Research Achievement Award of the University of Hong Kong, and the Science and Operational Applications Research - Education International (SOAR-EI) Initiative (Grant No. 5167).",,65,60,61,6,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,2-Mar,2019,6,,,,,,690,10.3390/rs11060690,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11060690,,,25,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,HU9LG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000465615300067,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, this work proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the optimal electrical and thermal dispatch, incorporating failure rates of the key equipment and applied to a major Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant in Karaganda. The proposed model allows improving the energy efficiency of the CHP operations while preserving system resilience. Historical data have been used to characterise the operating windows and steam consumption for electrical and thermal dispatch.

A major concern in the use of sensor networks in general is their reliability in the presence of security threats and cyberattacks. Compared to traditional networks, sensor networks typically face numerous additional vulnerabilities due to the dynamic and distributed network topology, the resource constrained nodes, the potentially large network scale and the lack of global network knowledge. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to launch more severe and complicated attacks. Since the state-of-the-art is lacking studies on vulnerabilities in VSNs, a thorough investigation of attacks that can be launched against VSNs is required.

Altai relict forests are under the risk of degradation under the recent warming. Investigations of climatic impacts on the southern Siberian forest, where temperature is not the main limiting growth factor are still rare and urgently needed. Therefore, we aim to reveal and evaluate the impact of recent extreme climatic events (1919-2019) on relict larch trees (Larix sibirica Ldb.) from two contrasting sites in the Russian Altai (Ersin-HO and Chadan-CH). Application of the state-of-the-art methods of stable isotope and tree-ring analyses is very promising in this region due to high sensitivity of trees to temperature and precipitation changes. We found site-specific differences (ca. 4 parts per thousand) recorded in newly developed centennial stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope chronologies, showing their climate sensitivity and reflecting the contrasting conditions at the dry (HO) and wet (CH) sites. The most extreme drought anomalies (sigma >= + 3 sigma) over the past 100 years (1919-2019) were revealed for the HO-site in 1935 and 2018. In contrast, a wet extreme anomaly (sigma = - 2.7 sigma) was detected for the CH site only in 1994. Moreover, trees from the CH-site are receiving a greater amount of precipitation during the summer months, especially for the years with extremes sigma >= - 2 sigma (1939, 1948, 1958, 1994, 2000, and 2019). Divergent delta C-13 and intrinsic water-use efficiency trends after the 1980s indicate increasing drought stress at the HO- compared to the CH-site, which is confirmed by changes in the running correlation between the isotopes and comparison with declining tree-ring width data. Drought or flooding extremes are recorded heterogeneously at the two study sites in southern Altai, indicating dependence from local habitats, type of soils and freezing active soil depths. Recent climate change affected both forest and humans as public and agricultural sectors are suffering from recent droughts or flooding events. To provide measures and apply mitigation plans for the unique relict forest and public sector, our reconstruction of past anomaly events in this region is important and helpful to predict future climate changes.","[Churakova (Sidorova), Olga, V; Fonti, Marina, V] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Ecol & Geog, Lab Ecosyst Biogeochem, Svobodny Pr 79, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Churakova (Sidorova), Olga, V; Saurer, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Forest Dynam, Ecosyst Ecol, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Myglan, Vladimir S.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Humanities, Siberian Dendrolab, Svobodny Pr 82, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia","Siberian Federal University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Siberian Federal University","Churakova, OV (corresponding author), Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Ecol & Geog, Lab Ecosyst Biogeochem, Svobodny Pr 79, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia.;Churakova, OV (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Forest Dynam, Ecosyst Ecol, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",ochurakova@sfu-kras.ru; vmiglan@sfu-kras.ru; mbryukhanova@sfu-kras.ru; matthias.saurer@wsl.ch,"Fonti, Marina/L-3978-2013; Myglan, Vladimir/S-7088-2018","Fonti, Marina/0000-0002-2415-8019; Churakova (Sidorova), Olga/0000-0002-1687-1201; Myglan, Vladimir/0000-0002-5268-653X",Russian National Science Foundation [RNSF 19-14-00028],Russian National Science Foundation,"The work was supported by the Russian National Science Foundation granted to Prof. Myglan (RNSF 19-14-00028 Extreme catastrophic droughts on south Siberia over the past millennia).

Specifically, the estimation of economic flood damage is gaining greater importance as flood risk management is becoming the dominant approach of flood control policies throughout Europe. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art and identifies research directions of economic flood damage assessment. Despite the fact that considerable research effort has been spent and progress has been made on damage data collection, data analysis and model development in recent years, there still seems to be a mismatch between the relevance of damage assessments and the quality of the available models and datasets. Often, simple approaches are used, mainly due to limitations in available data and knowledge on damage mechanisms. The results of damage assessments depend on many assumptions, e.g. the selection of spatial and temporal boundaries, and there are many pitfalls in economic evaluation, e.g. the choice between replacement costs or depreciated values. Much larger efforts are required for empirical and synthetic data collection and for providing consistent, reliable data to scientists and practitioners. A major shortcoming of damage modelling is that model validation is scarcely performed. Uncertainty analyses and thorough scrutiny of model inputs and assumptions should be mandatory for each damage model development and application, respectively. In our view, flood risk assessments are often not well balanced. Much more attention is given to the hazard assessment part, whereas damage assessment is treated as some kind of appendix within the risk analysis. Advances in flood damage assessment could trigger subsequent methodological improvements in other natural hazard areas with comparable time-space properties.","[Merz, B.; Kreibich, H.] German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Schwarze, R.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04316 Leipzig, Germany; [Thieken, A.] AlpS Ctr Nat Hazard & Risk Management, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Schwarze, R.; Thieken, A.] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, CSC Climate Serv Ctr, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Thieken, A.] Leopold Franzens Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; University of Innsbruck,"Merz, B (corresponding author), German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",bmerz@gfz-potsdam.de,"Thieken, Annegret Henriette/B-1946-2017; Kreibich, Heidi/G-9408-2012","Thieken, Annegret Henriette/0000-0001-7068-2615; Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; Schwarze, Reimund/0000-0002-2734-9259; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [0330688],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work is part of the research project MEDIS (Methods for the evaluation of direct and indirect flood damages) which was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) (No. 0330688) within the research programme RIMAX (Risk management of extreme flood events).,,157,692,702,17,296,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

Thus, considering the hydro-climatic effects of reservoirs is important in water cycle studies at a river basin to global scales; yet, reservoirs are represented poorly in large-scale hydrological and climate models. Here we present a high-resolution (5km) continental-scale reservoir storage dynamics and release scheme by enhancing existing schemes and adding critical novel parameterizations to improve reservoir storage and release simulations. The new scheme simulates river-floodplain-reservoir storages in an integrated manner considering their spatial and temporal variations. A new calibration scheme is also incorporated to better simulate reservoir dynamics considering cascade-reservoir effects. Further, since no reservoir bathymetry data are available over large domains, we use a state-of-the-art digital elevation model and reservoir extent data to derive reservoir bed elevation. The new scheme is integrated within the river-floodplain routing scheme of a continental hydrological model LEAF-Hydro-Flood. Results from the simulation of similar to 1,900 reservoirs within the contiguous United States suggest that the model well captures the observed reservoir storage-release dynamics. Comparison of our results with those from the existing schemes suggest a significant improvement; importantly, the new scheme reduces the excessive and frequent reservoir overfilling and underfilling. Comparison of results with satellite-based surface water data shows that the model accurately reproduces the large-scale patterns of reservoir-floodplain inundation extents. It is expected that the results of this study will inform the incorporation of reservoirs in hyper-resolution models to improve simulations of terrestrial water storage and flow and examine reservoir-atmosphere interactions over large domains.","[Shin, Sanghoon; Pokhrel, Yadu] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Fac Phys 15782, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Michigan State University; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Pokhrel, Y (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ypokhrel@egr.msu.edu,"Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/AAA-3295-2019; Pokhrel, Yadu/AAC-1776-2021; Pokhrel, Yadu/J-6440-2013","Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Pokhrel, Yadu/0000-0002-1367-216X; Shin, Sanghoon/0000-0001-6313-2076",National Science Foundation [1752729]; WaterCUBE project from Michigan State University [GR100096],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); WaterCUBE project from Michigan State University,"This study was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (1752729) and WaterCUBE project from Michigan State University (GR100096).

However, research on the details of energy consumption in this sector is relatively poor and there is a lack of data on actual energy use in households. This study attempts to fill the gap by providing an analysis of appliance penetration, usage behavior, and actual energy consumption of Vietnamese homes. Data were collected from a survey of 60 households in Tuy Hoa City on the South-Central Coast of Vietnam in 2017. The result shows that the average energy consumption was 4492 kWh per household per year, in which electricity and liquefied petroleum gas accounted for 74.4% and 25.6% respectively. The breakdown of current energy consumption revealed that cooling was the primary consuming end-use with 31.9% of the total, followed by cooking gas with 25.6% and kitchen appliances with 18.5%. Energy consumption for typical households with various ownership levels of air conditioner were also predicted. The results of this study are therefore a valuable reference for policy makers, energy planners and Vietnamese households themselves to understand the existing energy consumption characteristics and identify potential ways to improve energy efficiency in dwellings.

We build a database of 4691 relevant papers from the Web of Science and Scopus. We analyze their abstracts and metadata using text mining and natural language processing techniques. To discover common topics within the abstracts, we use an innovative and fully reproducible topic modeling approach based on two machine learning models. We find that the number of papers per country is well correlated with current levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with few papers for (current) low emitters, notably in Africa. Time horizons of 2030 and 2050 each account for one-third of the papers, with the former actually more frequent in recent years, spurred by interest in the (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions. Topic modeling analysis of the data set reveals that forward-looking mitigation papers encompass all dimensions of mitigation, save for financial issues, that are lacking. However, energy and to a lesser degree land use, land use change and forestry are very dominant relative to other sectors. Topics are unevenly addressed across countries, reflecting national circumstances and priorities, but also pointing to gaps in the literature. The limited number of forward-looking papers in (currently) low-emitting countries raises questions about the lack of research capacity in support of the construction of domestic climate policies.","[Lepault, Claire; Lecocq, Franck] Univ Paris Saclay, CIRED, AgroParisTech, CNRS,ENPC,CIRAD,EHESS, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Lepault, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CIRED, AgroParisTech, CNRS,ENPC,CIRAD,EHESS, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",claire.lepault@enpc.fr,,"Lecocq, Franck/0000-0003-4875-1156; Lepault, Claire/0000-0002-4976-2319",French environment and Energy Management Agency (Ademe) [18MAR000099186715],French environment and Energy Management Agency (Ademe),"We warmly thank two anonymous reviewers who contributed to improve the quality of the manuscript.

In particular, the applications of deep CNNs using optical remote sensing data have focused on the classification of very high-resolution aerial and satellite data, owing to the similarity of these data to the large datasets in computer vision. Accordingly, this study presents a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep learning tools for classification of complex wetland classes using multispectral RapidEye optical imagery. Specifically, we examine the capacity of seven well-known deep convnets, namely DenseNet121, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, for wetland mapping in Canada. In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands. The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets.

However, biospheric models, particularly when used in conjunction with recent satellite datasets, provide a new, fully coupled, global perspective. The current investigation uses a new version of the Grid Enabled Integrated Earth system (GENIE-SF) to compare both the magnitude and the seasonal and zonal variation in water flux [evaporation E and precipitation (PPT)] and carbon flux [net primary productivity (NPP)] above land and ocean. GENIE-SF contains state-of-the-art representations of photosynthesis and is driven by the phenological cycles of leaf area index (LAI) and marine chlorophyll concentration, both recorded with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors. The current study reveals the striking uniformity of the ocean-atmosphere carbon and water flux exchange, both temporally and spatially, compared to the corresponding land-atmosphere exchange. Although biospheric annual NPP (108 +/- 27 GtC yr(-1)) is split almost equally between land (52% +/- 9%) and ocean (48% +/- 9%), the oceanic contribution to biospheric annual E exceeds that of the land by a factor of 6.7 +/- 1.7. Simulations conducted over a 50-yr period (1951-2000) suggest that a 16% increase in land NPP, owing mainly to CO2 fertilization, may be partially offset by a decline in marine productivity.","[Alton, Paul B.; Bodin, Per E.] Swansea Univ, Dept Geog, Swansea SA2 8EF, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Alton, PB (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Geog, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8EF, W Glam, Wales.",p.alton@swansea.ac.uk,,,,,,,106,1,1,1,8,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994-2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the MA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and day content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

The results showed that the daily maximum LST simulated by CHTESSEL over Iberia was affected by a large cold bias during summer months when compared against the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF), reaching magnitudes larger than 10 degrees C over wide portions of central and southwestern Iberia. This error was shown to be tightly linked to a misrepresentation of the vegetation cover. In contrast, SURFEX simulations did not display such a cold bias. We show that this was due to the better representation of vegetation cover in SURFEX, which uses an updated land cover dataset (ECOCLIMAP-II) and an interactive vegetation evolution, representing seasonality. The representation of vegetation over Iberia in CHTESSEL was improved by combining information from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) land cover dataset with the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of vegetation coverage (FCOVER). The proposed improvement in vegetation also included a clumping approach that introduces seasonality to the vegetation cover. The results showed significant added value, removing the daily maximum LST summer cold bias completely, without reducing the accuracy of the simulated LST, regardless of season or time of the day. The striking performance differences between SURFEX and CHTESSEL were fundamental to guiding the developments in CHTESSEL highlighting the importance of using different models. This work has important implications: first, it takes advantage of LST, a key variable in surface-atmosphere energy and water exchanges, which is closely related to satellite top-of-atmosphere observations, to improve the model's representation of land surface processes. Second, CHTESSEL is the land surface model employed by ECMWF in the production of their weather forecasts and reanalysis; hence systematic errors in land surface variables and fluxes are then propagated into those products. Indeed, we showed that the summer daily maximum LST cold bias over Iberia in CHTESSEL is present in the widely used ECMWF fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5). Finally, our results provided hints about the interaction between vegetation land-atmosphere exchanges, highlighting the relevance of the vegetation cover and respective seasonality in representing land surface temperature in both CHTESSEL and SURFEX. As a whole, this work demonstrated the added value of using multiple earth observation products for constraining and improving weather and climate simulations.","[Nogueira, Miguel; Johannsen, Frederico; Dutra, Emanuel] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Inst Dom Luiz, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Albergel, Clement] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Boussetta, Souhail] ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Trigo, Isabel F.; Ermida, Sofia L.; Martins, Joao P.

This study challenges state-of-the-art parametrizations used in general circulation models to represent the clear-sky summertime diurnal cycle of the ABL at Dome C, Antarctic Plateau. The Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique-Zoom model is run in a 1-D configuration on the fourth Global Energy and Water Cycle Exchanges Project Atmospheric Boundary Layers Study case. Simulations are analyzed and compared to observations, giving insights into the sensitivity of one model that participates to the intercomparison exercise. Snow albedo and thermal inertia are calibrated leading to better surface temperatures. Using the so-called thermal plume model improves the momentum mixing in the diurnal ABL. In stable conditions, four turbulence schemes are tested. Best simulations are those in which the turbulence cuts off above 35 m in the middle of the night, highlighting the contribution of the longwave radiation in the ABL heat budget. However, the nocturnal surface layer is not stable enough to distinguish between surface fluxes computed with different stability functions. The absence of subsidence in the forcings and an underestimation of downward longwave radiation are identified to be likely responsible for a cold bias in the nocturnal ABL. Apart from model-specific improvements, the paper clarifies on which are the critical aspects to improve in general circulation models to correctly represent the summertime ABL over the Antarctic Plateau.","[Vignon, Etienne; Genthon, Christophe; Gallee, Hubert] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, IGE, Grenoble, France; [Hourdin, Frederic; Lefebvre, Marie-Pierre; Madeleine, Jean-Baptiste] CNRS, UMR 8539, Lab Meteorol Dynam IPSL, Paris, France; [Bazile, Eric] CNRM, GAME, Toulouse, France; [Madeleine, Jean-Baptiste] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Lab Meteorol Dynam IPSL, UMR 8539, Paris, France; [Van de Wiel, Bas J.

They depend mostly on the incorrect modelling of building components and their properties, the inadequate characterization of operational schedules, the limitations in the simulation algorithms used by energy simulation software, the quality and reliability of data contained in weather files. The first three limiting factors are somehow under the control and capacity of the person in charge of the simulation, that, nevertheless, may not always be able to get detailed building specifications to identify the correct set-points and schedules, or to choose an alternative simulation software. The information contained in weather datasets are, however, completely out of the control of the person in charge of the simulation that may only assume them as a boundary condition. Unfortunately, not all the weather databases show the same level of data accuracy; moreover, they may refer to a climate that substantially changed in the last decades. The effects on building energy simulation results, played by different weather files referred to the city of Milan, is showed and discussed, highlighting the substantial performance difference depending on them.

During 1980-2005 modelled results indicated that China's croplands acted as a carbon sink with an average carbon sequestration rate of 33.4 TgC yr-1 (1 Tg = 1012 g). Both the highest net CO2 uptake rate and the largest CH4 emission rate were found in southeast region of China's croplands. Of primary influences were land-cover and land-use change, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition, which accounted for 76%, 42% and 17% of the total carbon sequestration in China's croplands during the study period, respectively. The total carbon losses due to elevated ozone and climate variability/change were equivalent to 27% and 9% of the total carbon sequestration, respectively. Our further analysis indicated that nitrogen fertilizer application accounted for 60% of total national carbon uptake in cropland, whereas changes in paddy field areas mainly determined the variability of CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that improving air quality by means such as reducing ozone concentration and optimizing agronomic practices can enhance carbon sequestration capacity of China's croplands.","[Ren, Wei; Tian, Hanqin; Xu, Xiaofeng; Liu, Mingliang; Lu, Chaoqun; Chen, Guangsheng] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Ecosyst Dynam & Global Ecol Lab, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Ren, Wei; Tian, Hanqin; Xu, Xiaofeng; Liu, Mingliang; Lu, Chaoqun; Chen, Guangsheng] Auburn Univ, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Melillo, Jerry] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Reilly, John] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Liu, Jiyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Tian, HQ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Ecosyst Dynam & Global Ecol Lab, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",tianhan@auburn.edu,"Xu, Xiaofeng/B-2391-2008; Lu, Chaoqun/A-6497-2012; Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012; Ren, Wei/I-4048-2014; Xu, Xiaofeng/Y-3672-2019; Lu, Chaoqun/HCH-9102-2022; Lu, Chaoqun/D-6694-2018; Chen, Guangsheng/AAC-4462-2022; Ren, Wei/G-8317-2016; Liu, Mingliang/B-1361-2009","Xu, Xiaofeng/0000-0002-6553-6514; Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091; Ren, Wei/0000-0002-4840-4835; Xu, Xiaofeng/0000-0002-6553-6514; Lu, Chaoqun/0000-0002-1526-0513; Lu, Chaoqun/0000-0002-1526-0513; Liu, Mingliang/0000-0002-1963-5933","NASA [NNX08AL73G, NNG04GM39C]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950900]",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"This study has been supported by NASA Land Cover and Land Use Change Program (NNX08AL73G), NASA Interdisciplinary Science Program (NNG04GM39C), and the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2010CB950900).

The rapidly developing unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and specially designed cameras offer opportunities for TIR survey with increasingly high resolution, reduced geometric and radiometric noise, and prolonged flight times. A state-of-the-art science platform is assembled using a Matrice 210 V2 drone equipped with a Zenmuse XT2 thermal camera and deployed over a pristine boreal peatland with the aim of testing its performance in a heterogeneous sedgefen ecosystem. The study utilizes the capability of the UAS platform to hover for prolonged times (about 20 min) at a height of 500ma.g.l. while recording high frame rate (30 Hz) TIR videos of an area of ca. 430 x 340 m. A methodology is developed to derive thermal signatures of near-ground coherent turbulent structures impinging on the land surface, surface temperature spectra, and heat fluxes from the retrieved videos. The size, orientation, and movement of the coherent structures are computed from the surface temperature maps, and their dependency on atmospheric conditions is examined. A range of spectral and wavelet-based approaches are used to infer the properties of the dominant turbulent scene structures. A ground-based eddy-covariance system and an in situ meteorological setup are used for reference.","[Alekseychik, Pavel; Launiainen, Samuli] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Bioecon & Environm, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Alekseychik, Pavel] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, POB 68, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Katul, Gabriel] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Katul, Gabriel] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Korpela, Ilkka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, Helsinki 00014, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Helsinki; Duke University; Duke University; University of Helsinki,"Alekseychik, P (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland, Bioecon & Environm, Helsinki 00790, Finland.;Alekseychik, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, POB 68, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",pavel.alekseychik@luke.fi,"Launiainen, Samuli/AAS-9180-2021; Katul, Gabriel/A-7210-2008","Launiainen, Samuli/0000-0001-6611-6573; Alekseychik, Pavel/0000-0002-4081-3917; Katul, Gabriel/0000-0001-9768-3693",Academy of Finland (Project CLIMOSS (Climate impacts of boreal bryophytes -from functional traits to global models)) [296116]; Academy of Finland (Project SOMPA (Novel soil management practices -key for sustainable bioeconomy and climate change mitigation)) [312912],Academy of Finland (Project CLIMOSS (Climate impacts of boreal bryophytes -from functional traits to global models)); Academy of Finland (Project SOMPA (Novel soil management practices -key for sustainable bioeconomy and climate change mitigation))(Academy of Finland),"This research has been supported by the Academy of Finland (Project CLIMOSS (Climate impacts of boreal bryophytes -from functional traits to global models), Decision no. 296116; and Project SOMPA (Novel soil management practices -key for sustainable bioeconomy and climate change mitigation), Decision no. 312912).",,52,4,4,1,8,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1867-1381,1867-8548,,ATMOS MEAS TECH,Atmos.

Comparative phylogeographic analysis provides an effective tool for locating such refugia, as long-term retention of one or more populations within a refugial landscape will generate unique genetic lineages. The ranges of the western Gulf region of northern Australia are thought to represent a significant arid-zone refugium, in which case low-dispersal organisms should have strong phylogeographic structure across the region. To test for this, we conducted extensive sampling of three species of Gehyra geckos and analysed diversity for mitochondrial DNA and eight nuclear loci. These analyses revealed congruent and high phylogeographic diversity, especially, but not exclusively, in rock-restricted species. This finding, and other recent phylogeographic evidence, demonstrates that these topographically variable landforms have enabled persistence of ecologically diverse vertebrate species through the climate changes of the late Pleistocene. Identification of this relatively under-protected region as a significant climate change refugium points to the need to expand protected areas in this region and to invest in ecological management across existing National Parks and Indigenous Protected Areas.","[Noble, Catherine; Laver, Rebecca J.; Rosauer, Dan F.; Moritz, Craig] Australian Natl Univ, Div Ecol & Evolut, Res Sch Biol, 46 Sullivans Creek Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Noble, Catherine; Laver, Rebecca J.; Rosauer, Dan F.; Moritz, Craig] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Biodivers Anal, 46 Sullivans Creek Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Ferrier, Simon] CSIRO Land & Water, Black Mt, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Moritz, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Div Ecol & Evolut, Res Sch Biol, 46 Sullivans Creek Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.;Moritz, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Biodivers Anal, 46 Sullivans Creek Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",craig.moritz@anu.edu.au,"Rosauer, Dan F/C-3735-2008; Ferrier, Simon/C-1490-2009; Laver, Rebecca J./I-9457-2019","Rosauer, Dan F/0000-0002-2371-1767; Ferrier, Simon/0000-0001-7884-2388; Laver, Rebecca J./0000-0002-6319-7213",Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship,Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship(Australian Research Council),"We thank the many people who allowed access to, and sampling on, their lands, including pastoralists, National Parks Staff and Traditional Owners of the Ganalanga-Mindibirrina, South East Arnhem, and Marthakal Indigenous Protected Areas.

By focusing on inter-annual variations, it is possible to track effects acting on decadal timescales such as temperature increase due to climate change as well as changes in nutrient input. The strongest inter-annual coherence indicates that variations in phytoplankton biomass are determined by changes in concentrations of the limiting nutrient. However, after 1950 high nutrient concentrations created a less-nutrient-limited regime, and the coherence was reduced. Furthermore, the inter-annual coherence of mixed-layer nitrate with riverine input of nitrate is much larger than the coherence between mixed-layer phosphate and phosphate loads. This indicates a greater relative importance of the vertical flux of phosphate from the deep layer into the mixed layer. In addition, shifts in nutrient patterns give rise to changes in phytoplankton nutrient limitation. The modelled pattern shifts from purely phosphate limited to a seasonally varying regime. The results further indicate some effect of inter-annual temperature increase on cyanobacteria and flagellates. Changes in mixed-layer depth affect mainly diatoms due to their high sinking velocity, while inter-annual coherence between irradiance and phytoplankton biomass is not found.","[Hieronymus, Jenny; Eilola, Kari; Hieronymus, Magnus; Meier, H.

This paper contributes to current understandings of artfulness through an in-depth case study of conversations facilitated by an arts-sustainability project in Wales known as Emergence. Through the author's experiences of conversations at Emergence gatherings, the paper develops a theory of artfulness as a manner of being that is attuned to a dispersed, emergent version of creativity. The radical ecological potential of the conversations is explored through three themes: vulnerability and receptivity; reconfiguring self-other subjectivities; and posthuman sensibilities. In doing so, the paper contends that artfulness further expands ideas about where and how creativity arises, presenting possibilities for non-artists to creatively compose-with the world in transformative ways. This is essential because the imaginative and creative leap required in response to ongoing ecological loss is so great that it should not be left to professional artists alone.","[Pigott, Anna] Swansea Univ, Geog, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Pigott, A (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Geog, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",a.l.pigott@swansea.ac.uk,,"Pigott, Anna/0000-0002-0573-8181",Research Councils UK > Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S011358/1]; ESRC [ES/S011358/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils UK > Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Research Councils UK > Economic and Social Research Council ES/S011358/1.,,105,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

The aim of this study is to conduct a parametric evaluation of courtyard design variants in a residential building of different climates with a focus on indoor thermal comfort and utility costs. A brute-force approach is applied to generate a wide range of design alter-natives and the simulation workflow is conducted by Grasshopper together with the environ-mental plugins Ladybug and Honeybee. The main study objective is the evaluation of the occupant thermal comfort in an air-conditioned residential building, energy load, and cost analysis, derived from different design variables including courtyard geometry, window-to -wall ratio, envelope materials, heating, and cooling set-point dead-bands, and building geographical location. Furthermore, a Deep Learning model is developed using the inputs and outputs of the simulation and analysis to transform the outcomes into the algorithmic and tangible environment feasible for predictive applications. The results suggest that regarding the thermal loads, costs, and indoor thermal comfort index (PMV), there are high correlations between the outdoor weather variation and dead-band ranges, while in extreme climates such as Singapore, courtyard spaces might not be efficient enough as expected. Finally, the highly accurate deep learning model is also developed, delivering superior predic-tive capabilities for the thermal comfort and utility costs of the courtyard designs.(c) 2022 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

As a result, snow cover is one of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) essential climate variables (ECVs). Consistent, long-term datasets of snow cover are needed to study interannual variability and snow climatology. The NASA snow-cover datasets generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are NASA Earth System Data Records (ESDR). The objective of the snow-cover detection algorithms is to optimize the accuracy of mapping snow-cover extent (SCE) and to minimize snow-cover detection errors of omission and commission using automated, globally applied algorithms to produce SCE data products. Advancements in snow-cover mapping have been made with each of the four major reprocessings of the MODIS data record, which extends from 2000 to the present. MODIS Collection 6 (C6; https://nsidc.org/data/modis/data_summaries) and VIIRS Collection 1 (C1; https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP10.001) represent the state-of-the-art global snow-cover mapping algorithms and products for NASA Earth science. There were many revisions made in the C6 algorithms which improved snow-cover detection accuracy and information content of the data products. These improvements have also been incorporated into the NASA VIIRS snow-cover algorithms for C1. Both information content and usability were improved by including the Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) and a quality assurance (QA) data array of algorithm processing flags in the data product, along with the SCE map. The increased data content allows flexibility in using the datasets for specific regions and end-user applications. Though there are important differences between the MODIS and VIIRS instruments (e.g., the VIIRS 375m native resolution compared to MODIS 500 m), the snow detection algorithms and data products are designed to be as similar as possible so that the 16+ year MODIS ESDR of global SCE can be extended into the future with the S-NPP VIIRS snow products and with products from future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) platforms. These NASA datasets are archived and accessible through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.","[Riggs, George A.] SSAI Inc, 10210 Greenbelt Rd,Suite 600, Lanham, MD 20706 USA; [Hall, Dorothy K.; Roman, Miguel O.] NASA, GSFC, Terr Informat Lab, Code 619, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Hall, Dorothy K.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Michigan State University,"Riggs, GA (corresponding author), SSAI Inc, 10210 Greenbelt Rd,Suite 600, Lanham, MD 20706 USA.",george.a.riggs@nasa.gov,"Hall, Dorothy/D-5562-2012",,,,,,62,62,62,2,36,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

Since climate projections include biases, bias correction is widely used to adjust meteorological elements, such as the atmospheric temperature and precipitation, but less attention has been paid to biases in humidity. Hence, in many cases, uncorrected humidity data have been directly used to analyze the impact of future climate change. In this study, we examined how the biases remaining in the humidity data of five GCMs propagate into the estimation of irrigation water demand and consumption from rivers using the global hydrological model (GHM) H08. First, to determine the effects of humidity bias across GCMs, we ran H08 with GCM-based meteorological forcing data sets distributed by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). A state-of-the-art bias correction method was applied to the data sets without correcting biases in humidity. Differences in the monthly relative humidity amounted to 11.7 to 20.4% RH (percentage relative humidity) across the GCMs and propagated into differences in the estimated irrigation water demand, resulting in a range between 1152.6 and 1435.5 km(3) yr(-1) for 1971-2000. Differences in humidity also propagated into future projections. Second, sensitivity analysis with hypothetical humidity biases of +/- 5% RH added homogeneously worldwide revealed the large negative sensitivity of irrigation water abstraction in India and East China, which are heavily irrigated. Third, we performed another set of simulations with bias-corrected humidity data to examine whether bias correction of the humidity can reduce uncertainties in irrigation water across the GCMs. The results showed that bias correction, even with a primitive methodology that only adjusts the monthly climatological relative humidity, helped reduce uncertainties across the GCMs: by using bias-corrected humidity data, the uncertainty ranges of irrigation water demand across the five GCMs were successfully reduced from 282.9 to 167.0 km(3) yr(-1) for the present period, and from 381.1 to 214.8 km(3) yr(-1) for the future period (RCP8.5, 2070-2099). Although different GHMs have different sensitivities to atmospheric humidity because different types of potential evapotranspiration formulae are implemented in them, bias correction of the humidity should be applied to forcing data, particularly for the evaluation of evapotranspiration and irrigation water.","[Masaki, Y.; Hanasaki, N.; Takahashi, K.; Hijioka, Y.] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Masaki, Y (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",masaki.yoshimitsu@nies.go.jp,"Hijioka, Yasuaki/AAQ-7586-2020; TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/AAD-5992-2019; Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009","TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/0000-0002-0163-545X; Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-10]","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","We acknowledge S.

Using a state-of-the-art satellite product and regional atmospheric model, the well-defined diurnal cycle is detected around Lake Malawi with harmonic and principle component analyses: the precipitation is intense during midnight to morning over Lake Malawi and the precipitation peaks in the daytime over the surrounding area. This diurnal cycle in the precipitation around the lake is associated with the lake-land breeze circulation. Comparisons between the benchmark simulation and an idealized simulation in which Lake Malawi is removed reveal that the diurnal variations in precipitation are substantially amplified by the presence of Lake Malawi. This is most evident over the lake and surrounding coastal regions. Lake Malawi also enhances the lake-land breeze circulation; the nocturnal lakeward land breeze generates surface convergence effectively and precipitation intensifies over the lake. Conversely, the daytime landward lake breeze generates the intense divergence over the lake and precipitation is strongly depressed over the lake. The lake-land breeze and the background vapour enriched by Lake Malawi drive primarily a diurnal variation in the surface moisture flux divergence/convergence over the lake and surrounding area which contributes to the diurnal cycle of precipitation in this region.","[Koseki, Shunya] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Mooney, Priscilla A.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bergen, Norway",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE),"Koseki, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway.",shunya.koseki@gfi.uib.no,,"Mooney, Priscilla/0000-0001-5921-3105; Koseki, Shunya/0000-0001-7205-7434","Norwegian High-Performance Computing Program resources [NN9039K, NS9039K, NN9385K, NS9207k]; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7/2007-2013) PREFACE [603521]; ERC STERCP project [648982]; Research Council of Norway [268243, 233680/E10]",Norwegian High-Performance Computing Program resources; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7/2007-2013) PREFACE; ERC STERCP project; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The authors greatly appreciate two reviewers, Ryan Teuling and Femke Jansen at Wageningen University, for their quite constructive and useful comments on the manuscript.

This article offers a detailed description of the country's desal experience with a focus on the associated energy requirements, environmental policies and perspectives of decision makers. Israel's desalination plants are arguably the most energy-efficient in the world. The present consensus among government engineers, however, is that meaningful improvements in energy efficiency are unlikely in the foreseeable future. Official evaluations of increased introduction of solar-driven reverse osmosis (RO) processes concluded that mitigation of greenhouse gases will have to be attained in industries other than the water sector. The article details myriad environmental benefits that desalination has brought the country.

Having the form of semitransparent plates, LSCs offer a high degree of flexibility and can be used as windows or facades, as part of the of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) industry. Existing performance characterizations of LSC devices focus almost exclusively on electric power generation. However, when used as window components, the transmitted spectrum can alter the color, potentially affecting the visual comfort of the occupants by altering the properties of the sunlight. In this study, eight different state-of-the-art nanocrystals are evaluated as potential candidates for LSC window luminophores, using Monte Carlo simulations. The transparency of each LSC window varies between 90% and 50%, and the color-rendering properties are assessed with respect to the color rendering index (CRI) and the correlated color temperature (CCT). It is found that luminophores with a wide absorption bandwidth in the visible spectrum can maintain a high CRI value (above 85) and CCT values close to the Planckian locus, even for high luminophore concentrations. In contrast, luminophores that only absorb partly in the visible spectrum suffer from color distortion, a situation characterized by low CCT and CRI values, even at high transmittance.","[Moraitis, Panagiotis; van Leeuwen, Gijs; van Sark, Wilfried] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Moraitis, P (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.moraitis@uu.nl; g.e.vanleeuwen2@students.uu.nl; W.G.J.H.M.vanSark@uu.nl,"van Sark, Wilfried G.J.H.M./C-5009-2009","van Sark, Wilfried G.J.H.M./0000-0002-4738-1088; Moraitis, Panagiotis/0000-0003-0977-0653",Climate-KIC via the project Console; TKI-Urban Energy via the project Trapeze,Climate-KIC via the project Console; TKI-Urban Energy via the project Trapeze,"This project is financially supported by Climate-KIC via the project Console, and by TKI-Urban Energy via the project Trapeze.",,55,7,7,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1944,,,MATERIALS,Materials,16-Mar,2019,6,,,,,,885,10.3390/ma12060885,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12060885,,,22,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,HT1YV,30884811,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000464361300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Study purposes were to investigate goal orientation change across the semester, associations of goal change with achievement and self-regulation, and associations of classroom climate with goal change. Participants were 175 students from college introductory computer science courses. MANOVA identified significant during semester decreases for all goal orientations except task-avoid (Wilks' lambda=.724, F (6, 169.00)=10.71, p<.001, partial Eta(2)=.276). No differences in goal orientation change were found for gender, year in college, or course. Goal orientation change significantly predicted students' course grades, retention of CS content, and strategic self-regulation. Classroom climate significantly predicted goal orientation change. Results indicate that students began the semester with positive goal orientations, but shifted in negative directions over the semester. In college STEM classes, the primary motivational issue may not be motivating students' to initially set learning-and task-approach goals, but rather motivating them to maintain their initial positive goals. Perceptions of course affect and teacher directedness predicted students' goal shifts, suggesting potential avenues for intervention by educators.","[Hazley, Melissa Patterson; Shell, Duane F.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Educ Psychol, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Soh, Leen-Kiat; Miller, L.

As our recognition of the possible impacts increases, so does the need for more comprehensive model-based approaches to better assess long term impacts and plan precautionary interventions. Such models need to he integrated embracing both the morphological subsystem and the ecological subsystem, and their interactions in the coastal zone. By explicitly considering the need for integration between different disciplines, this paper briefly describes possible approaches to modelling long-term dynamics of coastal morphology, particularly the modelling of coastal evolution in the typical situation: limited data and limited process knowledge, and further complicated by the variability of the coastal space cover and coastal space use. It is argued that progress in long-term modelling of coastal morphology will be further stimulated by adopting a conceptual framework which can embrace all the data, information, knowledge and experience concerning the coastal system of interest, whatever form they have. The objective can be accomplished by using a top-down modelling conceptual approach which helps to formalise knowledge and experience concerning the coastal area and integrate all the available data, information and models, including qualitative understanding. Qualitative modelling, which defines tendencies of evolution, offers an important tool for this goal. The overall approach lends itself to being structured into a model-based Decision Support System (DSS), coupled with Geographic Information System (GIS) technology which represent the state-of-the-art of decision support tools in the environmental field.","Tecnomare SPA, R&D Environm, I-30124 Venice, Italy; Univ Twente, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, Enfield EN3 4SF, Middx, England; Delft Univ Technol, Netherlands Ctr Coastal Res, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; Delft Hydraul, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands",University of Twente; Middlesex University; Delft University of Technology,"Capobianco, M (corresponding author), Tecnomare SPA, R&D Environm, San Marco 3584, I-30124 Venice, Italy.",,"Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010","Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Stive, Marcel/0000-0002-9820-6351; Capobianco, Michele/0000-0002-1573-7879",,,,,68,33,34,0,10,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0749-0208,,,J COASTAL RES,J.

However, a key issue that will affect this trend is sustainability of bioenergy. There have been many studies on this topic but mainly focusing on only one or two-dimensions of the issue and also with much of the literature directed at studies of European regions. To help understand the wider scope of bioenergy sustainability, this paper reviews a broad range of current research on the topic and places the literature into a multi-dimensional framework covering the economic, environmental and ecological, social and land-related aspects of bioenergy sustainability, as well as a geographical analysis of the areas for which the studies have been carried out. The review indicates that it is hard to draw an overall conclusion on the sustainability of bioenergy because of limited studies or contradictory results in some respects. In addition, this review shows that crop-based bioenergy and forest bioenergy are seen as the main sources of bioenergy and that most studies discuss the final utilization of bioenergy as being for electricity generation. Finally, research directions for future study are suggested, based on the literature reviewed here.","[Wang, Jianliang; Yang, Yuru; Geng, Xu] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Bentley, Yongmei] Univ Bedfordshire, Business Sch, Luton LU1 3JU, Beds, England; [Liu, Xiaojie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; University of Bedfordshire; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Wang, JL (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",wangjianliang@cup.edu.cn; sunyyr@126.com; Yongmei.Bentley@beds.ac.uk; ggjjeric@126.com; strawberry_lxj@163.com,"Wang, Jianliang/D-9149-2019","Wang, Jianliang/0000-0001-7037-9368","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503264]; Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [15YJC630121, 13YJC790112]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71503264) and Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant number 15YJC630121, 13YJC790112).",,103,9,9,9,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,8,,,,,,2739,10.3390/su10082739,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10082739,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000446767700155,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, it is only in the last few decades that concerted efforts have been made to understand and predict ice-jam occurrence and severity. Building on a 1990s state of the art review, new physical knowledge, prediction capabilities, and management methods are discussed herein. The thickness and hydraulic roughness of ice jams have been elucidated, and flow through ice-jam voids quantified. Under-ice transport of frazil ice, which can lead to enormous freezeup accumulations, has been placed on a more rigorous footing, while heat exchange with the water flowing under a jam can be predicted with some confidence. Systematic field measurements have produced new understanding of the waves that are generated by ice-jam releases. Increased understanding of the physical processes has enhanced confidence in older numerical models and motivated development of more sophisticated ones, leading to two-dimensional dynamic algorithms based on continuum as well as discrete element approaches. Ice-jam management and control continue to be difficult tasks, but new structural and non-structural techniques offer promising avenues, at least in the case of relatively small rivers. The emerging issue of climate change and the growing appreciation of related ecological linkages have led to important, but still few, insights on how ice jamming regimes can be modified by altered climatic conditions and what the repercussions might be on river ecology. Despite the progress, there are still major unknowns, particularly related to the conditions of formation and release of ice jams.

It is considered an appropriate solution not only for renovation of existing buildings but also for new buildings. The influence of ventilated facades in buildings is a constantly current issue in research always concluding the importance of the envelope in the reduction of energy needs in the whole building, and the importance of an accuracy model for the deep knowledge of the facade performance. Currently, the main interest in OVFs is their ability to reduce cooling thermal loads in Southern European locations. Although reference literature recognizes energy savings associated to the use of OVFs in comparison with traditional solutions, previous energy studies consider a limited number of locations and standard solutions. Trying to fill in an existing gap, this article includes information from different studies carried out in recent years which address the thermal and energy performance of OVFs. It also explains the implications of both external ambient conditions and design decision (external layer material, joints, air cavity width...) in terms of the energy and thermal performance of OVFs.

In Europe, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), intended to lead to a 'good environmental status' of the marine waters, requires indicators of the status of the marine environment that also respond to manageable anthropogenic pressures. Identifying such relationships to pressures is particularly challenging for food-web indicators, as they need to be disentangled from linkages between indicators of different functional groups caused by species interactions. Still, such linkages have not been handled in the indicator development. Here we used multivariate autoregressive time series models to identify how fish indicators in an exploited food-web relate to fishing, climate and eutrophication, while accounting for the linkages between indicators caused by species interactions. We assembled 31-year long time series of indicators of key functional groups of fish in the Central Baltic Sea pelagic food-web, which is characterized by strong trophic links between cod (Gadus morhua) and its main fish prey sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harengus). These food-web indicators were either abundance-based indicators of key piscivores (cod) and zooplanktivores (sprat and herring) or size-based indicators of the corresponding trophic groups (biomass of large predatory fish (cod >= 38 cm) and biomass of small prey fish (sprat and herring <10 cm)). Comparative analyses of models with and without linkages among indicators showed that for both types of indicators, linkages corresponding to predator-prey feedbacks and intra-specific density-dependence were essential to explain temporal variation in the indicators. Thus, no indicator-pressure relationships could be found that explained the indicators' variation unless such linkages were accounted for. When accounting for these, we found that the indicators overall respond to multiple pressures acting simultaneously rather than to single pressures, as no pressure alone could explain how the indicators developed over time. The manageable pressures fishing and eutrophication, as well as the prevailing hydrological conditions influenced by climate, were all needed to reproduce the inter-annual changes in these food-web indicators combined, although individual relationships differed between the indicators. We conclude that our innovative indicator-testing framework can therefore be used to identify responses of food-web indicators to manageable pressures while accounting for the biotic interactions in food-webs linking such indicators.

Here it is shown that HiGEM, a high-resolution GCM, simulates a very realistic MJO with approximately the correct spatial and temporal scale. Many MJO studies in GCMs are limited to diagnostics which average over a latitude band around the equator, allowing an analysis of the MJO's structure in time and longitude only. In this study a wider range of diagnostics is applied. It is argued that such an approach is necessary for a comprehensive analysis of a model's MJO. The standard analysis of Wheeler and Hendon (Mon Wea Rev 132(8):1917-1932, 2004; WH04) is applied to produce composites, which show a realistic spatial structure in the MJO envelopes but for the timing of the peak precipitation in the inter-tropical convergence zone, which bifurcates the MJO signal. Further diagnostics are developed to analyse the MJO's episodic nature and the MJO inertia (the tendency to remain in the same WH04 phase from one day to the next). HiGEM favours phases 2, 3, 6 and 7; has too much MJO inertia; and dies out too frequently in phase 3. Recent research has shown that a key feature of the MJO is its interaction with the diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent. This interaction is present in HiGEM but is unrealistically weak.","[Peatman, Simon C.; Matthews, Adrian J.; Stevens, David P.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Math, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Matthews, Adrian J.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Peatman, SC (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Math, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.peatman@reading.ac.uk,"Stevens, David/F-2509-2010; Matthews, Adrian J/A-6444-2011; Peatman, Simon/C-8071-2012","Stevens, David/0000-0002-7283-4405; Matthews, Adrian J/0000-0003-0492-1168; Peatman, Simon/0000-0002-2511-7649",NERC [NE/I528285/1]; Research Computing Service at the University of East Anglia; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I012419/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I012419/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Research Computing Service at the University of East Anglia; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"GLOBE topography data were downloaded from the web site of the NOAA-NGDC (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo); TRMM 3B42HQ precipitation data from NASA-Goddard (http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov); and WH04 EOFs from the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research (http://www.cawcr.gov.au/staff/mwheeler/maproom).

Biome-BGC and MOD17 are validated using the long-term measurement results from Hegyhatsal tall tower site (Western Hungary). After a simple bias correction, it was found that Biome-BGC is capable to describe the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of Hungarian arable lands. The model is used to estimate the net primary production (NPP) and the net biome production (NBP) in the vicinity of the tall tower for the period of 1997-2008. The validation of MOD17 shows that the model is suitable to describe the gross primary production (GPP) of arable lands, although the model has limitations in years with higher precipitation amount. Introducing a new method MOD17 is downscaled to 250 m resolution, which is close to the size of agricultural parcels in the region. The downscaling helps us to better understand the biogeochemical processes of individual parcels with different crop cultivars. The DNDC model is parameterized using country-specific fertilizer input and climate data to provide estimates of the N2O and CH4 emissions for different crop cultivars. Sensitivity analysis was performed to find the most important parameters needed for accurate emission estimation. The results show that N2O emission is highly variable for the different crop types, and it has significant contribution to the GHG balance of arable lands. Methane has bidirectional fluxes and arable lands were generally net sinks of CH4 in the study period (2002-2004).","[Grosz, Balazs] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Gen & Inorgan Chem, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Pasztor, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Machon, Attila] Szent Istvan Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Physiol, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary; [Haszpra, Laszlo; Hidy, Dora; Horvath, Laszlo; Machon, Attila] Hungarian Meteorol Serv, H-1675 Budapest, Hungary; [Churkina, Galina] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Gelybo, Gyorgyi; Kern, Aniko; Bareza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Kljun, Natascha] Univ Coll Swansea, Dept Geog, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Machon, Attila] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Machon, Attila] Szent Istvan Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Physiol, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary; [Kern, Aniko] Hungarian Acad Sci, Adaptat Climate Change Res Grp, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Agricultural Research; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Eotvos Lorand University; Swansea University; Eotvos Lorand University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"Grosz, B (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Gen & Inorgan Chem, Pazmany Ps 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",grosz@mail.datanet.hu,"Kljun, Natascha/AAR-3629-2021; Barcza, Zolt√°n/G-3880-2014; Grosz, Balazs/AFT-1500-2022; Kern, Anik√≥/M-8361-2014; Kljun, Natascha/B-8467-2008; P√°sztor, L√°szl√≥/B-3270-2014","Kljun, Natascha/0000-0001-9650-2184; Barcza, Zolt√°n/0000-0002-1278-0636; Kern, Anik√≥/0000-0002-3504-1668; Kljun, Natascha/0000-0001-9650-2184; P√°sztor, L√°szl√≥/0000-0002-1605-4412; Haszpra, Laszlo/0000-0002-7747-6475; Churkina, Galina/0000-0002-5895-7425",,,,,38,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-90-481-9949-5,,,,2011,,,,,263,293,,10.1007/978-90-481-9950-1_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9950-1_12,10.1007/978-90-481-9950-1,,31,Environmental Sciences,Book Citation Index ‚Äì Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BSE79,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000284291300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

A major source of global and regional sea level data is satellite radar altimetry, which relies on precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit. Here, we assess the error budget of the radial orbit component for the TOPEX/Poseidon mission for the period 1993 to 2004 from a set of different orbit solutions. The errors for seasonal, interannual (5-year), and decadal periods are estimated on global and regional scales based on radial orbit differences from three state-of-the-art orbit solutions provided by different research teams: the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), the Groupe de Recherche de Geodesie Spatiale (GRGS), and the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The global mean sea level error related to orbit uncertainties is of the order of 1 mm (8% of the global mean sea level variability) with negligible contributions on the annual and decadal timescales. In contrast, the orbit-related error of the interannual trend is 0.1 mmyr(-1) (27% of the corresponding sea level variability) and might hamper the estimation of an acceleration of the global mean sea level rise. For regional scales, the gridded orbit-related error is up to 11 mm, and for about half the ocean the orbit error accounts for at least 10% of the observed sea level variability. The seasonal orbit error amounts to 10% of the observed seasonal sea level signal in the Southern Ocean. At interannual and decadal timescales, the orbit-related trend uncertainties reach regionally more than 1 mmyr(-1). The interannual trend errors account for 10% of the observed sea level signal in the tropical Atlantic and the south-eastern Pacific. For decadal scales, the orbit-related trend errors are prominent in a several regions including the South Atlantic, western North Atlantic, central Pacific, South Australian Basin, and the Mediterranean Sea. Based on a set of test orbits calculated at GFZ, the sources of the observed orbit-related errors are further investigated. The main contributors on all timescales are uncertainties in Earth's time-variable gravity field models and on annual to interannual timescales discrepancies of the tracking station subnetworks, i.e. satellite laser ranging (SLR) and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS).","[Esselborn, Saskia; Rudenko, Sergei; Schoene, Tilo] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Dept Geodesy 1, Potsdam, Germany; [Rudenko, Sergei] Tech Univ Munich, Deutsch Geodat Forschungsinst DGFI TUM, Munich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Technical University of Munich,"Esselborn, S (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Dept Geodesy 1, Potsdam, Germany.",saskia.esselborn@gfz-potsdam.de,"Esselborn, Saskia/N-9099-2019; Esselborn, Saskia/I-8412-2016; Sch√∂ne, Tilo/C-7403-2019; Rudenko, Sergei/H-4478-2017","Esselborn, Saskia/0000-0002-1924-4449; Esselborn, Saskia/0000-0002-1924-4449; Sch√∂ne, Tilo/0000-0003-4118-9578; Rudenko, Sergei/0000-0001-5149-3827",European Space Agency (ESA) within the Climate Change Initiative Sea Level (SLCCI) Phase II project; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grant CoRSEA as part of the Special Priority Programme [1889]; International Office of the BMBF [01DO17017],European Space Agency (ESA) within the Climate Change Initiative Sea Level (SLCCI) Phase II project; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grant CoRSEA as part of the Special Priority Programme; International Office of the BMBF,"We are grateful for the insightful comments of the reviewers Nikita Zelensky and John Huthnance which helped to improve the manuscript substantially.

Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with interactive fire modeling provide important estimates for long-term and large-scale changes in fire emissions. Here we present the first multi-model estimates of global gridded historical fire emissions for 1700-2012, including carbon and 33 species of trace gases and aerosols. The dataset is based on simulations of nine DGVMs with different state-of-the-art global fire models that participated in the Fire Modeling Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), using the same and standardized protocols and forcing data, and the most up-to-date fire emission factor table based on field and laboratory studies in various land cover types. We evaluate the simulations of present-day fire emissions by comparing them with satellite-based products. The evaluation results show that most DGVMs simulate present-day global fire emission totals within the range of satellite-based products. They can capture the high emissions over the tropical savannas and low emissions over the arid and sparsely vegetated regions, and the main features of seasonality. However, most models fail to simulate the interannual variability, partly due to a lack of modeling peat fires and tropical deforestation fires. Before the 1850s, all models show only a weak trend in global fire emissions, which is consistent with the multi-source merged historical reconstructions used as input data for CMIP6. On the other hand, the trends are quite different among DGVMs for the 20th century, with some models showing an increase and others a decrease in fire emissions, mainly as a result of the discrepancy in their simulated responses to human population density change and land use and land cover change (LULCC). Our study provides an important dataset for further development of regional and global multi-source merged historical reconstructions, analyses of the historical changes in fire emissions and their uncertainties, and quantification of the role of fire emissions in the Earth system. It also highlights the importance of accurately modeling the responses of fire emissions to LULCC and population density change in reducing uncertainties in historical reconstructions of fire emissions and providing more reliable future projections.","[Li, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China;

Promoting whole building strategies that employ passive measures together with energy efficient systems and technologies using renewable energy became a European political strategy following the publication of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive recast in May 2010 by the European Parliament and Council. However designing successful NZEBs represents a challenge because the definitions are somewhat generic while assessment methods and monitoring approaches remain under development and the literature is relatively scarce about the best sets of solutions for different typologies and climates likely to deliver an actual and reliable performance in terms of energy balance (consumed vs generated) on a cost-effective basis. Additionally the lessons learned from existing NZEB examples are relatively scarce. The authors of this paper, who are participants in the IEA SHC Task 40-ECBCS Annex 52, Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings, are willing to share insights from on-going research work on some best practice leading NZEB residential buildings. Although there is no standard approach for designing a Net Zero-Energy Building (there are many different possible combinations of passive and efficient active measures, utility equipment and on-site energy generation technologies able to achieve the net-zero energy performance), a close examination of the chosen strategies and the relative performance indicators of the selected case studies reveal that it is possible to achieve zero-energy performance using well known strategies adjusted so as to balance climate driven-demand for space heating/cooling, lighting, ventilation and other energy uses with climate-driven supply from renewable energy resources.","[Aelenei, Laura; Goncalves, Helder] LNEG, P-1649038 Lisbon, Portugal; [Aelenei, Daniel] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Sci & Technol, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Musall, Eike] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany; [Noguchi, Massa] Glasgow Sch Art, MEARU ZEMCH R&D Grp, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Laboratorio Nacional de Energia e Geologia IP (LNEG); Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Wuppertal; Glasgow School of Art,"Aelenei, L (corresponding author), LNEG, Estr Paco do Lumiar,22 Edificio G-2023, P-1649038 Lisbon, Portugal.",laura.aelenei@lneg.pt; aelenei@fct.unl.pt; helder.goncalves@lneg.pt; roberto.lollini@eurac.edu; emusall@uni-wuppertal.de; alessandra.scognamiglio@enea.it; ecubi@irec.cat; m.noguchi@gsa.ac.uk,"Aelenei, Laura/I-1704-2012; Noguchi, Masa/V-4471-2019; FCT/UNL, UNIC/F-8324-2014; Lollini, Roberto/V-6092-2018","Aelenei, Laura/0000-0002-9140-4953; Noguchi, Masa/0000-0003-1437-5455; Aelenei, Daniel/0000-0002-1007-1756; Goncalves, Helder/0000-0002-7350-263X; Scognamiglio, Alessandra/0000-0002-9816-4016; Cubi, Eduard/0000-0002-7281-5909; FCT/UNL, UNIC/0000-0002-1310-025X; Lollini, Roberto/0000-0003-0480-1166",,,,,10,20,20,5,61,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,SEP,2013,3,,,,7,14,,,,,,8,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,198OX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000322933300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

By labeling a novel instance in at least one abstract category, more informed decisions can be made by an automated driving (AD) function, resulting in a safer behavior in novel situations. Current approaches are mainly composed of different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Capsule Networks (CNs) were introduced as an alternative to CNNs that expand their capacity in tasks that were previously challenging. We explore the hierarchical nature of CNs and propose a novel approach for hierarchical novelty detection using a unified CN architecture. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate it on a novelty detection task based on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. We define a misclassification matrix for evaluation of the performance based on a semantically sensible scenario for this dataset. The results show that our method outperforms the main CNN-based methods in the current literature in this task while also giving more flexibility for task-specific tuning and has the potential to reach state-of-the-art status in more complex HND use cases within the AD domain.","[de Graaff, Thies; de Menezes, Arthur Ribeiro] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Oldenburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"de Graaff, T (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Oldenburg, Germany.",thies.degraaff@dlr.de; arthur.ribeirodemenezes@dlr.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Actionwithin the project KI Delta Learning,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Actionwithin the project KI Delta Learning,The research leading to these results is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Actionwithin the project KI Delta Learning.,,39,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1931-0587,,978-1-6654-8821-1,IEEE INT VEH SYM,,,2022,,,,,1795,1800,,10.1109/IV51971.2022.9827249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IV51971.2022.9827249,,,6,Automation & Control Systems; Transportation Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Transportation,BT8NW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000854106700254,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this kind of information is scarce for emerging post-lithium systems such as the magnesium-sulfur (MgS) battery. Therefore, we use life cycle assessment following a cradle-to-gate perspective to quantify the cumulative energy demand and potential environmental impacts per Wh of the storage capacity of a hypothetical MgS battery (46 Wh/kg). Furthermore, we also estimate global warming potential (0.33 kg CO2 eq/Wh) , fossil depletion potential (0.09 kg oil eq / Wh), ozone depletion potential (2.5E08 kg CFC-11/Wh) and metal depletion potential (0.044 kg Fe eq/Wh), associated with the MgS battery production. The battery is modelled based on an existing prototype MgS pouch cell and hypothetically optimised according to the current state of the art in lithium-ion batteries (LIB), exploring future improvement potentials. It turns out that the initial (non-optimised) prototype cell cannot compete with current LIB in terms of energy density or environmental performance, mainly due to the high share of non-active components, decreasing its performance substantially. Therefore, if the assumed evolutions of the MgS cell composition are achieved to overcome current design hurdles and reach a comparable lifespan, efficiency, cost and safety levels to that of existing LIB; then the MgS battery has significant potential to outperform both existing LIB, and lithium-sulfur batteries.","[Montenegro, Claudia Tomasini; Zhao-Karger, Zhirong; Weil, Marcel] Helmholtz Inst Ulm Electrochem Energy Storage HIU, Ulm, Germany; [Peters, Jens F.] Univ Alcala UAH, Fac Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Baumann, Manuel; Weil, Marcel] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Technol Assessment & Syst Anal ITAS, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Wolter, Christopher] Custom Cells Itzehoe GmbH, Fraunhoferstr 1b, Itzehoe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Universidad de Alcala; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Weil, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Inst Ulm Electrochem Energy Storage HIU, Ulm, Germany.;Weil, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Technol Assessment & Syst Anal ITAS, Karlsruhe, Germany.",marcel.weil@kit.edu,"Baumann, Manuel/ABB-6245-2020","Baumann, Manuel/0000-0002-8374-4624; Weil, Marcel/0000-0003-0151-9990",German Research Foundation (DFG) (POLiS Cluster of Excellence) [390874152]; Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association [ExNet-0035]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [754382],German Research Foundation (DFG) (POLiS Cluster of Excellence)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme,"This work contributes to the research performed at CELEST (Center for Electrochemical Energy Storage Ulm-Karlsruhe) and was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under Project ID 390874152 (POLiS Cluster of Excellence), and was financially supported by the Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association within the Network of Excellence on post-Lithium batteries (ExNet-0035).

When the world is about to suffocate out of masses of products, materials, waste and garbage we all have to concentrate to the task which is essential for the global surviving campaign. There are many ways to do ecological deeds but for a clothing designer the task may be even harder than for many others. When I studied and started my career as clothing designer in the seventies, the world was different from now. Today designers have to face the problems of globalisation and climate change in their everyday-life but also in profession and these dilemmas challenge their skills and values in interesting but also very hard way. How do we answer to the challenges? Is clothing design, designing new clothes even acceptable among those bigger problems of the world? How contradictory is it to follow new trends, make efforts to market new products, design products which should be selling well? What is the responsibility of a designer in this circle? As a designer, as teacher of clothing design and researcher of clothing design I want to reassure myself and my students as well as the fellow researchers about the solid ground and reasons to do valuable and sustainable design work. As a northern, Scandinavian designer I have a good knowledge and heritage of the idea of functional clothing and research of user-based and practice-based clothing design. In addition as I'm working in the far North, Lapland I feel that I have the opportunity and responsibility to think locally, I believe in northern values, needs and traditions, knowledge of the northern arctic climate and environment, which are on the other half a challenge but also a great possibility. In this contribution I will represent some ways for designer to model his or her responsibility into an effective and yet sustainable way of design. I will represent a theoretical model for sustainable design know-how. In University of Lapland, Department of Textile and Clothing Design, in a Pilot-project of Clothing, two important lines of research were realized in 2007: researching the possibilities to design customized clothing for disabled groups and a research-study of ecological and recycled materials and their use for clothing concepts. These projects represent well the responsible design.","Univ Lapland, Fac Art & Design, Dept Text & Clothing Design, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland",University of Lapland,"Heikkila-Rastas, M (corresponding author), Univ Lapland, Fac Art & Design, Dept Text & Clothing Design, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland.",marjatta.heikkila-rastas@ulapland.fi,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,8,"UNIV ZAGREB, FAC TEXTILE TECH",ZAGREB,"PO BOX 818, PRILAZ BARUNA FILIPOVICA 28A, ZAGREB, HR-10 000, CROATIA",,,978-953-7105-26-6,,,,2008,,,,,963,968,,,,,,6,"Materials Science, Textiles",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science,BIT89,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000262707700170,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we performed an evapotranspiration-based (ET-based) assessment of agricultural droughts in Uganda where drought has usually been assessed with precipitation deficiency. The land-surface ET and evaporative demand were estimated with a state-of-the-art complementary principle across the country under poor ET data availability. Using the ET estimates, the Standardized Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) was quantified to assess agricultural droughts for 1984-2017. The ET-based drought assessment was compared with conventional precipitation-based analyses using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in respect of severity, areal extent, and temporal trends. Results showed that the complementary principle provided acceptable performance in reproducing interpolated latent flux observations. SPI and SEDI were strongly correlated, and thus yielded identical temporal variations of mean drought severity and areal extent. The trend maps of SPI and SEDI also tended to agree, and indicate that central and northwestern Uganda would face increasing drought risks in the future. The declining precipitation in Uganda has been attributed to rising surface temperatures of the Indian Ocean, and is expected to persist up to the next decade. This study suggests that droughts in major croplands could be often accompanied by high heat-wave temperatures in Uganda due to strong land-atmosphere coupling, and thus mortality risks in ecosystems could increase together with water stress.","[Kyatengerwa, Christelle; Choi, Minha] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Water Resources, Suwon 16419, Gyeonggido, South Korea; [Kim, Daeha] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Analyt Dept, Busan 48058, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, D (corresponding author), APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Analyt Dept, Busan 48058, South Korea.",d.kim@apcc21.org,"Choi, Minha/ABH-7266-2020",,Korea International Cooperation Agency; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2019R1A2B5B01070196],Korea International Cooperation Agency; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT),We would like to acknowledge the sponsorship of the Korea International Cooperation Agency for this research.

From this climate of experimentation with foreign cultures arose a morally detached spectator and a critique of Eurocentrism in the era of Captain Cook and the American Revolution. Fuseli's classicism thus played its part in the formation of the modern liberal version of cultural pluralism.","Univ Basel, Kunsthistor Seminar, CH-4010 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Pop, A (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Kunsthistor Seminar, St Alban Graben 8, CH-4010 Basel, Switzerland.",apop@post.harvard.edu,,,,,,,145,3,3,0,2,COLL ART ASSOC,NEW YORK,"50 BROADWAY, 21ST FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10004 USA",0004-3079,,,ART BULL,Art Bull.,MAR,2012,1,,,,78,98,,10.1080/00043079.2012.10786030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00043079.2012.10786030,,,21,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,905XP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000301309800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The automation of such systems is challenging because reference trajectories and states of the manipulator are not fully measurable for the automation. To overcome this, the so-called limited information shared controller (LISC) is proposed in earlier works. The benefit of the LISC is that even if the manipulator's reference velocity is not measurable or observable, the automation can still support the operator in his/her tasks with the manipulator. In this paper, we apply the concept of LISC for the longitudinal guidance of the vehicle. Furthermore, a study is carried out on a real-time test bench, in which the test-subjects compared the proposed longitudinal guidance with a state-of-the-art solution. The results show that the proposed concept can help the operator to carry out his/her task faster and more efficiently.

It aims to acquire summarized information on the state-of-the-art in the field of valuation of and compensation for non-market forest goods and services in the Baltic States as well as on the perceived potential developments in this field in the future. This study is a part of a larger research exercise commissioned by the European Commission and carried out in the 27 Member States of the European Union in 2008. First, based on literature review, we provide a brief overview of theoretical aspects of classification of financing mechanisms. Then, using survey we acquired information from national forestry authorities regarding the state of forest goods and services and compensation for provision of non-market forest goods and services in the Baltic States. Finally, also using survey as well as the follow-up expert interviews we learn about the potentials for marketing of non-market forest goods and services in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Our study indicates that in the Baltic States, as well as in the EU overall, biodiversity protection, climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and water regulation functions of forests are viewed as the most important non-market forest goods and services and their importance is seen to be increasing. The results also show that so far there are only few well functioning mechanisms financing provision of non-market forest goods and services. In this context, the issue of valuation also receives very little attention. We conclude that despite the existing interest, it is quite unlikely that there would be a strong increase in the use of financing mechanisms for provision of non-market forest goods and services in a foreseeable future in the three Baltic States.","[Lazdinis, Imantas] Mykolas Romeris Univ Lithuania, Fac Strateg Management & Policy, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Mavsar, Robert] Mediterranean Reg Off EFIMED, European Forest Inst, Barcelona 08010, Spain; Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Vienna BOKU,EPI PC INNOFORCE, Dept Econ & Social Sci,Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","Mykolas Romeris University; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Lazdinis, M (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Agr & Rural Dev, Unit Bioenergy Biomass Forestry & Climate Change, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",marius@bmm.lt,,,European Communities,European Communities(European Commission),"This study has been financed by the Commission of the European Communities and produced by the consortium led by the European Forest Institute.

With a stochastic deep convection scheme implemented into two state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs), a recent study found that aerosol burdens are increased globally by reduced climatological mean wet removal of aerosols due to suppressed light rain. Motivated by their work, a novel approach is developed in this study to detect what rainfall rates are most efficient for wet removal (scavenging amount mode) of different aerosol species of different sizes in GCMs and applied to the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) with and without the stochastic convection cases. Results show that in the standard CAM5, no obvious differences in the scavenging amount mode are found among different aerosol types. However, the scavenging amount modes differ in the Aitken, accumulation and coarse modes, showing around 10-12, 8-9 and 7-8 mm d(-1), respectively, over the tropics. As latitude increases poleward, the scavenging amount mode in each aerosol mode is decreased substantially. The scavenging amount mode is generally smaller over land than over ocean. With stochastic convection, the scavenging amount mode for all aerosol species in each mode is systematically increased, which is the most prominent along the Intertropical Convergence Zone, exceeding 20 mm d(-1) for small particles. The scavenging amount modes in the two cases are both smaller than individual rainfall rates associated with the most accumulated rain (rainfall amount mode), further implying precipitation frequency is more important than precipitation intensity for aerosol wet removal. The notion of the scavenging amount mode can be applied to other GCMs to better understand the relation between rainfall and aerosol wet scavenging, which is important to better simulate aerosols.","[Wang, Yong; Xia, Wenwen] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guang J.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA",Tsinghua University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",yongw@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975126],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China grant 2017YFA0604000 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China grant 41975126.,,32,4,4,1,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

However, long operational lifespans and a multitude of treatment requirements demand thorough investigations into how resource recovery can be implemented sustainably. To aid the formulation of new legislation for phosphorus (P) recovery specifically, in 2017 we conducted a survey on Austrian WWTP-infrastructure, with a focus on P removal and sludge treatment, as well as disposal and sludge quality of all WWTPs above 2000 population equivalents (PE).

On the spatial scale typically used in terrestrial ecosystem models (0.5 or 1 ffi) changes in LUC over time periods of a few years or more can include bidirectional changes on the sub-grid level, such as the parallel expansion and abandonment of agricultural land (e. g. in shifting cultivation) or cropland-grassland conversion (and vice versa). These complex changes between classes within a grid cell have often been neglected in previous studies, and only net changes of land between natural vegetation cover, cropland and pastures accounted for, mainly because of a lack of reliable high-resolution historical information on gross land transitions, in combination with technical limitations within the models themselves. In the present study we applied a stateof- the-art dynamic global vegetation model with a detailed representation of croplands and carbon-nitrogen dynamics to quantify the uncertainty in terrestrial ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes arising from the choice between net and gross representations of LUC. We used three frequently applied global, one recent global and one recent European LUC datasets, two of which resolve gross land transitions, either in Europe or in certain tropical regions. When considering only net changes, land-use-transition uncertainties (expressed as 1 standard deviation around decadal means of four models) in global carbon emissions from LUC (E-LUC) are +/- 0.19, +/- 0.66 and +/- 0.47 PgC a(-1) in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively, or between 14 and 39% of mean E-LUC. Carbon stocks at the end of the 20th century vary by +/- 11 PgC for vegetation and +/- 37 PgC for soil C due to the choice of LUC reconstruction, i. e. around 3% of the respective C pools. Accounting for sub-grid (gross) land conversions significantly increased the effect of LUC on global and European carbon stocks and fluxes, most noticeably enhancing global cumulative E-LUC by 33 Pg C (1750-2014) and entailing a significant reduction in carbon stored in vegetation, although the effect on soil C stocks was limited. Simulations demonstrated that assessments of historical carbon stocks and fluxes are highly uncertain due to the choice of LUC reconstruction and that the consideration of different contrasting LUC reconstructions is needed to account for this uncertainty. The analysis of gross, in addition to net, land-use changes showed that the full complexity of gross land-use changes is required in order to accurately predict the magnitude of LUC change emissions. This introduces technical challenges to process-based models and relies on extensive information regarding historical land-use transitions.","[Bayer, Anita D.; Pugh, Thomas A.

With an increasing concern that climate change accelerates both snowmelt timing and rate, obtaining an accurate characterization of microbial response to snowmelt is important for understanding biogeochemical cycles intertwined with soil. However, observing microbial metabolism and its dynamics non-destructively remains a major challenge for systems such as soil. Microbial volatile compounds (mVCs) emitted from soil represent information-dense signatures and when assayed non-destructively using state-of-the-art instrumentation such as Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) provide time resolved insights into the metabolism of active microbiomes. In this study, we used PTR-TOF-MS to investigate the metabolic trajectory of microbiomes from a subalpine forest soil, and their response to a simulated wet-up event akin to snowmelt. Using an information theory approach based on the partitioning of mutual information, we identified mVC metabolite pairs with robust interactions, including those that were non-linear and with time lags. The biological context for these mVC interactions was evaluated by projecting the connections onto the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) network of known metabolic pathways. Simulated snowmelt resulted in a rapid increase in the production of trimethylamine (TMA) suggesting that anaerobic degradation of quaternary amine osmo/cryoprotectants, such as glycine betaine, may be important contributors to this resource pulse. Unique and synergistic connections between intermediates of methylotrophic pathways such as dimethylamine, formaldehyde and methanol were observed upon wet-up and indicate that the initial pulse of TMA was likely transformed into these intermediates by methylotrophs. Increases in ammonia oxidation signatures (transformation of hydroxylamine to nitrite) were observed in parallel, and while the relative role of nitrifiers or methylotrophs cannot be confirmed, the inferred connection to TMA oxidation suggests either a direct or indirect coupling between these processes. Overall, it appears that such mVC time-series from PTR-TOF-MS combined with causal inference represents an attractive approach to non-destructively observe soil microbial metabolism and its response to environmental perturbation.","[Kim, Junhyeong; Chakraborty, Romy; Jardine, Kolby; Sorensen, Patrick O.; Wang, Shi; Faybishenko, Boris; Brodie, Eoin L.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Earth & Environm Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Goldstein, Allen H.; Weber, Robert; Misztal, Pawel K.; Brodie, Eoin L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Misztal, Pawel K.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Kim, J; Brodie, EL (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Earth & Environm Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Brodie, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rlawnsgud20@berkeley.edu; elbrodie@lbl.gov,"Brodie, Eoin L/A-7853-2008; Sorensen, Patrick O./K-1401-2017; Wang, Shi/GLR-4122-2022; Faybishenko, Boris/G-3363-2015; Misztal, Pawel K/B-8371-2009","Brodie, Eoin L/0000-0002-8453-8435; Sorensen, Patrick O./0000-0002-0558-2789; Wang, Shi/0000-0002-2408-2544; Faybishenko, Boris/0000-0003-0085-8499; Misztal, Pawel K/0000-0003-1060-1750","Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; UC Berkeley Honors Program, Sponsored Projects for Undergraduate Research (SPUR); Watershed Function SFA","Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UC Berkeley Honors Program, Sponsored Projects for Undergraduate Research (SPUR); Watershed Function SFA","This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy Contract No. DEAC02-05CH11231.

It enables spatial interaction between grid features, as sampled from boxes of interest, and improves the learning capability of transformers for several vision tasks. Specifically, we present BoxeR, short for Box Transformer, which attends to a set of boxes by predicting their transformation from a reference window on an input feature map. The BoxeR computes attention weights on these boxes by considering its grid structure. Notably, BoxeR-2D naturally reasons about box information within its attention module, making it suitable for end-to-end instance detection and segmentation tasks. By learning invariance to rotation in the box-attention module, BoxeR-3D is capable of generating discriminative information from a bird's-eye view plane for 3D end-to-end object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed BoxeR-2D achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO detection and instance segmentation. Besides, BoxeR-3D improves over the end-to-end 3D object detection baseline and already obtains a compelling performance for the vehicle category of Waymo Open, without any class-specific optimization.

Three theories account for the relatively slow spread of domesticated animals into the southern latitudes between 4000 and 3000 BP. The first theory posits that arid climates hindered the dispersal of domesticated animals beyond the Lake Turkana basin until pluvial conditions set in after 3000 BP. The second theory argues that epizootic diseases were the inhibiting factors. Finally, indigenous cultural reticence to alter their primary modes of subsistence in favor of animal husbandry accords with the archaeological data from sites that date to this period. A single normative paradigm explaining the shift from a primarily foraging subsistence economy to one that relied heavily on domesticates is unlikely. This review of the current archaeological and paleoenvironmental state of knowledge finds the static frontier likely resulted from a combination of all of these factors.","Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, Coll Humanities, Seoul 151745, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Wright, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, Coll Humanities, 14-201,San 56-1,Sillim 9 Dong, Seoul 151745, South Korea.",msafiri@snu.ac.kr,"Wright, David K./H-3311-2019","Wright, David K./0000-0003-1704-0423",,,,,202,13,13,1,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0091-7710,2153-3806,,J ANTHROPOL RES,J.

Surface displacements derived from GRACE gravity field coefficient time series also should be observed in GPS coordinate time series, if both time series are sufficiently free of systematic errors. A successful validation can be an important contribution to climate change research, as the biggest contributors to mass variability in the system Earth include the movement of oceanic, atmospheric, and continental water and ice. In our analysis, we find that if the signals are larger than their precision, both geodetic sensor systems see common signals for almost all the 115 stations surveyed. Almost 80% of the stations have their signal WRMS decreased, when we subtract monthly GRACE surface displacements from those observed by GPS data. Almost all other stations are on ocean islands or small peninsulas, where the physically expected loading signals are very small. For a fair comparison, the data (79 months from September 2002 to April 2009) had to be treated appropriately: the GPS data were completely reprocessed with state-of-the-art models. We used an objective cluster analysis to identify and eliminate stations, where local effects or technical artifacts dominated the signals. In addition, it was necessary for both sets of results to be expressed in equivalent reference frames, meaning that net translations between the GPS and GRACE data sets had to be treated adequately. These data sets are then compared and statistically analyzed: we determine the stability (precision) of GRACE-derived, monthly vertical deformation data to be similar to 1.2 mm, using the data from three GRACE processing centers. We statistically analyze the mean annual signals, computed from the GPS and GRACE series. There is a detailed discussion of the results for five overall representative stations, in order to help the reader to link the displayed criteria of similarity to real data. A series of tests were performed with the goal of explaining the remaining GPS-GRACE residuals.","[Tesmer, Volker] OHB Syst AG, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Steigenberger, Peter] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Astron & Phys Geodasie, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [van Dam, Tonie] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Commun, L-1359 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Mayer-Guerr, Torsten] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",OHB SE; Technical University of Munich; University of Luxembourg; University of Bonn,"Tesmer, V (corresponding author), OHB Syst AG, Univ Allee 27-29, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",tesmer@ohb-system.de; steigenberger@bv.tum.de; tonie.vandam@uni.lu; tmg@geod.uni-bonn.de,"Mayer-G√ºrr, Torsten/C-3144-2015; Steigenberger, Peter/AAA-6862-2019","Mayer-G√ºrr, Torsten/0000-0003-2609-428X; Steigenberger, Peter/0000-0003-1905-6699",,,,,66,77,91,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0949-7714,1432-1394,,J GEODESY,J.

The causes of these temporal anomalies are yet poorly understood. Hence, highly resolved glacier reconstructions based on historical evidence can give valuable insights into past climate, but they exist only for few glaciers worldwide. Here, we present a new reconstruction of length changes for the Glacier des Bossons (Mont Blanc massif, France), based on unevaluated historical material. More than 250 pictorial documents (drawings, paintings, prints, photographs, maps) as well as written accounts have been critically analysed, leading to a revised picture of the glacier's history, especially from the mid-eighteenth century up to the 1860s. Very important are the drawings by Jean-Antoine Linck, Samuel Birmann and EugSne Viollet-le Duc, which depict meticulously the glacier's extent during the vast advance and subsequent retreat during the nineteenth century. The new glacier reconstruction extends back to AD 1580 and proves maxima of the Glacier des Bossons around 1610/1643, 1685, 1712, 1777, 1818, 1854, 1892, 1921, 1941, and 1983. The Little Ice Age maximum extent was reached in 1818. Until the present, the glacier has lost about 1.5 km in length, and it is now shorter than at any time during the reconstruction period. The Glacier des Bossons reacts faster than the nearby Mer de Glace (glacier reconstruction back to AD 1570 available). The Mont Blanc area is, together with the valley of Grindelwald in the Swiss Alps (two historical glacier reconstructions available back to AD 1535, and 1590, respectively), among the two regions that are probably best-documented in the world regarding historical glacier data.","[Nussbaumer, Samuel U.; Zumbuhl, Heinz J.] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Nussbaumer, Samuel U.; Zumbuhl, Heinz J.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Nussbaumer, Samuel U.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Zurich,"Nussbaumer, SU (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland.",samuel.nussbaumer@geo.uzh.ch,,"Nussbaumer, Samuel/0000-0002-5314-5815",Swiss National Science Foundation [200021-116354],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"The authors wish to thank H.

Despite this intense interest, there is little work focusing on how to design a sustainable FEW system that can consistently meet its food, energy, and water demands. In an effort to better understand the dynamics among the nexus, the scope of the study is limited to a small-scale FEW system that can consistently yield food for a family of four (two adults and two children) and collect or recycle its own water and supply its own energy needs through solar panels (electricity demand). In order to determine the influence of each component (i.e. food, water, or energy) on the system's output and identify the weakest link of the system (e.g. water scarcity, energy shortage, inconsistent supply of food, etc.), a quantitative modeling is used to calculate the total cost of sustainable FEW systems. The impact of each design decision variable (e.g. size of the system, water recycling capacity, solar system) on the system's output is formulated and then optimized. The model is analyzed for two different climate scenarios; a cloudy and humid scenario and sunny and arid scenario. In both scenarios, the energy component represents a large portion of the system's total cost (around 86% in the humid climate and 73% in the arid climate). This shows that innovative energy production technologies are needed to improve the sustainability of FEW systems at a reasonable cost. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to be able to link and use such heterogeneous data, spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities can play an important role in establishing interoperability between systems and platforms. Based on the open and international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) concept integrates different sensors, IoT devices, simulation tools, and 3D city models within a common operational framework. However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. Also, there are various users and applications who prefer to work with all the systems in convenient ways using Single-Sign-On. This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration.

They have the potential to play a critical role in flood risk assessment, operational response, and resilience planning, but existing models remain limited in their capability to represent integrated flooding processes in urban areas and provide the credible quantitative information needed to support risk assessment and resilience practice. Research to advance model development, facilitate intensive watershed monitoring for model parameterization and validation, and support collaboration between researchers and practitioners should be prioritized. This will represent a substantial, expensive effort, but will still be of great value as cities are faced with urgent challenges posed by climate change in coming decades.","[Rosenzweig, B.

Significant lead-lag covariance between oceanic and tropospheric variables suggests that the system supports a damped oscillatory mode involving an active ocean-atmosphere coupling, with a typical NAO-like space structure and a 5 years timescale, qualitatively consistent with a mid-latitude delayed oscillator paradigm. The two essential processes governing the oscillation are (1) a negative feedback between ocean gyre circulation and the high latitude SST meridional gradient and (2) a positive feedback between SST and the NAO. The atmospheric NAO pattern appears to have a weaker projection on the ocean meridional overturning, compared to the gyre circulation, which leads to a secondary role for the thermohaline circulation in driving the meridional heat transport, and thus the oscillatory mode.","[Bellucci, A.; Gualdi, S.; Navarra, A.] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Gualdi, S.; Scoccimarro, E.; Navarra, A.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Bellucci, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Viale A Moro 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",bellucci@bo.ingv.it,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; Scoccimarro, Enrico/AAV-6281-2020","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Scoccimarro, Enrico/0000-0001-7987-4744; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per i Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) Project; European Community [GOCECT-2003- 505539],Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per i Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) Project; European Community(European Commission),The authors wish to thank Riccardo Farneti and Annalisa Cherchi for stimulating discussions and precious support.

Dust in China is potentially influenced by the interannual climate variability associated with El Nino. Here, the impacts of El Nino with different temporal and spatial types on dust pollution in boreal winter and spring in China and the potential mechanisms are investigated using a state-of-the-art Earth system model (E3SMv1). We find that the eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) El Nino both increase wintertime dust concentrations by 5-50 mu g m-3 over central-eastern China. Due to a stronger wind and lower relative humidity, which favor dust emissions near sources, and a strengthened northwesterly and reduced precipitation, which are conducive to dust transport, dust concentrations during the CP El Nino are 5-20 mu g m-3 higher in northern China than during the EP El Nino, although the changes are mostly insignificant. El Nino with a short duration (SD) increases boreal winter dust concentrations by 20-100 mu g m-3 over northern China relative to the climatological mean, while there is a decrease of 5-50 mu g m-3 during the long-duration (LD) El Nino, which is also related to the El Nino-induced changes in atmospheric circulation, precipitation, and relative humidity. In the following spring season, all types of El Nino events enhance dust over northern China, but only the increase during the LD El Nino is statistically significant, suggesting that the weaker intensity but longer duration of the LD El Nino events can significantly affect spring dust in China. Our results contribute to the current knowledge of the influence of El Nino on dust pollution, which has profound implications for air pollution control and dust storm prediction.","[Yang, Yang; Zeng, Liangying; Wang, Pinya; Liao, Hong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm, Sch Environm Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & Po, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Liangying] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hailong] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; National University of Defense Technology - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm, Sch Environm Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & Po, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yang.yang@nuist.edu.cn,"; Wang, Hailong/B-8061-2010","Wang, Pinya/0000-0001-7034-7868; Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-1994-4402","US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling program; DOE by the Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC05-76RLO1830]","US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE by the Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","Hailong Wang acknowledges the support by the US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling program.

The PETM (similar to 56 Ma) likely represents the most dramatic and rapid event of global climate warming of the whole Cenozoic. During the PETM, temperatures at the Earth's surface probably increased by at least 5 degrees C over a few thousand years, and remained thereafter exceptionally high for over 100 k.y. Hallmark of the PETM is a negative excursion in stable carbon isotopes globally recognised that is generally interpreted as the response to a massive and sudden input of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system, which eventually gave rise to a rapid and extreme global warming. Climatic perturbations associated with the PETM were severe and affected both the marine and terrestrial domains, triggering faunal and floral turnovers and radiations, migrations and the most dramatic Cenozoic deep-sea benthic foraminiferal extinction event. Since the beginning of the 2000s, insightful contributions to this topic have been provided by the investigations of lower Palaeogene marine Italian records from the Umbria-Marche (Northern Apennines, Italy) and Belluno (Southern Alps, Italy) basins. In particular, crucial reference sections found in Scaglia Rossa-type facies, such as the Contessa, Possagno, Forada and Cicogna sections, have significantly improved our knowledge of the biotic and abiotic events associated to the PETM. Among these, the Forada section (Belluno Basin) was the focus of accurate integrated micropalaeontological (calcareous plankton and benthic foraminifera) and geochemical-stratigraphical studies, which possibly offer the most complete reconstruction across the PETM available in Europe to date.","[Giusberti, Luca; Capraro, Luca; Fornaciari, Eliana] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geosci, Via G Gradenigo 6, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Luciani, Valeria] Dipartimento Fis & Sci Terra, Via G Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy",University of Padua,"Giusberti, L (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geosci, Via G Gradenigo 6, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",luca.giusberti@unipd.it; luca.capraro@unipd.it; valeria.luciani@unife.it; eliana.fornaciari@unipd.it,"Giusberti, Luca/AAA-9913-2021; GIUSBERTI, LUCA/AAK-4640-2020","GIUSBERTI, LUCA/0000-0002-4401-5410; Capraro, Luca/0000-0003-1718-2106",,,,,127,3,3,0,9,SOC PALEONTOLOGICA ITALIANA,MODENA,"C/O E.

Advection-dispersion processes along streamlines are simulated with the very efficient matched artificial dispersivity (MAD) method of Syriopoulou and Koussis and the system of discretized transverse-dispersion equations is solved with the Thomas algorithm. These concepts are embedded in the 2D-MADPD-SWI model, yielding comparable solutions to those of the uncoupled SWI equations with the state-of-the-art FEFLOW code, but faster, while 2D-MADPD-SWI achieves an at least hundredfold faster solution than a variable-density flow model.

For example, the effects of land-cover changes on regional rainfall regimes depend on this process. To study moisture recycling, a range of moisture-tracking models are in use that are forced with output from atmospheric models but differ in various ways. They can be Eulerian (grid-based) or Lagrangian (trajectory-based), have two or three spatial dimensions, and rely on a range of other assumptions. Which model is most suitable depends not only on the purpose of the study but also on the quality and resolution of the data with which it is forced. Recently, the high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data set has become the state of the art, paving the way for a new generation of moisture-tracking models. However, it is unclear how the new data can best be used to obtain accurate estimates of atmospheric moisture flows. Here we develop a set of moisture-tracking models forced with ERA5 data and systematically test their performance regarding continental evaporation recycling ratio, distances of moisture flows, and footprints of evaporation from seven point sources across the globe. We report simulation times to assess possible trade-offs between accuracy and speed. Three-dimensional Lagrangian models were most accurate and ran faster than Eulerian versions for tracking water from single grid cells. The rate of vertical mixing of moisture in the atmosphere was the greatest source of uncertainty in moisture tracking. We conclude that the recently improved resolution of atmospheric reanalysis data allows for more accurate moisture tracking results in a Lagrangian setting, but that considerable uncertainty regarding turbulent mixing remains. We present an efficient Lagrangian method to track atmospheric moisture flows from any location globally using ERA5 reanalysis data and make the code for this model, which we call UTrack-atmospheric-moisture, publicly available.","[Tuinenburg, Obbe A.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Tuinenburg, Obbe A.; Staal, Arie] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tuinenburg, Obbe A.; Staal, Arie] Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Utrecht University; Stockholm University,"Tuinenburg, OA (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.;Tuinenburg, OA (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Tuinenburg, OA (corresponding author), Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",o.a.tuinenburg@uu.nl,,"Tuinenburg, Obbe/0000-0001-6895-0094; Staal, Arie/0000-0001-5409-1436",Bolin Centre for Climate Research; research programme Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Veni - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [016.veni.171.019]; European Research Council project Earth Resilience in the Anthropocene [743080 ERA],Bolin Centre for Climate Research; research programme Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Veni - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Research Council project Earth Resilience in the Anthropocene,"We thank Ruud van der Ent, Ingo Fetzer, Line Gordon, and Lan Wang-Erlandsson for useful discussions.

There are many versions of ATC models, but few studies have explored how to determine the optimal prediction model. This paper proposes a method to determine the optimal model from the perspective of statistics and uses an actual case to illustrate the method. Through the investigation of 7 buildings with natural ventilation, 1331 valid questionnaires were obtained in combination with the instrument test. The optimal ATC model was obtained using grey relational analysis. The effectiveness of the optimal model was verified by comparing the predicted and measured values of the neutral temperature. The results show that the optimal ATC model determined by the method presented in the article is effective, and the best model for the whole year can explain 69.6% of the observed values. The prediction accuracy and stability of the model established separately by climate region are better than those of the general model.

The 12 week long observation period shows a clear orographic precipitation signal across the 10-15 km wide island (peak elevation 750 m). The model experiment designed to capture this signal is run with 9-3-1 km nested grid and results are compared with observations at different accumulation intervals. The total amount of precipitation over the 12 week period is underpredicted, even for the 1 km grid. The maximum precipitation intensity, however, is slightly overpredicted. Time-step (5 s) precipitation from the model is also compared with observed intensities at the highest possible temporal resolution permitted by the rain collection method. The observations indicate that most of the precipitation is formed at intensities from 5 to 20 mm h(-1). A smaller fraction of the precipitation is formed with intensities > 20 mm h(-1). The simulated precipitation at the 3 km grid did not reproduce at the correct intensities. The 1 km grid showed an improved tendency to produce the precipitation at the right intensities, but had too high maximum intensities. A test simulation where the intermediate grid had no cumulus parametrization was performed. Even though effects such as undercatchment and unresolved terrain influenced, it was concluded that the test run performed better than the control run. The investigation concluded that, in general, a 1 km grid is sufficient for capturing the most intensive precipitation event in a satisfying way.","[Barstad, Idar; Caroletti, Giulio N.] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Barstad, Idar] UniResearch, UniComp, Bergen, Norway; [Caroletti, Giulio N.] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Ambientale & Architettur, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; University of Cagliari,"Barstad, I (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Idar.Barstad@uni.no,"Caroletti, Giulio/AAA-2227-2022","Caroletti, Giulio Nils/0000-0001-7827-7411",,,,,51,12,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

Conventional proposed solutions, all already used to some extent, include a shift to low carbon transport fuels, major improvements in vehicular fuel efficiency, and modal shift. However, their impact has been marginal. This paper instead examines the extent to which fully automated vehicles could contribute to the environmental sustainability of global passenger transport. Fully automated vehicles were found to lead to either an increase or, at best, a slight decrease in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and so will be of marginal use at best for reducing emissions in a business-as-usual world. Reasons for this conclusion are first, their potentially lower time and money costs would tend to increase vehicular travel, offsetting any energy efficiency gains, and second, that they face serious problems that could delay or even prevent their widespread introduction.

Sustainability issues pose a huge challenge for this sector. In this context, a big issue is to be able to predict the multiscale dynamics of those systems using computing science. A robust predictive mathematical tool is implemented for this sector and applied to the wine industry being easily able to be generalized to other applications. Grape berry maturation relies on complex and coupled physicochemical and biochemical reactions which are climate dependent. Moreover one experiment represents one year and the climate variability could not be covered exclusively by the experiments. Consequently, harvest mostly relies on expert predictions. A big challenge for the wine industry is nevertheless to be able to anticipate the reactions for sustainability purposes.

The Upper Pleniglacial was characterized by periglacial conditions and a braided channel system in the Moselle River valley (formation of terrace M1). The fining-upwards fluvial sediments and the presence of aeolian deposits however evidence a gradual climate drying. The weathering by the permafrost might then be associated with slope deposits. After incision of M1, the Moselle River starts building its present floodplain M0 during Late Glacial time (as recognized in other parts of its valley). During the Holocene pedogenetical processes increased and new slope deposition occurred above the M1 terrace. Such deposition reflects a soil erosion related to increasing human occupation as indicated by numerous vestiges.

Their aim is to incorporate the advantages of both components: the bounded complexity of parametric models and the flexibility of nonparametric ones. We demonstrate that semiparametric Bayesian networks generalize two well-known types of Bayesian networks: Gaussian Bayesian networks and kernel density estimation Bayesian networks. For this purpose, we consider two different conditional probability distributions required in a semiparametric Bayesian network. In addition, we present modifications of two well-known algorithms (greedy hill-climbing and PC) to learn the structure of a semiparametric Bayesian network from data. To realize this, we employ a score function based on cross-validation. In addition, using a validation dataset, we apply an early-stopping criterion to avoid overfitting. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, we conduct an exhaustive experiment on synthetic data sampled by mixing linear and nonlinear functions, multivariate normal data sampled from Gaussian Bayesian networks, real data from the UCI repository, and bearings degradation data.

Studies have reported a strong correlation between weather, the abundance of Aedes aegypti, the vector of DHF virus, and dengue incidence. However, this conclusion has been based on the general climate pattern of wide regions. In general, however, the human population, level of infrastructure, and land-use change in rural and urban areas often produce localized climate patterns that may influence the interaction between climate, vector abundance, and dengue incidence. Thoroughly understanding this correlation will allow the development of a customized and precise local early warning system. To achieve this purpose, we conducted a cohort study, during January-December 2017, in 16 districts in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. In the selected areas, local weather stations and modified light mosquito traps were set up to obtain data regarding daily weather and the abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti. A generalized linear model was applied to analyze the effect of local weather and female adult Ae. aegypti on the number of dengue cases. The result showed a significant non-linear correlation among mosquito abundance, maximum temperature, and dengue cases. Using our model, the data showed that the addition of a single adult Ae. aegypti mosquito increased the risk of dengue infection by 1.8%, while increasing the maximum temperature by one degree decreased the risk by 17%. This finding suggests specific actionable insights needed to supplement existing mosquito eradication programs.","[Faridah, Lia; Fauziah, Nisa; Ekawardhani, Savira] Univ Padjadjaran, Dept Biomed Sci, Parasitol Div, Fac Med, Jl Raya Bandung Sumedang Km 21, Sumedang 45363, West Java, Indonesia; [Faridah, Lia] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Bunkyo Cho 3, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; [Agustian, Dwi; Rinawan, Fedri Ruluwedrata] Univ Padjadjaran, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med, Jl Raya Bandung Sumedang Km 21, Sumedang 45363, West Java, Indonesia; [Jaya, I.

Although the potential of citizen science activities to generate enormous amounts of data otherwise not feasible is widely recognized, the obtained data are often treated with caution and scepticism. Their quality and reliability is not fully trusted since they are obtained by non-experts using low-cost instruments or scientifically non-verified methods. In this study, we evaluate the performance of Parrot's Flower Power soil moisture sensor used within the European citizen science project the GROW Observatory (GROW; https://growobservatory.org, last access: 30 March 2020). The aim of GROW is to enable scientists to validate satellite-based soil moisture products at an unprecedented high spatial resolution through crowdsourced data. To this end, it has mobilized thousands of citizens across Europe in science and climate actions, including hundreds who have been empowered to monitor soil moisture and other environmental variables within 24 high-density clusters around Europe covering different climate and soil conditions. Clearly, to serve as reference dataset, the quality of ground observations is crucial, especially if obtained from low-cost sensors. To investigate the accuracy of such measurements, the Flower Power sensors were evaluated in the lab and field. For the field trials, they were installed alongside professional soil moisture probes in the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) in Petzenkirchen, Austria. We assessed the skill of the low-cost sensors against the professional probes using various methods. Apart from common statistical metrics like correlation, bias, and root-mean-square difference, we investigated and compared the temporal stability, soil moisture memory, and the flagging statistics based on the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) quality indicators. We found a low intersensor variation in the lab and a high temporal agreement with the professional sensors in the field. The results of soil moisture memory and the ISMN quality flags analysis are in a comparable range for the low-cost and professional probes; only the temporal stability analysis shows a contrasting outcome. We demonstrate that low-cost sensors can be used to generate a dataset valuable for environmental monitoring and satellite validation and thus provide the basis for citizen-based soil moisture science.","[Xaver, Angelika; Zappa, Luca; Pfeil, Isabella; Vreugdenhil, Mariette; Dorigo, Wouter Arnoud] TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-E120, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Rab, Gerhard; Pfeil, Isabella; Vreugdenhil, Mariette] TU Wien, Ctr Water Resource Syst, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Hemment, Drew] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Futures Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hemment, Drew] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Technische Universitat Wien; Technische Universitat Wien; University of Edinburgh; Edinburgh College of Art; University of Edinburgh,"Xaver, A; Dorigo, WA (corresponding author), TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-E120, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",angelikaxaver@geo.tuwien.ac.at; wouter.dorigo@geo.tuwien.ac.at,"; Dorigo, Wouter/C-7794-2014","Vreugdenhil, Mariette/0000-0003-4913-0255; Greimeister-Pfeil, Isabella/0000-0002-7893-8141; Rab, Gerhard/0000-0002-2271-275X; Zappa, Luca/0000-0002-0928-229X; Dorigo, Wouter/0000-0001-8054-7572",European Commission Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [690199],European Commission Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,This research has been supported by the European Commission Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant no. 690199).,,46,8,8,0,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0856,2193-0864,,GEOSCI INSTRUM METH,Geosci.

Current knowledge on the average pace of landscape evolution in the Campine area is largely based on geological inferences and modern analogies. We performed a Bayesian inversion of an in situ-produced Be-10 concentration depth profile to infer the average long-term erosion rate together with two other parameters: the surface exposure age and the inherited 10Be concentration. Compared to the latest advances in probabilistic inversion of cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) data, our approach has the following two innovative components: it (1) uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and (2) accounts (under certain assumptions) for the contribution of model errors to posterior uncertainty. To investigate to what extent our approach differs from the state of the art in practice, a comparison against the Bayesian inversion method implemented in the CRONUScalc program is made. Both approaches identify similar maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter values, but posterior parameter and predictive uncertainty derived using the method taken in CRONUScalc is moderately underestimated. A simple way for producing more consistent uncertainty estimates with the CRONUScalc-like method in the presence of model errors is therefore suggested. Our inferred erosion rate of 39 +/- 8.9 mm kyr(-1) (1 sigma) is relatively large in comparison with landforms that erode under comparable (paleo-)climates elsewhere in the world. We evaluate this value in the light of the erodibility of the substrate and sudden base level lowering during the Middle Pleistocene. A denser sampling scheme of a two-nuclide concentration depth profile would allow for better inferred erosion rate resolution, and including more uncertain parameters in the MCMC inversion.","[Laloy, Eric; Beerten, Koen; Rogiers, Bart] Belgian Nucl Res Ctr SCK CEN, Engn & Geosyst Anal, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Vanacker, Veerle] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Christl, Marcus] ETH, Lab Ion Beam Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wouters, Laurent] Belgian Natl Agcy Radioact Waste & Enriched Fissi, Long Term RD&D Dept, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium",Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK-CEN); Universite Catholique Louvain; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Beerten, K (corresponding author), Belgian Nucl Res Ctr SCK CEN, Engn & Geosyst Anal, B-2400 Mol, Belgium.",kbeerten@sckcen.be,"Christl, Marcus/J-4769-2016","Christl, Marcus/0000-0002-3131-6652; Rogiers, Bart/0000-0002-8836-0988","NIRAS/ONDRAF, the Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Fissile Materials, programme on geological disposal of high-level/long-life radioactive waste that is carried out by ONDRAF/NIRAS","NIRAS/ONDRAF, the Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Fissile Materials, programme on geological disposal of high-level/long-life radioactive waste that is carried out by ONDRAF/NIRAS","This work was undertaken in close cooperation with, and with the financial support of, NIRAS/ONDRAF, the Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Fissile Materials, as part of the programme on geological disposal of high-level/long-life radioactive waste that is carried out by ONDRAF/NIRAS.",,49,10,10,0,9,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2196-6311,2196-632X,,EARTH SURF DYNAM,Earth Surf.

The examined techniques include a classical, state-of-the-art eye tracking approach, two data-driven approaches that rely on eye tracking data, a datadriven approach that only considers the driver's facial configuration, and an end-to-end approach based on a convolutional neural network.

A useful period for assessing the sensitivity of Antarctica to warming is the Last Interglacial (LIG) (129 to 116 ky), which experienced warmer polar temperatures and higher global mean sea level (GMSL) (+6 to 9 m) relative to present day. LIG sea level cannot be fully explained by Greenland Ice Sheet melt (similar to 2 m), ocean thermal expansion, and melting mountain glaciers (similar to 1 m), suggesting substantial Antarctic mass loss was initiated by warming of Southern Ocean waters, resulting from a weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in response to North Atlantic surface freshening. Here, we report a blue-ice record of ice sheet and environmental change from the Weddell Sea Embayment at the periphery of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which is underlain by major methane hydrate reserves. Constrained by a widespread volcanic horizon and supported by ancient microbial DNA analyses, we provide evidence for substantial mass loss across the Weddell Sea Embayment during the LIG, most likely driven by ocean warming and associated with destabilization of subglacial hydrates. Ice sheet modeling supports this interpretation and suggests that millennial-scale warming of the Southern Ocean could have triggered a multimeter rise in global sea levels. Our data indicate that Antarctica is highly vulnerable to projected increases in ocean temperatures and may drive ice-climate feedbacks that further amplify warming.","[Turney, Chris S.

However, the exact responses of carbon cycle processes to climatic drivers often remain uncertain. Presently, knowledge derived from experiments, complemented by a steadily evolving body of mechanistic theory, provides the main basis for developing such models. The strongly increasing availability of measurements may facilitate new ways of identifying suitable model structures using machine learning. Here, we explore the potential of gene expression programming (GEP) to derive relevant model formulations based solely on the signals present in data by automatically applying various mathematical transformations to potential predictors and repeatedly evolving the resulting model structures. In contrast to most other machine learning regression techniques, the GEP approach generates readable models that allow for prediction and possibly for interpretation. Our study is based on two cases: artificially generated data and real observations. Simulations based on artificial data show that GEP is successful in identifying prescribed functions, with the prediction capacity of the models comparable to four state-of-the-art machine learning methods (random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and kernel ridge regressions). Based on real observations we explore the responses of the different components of terrestrial respiration at an oak forest in south-eastern England. We find that the GEP-retrieved models are often better in prediction than some established respiration models. Based on their structures, we find previously unconsidered exponential dependencies of respiration on seasonal ecosystem carbon assimilation and water dynamics. We noticed that the GEP models are only partly portable across respiration components, the identification of a general terrestrial respiration model possibly prevented by equifinality issues. Overall, GEP is a promising tool for uncovering new model structures for terrestrial ecology in the data-rich era, complementing more traditional modelling approaches.","[Ilie, Iulia; Carvalhais, Nuno; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Sippel, Sebastian; Mahecha, Miguel D.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, Hans Knoell Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Dittrich, Peter] Jena Ctr Bioinformat, Inst Comp Sci, Bio Syst Anal Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Dittrich, Peter] Friedrich Schiller Univ, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Dittrich, Peter; Mahecha, Miguel D.] Michael Stifel Ctr Jena Data Driven & Simulat Sci, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CENSE, Dept Ciencias & Engn Ambiente, Caparica, Portugal; [Heinemeyer, Andreas] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, Dept Environm, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Subke, Jens-Arne] Univ Stirling, Sch Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling, Scotland; [Mahecha, Miguel D.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Morison, James I.

To find solutions based on nature, clarifying the complicated mechanisms and feedback among land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being, is increasingly crucial. However, the in-depth linkages among these three elements have not been clearly and systematically illustrated, present research paths have not been summarized well, and the future research trends on this topic have not been reasonably discussed. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into how land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being are linked, as well as their relationships, interacting ways, applications in solving ecological and socioeconomic problems, and to reveal their future research trends. Here, we use a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature to conclude the state of the art and the progress, emphasize the hotspot, and reveal the future trend of the nexus among the three aspects. Results show that (1) ecosystem services are generally altered by the changes in land use type, spatial pattern, and intensity; (2) the nexus among land use change, ecosystem services, and human well-being is usually used for supporting poverty alleviation, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development; (3) future research on land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being should mainly focus on strengthening multiscale correlation, driving force analysis, the correlation among different group characteristics, land use types and ecosystem service preferences, and the impact of climate change on ecosystem services and human well-being. This study provides an enhanced understanding of the nexus among the three aspects and a reference for future studies to mitigate the relevant problems.","[Liu, Mengxue; Dong, Xiaobin; Wang, Xue-Chao; Zhang, Ying] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Mengxue; Dong, Xiaobin; Wang, Xue-Chao; Zhao, Bingyu; Zhang, Ying] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Mengxue; Dong, Xiaobin; Wang, Xue-Chao; Zhang, Ying] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wei, Hejie] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Henan Agricultural University,"Dong, XB (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Dong, XB (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Dong, XB (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",mengxueliu@mail.bnu.edu.cn; hjwei@henau.edu.cn; xbdong@bnu.edu.cn; xcwang@bnu.edu.cn; bingyuzhao@mail.bnu.edu.cn; zhangying19@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0608]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171275],Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (Grant No. 2019QZKK0608) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42171275).,,182,4,4,49,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,11,,,,,,6926,10.3390/su14116926,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116926,,,31,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Z4VM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000808824300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The rainfall maximum is generally displaced downshear to downshear-left side in the Northern Hemisphere or downshear to downshear-right side in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we revisit the rainfall asymmetries of TCs over the western North Pacific using the state-of-art Global Precipitation Measurement data. Observations pose that using the conventional VWS to interpret the TC rainfall asymmetry is inopportune. The conventional VWS can only largely grasp the rainfall asymmetry in the inner core of TC, but not in the outer core. We, therefore, explicitly propose a new VWS, namely the effective VWS, to fill this gap. The effective shear layer responsible for the rainfall asymmetry is a function of TC intensity and core region. In addition, we suggest that the angle difference between the effective shears for the inner-core and outer-core rainfall asymmetries can help to comprehend the spirality of the rainfall asymmetries that are, the fashions, or patterns of the rainbands. Meanwhile, the moisture flux convergence and storm motion show little effect on the rainfall asymmetry. This study advances the understanding of TC rainfall asymmetry and provides scientific support for disaster prediction, prevention, and mitigation.","[Liang, Junyi; Chan, Kelvin T.

This article evaluates the significance and impact of private funding in the Dutch heritage and museum sector. By focusing on three museums that have received funding from Dutch oil and gas companies we foreground specifically the nexus heritage, oil, and funding. We show how a particular type of 'energy literacy' is promoted, a narrative that is favourable to the agenda of the gas and oil sector. Our explorations are based on interviews with museum officials, an analysis of policy documents, and a close reading of exhibitions. By describing the impact of oil and gas money on the Dutch heritage sector, this article charts the growing influence of corporate players in the Dutch public cultural sector. Following neoliberal reforms in 2011-2012 promoting cultural entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency, museums and heritage sites had to act even more like businesses and attract sponsorships and gifts from private players. This development is part of a global retraction of the state in the public sector. Our discussion of the intricacies of corporate heritage funding in the Netherlands shows that through a fairly limited investment, enterprises acquire disproportionate outreach and influence in the cultural heritage field, an environment that is generally perceived by the public as reliable and independent.","[Plets, Gertjan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Cultural Heritage Studies & Archaeol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kuijt, Marin] Univ Utrecht, Hist & Philosophy, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Plets, G (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Cultural Heritage Studies & Archaeol, Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.f.j.plets@uu.nl; m.w.kuijt@umail.leidenuniv.nl,,"Plets, Gertjan/0000-0002-9858-3464",UGLOBE centre for global challenges,UGLOBE centre for global challenges,"The authors wish to thank the editors of bmgn -Low Countries Historical Review for their interest in this paper and their suggestions.

During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, indirect observations and models suggest a weakening of the AMOC. Direct AMOC observations also suggest a weakening during the early 21st century but with substantial interannual variability. Long-term weakening of the AMOC has been associated with increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs), but some modeling studies suggest the build up of anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) may have offset part of the GHG-induced weakening. Here, we quantify 1900-2020 AMOC variations and assess the driving mechanisms in state-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The CMIP6 forcing (GHGs, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and land use and land change) multi-model mean shows negligible AMOC changes up to similar to 1950, followed by robust AMOC strengthening during the second half of the 20th century (similar to 1950-1990) and weakening afterwards (1990-2020). These multi-decadal AMOC variations are related to changes in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation, including an altered sea level pressure gradient, storm track activity, surface winds, and heat fluxes, which drive changes in the subpolar North Atlantic surface density flux. To further investigate these AMOC relationships, we perform a regression analysis and decompose these North Atlantic climate responses into an anthropogenic aerosol-forced component and a subsequent AMOC-related feedback. Similar to previous studies, CMIP6 GHG simulations yield robust AMOC weakening, particularly during the second half of the 20th century. Changes in natural forcings, including solar variability and volcanic aerosols, yield negligible AMOC changes. In contrast, CMIP6 AA simulations yield robust AMOC strengthening (weakening) in response to increasing (decreasing) anthropogenic aerosols. Moreover, the CMIP6 all-forcing AMOC variations and atmospheric circulation responses also occur in the CMIP6 AA simulations, which suggests these are largely driven by changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. More specifically, our results suggest that AMOC multi-decadal variability is initiated by North Atlantic aerosol optical thickness perturbations to net surface shortwave radiation and sea surface temperature (and hence sea surface density), which in turn affect sea level pressure gradient and surface wind and - via latent and sensible heat fluxes - sea surface density flux through its thermal component. AMOC-related feedbacks act to reinforce this aerosol-forced AMOC response, largely due to changes in sea surface salinity (and hence sea surface density), with temperature-related (and cloud-related) feedbacks acting to mute the initial response. Although aspects of the CMIP6 all-forcing multi-model mean response resembles observations, notable differences exist. This includes CMIP6 AMOC strengthening from similar to 1950 to 1990, when the indirect estimates suggest AMOC weakening. The CMIP6 multi-model mean also underestimates the observed increase in North Atlantic ocean heat content, and although the CMIP6 North Atlantic atmospheric circulation responses - particularly the overall patterns - are similar to observations, the simulated responses are weaker than those observed, implying they are only partially externally forced. The possible causes of these differences include internal climate variability, observational uncertainties, and model shortcomings, including excessive aerosol forcing. A handful of CMIP6 realizations yield AMOC evolution since 1900 similar to the indirect observations, implying the inferred AMOC weakening from 1950 to 1990 (and even from 1930 to 1990) may have a significant contribution from internal (i.e., unforced) climate variability. Nonetheless, CMIP6 models yield robust, externally forced AMOC changes, the bulk of which are due to anthropogenic aerosols.","[Hassan, Taufiq; Allen, Robert J.; Liu, Wei] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Randles, Cynthia A.] ExxonMobil Res & Engn Co, Annandale, NJ 08801 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Exxon Mobil Corporation,"Hassan, T; Allen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",mhass004@ucr.edu; rjallen@ucr.edu,"Hassan, Taufiq/AGV-1080-2022","Hassan Mozumder, Mohammad Taufiq/0000-0003-2361-6361",,,,,89,15,16,6,21,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

In this study, we attempt an ecosystem-level physiological approach of estimating GPP using an asymptotic light response function (LRF) between GPP and incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that better represents the response observed at high spatiotemporal resolutions than the conventional light use efficiency approach. Modelled GPP is thereafter constrained with meteorological and hydrological variables. The variability in field-observed GPP, net primary productivity and solar-induced fluorescence was better or equally well captured by our LRF-based GPP when compared with six state-of-the-art Earth observation-based GPP products. Over the period 1982-2015, the LRF-based average annual global terrestrial GPP budget was 121.8 +/- 3.5 Pg C, with a detrended inter-annual variability of 0.74 +/- 0.13 Pg C. The strongest inter-annual variability was observed in semi-arid regions, but croplands in China and India also showed strong inter-annual variations. The trend in global terrestrial GPP during 1982-2015 was 0.27 +/- 0.02 Pg C year(-1), and was generally larger in the northern than the southern hemisphere. Most positive GPP trends were seen in areas with croplands whereas negative trends were observed for large non-cropped parts of the tropics. Trends were strong during the eighties and nineties but levelled off around year 2000. Other GPP products either showed no trends or continuous increase throughout the study period. This study benchmarks a first global Earth observation-based model using an asymptotic light response function, improving simulations of GPP, and reveals a stagnation in the global GPP after the year 2000.","[Tagesson, Torbern; Tian, Feng; Ahlstrom, Anders; Ardo, Jonas; Olin, Stefan] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Solvegatan 12, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Tagesson, Torbern; Schurgers, Guy; Horion, Stephanie; Fensholt, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Tian, Feng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Scholes, Robert] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ahlstrom, Anders] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, Lund, Sweden; [Moreno, Alvaro] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab IPL, Valencia, Spain; [Moreno, Alvaro] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Madani, Nima] Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",Lund University; University of Copenhagen; Wuhan University; University of Witwatersrand; Lund University; University of Valencia; University of Montana System; University of Montana; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Tagesson, T (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Solvegatan 12, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",torbern.tagesson@nateko.lu.se,"Schurgers, Guy/K-6543-2012; Tian, Feng/C-8946-2015; Ahlstr√∂m, Anders/F-3215-2017; Horion, Stephanie/AAE-3226-2022; Tagesson, Torbern/AGG-5627-2022; Mart√≠nez, √Ålvaro Moreno/AAA-5778-2019; Tagesson, Torbern/E-5429-2015","Schurgers, Guy/0000-0002-2189-1995; Tian, Feng/0000-0002-9686-2769; Ahlstr√∂m, Anders/0000-0003-1642-0037; Mart√≠nez, √Ålvaro Moreno/0000-0003-2990-7768; Tagesson, Torbern/0000-0003-3011-1775; Ardo, Jonas/0000-0002-9318-0973","Swedish National Space Agency [Dnr 95/16]; Swedish National Space Board [95, 16]; Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-6111-00258]; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office [SR/00/339]; NASA [NNX08AG87A]; European Research Council [647423]",Swedish National Space Agency; Swedish National Space Board; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Belgian Federal Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"Swedish National Space Agency, Grant/Award Number: Dnr 95/16; Swedish National Space Board, Grant/Award Number: 95 and 16; Danish Council for Independent Research, Grant/Award Number: DFF-6111-00258; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, Grant/Award Number: SR/00/339; NASA, Grant/Award Number: NNX08AG87A; European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 647423",,79,7,7,11,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Using a combination of microbotanical, geochemical and isotopic analysis they argued that the objects were multi-grained food-balls that had ritual and social functions, with further reaching implications for adaptations to much later period climate change in the Late Harappan. We argue in this paper that there are concerns relating to how the multi-proxy analyses were applied to the objects that raises questions about the interpretation of these unique objects as 'food-balls', or even wholly organic in nature, and that as a result, their presumed ritual connotations in particular are difficult to sustain.

Thus, the aim of the research discussed and presented in this paper was to measure the impact of using recycled and onsite non-potable water sources at the MFCS to alleviate the use of desalinated potable water and reduce associated energy consumption, operational costs, and GHG emissions (latterly in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), for LI and WFs. The analysis of three case scenarios at the MFCS compared different approaches to alleviate energy use, costs, and GHG impacts for the use of recycled water in LI and WFs against a baseline. The findings led to a proposed sustainable water conservation and reuse (SWC) strategy, which helped save 50% desalinated potable water for LI use by soil improvement, building water system audits, and alternate non-potable water reuse. The recommendations for this paper are to develop a SWC strategy forming the basis for a water protocol by the competent authority for regional medical facilities including an assessment methodology for building decentralized non-potable water systems to measure their energy, GHG emissions and financial impact.","[Seguela, Geraldine; Littlewood, John R.] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Sustainable & Resilient Built Environm Grp, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales; [Karani, George] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Hlth Sci, Environm Publ Hlth Grp, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales",Cardiff Metropolitan University; Cardiff Metropolitan University; Cardiff University,"Seguela, G (corresponding author), Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Sustainable & Resilient Built Environm Grp, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales.",geseguela@cardiffmet.ac.uk; jlittlewood@cardiffmet.ac.uk; gkarani@cardiffmet.ac.uk,,"Littlewood, John/0000-0002-0351-9954",,,,,80,3,3,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx) is a model intercomparison project of the Forum of Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS). In SIREx, skill metrics are designed to evaluate different recently suggested approaches for modeling linear kinematic features (LKFs) to provide guidance for modeling small-scale deformation. These LKFs are narrow bands of localized deformation that can be observed in satellite images and also form in high resolution sea ice simulations. In this contribution, spatial and temporal properties of LKFs are assessed in 36 simulations of state-of-the-art sea ice models and compared to deformation features derived from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System. All simulations produce LKFs, but only very few models realistically simulate at least some statistics of LKF properties such as densities, lengths, or growth rates. All SIREx models overestimate the angle of fracture between conjugate pairs of LKFs and LKF lifetimes pointing to inaccurate model physics. The temporal and spatial resolution of a simulation and the spatial resolution of atmospheric boundary condition affect simulated LKFs as much as the model's sea ice rheology and numerics. Only in very high resolution simulations (<= 2 km) the concentration and thickness anomalies along LKFs are large enough to affect air-ice-ocean interaction processes.","[Hutter, Nils; Koldunov, Nikolay; Losch, Martin; Wang, Qiang] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Bouchat, Amelie; Tremblay, Bruno] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dupont, Frederic] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Serv Meteorol Canadien, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Dukhovskoy, Dmitry] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Lee, Younjoo J.; Maslowski, Wieslaw] Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA USA; [Lemieux, Jean-Francois] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Rech Previs Numer Environm, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Lique, Camille; Talandier, Claude] Univ Brest, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS,IUEM, Brest, France; [Myers, Paul G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Olason, Einar] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Rampal, Pierre] CNRS, Inst Geophys Environm, Grenoble, France; [Rasmussen, Till] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; McGill University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; Recherche en Prevision Numerique (RPN); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); University of Alberta; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Danish Meteorological Institute DMI","Hutter, N (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany.",nils.hutter@awi.de,"Losch, Martin/S-5896-2016; Dukhovskoy, Dmitry/I-9391-2017; Lique, Camille/L-5543-2015","Losch, Martin/0000-0002-3824-5244; Wang, Qiang/0000-0002-2704-5394; Dukhovskoy, Dmitry/0000-0002-9114-9796; Rasmussen, Till Andreas Soya/0000-0003-2931-5180; Lemieux, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-2084-5759; Dupont, Frederic/0000-0002-9722-4478; Lique, Camille/0000-0002-8357-4928; Hutter, Nils/0000-0003-3450-9422; Bouchat, Amelie/0000-0002-8228-0426; Olason, Einar/0000-0001-7911-5713","DOE [DE-SC0014378]; HYCOM NOPP [N00014-19-1-2674]; DoD High-Performance Computing Modernization Program at NRL SSC; Danish State through the National Centre for Climate Research; SALIENSEAS project part of the ERA4CS program; Innovation Fund Denmark; Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union [690462]; German Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada [RGPIN 04357, RGPCC 433898]; Natural Science and Engineering and Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada Grants & Contributions program; U.S. Department of Energy Regional and Global Model Analysis program; Office of Naval Research Arctic and Global Prediction program; National Science Foundation Arctic System Science program; project S1 (Diagnosis and Metrics in Climate Models) of the Collaborative Research Centre TRR 181 Energy Transfer in Atmosphere and Ocean - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [274762653]; Projekt DEAL","DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); HYCOM NOPP; DoD High-Performance Computing Modernization Program at NRL SSC; Danish State through the National Centre for Climate Research; SALIENSEAS project part of the ERA4CS program; Innovation Fund Denmark; Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union; German Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Natural Science and Engineering and Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Environment and Climate Change Canada Grants & Contributions program; U.S. Department of Energy Regional and Global Model Analysis program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Naval Research Arctic and Global Prediction program; National Science Foundation Arctic System Science program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); project S1 (Diagnosis and Metrics in Climate Models) of the Collaborative Research Centre TRR 181 Energy Transfer in Atmosphere and Ocean - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation); Projekt DEAL","D.

The data sources are quasi-independent and include the U.N. Food andAgriculture Organization-Forest Resource Assessment (FAO-FRA2015; country-level inventory estimates), the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3), the 'Houghton' bookkeeping model that incorporates FAO-FRA data, an ensemble of 8 state-of-the-art Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVM), and 2 recently published independent studies using primarily remote sensing techniques. The estimates are aggregated spatially to Southeast, East, and South Asia and temporally for three decades, 1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Since 1980, net carbon emissions from LULCC in Asia were responsible for 20%-40% of global LULCC emissions, with emissions from Southeast Asia alone accounting for 15%-25% of global LULCC emissions during the same period. In the 2000s and for all Asia, three estimates (FAO-FRA, DGVM, Houghton) were in agreement of a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with mean estimates ranging between 0.24 to 0.41 Pg Cyr(-1), whereas EDGARv4.3 suggested a net carbon sink of -0.17 Pg Cyr(-1). Three of 4 estimates suggest that LULCC carbon emissions declined by at least 34% in the preceding decade (1990-2000). Spread in the estimates is due to the inclusion of different flux components and their treatments, showing the importance to include emissions from carbon rich peatlands and land management, such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, which appear to be consistently underreported.","[Calle, Leonardo;

This study conducts a quantitative evaluation of the MJO prediction skill in state-of-the-art operational models, participating in the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction project. The relationship of MJO prediction skill with model biases in the mean moisture fields and in the longwave cloud-radiation feedbacks is also investigated. The S2S models exhibit MJO prediction skill out to a range of 12 to 36 days. The MJO prediction skills in the S2S models are affected by both the MJO amplitude and phase errors, with the latter becoming more important at longer forecast lead times. Consistent with previous studies, MJO events with stronger initial MJO amplitude are typically better predicted. It is found that the sensitivity to the initial MJO phase varies notably from model to model. In most models, a notable dry bias develops within a few days of forecast lead time in the deep tropics, especially across the Maritime Continent. The dry bias weakens the horizontal moisture gradient over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific, likely dampening the organization and propagation of the MJO. Most S2S models also underestimate the longwave cloud-radiation feedbacks in the tropics, which may affect the maintenance of the MJO convective envelope. The models with smaller bias in the mean horizontal moisture gradient and the longwave cloud-radiation feedbacks show higher MJO prediction skills, suggesting that improving those biases would enhance MJO prediction skill of the operational models.","[Lim, Yuna; Son, Seok-Woo] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Daehyun] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Son, SW (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",seokwooson@snu.ac.kr,"Lim, Yuna/AAV-8137-2020; Son, Seok-Woo/A-8797-2013; Kim, Daehyun/X-1710-2019","Kim, Daehyun/0000-0001-9233-2747",University of Washington; Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 2015-2100],University of Washington(University of Washington); Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),Y.

For almost 50 years now, accurate, long term records of solar insolation, planetary albedo, and OLR have been collected to monitor climate change. This paper describes results of two closure studies: one tests how well a state of die art radiative model using satellite retrievals from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) reproduces clear sky observations of OLR obtained by the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) broadband radiometer, and the other tests how well the AIRS retrievals input into the radiative model reproduces AIRS radiances. In both studies the methodologies were tested at the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program site in the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) then applied globally. The clear sky OLR comparisons were impressive; RRTM calculations agree with CERES observations to similar to 1 W/m(2) with an uncertainty of similar to 1 W/m(2) at SGP between September 2002 and February 2005 and globally (with some understood regional exceptions) for four study days. Clear sky global analyses as a function of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) surface types quantified clear sky OLR agreements for exceptionally bad (desert and snow/ice) and good (ocean) regions. Obtaining cloud conditions in the necessary, form for radiative model calculations remains a formidable challenge but preliminary results are presented here. AIRS spectral analysis uncovered a persistent bias in the upper level water vapor reported by AIRS retrievals but no day/night bias necessary to explain the day/night bias seen in die OLR comparisons to CERES. We were also able to offer one of the few, albeit tentative, estimates of the error in the far infrared (a radiatively important but understudied spectral region) to be better than similar to 0.3% for clear skies.","[Moy, Leslie; Knuteson, Robert; Tobin, David; Revercomb, Henry; Borg, Lori] Univ Wisconsin, CIMSS, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Moy, L (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, CIMSS, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0635-3,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,,,,,561,564,,,,,,4,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BJG63,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000265672300137,View Full Record in Web of Science

The influence of wave farms, i. e., arrays of wave energy converters, on coastal processes, in particular sediment transport patterns, has been analysed in recent works; however, their influence on coastal flooding has not been addressed so far. The objective of this work is to investigate whether a wave farm can provide some protection from flooding on the coast in its lee through a case study: a gravel-dominated beach in southern Spain (Playa Granada). We consider three sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios: the present situation (SLR0), an optimistic projection (SLR1) and a pessimistic projection (SLR2). Two state-of-the-art numerical models, SWAN and XBeach-G, are applied to determine the wave propagation patterns, total run-up and flooded dry beach area. The results indicate that the absorption of wave power by the wave farm affects wave propagation in its lee and, in particular, wave heights, with alongshore-averaged reductions in breaking wave heights about 10% (25%) under westerly (easterly) storms. These lower significant wave heights, in turn, result in alongshore-averaged run-up reductions for the three scenarios, which decreases with increasing SLR values from 5.9% (6.8%) to 1.5% (5.1%) for western (eastern) storms. Importantly, the dry beach area flooded under westerly (easterly) storms is also reduced by 5.7% (3.2%), 3.3% (4.9%) and 1.99% (4.5%) in scenarios SLR0, SLR1 and SLR2, respectively. These findings prove that a wave farm can actually reduce coastal flooding on its leeward coast. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Exhaustive evaluations on model representation of aerosol distributions and properties are fundamental to assess health and climate impacts of BBA. Here we conducted a comprehensive comparison of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project model simulations with satellite observations. A total of 59 runs by 18 models from three AeroCom Phase-III experiments (i.e., biomass burning emissions, CTRL16, and CTRL19) and 14 satellite products of aerosols were used in the study. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm was investigated during the fire season over three key fire regions reflecting different fire dynamics (i.e., deforestation-dominated Amazon, Southern Hemisphere Africa where savannas are the key source of emissions, and boreal forest burning in boreal North America). The 14 satellite products were first evaluated against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations, with large uncertainties found. But these uncertainties had small impacts on the model evaluation that was dominated by modeling bias. Through a comparison with Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances measurements with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties algorithm (POLDER-GRASP), we found that the modeled AOD values were biased by -93% to 152 %, with most models showing significant underestimations even for the state-of-the-art aerosol modeling techniques (i.e., CTRL19). By scaling up BBA emissions, the negative biases in modeled AOD were significantly mitigated, although it yielded only negligible improvements in the correlation between models and observations, and the spatial and temporal variations in AOD biases did not change much. For models in CTRL16 and CTRL19, the large diversity in modeled AOD was in almost equal measures caused by diversity in emissions, lifetime, and the mass extinction coefficient (MEC). We found that in the AeroCom ensemble, BBA lifetime correlated significantly with particle deposition (as expected) and in turn correlated strongly with precipitation. Additional analysis based on Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol profiles suggested that the altitude of the aerosol layer in the current models was generally too low, which also contributed to the bias in modeled lifetime. Modeled MECs exhibited significant correlations with the Angstrom exponent (AE, an indicator of particle size). Comparisons with the POLDER-GRASP-observed AE suggested that the models tended to overestimate the AE (underestimated particle size), indicating a possible underestimation of MECs in models. The hygroscopic growth in most models generally agreed with observations and might not explain the overall underestimation of modeled AOD. Our results imply that current global models contain biases in important aerosol processes for BBA (e.g., emissions, removal, and optical properties) that remain to be addressed in future research.","[Zhong, Qirui; Schutgens, Nick; van der Werf, Guido] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Noije, Twan; Le Sager, Philippe] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Tsigaridis, Kostas; Bauer, Susanne E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY USA; [Tsigaridis, Kostas; Bauer, Susanne E.] NASA Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY USA; [Mielonen, Tero; Kokkola, Harri] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Kuopio, Finland; [Kirkevag, Alf; Seland, Oyvind; Tsyro, Svetlana G.] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Checa-Garcia, Ramiro] IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Neubauer, David] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kipling, Zak] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Matsui, Hitoshi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Ginoux, Paul] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Takemura, Toshihiko] Kyushu Univ, Res Inst Appl Mech, Fukuoka, Japan; [Remy, Samuel] HYGEOS, Lille, France; [Bian, Huisheng] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Joint Ctr Earth Syst Technol, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Bian, Huisheng; Chin, Mian] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Zhang, Kai] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Zhu, Jialei] Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Curci, Gabriele] Univ Aquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Laquila, Italy; [Curci, Gabriele] Univ Aquila, Ctr Excellence Telesensing Environm & Model Predi, Laquila, Italy; [Protonotariou, Anna] Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Athens, Greece; [Johnson, Ben] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Penner, Joyce E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bellouin, Nicolas] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Skeie, Ragnhild B.; Myhre, Gunnar] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res CICERO, Oslo, Norway",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Nagoya University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Kyushu University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Tianjin University; University of L'Aquila; University of L'Aquila; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Met Office - UK; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Reading,"Zhong, QR (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",q.zhong@vu.nl,"Myhre, Gunnar/A-3598-2008; Kokkola, Harri/J-5993-2014; Zhang, Kai/F-8415-2010; Tsigaridis, Kostas/K-8292-2012; Zhong, Qirui/AAD-7460-2022; van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016; Schutgens, Nick/B-2275-2013; Mielonen, Tero/L-7067-2014","Myhre, Gunnar/0000-0002-4309-476X; Kokkola, Harri/0000-0002-1404-6670; Zhang, Kai/0000-0003-0457-6368; Tsigaridis, Kostas/0000-0001-5328-819X; Zhong, Qirui/0000-0002-1397-6024; van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; Schutgens, Nick/0000-0001-9805-6384; Mielonen, Tero/0000-0003-1496-097X",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)European Commission),This research has been supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (grant no.

For a variety of scientific disciplines, model calibration by parameter quantification is therefore of central importance. As the time and cost of calibration experiments increases, the question of how to determine parameter values of required quality with a minimum number of experiments comes to the fore. In this paper, a methodology is introduced allowing to quantify and optimize achievable parameter extraction quality based on an experimental plan including a process and methods how to adapt the experimental plan for improved estimation of individually selectable parameters. The resulting parameter-individual optimal design of experiments (pi-OED) enables experimenters to extract a maximum of parameter-specific information from a given number of experiments. We demonstrate how to minimize variance or covariances of individually selectable parameter estimators by model-based calculation of the experimental designs. Using the Fisher Information Matrix in combination with the Cramer-Rao inequality, the pi-OED plan is reduced to a global optimization problem. The pi-OED workflow is demonstrated using computer experiments to calibrate a model describing calendrical aging of lithium-ion battery cells. Applying bootstrapping methods allows to also quantify parameter estimation distributions for further benchmarking. Comparing pi-OED based computer experimental results with those based on state-of-the-art designs of experiments, reveals its efficiency improvement.

Furthermore, in some ecosystems, e.g. forests, the response is not instantly visible, but the effects of the meteorological anomaly can be seen in the following year. The aim of the present paper is to select and characterize typical and anomalous years using satellite-based remote sensing data and meteorological observations during the recent years of 2000-2014 for Central Europe, based on the response of the vegetation. Materials and Methods: In the present study vegetation characteristics were described using remotely sensed official products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), namely NDVI, EVI, FPAR, LAI, GPP, and NPP, with 8-day temporal and 500 meter spatial resolution for the period of 2000-2014. The corresponding mean temperature and precipitation data (on the same grid) were derived from the Open Database for Climate Change Related Impact Studies in Central Europe (FORESEE) daily meteorological dataset. Land cover specific anomalies of the meteorological and vegetation characteristics were created and averaged on a country-scale, where the distinction between the main land cover types was based on the synergetic use of MODIS land cover and Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover 2012 datasets. Results: It has been demonstrated that the anomaly detection based solely on basic meteorological variables is ambiguous since the strength of the anomaly depends on the selected integration time period. In contrast, the effect-based approach exploiting the available, state-of-the-art remote sensing based vegetation indices is a promising tool for the characterization of the anomalous behaviour of the different land cover types. The selection of extreme years was performed in an explicit way using percentile analysis on pixel level. Conclusions: Plant status in terms of both positive and negative anomalies shows strong land cover dependency in Central Europe. This is most likely due to the differences in heat and drought resistance of the vegetation, and species composition.

However, the magnitude of this attenuation remains uncertain. A particularly important but highly uncertain process is biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is the largest natural input of N to land ecosystems globally. In order to quantify this uncertainty and estimate likely effects on terrestrial biosphere dynamics, we applied six alternative formulations of BNF spanning the range of process formulations in current state-of-the-art biosphere models within a common framework, the O-CN model: a global map of static BNF rates, two empirical relationships between BNF and other ecosystem variables (net primary productivity and evapotranspiration), two process-oriented formulations based on plant N status, and an optimality-based approach. We examined the resulting differences in model predictions under ambient and elevated atmospheric [CO2] and found that the predicted global BNF rates and their spatial distribution for contemporary conditions were broadly comparable, ranging from 108 to 148 TgNyr(-1) (median: 128 TgNyr(-1)), despite distinct regional patterns associated with the assumptions of each approach. Notwithstanding, model responses in BNF rates to elevated levels of atmospheric [CO2] (+200 ppm) ranged between 4 TgNyr(-1) (-3%) and 56 TgNyr(-1) (+42 %) (median: 7 TgNyr(-1) (+8 %)). As a consequence, future projections of global ecosystem carbon (C) storage (+ 281 to +353 Pg C, or +13 to +16 %) as well as N2O emission (-1.6 to +0.5 TgNyr(-1), or -19 to +7 %) differed significantly across the different model formulations. Our results emphasize the importance of better understanding the nature and magnitude of BNF responses to change-induced perturbations, particularly through new empirical perturbation experiments and improved model representation.","[Meyerholt, Johannes; Zaehle, Soenke] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Biogeochem Integrat Dept, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Meyerholt, Johannes] Int Max Planck Res Sch IMPRS Global Biogeochem Cy, Jena, Germany; [Zaehle, Soenke] Michael Stifel Ctr Jena Data Driven & Simulat Sci, Jena, Germany; [Smith, Matthew J.] Microsoft Res Cambridge, Sci Computat Lab, Cambridge, England",Max Planck Society; Microsoft,"Meyerholt, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Biogeochem Integrat Dept, D-07745 Jena, Germany.;Meyerholt, J (corresponding author), Int Max Planck Res Sch IMPRS Global Biogeochem Cy, Jena, Germany.",jmeyer@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Zaehle, S√∂nke/C-9528-2017","Zaehle, S√∂nke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Smith, Matthew/0000-0002-5401-1763",Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [647204],Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme(Microsoft); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This work was supported by Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (QUINCY; grant no. 647204).

For many applications, significant benefit would be expected to accrue from the versatility offered by unstructured grids. However, until very recently, available numerical methods for performing integrations oil unstructured grids could not conserve discrete dynamical invariants, a numerical model characteristic that is important for robust ocean Simulations over large space and time scales (as needed, for instance, in climate modeling applications). Our purpose in this paper is to describe such a conservative discretization scheme for rotating hydrostatic Boussinesq fluid dynamics on general triangular tessellations of the sphere, and to demonstrate its properties in a number of simulations that incorporate realistic ocean basin geometry. Several different implicit time discretizations are possible, each of which exhibits a form of exact numerical energy conservation in the absence of dissipation. The properties of this new numerical methodology are validated through analysis of a sequence of unforced nonlinear dynamical problems, which clearly demonstrate the capacity of the model to resolve the geostrophic adjustment process and the onset of baroclinic instability in collapsing density fronts. As a final test, a number of ocean modeling experiments with realistic climatological and wind-stress forcing are performed in order to investigate the manner in which different mesh structures and resolutions influence the simulated phenomenology. As the theoretical properties of the numerical methodology suggest, it is thereby shown to be both robust and stable. The further work that will be required to implement this structure in a state-of-the-art oceanic general circulation model, as well as other potential applications of the techniques, are discussed in the concluding section of the paper.

Hyphal respiration did not respond significantly to elevated CO2 and O-3. Sporocarp respiration was affected by temperature and moisture content while hyphal respiratory response to temperature was undetected over the narrower range of soil temperatures captured. Hyphal respiration comprised 31 % of soil respiration, and the ratio of hyphal respiration to soil respiration declined with elevated CO2. Hyphal biomass was reduced under all treatments though not statistically significant. Given the large fraction of soil respiration represented by mycorrhizal fungi and its sensitivity to climate, a small change in fungal respiration could strongly affect carbon budgets and cycling under climate change.

J,"Alain, H",,,,"Alain, Hubert",,,CONTROL: the extractive ecology of corn monoculture,CULTURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Monoculture; industrialization; biotechnology; extractivism; new materialism; Anthropocene,,"This article tells the history of the industrial and biotechnological development of large-scale corn agriculture, from a new materialist perspective. Addressing the large-scale economy of industrial food production as a form of more-than-human configuration, it demonstrates how corn has been made into a quintessential commodity and factor of production for a consumption-based economy. Set within discourses around the climate crisis, this account critically assesses the Anthropocene and its advocacy for human accountability in regards to the exploitation of nonhuman matters. I ask: who is the Anthropos? How does it/he/she meet with its domesticated subjects, or rather makes them into domesticable materials? Telling the history of corn monoculture from a new materialist standpoint exposes this industry's distribution of agency, power and control across a diversity of human and nonhuman actors. This is at the centre of this article's three sections: (1) an argument for inscribing extractivism within new materialist literature, (2) an account of the industrialization of corn monoculture, exposing the industry's main mechanisms and economic endeavours, as well as its ramifications with a biopolitics of invasion and (3) the biotechnological development of the industry and its shifts from a biopolitics of vegetal matter to an informational extractivism and a necropolitics of killable life. Thus I argue that if the industry of corn monoculture belongs to a broader network of detrimental industries characteristic of the Anthropocene, the geological Anthropos is not to be understood as synonymous with the human species, but as a very restrictive ecology of humans and nonhumans, including corporate, industrial, technoscientific and extractive actors. As such, the article emphasizes the moral necessity of rupturing with the narrative of the Anthropocene, a discourse better suited for supporting existing mechanisms of domination and exploitation constitutive of the economy of climate change.","[Alain, Hubert] McGill Univ, Dept Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Alain, H (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",hubertalain1@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-2386,1466-4348,,CULT STUD,Cult.

Unlike statistical models and AI models, the JULES model simulates the physical water flux under given meteorological conditions, allowing us to understand and investigate the cause and effect of environmental changes. Here we explore the possibility of this approach using a case study in the Atibaia River basin, which serves as a major water supply for metropolitan regions of Campinas and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The watershed is suffering increasing hydrological risks, which could be attributed to environmental changes, such as urbanization and agricultural activity. The increasing risks highlight the importance of evaluating the land surface processes of the watershed systematically. We explore the use of local precipitation collection in conjunction with data from a global meteorological reanalysis to simulate the basin hydrology. Our results show that key hydrological fluxes in the basin can be represented by the JULES model simulations.","[Chou, Hsi-Kai; Bray, Michaela] Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales; [Heuminski de Avila, Ana Maria] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Meteorol & Climate Res Appl Agr CEPAGRI, BR-13083871 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Cardiff University; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Chou, HK (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales.",chouh2@cardiff.ac.uk,,"HEUMINSKI DE AVILA, ANA MARIA/0000-0002-6801-8528; Chou, Hsi-Kai/0000-0002-0010-8148",Higher Education Funding Council for Wales [SP93],Higher Education Funding Council for Wales(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)),This research has been supported by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (grant no.

Nine multiparous lactating Holstein cows (131 +/- 22.6 d in milk), 3 of which were rumen fistulated, were fed 3 experimental diets in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 3 periods of 14 d of adaptation and 7 d of data and sample collection. Within squares, cows were randomly assigned to diets as follows: alfalfa hay-based diet (AHT), alfalfa and birdsfoot trefoil hay-based diet (ABT), and birdsfoot trefoil hay-based diet (BT). Intakes of dry matter and crude protein were similar across treatments, whereas ABT and BT diets resulted in decreased fiber intake compared with AHT. Feeding BT tended to increase neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with ART and ABT. Milk yield tended to increase for cows consuming ABT or BT diets. Milk true protein concentration and yield were greater for cows consuming ABT relative to those fed ART. Concentration of total volatile fatty acids tended to increase by cows fed BT compared with those fed ART and ABT. Feeding birdsfoot trefoil hay in a total mixed ration resulted in a tendency to decrease acetate proportion, but it tended to increase propionate proportion, leading to a tendency to decrease acetate-to-propionate ratio. Whereas concentration of ammonia-N was similar across treatments, cows offered BT exhibited greater microbial protein yield relative to those fed ART and ABT. Cows offered birdsfoot trefoil hay diets secreted more milk N than AHT, resulting in improved N utilization efficiency for milk N. The positive effects due to feeding birdsfoot trefoil hay were attributed to enhanced neutral detergent fiber digestion, and thus it could replace alfalfa hay in high-forage dairy diets while improving N utilization efficiencies and maintaining lactational performance compared with alfalfa hay.","[Christensen, R.

Some reflexions are suggested to the institutions and their supervision to cure it gradually.","[Colson, Isabelle] C2RMF, Dept Conservat Prevent, Travaux Art, Paris, France; [Boyer, Francois] C2RMF, Dept Conservat Prevent, Paris, France",,"Colson, I (corresponding author), C2RMF, Dept Conservat Prevent, Travaux Art, Paris, France.",isabelle.colson@culture.gouv.fr; francois.boyer@culture.gouv.fr,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,MINISTERE CULTURE & COMMUNICATION,PARIS,"3 RUE DE VALOIS, PARIS, 75033, FRANCE",1630-7305,,,IN SITU-REV PATRIMOI,,,2012,19,,,,,,,10.4000/insitu.9959,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/insitu.9959,,,27,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,V7N8W,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000421130500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Globally, by far the largest bias is introduced by not considering human adaptation, which can lead to an overestimation of coastal flood risk in 2100 by up to factor 1300. But even when considering adaptation, uncertainties in how coastal societies will adapt to sea-level rise dominate with a factor of up to 27 all other uncertainties. Other large uncertainties that have been quantified globally are associated with socio-economic development (factors 2.3-5.8), digital elevation data (factors 1.2-3.8), ice sheet models (factor 1.6-3.8) and greenhouse gas emissions (factors 1.6-2.1). Local uncertainties that stand out but have not been quantified globally, relate to depth-damage functions, defense failure mechanisms, surge and wave heights in areas affected by tropical cyclones (in particular for large return periods), as well as nearshore interactions between mean sea-levels, storm surges, tides and waves. Advancing the state-of-the-art requires analyzing and reporting more comprehensively on underlying uncertainties, including those in data, methods and adaptation scenarios. Epistemic uncertainties in digital elevation, coastal protection levels and depth-damage functions would be best reduced through open community-based efforts, in which many scholars work together in collecting and validating these data.","[Hinkel, J.; Lincke, D.] Global Climate Forum GCF, Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, J.] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, J.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Workshop Inst Anal Social Ecol Syst WINS, Berlin, Germany; [Feyen, L.; Mentaschi, L.; Vousdoukas, M.

The number of rain droplets less than 1 mm in diameter is affected by several factors, including the type of rainfall and seasonality. Over the ocean, small rain and large sea spray droplets co-exist in the same diameter size class (0.072 to 1000 mm); hence, sea spray creates uncertainty when seeking to characterize the drop size distribution (DSD) of rain droplets over the ocean. We measured droplet sizes at a marine tower using a state-of-the-art optical disdrometer, a tipping-bucket rain gauge, a wind anemometer, and a time-lapse camera, over a period that included typhoon Krosa of 2019. The number of rain droplets of diameter less than 1 mm increased monotonically as the horizontal wind speed became stronger. Thus, the shape parameter mu of the Ulbrich distribution decreased. This decreasing trend can be recognized as an increase in sea spray. During no-rainfall hours (indicated by rain gauges on the ocean tower and nearby land), sea spray DSDs were obtained at various horizontal wind speeds. Furthermore, the proportions of sea spray to rainfall at different rainfall intensities and horizontal wind speeds were determined; at a horizontal wind speed of 16 to 20 m s(-1), the average sea spray proportions were 82.7%, 19.1%, and 5.3% during total rainfall periods of 2.1 mm h(-1), 8.9 mm h(-1), and 32.1 mm h(-1), respectively. Representation of sea spray DSDs, as well as rainfall DSDs, is a key element of calculating real rainfall intensities over the open ocean.","[Okachi, Hiroki] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kita Ku, N13 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0609628, Japan; [Yamada, Tomohito J.] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Engn, Kita Ku, N13 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0609628, Japan; [Baba, Yasuyuki; Kubo, Teruhiro] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, 2500-106 Katata, Wakayama 6492201, Japan",Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; Kyoto University,"Okachi, H (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kita Ku, N13 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0609628, Japan.",hiroki-okachi@eis.hokudai.ac.jp; tomohito@eng.hokudai.ac.jp; baba@uh31.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp; kubo.teruhiro.3s@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Yamada, Tomohito/0000-0002-0031-4283; Okachi, Hiroki/0000-0001-8193-4339","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0717935561]; JSPA KAKENHI Grant [18H03791, 19H00815, 19H00782, 19J11255]; Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University [29G-09]","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; JSPA KAKENHI Grant; Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University","This research was funded by the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) Grant Number JPMXD0717935561 fromthe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan and JSPA KAKENHI Grant Number 18H03791, 19H00815, 19H00782 and 19J11255.

Sea-ice is one of the most important components of these models. Simulation of sea-ice in these models is a challenging problem. In this study, evaluation of the hind-cast data of 14 boreal summer seasons with global coupled model HadGEM3 in its seasonal set-up has been performed over the Arctic region fromMay start dates. Along with the biases of the sea-ice variables, related atmosphere and oceanic variables have also been examined. The model evaluation is focused on seasonal mean of sea-ice concentration, sea-ice thickness, ocean surface current, SST, ice-drift velocity and sea-ice extent. To diagnose the sea-ice biases, atmospheric variables like, 10m wind, 2m air temperature, sea-level pressure and ocean sub-surface temperatures were also examined. The sea-ice variables were compared with GIOMAS dataset. The atmospheric and the oceanic variables were compared with the ERA Interim and the ECMWF Ocean re-analysis (ORAP5) datasets, respectively. The model could simulate the sea-ice concentration and thickness patterns reasonably well in the Arctic Circle. However, both sea-ice concentration and thickness in the model are underestimated compared to observations. A positive (warm) bias is seen both in 2m air temperature and SST, which are consistent with the negative sea-ice bias. Biases in ocean current and related ice drift are not related to biases in the atmospheric winds. The magnitude of the oceanic subsurface warm biases is seen to be gradually decreasing with depth, but consistent with sea-ice biases. These analyses indicate a possibility of deeper warm subsurface water in the western Arctic Ocean sector (Pacific and Atlantic exchanges) affecting the negative biases in the sea-ice at the surface. The model is able to simulate reasonably well the summer sea-ice melting process and its inter-annual variability, and has useable skill for application purpose.","[Saheed, P.

At the same time, South Asian populations witnessed the widespread deposition of tephra from the Sumatran Toba super-eruption, the largest explosive volcanic event of the past two million years. Here we report new data on the lithic technology and environmental context for a southern Indian site with hominin occupation in association with Toba tephra deposits: Jwalapuram Locality 3 in the Jurreru Valley. Sedimentological and isotopic studies demonstrate that a cooling trend was in effect in this part of southern India prior to the eruption, and that thick deposits of ash in the Jurreru Valley supported grassland communities before more wooded conditions were re-established. Detailed technological analyses of an expanded lithic sample from Locality 3 suggest cultural continuity after the eruptive event, and comparisons with lithic core technologies elsewhere indicate that Homo sapiens cannot be ruled out as the creator of these Middle Palaeolithic assemblages.

However, it is well known that they may fail in properly reproducing the amount of precipitation reaching the ground, which is of paramount importance for hydrological applications. To address this issue, an integration between satellite rainfall and soil moisture SM products is proposed here by using an algorithm, SM2RAIN, which estimates rainfall from SM observations. A nudging scheme is used for integrating SM-derived and state-of-the-art rainfall products. Two satellite rainfall products are considered: H05 provided by EUMESAT and the real-time (3B42-RT) TMPA product provided by NASA. The rainfall dataset obtained through SM2RAIN, SM2R(ASC), considers SM retrievals from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The rainfall datasets are compared with quality-checked daily rainfall observations throughout the Italian territory in the period 2010-13. In the validation period 2012-13, the integrated products show improved performances in terms of correlation with an increase in median values, for 5-day rainfall accumulations, of 26% (18%) when SM2R(ASC) is integrated with the H05 (3B42-RT) product. Also, the median root-mean-square error of the integrated products is reduced by 18% and 17% with respect to H05 and 3B42-RT, respectively. The integration of the products is found to improve the threat score for medium-high rainfall accumulations. Since SM2R(ASC), H05, and 3B42-RT datasets are provided in near-real time, their integration might provide more reliable rainfall products for operational applications, for example, for flood and landslide early warning systems.","[Ciabatta, Luca; Brocca, Luca; Massari, Christian; Moramarco, Tommaso] CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, I-06128 Perugia, Italy; [Puca, Silvia; Rinollo, Angelo] Natl Civil Protect Dept, Rome, Italy; [Gabellani, Simone] Int Ctr Environm Monitoring, Savona, Italy; [Wagner, Wolfgang] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Technische Universitat Wien,"Ciabatta, L (corresponding author), CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Via Madonna Alta 126, I-06128 Perugia, Italy.",luca.ciabatta@irpi.cnr.it,"Massari, Christian/H-5037-2019; Wagner, Wolfgang/AAC-5507-2019; Ciabatta, Luca/AAW-1812-2020; Brocca, Luca/F-2854-2010; Moramarco, Tommaso/E-6726-2011","Massari, Christian/0000-0003-0983-1276; Wagner, Wolfgang/0000-0001-7704-6857; Ciabatta, Luca/0000-0003-4600-6320; Brocca, Luca/0000-0002-9080-260X; ",ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (ESA/ESRIN) [4000104814/11/I-NB]; EUMETSAT through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF); Italian Civil Protection Department,ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (ESA/ESRIN); EUMETSAT through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF); Italian Civil Protection Department,The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (ESA/ESRIN Contract 4000104814/11/I-NB; www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org) and EUMETSAT through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) (http://hsaf.meteoam.it/).

Organic aerosol performance is improved when compared to the default SOA module of COSMO-ART (SORGAM) against high temporal resolution aerosol mass spectrometer ground measurements. The impact of SOA on the overall radiative budget was investigated. The mean direct surface radiative cooling averaged over Europe is -1.2 Wm(-2), representing approximately 20% of the total effect of aerosols on the radiative budget. However, responses are not spatially correlated with the radiative forcing, due to the nonlinear interactions among changes in particle chemical composition, water content, size distribution and cloud cover. These interactions initiated by the effect of SOA on radiation are found to result even in a positive forcing in specific areas. Further model experiments showed that the availability of nitrogen oxides slightly affects SOA production, but that the aging rate constant used in the VBS approximation and boundary concentrations assumed in the model should be carefully selected. The aging of SOA is found to reduce hourly nitrate levels by up to 30 %, while the condensation of inorganic species upon pre-existing, SOA-rich particles results in a monthly average increase of 5% in sulfate and ammonium formation in the accumulation mode.","[Athanasopoulou, E.; Vogel, H.; Vogel, B.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Tsimpidi, A.

This work compares different passive cooling techniques of shading, natural ventilation, cool painting and increase in thickness of interior gypsum plaster for these buildings to tackle overheating in hot climates. The studied techniques are measured and compared in terms of indoor air temperature by calculating four indicators of maximum, minimum, average of highest 5% and average of lowest 5% temperatures as well as thermal comfort of the occupants based on two acceptability rates of ASHRAE 55 and three acceptability limits of EN 15251 standards in three climates: Porto, Nairobi and Mumbai. The findings of this comparison bring insights into the effectiveness of passive cooling techniques, that can be highly beneficial at design level. Results point out improvements by all studied techniques, even if these quantitatively depend on the presence of the occupants and the choice of the performance indicators. Finally, further indicators such as stored heat, solar radiation heat gain and surface temperature are analyzed, to explain causes and effects associated with studied passive cooling techniques. Results of these comparisons pointed out that the combined implementation of all techniques combined is effective enough to provide thermal comfort of the occupants during almost all annual occupancy in Nairobi measured by acceptability rate of 80% of ASHRAE 55 and Category III of EN 15251.

This is only to get worse, because risk is increasing due to increase in both hazard intensity, frequency and increase in consequences (increased coastal development). Adaptation requires a re-evaluation of coastal disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies and a new mix of prevention, mitigation (e.g. limiting construction in flood-prone areas) and preparedness (e.g. Early warning systems, EWS) measures. Within the EU funded project RISC-KIT the focus is on preparedness measures and its aim is to demonstrate robustness and applicability of coastal EWS (Early Warning Systems) and DSS (Decision Support Systems). Delft-FEWS, a generic tool for Early Warning Systems has been extended, to be applied at sites all across Europe. The challenges for developing a modern EWS are found in the integration of large data sets, specialised modules to process the data, and open interfaces to allow easy integration of existing modelling capacities. In response to these challenges, Delft-FEWS provides a state of the art EWS framework, which is highly customizable to the specific requirements of an individual organisation. For ten case study sites on all EU regional seas a EWS has been developed, to provide real-time (short-term) forecasts and early warnings. The EWS component is a 2D model framework of hydro-meteo and morphological models which computes hazard intensities. The total expected impact of a hazard can be obtained by using a Bayesian network DSS. This DSS, which is incorporated in the Delft-FEWS platform is a tool that links coastal multi-hazards to their socioeconomic and environmental consequences. An important innovation of the EWS/DSS lies in its application in dual mode: as a forecast and warning system and as a consistent ex-ante planning tool to evaluate the long-term vulnerability due to multiple (low-frequency) coastal hazards, under various climate-related scenarios. Generic tools which can be used to set-up a EWS/DSS for coastal regions regardless of geomorphic settings, forcing or hazard type have been developed and are available via the project website.","[Bogaard, Tom; De Kleermaeker, Simone; van Dongeren, Ap] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Jaeger, Wiebke S.] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands",Deltares; Delft University of Technology,"Bogaard, T (corresponding author), Deltares, Delft, Netherlands.",tom.bogaard@deltares.nl,,"Van Dongeren, Albertus/0000-0002-1982-4777",European Commission under the Environment Theme of the 7th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development [603458],European Commission under the Environment Theme of the 7th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development,This RISC-KIT project (contract 603458) is supported by the European Commission under the Environment (including climate change) Theme of the 7th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development.,,3,4,4,0,5,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,,,E3S WEB CONF,,,2016,,,,,,,18017,10.1051/e3sconf/20160718017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20160718017,,,4,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Regional & Urban Planning; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Public Administration; Water Resources,BG8GU,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000392270100200,View Full Record in Web of Science

In regions that include both developed and developing countries, coral reefs and the services they provide are critical for the livelihoods, economies and well being of local communities, while they are at risk due to both anthropogenic and natural threats. Coral reefs also offer to scientific research a unique array of ecological and geological processes specific to these regions. Both applied and fundamental aspects motivate conservation and management projects. Satellite and airborne remote sensing has contributed to scientific and management projects with a variety of sensors and products, including some of the earliest coral reef applications worldwide 30 years ago. High spatial resolution geomorphology, bathymetry and habitat maps provide a biophysical description of the reefs themselves. Oceanic fields, such as sea surface temperature regime and their anomalies, quantify how coral reefs are exposed to weather and climate forcing. The combined local and large scale spatial information help understand how coral reefs status and processes vary across space and time. In particular, data products are increasingly combined to map the resilience of coral reef and associated habitats, and to design conservation plans at different spatial scales. However, both high-tech state-of-the-art and user-friendly remote sensing are still not used as systematically as it could be, while most countries still need basic spatial information consistent at national and international scales, such as habitat maps. Future applied developments will need to address these gaps in priority products. At the same time, on-going research will continue to refine local and regional products relevant for the science and the management of the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean coral reefs and their environments.","Inst Rech Dev, Noumea, New Caledonia",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Andrefouet, S (corresponding author), Inst Rech Dev, Noumea, New Caledonia.",serge.andrefouet@ird.fr,,,,,,,77,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0,,,,2014,,,,,317,335,,10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_16,10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7,,19,Oceanography; Remote Sensing,Book Citation Index ‚Äì Science (BKCI-S),Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BD6CW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000362071100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus is on four separate regions: the Western Ghats (WG), the Ganges basin (GB), the Bay of Bengal (BB), and Bangladesh northeastern India (BD). Data reliability varies strongly by region, with particularly low correlations between different products for the BB and BD regions. Correlations between regions are generally not statistically significant, indicating rainfall varies independently in these four regions. The diagnosed associations between rainfall, circulation, and sea surface temperatures can be sensitive to the choice of rainfall product, and multiple precipitation products may need to be analyzed in this region to ensure that the results are robust. Enhanced precipitation in the BD region is associated with anomalous anticyclonic circulation at 850 mb and westerly anomalies along the foothills of the Tibetan Plateau, while precipitation in the other regions is associated with cyclonic flow and easterlies. These associations provide a dynamical explanation for previously reported weak, negative correlations between BD and the other regions. In addition to observed products, atmosphere-only simulations made using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS) during Project Athena are analyzed. While the simulations do not reproduce the observed interannual variations in rainfall, the fidelity of the simulated precipitation and circulation structure is comparable to or even outperforms the different state-of-the-art reanalysis products considered. Accuracy in representing interannual variability and regional structure thus appears to be independent.","[Cash, Benjamin A.; Kinter, James L., III; Adams, Jennifer; Altshuler, Eric; Huang, Bohua; Manganello, Julia; Marx, Larry] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Kinter, James L., III; Huang, Bohua; Jin, Emilia K.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Jin, Emilia K.] Korea Inst Atmospher Predict Syst, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Thomas] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany","Center for Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies; George Mason University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Cash, BA (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 287 Res Hall,Mail Stop 6C5,4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",bcash@gmu.edu,"Jung, Thomas/J-5239-2012; Kinter, James/A-8610-2015","Jung, Thomas/0000-0002-2651-1293; Kinter, James/0000-0002-6277-0559; Jin, Emilia/0000-0002-5257-3340; Cash, Benjamin/0000-0003-2295-3112; Huang, Bohua/0000-0003-4869-3849","National Science Foundation (NSF); NICS; NSF [0830068, 0957884]; NOAA [NA09OAR4310058]; NASA [NNX09AN50G]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NICS; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The IFS results described herein were obtained in the 2009-2010 Athena Project, a computationally intensive project that was carried out using the Athena supercomputer at the University of Tennessee's National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS), under the auspices of the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Many isotope-based studies show that transpiration contributes generally more than 70% to the total evaporation, while other isotope-independent techniques lead to considerably smaller transpiration fractions. This paper provides a perspective on isotope-based versus non-isotope-based partitioning studies. Some partitioning results from isotope-based methods, hydrometric measurements, and modeling are presented for comparison. Moreover, the methodological aspects of the partitioning analysis are considered, including their limitations, and explanations of possible discrepancies between the methods are discussed. We suggest sources of systematic error that may lead to biases in the results, e.g., instruments inaccuracy, assumptions used in analyses, and calibration parameters. A number of comparison studies using isotope-based methods and hydrometric measurements in the same plants and climatic conditions are consistent within the errors; however, models tend to produce lower transpiration fractions. The relatively low transpiration fraction in current state-of-the-art land-surface models calls for a reassessment of the skill of the underlying model parameterizations. The scarcity of global evaporation data makes calibration and validation of global isotope-independent and isotope-based results difficult. However, isotope-enabled land-surface and global climate modeling studies allow for the evaluation of the parameterization of land-surface models by comparing the computed water isotopologue signals in the atmosphere with the available remote sensing and flux-based data sets. Future studies that allow for this evaluation could provide a better understanding of the hydrological cycle in vegetated regions.","[Sutanto, S.

Here, we show, to our knowledge, for the first time that fossil eggshell is a previously unrecognized source of ancient DNA (aDNA). We describe the successful isolation and amplification of DNA from fossil eggshell up to 19 ka old. a DNA was successfully characterized from eggshell obtained from New Zealand (extinct moa and ducks), Madagascar (extinct elephant birds) and Australia (emu and owl). Our data demonstrate excellent preservation of the nucleic acids, evidenced by retrieval of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from many of the samples. Using confocal microscopy and quantitative PCR, this study critically evaluates approaches to maximize DNA recovery from powdered eggshell. Our quantitative PCR experiments also demonstrate that moa eggshell has approximately 125 times lower bacterial load than bone, making it a highly suitable substrate for high-throughput sequencing approaches. Importantly, the preservation of DNA in Pleistocene eggshell from Australia and Holocene deposits from Madagascar indicates that eggshell is an excellent substrate for the long-term preservation of DNA in warmer climates. The successful recovery of DNA from this substrate has implications in a number of scientific disciplines; most notably archaeology and palaeontology, where genotypes and/or DNA-based species identifications can add significantly to our understanding of diets, environments, past biodiversity and evolutionary processes.","[Oskam, Charlotte L.; Mclay, Emma; Allentoft, Morten E.; Bunce, Michael] Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Ancient DNA Lab, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Haile, James] Univ Oxford, Ancient Biomol Ctr, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Haile, James; Olsen, Maia E.; Bengtsson, Camilla; Gilbert, M.

Coastal belt along the East coast of India is thickly populated and also highly vulnerable to impact of tropical cyclones. Real-time forecasting system that provides reliable estimates on possible storm surge height, envelope and extent of onshore flooding has potential socioeconomic benefits. Conventional methods use state-of-art numerical models or ensemble of models that are computationally expensive and highly time consuming during real-time operations. This study proposes an alternate approach using soft computing techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the prediction of storm surge and onshore flooding. The proposed network architecture is proven to be viable and highly cost-effective consistently maintaining high level of computational accuracy (> 92%) thereby finding potential real-time application. As a case study, the efficacy of ANN model in simulating storm-tide and extent of onshore flooding associated with the 1999 Odisha Super cyclone have been examined. Pre-computed scenarios of storm-tide and inundation data were used to train ANN model for the entire Odisha coast with a success rate of 99%. After the training phase, computational time in prediction of storm surge and inundation is quite rapid (in order of seconds) as compared to any conventional model. Validation exercise performed to skill assess the robustness of ANN model using archived records of storm-tide and inundation obtained an accuracy of 92% and 94% respectively. Results obtained are quite encouraging demonstrating the efficacy of ANN model for real-time application and effectiveness for disaster risk reduction during tropical cyclone activity.","[Sahoo, Bishnupriya; Bhaskaran, Prasad K.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ocean Engn & Naval Architecture, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Bhaskaran, PK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ocean Engn & Naval Architecture, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",prasadlsu@yahoo.com,"Bhaskaran, Prasad/GLV-1506-2022",,"DST, Government of India","DST, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This study was conducted as a part of the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Climate Change studies established at IIT Kharagpur funded by DST, Government of India.

However, the complexity of the sample matrix has largely prevented degradation studies under realistic conditions. Here composts and fertilizers from state-of-the-art municipal combined anaerobic/aerobic biowaste treatment plants were investigated for residues of BDP. We found BDP fragments > 1 mm in significant numbers in the final composts intended as fertilizer for agriculture and gardening. Compared to pristine compostable bags, the recovered BDP fragments showed differences in their material properties, which potentially renders them less prone to further biodegradation. BDP fragments < 1 mm were extracted in bulk and came up to 0.43 wt% of compost dry weight. Finally, the liquid fertilizer produced during the anaerobic treatment contained several thousand BDP fragments < 500 mu m per liter. Hence, our study questions, if currently available BDP are compatible with applications in areas of environmental relevance, such as fertilizer production.","[Steiner, Thomas; Freitag, Ruth] Univ Bayreuth, Proc Biotechnol, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Zhang, Yuanhu; Agarwal, Seema; Greiner, Andreas] Univ Bayreuth, Macromol Chem 2, Bayreuth, Germany; [Moeller, Julia N.; Loeder, Martin G.

The article explores the interaction between library architecture and sustainability by reviewing the many complex strategies employed for saving or recycling evermore scarce natural resources. Although the focus is upon energy consumption, the article also investigates how concepts of comfort and climate are changing under the impact of environmental sustainability. These topics are discussed mainly in the context of public and university libraries built over the past decade, with some reference to library designs still awaiting construction. The methodology is developed primarily through comparative case studies, exploring the approach to environmental sustainability under a number of headings drawn from widely employed environmental assessment methods such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), commonly employed in the United Kingdom and much of Europe; and LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), the assessment tool frequently used to anticipate the environmental credentials of projects still on the drawing board in the United States and Asia. In many ways the architectural approach to the twenty-first century library is returning to the roots of the modernist library found in Scandinavia with its emphasis upon high levels of daylight, natural materials, social harmony, and contact with nature.","[Edwards, Brian W.] Edinburgh Coll Art, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh College of Art,"Edwards, BW (corresponding author), Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Sch Architecture, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,,,,,13,20,20,2,23,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0024-2594,,,LIBR TRENDS,Libr.

In this paper, we propose a novel per-image performance prediction for semantic segmentation, with (i) no need for additional sensors (sensor efficiency), (ii) no need for additional training data (data efficiency), and (iii) no need for a dedicated retraining of the semantic segmentation (training efficiency). Specifically, we extend an already trained semantic segmentation network having fixed parameters with an image reconstruction decoder. After training and a subsequent regression, the image reconstruction quality is evaluated to predict the semantic segmentation performance. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness with a new state-of-the-art benchmark both on KITTI and Cityscapes for imageonly input methods, on Cityscapes even excelling a LiDAR-supported benchmark.","[Baer, Andreas; Klingner, Marvin; Loehdefink, Jonas; Fingscheidt, Tim] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany; [Hueger, Fabian; Schlicht, Peter] CARIAD SE, Berlin, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology,"Bar, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany.",andreas.baer@tu-bs.de; m.klingner@tu-bs.de; j.loehdefink@tu-bs.de; fabian.hueger@volkswagen.de; peter.schlicht@volkswagen.de; t.fingscheidt@tu-bs.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action,"The research leading to these results is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Actionwithin the project Methoden und Massnahmen zur Absicherung von KI basierten Wahrnehmungsfunktionen fur das automatisierte Fahren (KI-Absicherung).

The sputtered TiOx/Ag/AZO (AZO: Al-doped ZnO) DMD electrode yields performance beyond the current state-of-the-art for transparent electrodes on PET, with an average transmittance larger than 85% (including the substrate) in the range 400-700 nm and sheet resistance below 6 O/square. Within a broad visible spectral range, the transmittance of the flexible electrode surpasses the transmittance of the bare PET. This performance was enabled by the use of a polymer layer between the PET and the DMD electrode. The interlayer modifies the growth of the TiOx on the flexible substrate, rendering it similar to its growth on glass. This markedly increases the transmittance of the DMD electrode and decreases its sheet resistance. The presented electrode has a large potential for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, outperforming the widely-used indium-tin-oxide (ITO) on flexible substrates. (c) 2019 The Authors.

The aim of the project, supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, was to develop a broadly accepted tool that provides investors and other stakeholders with a sound basis for the assessment of stranding risks. Design/methodology/approach The tool calculates the annual carbon emissions (baseline emissions) of a given asset or portfolio and assesses the stranding risks, by making use of science-based decarbonisation pathways. To account for ongoing climate change, the tool considers the effects of grid decarbonisation, as well as the development of heating and cooling-degree days. Findings The paper provides property-specific carbon emission pathways, as well as valuable insight into state-of-the-art carbon risk assessment and management measures and thereby paves the way towards a low-carbon building stock. Further selected risk indicators at the asset (e.g. costs of greenhouse gas emissions) and aggregated levels (e.g. Carbon Value at Risk) are considered. Research limitations/implications The approach described in this paper can serve as a model for the realisation of an enhanced tool with respect to other countries, leading to a globally applicable instrument for assessing stranding risks in the commercial real estate sector. Practical implications The real estate industry is endangered by the downside risks of climate change, leading to potential monetary losses and write-downs. Accordingly, this approach enables stakeholders to assess the exposure of their assets to stranding risks, based on energy and emission data. Social implications The CRREM tool reduces investor uncertainty and offers a viable basis for investment decision-making with regard to stranding risks and retrofit planning. Originality/value The approach pioneers a way to provide investors with a profound stranding risk assessment based on science-based decarbonisation pathways.","[Spanner, Maximilian M.] Univ Regensburg, Kompetenzzentrum Nachhaltigkeit Immobilienwirtsch, Int Real Estate Business Sch, Regensburg, Germany; [Wein, Julia] IIO Inst Real Estate Econ, Worgl, Austria",University of Regensburg,"Spanner, MM (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Kompetenzzentrum Nachhaltigkeit Immobilienwirtsch, Int Real Estate Business Sch, Regensburg, Germany.",maximilian.spanner@iioe.at; julia.wein@iioe.at,,,European Union [785058]; IIO Institute for Real Estate economics (Austria); University of Alicante (Spain); Ulster University (United Kingdom); GRESB (Netherlands); Tilburg University's TIAS Business School (Netherlands),European Union(European Commission); IIO Institute for Real Estate economics (Austria); University of Alicante (Spain); Ulster University (United Kingdom); GRESB (Netherlands)(Netherlands Government); Tilburg University's TIAS Business School (Netherlands),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 785058.

Based on leads from the literature, technology interventions required to motivate farmers to adopt millets again have been identified. It is concluded that by adopting decortication, parboiling, and germination, it is possible to enhance the nutritional and sensory properties of millets. Value-added and functional foods, including the fast-moving ones (baked, extruded ready-to-eat meal, etc.) can be designed using composite flours containing millets, like Kodo and Kutki, to drive the demand for these grains. This will help strategize plans for making millets, a preferred crop again for the sake of the sustainability of agriculture and addressing malnutrition.

This wastefulness of resources leads to the emission of unnecessary greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming and climate change. The solution proposed by the SORT project is to recycle'' the surplus of food by reconditioning it into animal feed or fuel for biogas/biomass power plants. In order to maximize the earnings and minimize the costs, several choices must be made during the reconditioning process. Given the extremely complex nature of the process, Decision Support Systems (DSSs) could be helpful to reduce the human effort in decision making. In this paper, we present a DSS for food recycling developed using two approaches for finding the optimal solution: one based on Binary Linear Programming (BLP) and the other based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which outperform our previous approach based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) on Finite Domains (CLP(FD)). In particular, the BLP and the CLP(FD) approaches are developed in (ECLPSe)-P-i, a Prolog system that interfaces with various state-of-the-art Mathematical and Constraint Programming solvers. The ASP approach, instead, is developed in clingo. The three approaches are compared on several synthetic datasets that simulate the operative conditions of the DSS.","[Chesani, Federico; Mello, Paola] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Informat Sci & Ingn, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Cota, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Matemat Fis & Informat, Parco Area Sci 53-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Riguzzi, Fabrizio] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Matemat & Informat, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy; [Gavanelli, Marco; Lamma, Evelina] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Ingn, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Parma; University of Ferrara; University of Ferrara,"Cota, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Matemat Fis & Informat, Parco Area Sci 53-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy.",federico.chesani@unibo.it; giuseppe.cota@unife.it; marco.gavanelli@unife.it; evelina.lamma@unife.it; paola.mello@unibo.it; fabrizio.riguzzi@unife.it,"mello, paola/GQH-4065-2022; Cota, Giuseppe/AAU-3295-2020; Fabrizio, Riguzzi/C-7679-2012","Cota, Giuseppe/0000-0002-3780-6265; Fabrizio, Riguzzi/0000-0003-1654-9703; Gavanelli, Marco/0000-0001-7433-5899","SORT project by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research [SCN_00367, 2427]","SORT project by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research","This work was supported by the SORT project, promoted by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research.

Forests not only produce wood - a renewable resource that is increasingly replacing fossil-based materials - but also preserve biodiversity and store massive amounts of carbon. Thus, a truly optimal forest policy has to balance profit-oriented logging with ecological and societal interests, and should thus be solved as a multi-objective optimization problem. Economic forest research, however, has largely focused on profit maximization. Recent publications still scalarize the problem a priori by assigning weights to objectives. In this paper, we formulate a multi-objective forest management problem where profit, carbon storage, and biodiversity are maximized. We obtain Pareto-efficient forest management strategies by utilizing three state-of-the-art Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), and by incorporating domain-specific knowledge through customized evolutionary operators. An analysis of Pareto-efficient strategies and their harvesting schedules in the design space clearly shows the benefits of the proposed approach. Unlike many EMO application studies, we demonstrate how a systematic post-optimality trade-off analysis can be applied to choose a single preferred solution. Our pioneering work on sustainable forest management explores an entirely new application area for MOEAs with great societal impact.","[Back, Philipp; Suominen, Antti; Malo, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland; [Tahvonen, Olli] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Blank, Julian; Deb, Kalyanmoy] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Aalto University; University of Helsinki; Michigan State University,"Back, P (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland.",philipp.back@aalto.fi; antti.suominen@aalto.fi; pekka.malo@aalto.fi; olli.tahvonen@helsinki.fi; blankjul@egr.msu.edu; kdeb@egr.msu.edu,"Malo, Pekka/G-2348-2013","Back, Philipp/0000-0002-1766-5055",,,,,37,0,0,1,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-7128-5,,,,2020,,,,,1046,1054,,10.1145/3377930.3389837,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3377930.3389837,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BQ5JD,,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000605292300121,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conventional empirical methods for formulating these possess some shortcomings. The artificial intelligence approach emerges as the best possible solution to map the relationships between climatic parameters and ET, even with limited knowledge of the interactions between variables. This review presents the state-of-the-art application of artificial intelligence models in ET estimation, along with different types and sources of data. This paper discovers the most significant climatic parameters for different climate patterns. The characteristics of the basic artificial intelligence models are also explored in this review. To overcome the pitfalls of the individual models, hybrid models which use techniques such as data fusion and ensemble modeling, data decomposition as well as remote sensing-based hybridization, are introduced. In particular, the principles and applications of the hybridization techniques, as well as their combinations with basic models, are explained. The review covers most of the related and excellent papers published from 2011 to 2019 to keep its relevancy in terms of time frame and field of study. Guidelines for the future prospects of ET estimation in research are advocated. It is anticipated that such work could contribute to the development of agriculture-based economy.","[Chia, Min Yan; Huang, Yuk Feng; Koo, Chai Hoon; Fung, Kit Fai] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Jalan Sungai Long, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),"Huang, YF (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Jalan Sungai Long, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",chiamy94@gmail.com; huangyf@utar.edu.my; kooch@utar.edu.my; fkfpanda@hotmail.com,"Chia, Min Yan/AAZ-3218-2021; Koo, Chai Hoon/L-2240-2017; Huang, Yuk Feng/J-5265-2016","Koo, Chai Hoon/0000-0001-7287-3394; Huang, Yuk Feng/0000-0001-6565-947X","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia through Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund [IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/2018-C2/K03]; UTAR","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia through Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund; UTAR","This research was funded by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia through Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund under project number IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/2018-C2/K03.

The EPS is found to be skillful in predicting rainfall during the southwest and northeast monsoon seasons, as well as temperature during the summer and winter seasons, across different subdivisions of India. In addition, the EPS is noted to be skillful in predicting selected extremes in rainfall and temperature.

As a 'new paradigm' in NGH production schemes, the non-destructive gas exchange as one of the most stable and promising NGH recovery approaches has received much attention in the fields of physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, civil engineering, petroleum engineering and geology. In this review, we assess the state-of-the-art gas exchange concept for NGH production by understanding its principles and developments, with emphasis on another technical breakthrough using the CO2 + N-2 gas mixture injection. After establishing the fundamentals of the gas exchange process, we make a general survey of the NGH field production in the North Slope of Alaska in 2012, which practically adopted the gas exchange as a key technology. Several recent international NGH field production tests that basically use depressurization are also briefly analyzed for comparison. We suggest that the gas exchange method is ready to be tested in the NGH deposits with the valuable lessons learned from past pioneering tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our arguments regard, therefore, the local history of a discipline (Romanian aesthetics) and the more general history of critical ideas. The first objective of the research is to explain the reasons of the partial, but symbolically significant assimilation of Vianu's aesthetics within the Marxist-Leninist doctrinary climate. Vianu's balanced conception upon the nature and functions of art, his consideration of extra-artistic factors or of aesthetic heteronomy were salutary in view of postwar dogmatic aestheticians. The second aim of the study is to evaluate the relations between the domains of general aesthetics and of current literary criticism after 1964, which were based on dissimilar conceptions of the aesthetic. As a consequence of that, the reception (and rereading) of Tudor Vianu's aesthetic work was polarized: on the one hand, academic aesthetics, largely dogm-dependent, reassessed the author as a classic reference, on the other hand, literary critics - and supporters of aesthetic autonomy - did not meet in any way with Vianu's views upon aesthetic heteronomy.","[Stan, Adriana] Univ Babes Bolyai, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Stan, A (corresponding author), Univ Babes Bolyai, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",,"Stan, Adriana/AAT-5218-2021",,Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD); European Social Fund; Romanian Government [SOP HRD/159/1.5/S/136077],Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Romanian Government(Romanian Government),"This paper was supported by the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD), financed from the European Social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the contract number SOP HRD/159/1.5/S/136077.",,23,0,0,0,1,EDITURA TRACUS ARTE,BUCHAREST,"STR PICTOR SAVA HENTIA NR 2, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 011162, ROMANIA",1841-5377,2247-8353,,PHILOL JASSYENSIA,Philol.

The special feature of this empirical model is using the spatial and temporal information of predictor-predictand coupled patterns to predict the temporally varying predictand field at all-time leads (i.e., 10-35 days) at once. A 10-year hindcast result shows that, different from previous statistical models, the skill scores of the STPM dropped slowly with forecast lead times. Useful skills can be detected at 30-35 day leads over most tropical regions. The highest temporal correlation coefficient of 0.4-0.5 appears over the Maritime Continent (Indian and western North Pacific monsoon regions) in boreal winter (summer), exceeding a 99 % confidence level. The STPM is also capable in predicting the spatial evolutions of convective anomalies, including the zonal and meridional propagation of OLRA. The forecast of the Real-time Multivariate MJO indices shows that the STPM attains a higher skill than previous statistical models. The STPM also shows comparable skills with the state-of-the-art dynamic models during the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation campaign period, especially at 15-day and longer leads.","[Zhu, Zhiwei; Li, Tim; Hsu, Pang-Chi; He, Jinhai] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Lab Climate & Environm Change, CDRC ESMC, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zhiwei; Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Li, T (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, 1680 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",zhiweizh@hawaii.edu; timli@hawaii.edu,"Zhu, Zhiwei/N-2679-2016","Zhu, Zhiwei/0000-0002-4885-1299","China National 973 project [2015CB453200]; CMA [GYHY201006020, GYHY201306032]; NSFC [41475084]; ONR [N00014-1210450]; priority academic program development of Jiangsu Higher Education institutions (PAPD); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20140046]; JAMSTEC",China National 973 project(National Basic Research Program of China); CMA; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); priority academic program development of Jiangsu Higher Education institutions (PAPD); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); JAMSTEC,"The authors thank Dr. Xiouhua Fu for discussions and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Now is a critical moment to ask how health promotion might become more responsive to and representative of people's daily realities. Also how it can become a more inclusive partner in, and collaborative conduit of, knowledge-one capable of both informing intellects and transforming hearts. It needs to feel the pulse of the fierce urgency of now, and perhaps nothing can reveal this pulse more than the creative power of art-especially poetry. Drawing from critical and Black feminist theory, I use commentary in prose to conceptualize and call for an epistemically just health promotion guided by poetry as praxis-not just as method. I posit that, as praxis rooted in lived realities, poetry becomes experiential excavation and illumination; a practice of community, communion, and solidarity; a site and source of healing; and a space to create new narratives of health to forge new paths toward its promotion. I accordingly suggest a need to view and value poetry as a critical scholarship format to advance health promotion knowledge, discourse, and action toward a more humanized pursuit-and narrative-of health equity.","[Petteway, Ryan J.] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",Portland State University,"Petteway, RJ (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, OHSU PSU Sch Publ Hlth, 506 SW Mill St,Suite 450, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",petteway@pdx.edu,,,,,,,54,7,7,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1524-8399,1552-6372,,HEALTH PROMOT PRACT,Health Promot.

The main purpose has been to examine university student perceptions of teaching effectiveness and its influence on students' academic engagement. The sample is composed by 782 students from 16 universities. Data have been collected with a transversal design by using the instruments My Teacher Questionnaire and the Academic Engagement Scale, both with a likert format and adapted in the study population. Findings suggest differences concerning teachers' gender and type of studies: male teachers are perceived by their students as better, and teachers belonging to studies of Arts and Humanities, Social and Legal Sciences and Health Sciences are also perceived more positively. Regarding students' engagement results confirm the predictive power of classroom management, activating teaching and differentiation domains. The percentage of explained variance is bigger for emotional engagement than for behavioural one. This kind of investigations give us very interesting information in order to identify which aspects of higher education need to be reinforced and which ones, on the contrary, are already positively perceived by students.

In this work, we present a new methodology for developing a detailed performance understanding of ML benchmarks. To demonstrate our approach we investigate two emerging SciML benchmark applications from cosmology and climate, ComsoFlow and DeepCAM, as well as ResNet-50, a well-known image classification model. We develop and validate performance models that explore the key architectural artifacts, including memory requirements, data reuse, and performance efficiency across both single- and multiple-GPU computations. Our methodology also focuses on the complexity of data-movement across storage and memory hierarchies, and leverages our performance models to capture key components of runtime execution while highlighting design tradeoffs. Although our work focuses on image-processing methods on GPU-based HPC systems, our approach is applicable to a variety of ML algorithmic domains and emerging AI accelerators. Overall, our insights will help computer architects and data scientists understand performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities to improve SciML design and system efficiency.","[Ibrahim, Khaled Z.; Tan Nguyen; Hai Ah Nam; Bhimji, Wahid; Farrell, Steven; Oliker, Leonid; Rowan, Michael; Wright, Nicholas J.; Williams, Samuel] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, NERSC CRD, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Ibrahim, KZ (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, NERSC CRD, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Wright, Nicholas/HHY-7227-2022",,"Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program in the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program in the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This material is based upon work supported by the Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program in the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under Award Number DE-AC02-05CH11231 and used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) which is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.",,22,1,1,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-6654-1118-9,,,,2021,,,,,7,17,,10.1109/PMBS54543.2021.00007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PMBS54543.2021.00007,,,11,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS7BR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000758429300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts. First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks. The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer learning and enable rapid progress in remote sensing applications.(1)","[Manas, Oscar; Lacoste, Alexandre; Vazquez, David; Rodriguez, Pau] Element AI, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Manas, Oscar; Giro-i-Nieto, Xavier] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Manas, O (corresponding author), Element AI, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Manas, O (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain.",oscmansan@gmail.com; pau.rodriguez@servicenow.com,"Rodr√≠guez L√≥pez, Pau/I-2762-2015","Rodr√≠guez L√≥pez, Pau/0000-0002-1689-8084",,,,,48,19,20,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-2812-5,,,,2021,,,,,9394,9403,,10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00928,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT1JX,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000798743208014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the deforestation is thought to occur in lowland forests, whereas the region's mountainous highlands undergo very limited deforestation. However, regional reports of cropland expansion in some highland areas suggest that this assumption is inaccurate. Here we investigate patterns of forest change and cropland expansion in the region for the twenty-first century, based on multiple streams of state-of-the-art satellite imagery. We find large increases in cultivated areas that have not been documented or projected. Many of these cultivated areas have evolved from forests that vary in health and status, including primary and protected forests, or from recovering lands that were on a trajectory to become secondary forests. These areas all have different biophysical features than croplands. We estimate that an area of 82 billion m(2) has been developed into croplands in the Southeast Asian highlands. Some portion of this land-use change is probably attributable to agricultural intensification on formerly swidden agriculture lands; however, a substantial proportion is from new forest loss. Our findings are in marked contrast with projections of land-cover trends that currently inform the prediction of future climate change, terrestrial carbon storage, biomass, biodiversity, and land degradation.","[Zeng, Zhenzhong; Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Estes, Lyndon] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Ziegler, Alan D.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore; [Chen, Anping] Purdue Univ, Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Searchinger, Timothy] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hua, Fangyuan] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England; [Guan, Kaiyu] Univ Illinois, Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL USA; [Jintrawet, Attachai] Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Fac Agr, Chiang Mai, Thailand",Princeton University; Clark University; National University of Singapore; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Princeton University; University of Cambridge; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Chiang Mai University,"Zeng, ZZ (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",zzeng@princeton.edu,", dr dr/AAA-5406-2022; Guan, Kaiyu/N-5772-2015; Hua, Fangyuan/CAA-3871-2022; Chen, Anping/H-9960-2014; Zeng, Zhenzhong/A-2212-2019","Guan, Kaiyu/0000-0002-3499-6382; Hua, Fangyuan/0000-0001-8514-8757; Chen, Anping/0000-0003-2085-3863; Zeng, Zhenzhong/0000-0001-6851-2756; Estes, Lyndon/0000-0002-9358-816X",Lamsam-Thailand Sustain Development [B0891],Lamsam-Thailand Sustain Development,"This study was supported by Lamsam-Thailand Sustain Development (B0891).

The parameterizations newly incorporated are Chou and Suarez (2002) for solar radiation and Chou et al. (2003) modified by Chou and Lee (2005) for infrared radiation, respectively, while the previous schemes are based on Oh (1989) for both processes. The advanced packages result in increased biases in the clear-sky shortwave fluxes. However, unlike the random errors produced by the previous parameterizations, those biases are systematic and hence understandable to a considerable extent. Updating surface reflectivity and inclusion of aerosol radiative forcings are inferred to be essential to reduce the biases over the global land and the global ocean, respectively. Meanwhile, the clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation biases are generally decreased and change in sign. Again, the biases are explainable and attributed to the temperature biases and weakening of greenhouse effects due to the reduction in the tropospheric water vapor. The implementation rectifies the simulated temperature structures in the upper troposphere and stratosphere, entailing improved zonal wind in terms of the intensity and position of the polar night jet and the subtropical jet, and the separation between these two jet cores. The simulated wintertime stationary waves also show desirable changes. The amplitudes of wave activity are intensified as a result of the realistic southward displacement of the modeled subtropical westerly jets. The vertical and horizontal phase propagations of the longest two zonal waves become comparable to those of the observed. However, in spite of the realistic meridional temperature gradient reproduced in the summer hemispheric stratosphere, the seasonal reversal of the stratospheric zonal wind direction remains unsatisfactory.","[Kim, Hyung-Jin] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Chung, Il-Ung; Lee, Kyu-Tae] Gangneung Wonju Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Kangnung, South Korea",University of Hawaii System; Kangnung Wonju National University,"Kim, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, 1680 East West Rd,POST 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",hyungjin@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,56,3,3,0,2,KOREAN METEOROLOGICAL SOC,SEOUL,"SHINKIL-DONG 508, SIWON BLDG 704, YONGDUNGPO-GU, SEOUL, 150-050, SOUTH KOREA",1976-7633,1976-7951,,ASIA-PAC J ATMOS SCI,Asia-Pac.

The challenge will be to build them smart with a minimal usage of non-renewable energy, minimal production of pollution, and minimal cost of energy dollars. Other important issues in building include increasing the comfort, health, and safety of people who live and work in them. Indeed, buildings consume many of the natural resources and are responsible for many problems. Now, in the 21st century, people are slowly beginning to realize the necessity of green architecture where new aspects and technologies started to emerge in terms of green buildings such as green walls which are considered a new prospect for the phenomenon of urban heat island and energy conservation aspects [1,5]. This research will display the meanings, the advantages and the techniques of the living wall as a part of the sustainable strategy for the urban environment. The Green vertical surfaces can contribute significant environmental, social and economic benefits to the built environment. moreover the research will display why this emerging technology should be considered as a valuable part of the design process for addressing climate change and energy crisis. The living wall could also function for urban agriculture, urban gardening, or for its beauty as art. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate sick building syndrome. Living walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens. Finally, the research will conclude with several recommendations for the using of living walls technique which suits the arid climate as a part of sustainable strategy for the urban environment.","[Sheweka, Samar; Magdy, Nourhan] British Univ Egypt, Dept Architecture, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); British University in Egypt,"Sheweka, S (corresponding author), British Univ Egypt, Dept Architecture, Cairo, Egypt.",Samar.sheweka@bue.edu.eg; Nourhan.Magdy@bue.edu.eg,"Magdy, Norhan/AAD-6040-2022; Bayomi, Norhan/AGD-8833-2022","Bayomi, Norhan/0000-0002-6903-5469",,,,,15,61,61,1,59,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1876-6102,,,ENRGY PROCED,,,2011,,,,,592,599,,10.1016/j.egypro.2011.05.068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2011.05.068,,,8,Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BYE94,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000298294900068,View Full Record in Web of Science

He argues that this shift in technology has fundamentally shaped our epistemology, and it is almost impossible to comprehend anything outside the technological enframing of knowledge. The exception is when something breaks down, and the fault 'shows up' in fresh ways. Stiegler has several important addendums to Heidegger's thesis. Heidegger fails to fully appreciate the early Greek myth of Prometheus, and the technological depth that fire offers all human societies. The fall, or failure, is doubled in the myth of Prometheus, and is at the root of all cultures. Since the onset of Information Technology, the acceleration of life is disorientating our Being. I argue the fall in both Heidegger and Stiegler has encaptured their imagination. Education is vital for generating the imaginary, along with the ability to think critically, and ensures the authenticity of political processes, but as importantly, it helps us to imagine the future beyond the Armaggedon scenarios of climate change, and ecological devastation.

Reinforcing the transmission lines or building new ones is a process that is made difficult due to authorization issues related with environmental and public acceptance concerns. Developing innovative conductors for overhead lines with enhanced performances with respect to the traditional ones would bring benefits in terms of energy efficiency increases in transmission and distribution grids without requiring the substitution of the existing towers. The project CALAJOULE (the genesis of the acronym comes from the union of the Italian verb calare-to decrease-to the third person singular, namely cala i.e., decreases, and of Joule, obvious reference to the active losses), cofinanced by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development in the framework of the Ricerca di Sistema program, aims at proposing innovative solutions for overhead line conductors for the containment of Joule power losses. In this paper, starting from the state-of-the-art of the currently adopted conductors, the main innovative solutions resulting from the project are presented and compared with the traditional ones to evaluate the achievable reduction in Joule losses.","[Benato, Roberto; Caldon, Roberto; Chiarelli, Antonio; Coppo, Massimiliano; Sessa, Sebastian Dambone; Modesti, Michele; Piovesan, Francesca] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Garesci, Claudio] NES Spa, I-89052 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Mimo, Debora; Mora, Luca] Angeli Prodotti Srl, I-35023 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Benato, R (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",roberto.benato@unipd.it,"COPPO, Massimiliano/AAH-5616-2019; Chiarelli, Antonio/AAW-6289-2021","COPPO, Massimiliano/0000-0002-1255-6263; CHIARELLI, ANTONIO/0000-0002-6398-2940; Dambone Sessa, Sebastian/0000-0002-1921-9892; Benato, Roberto/0000-0003-2235-7927; Modesti, Michele/0000-0002-5805-5587",Ministry of Economic Development [CCSEB_00176],"Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)","This research was funded by Ministry of Economic Development in the framework of the Ricerca di Sistema Programme, grant number CCSEB_00176.",,30,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,2-Aug,2019,16,,,,,,3107,10.3390/en12163107,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12163107,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,IV7NP,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000484454000070,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this was true for patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and living in Nordland County, a region with a challenging geography and climate and having, several small and remote communities and only 1 department of oncology. The latter is located in the main city, Bodo. We also compared a subgroup living in communities having lower average annual income (less than NOK 240,000 (equivalent to USD 28,600)) with patients living in Bodo (NOK 285,000 (USD 33,900)). Overall 288 patients were included and stratified into 3 subgroups (favourable distance and income, unfavourable distance and income, and unfavourable distance and favourable income). No statistically significant differences were observed regarding patient characteristics. There was no indication towards under-treatment among patients from the distant regions or the lower income region. Given that disparities were not observed, it was not surprising to see comparable survival outcomes (p=0.35).

Since Kenya is a developing country, there is need to manage the sometimes competing interests of development, such as infrastructure development, and conservation. To achieve this, tools to effectively monitor the state of Kenya's various ecosystems are essential. In this paper we propose a biodiversity monitoring software tool that integrates acoustic indices of biodiversity, recognition of species of interest based on their vocalizations and acoustic census. This tool can be used by non-experts to determine the current state of their ecosystems by monitoring the state of bird species that serve as indicator taxa and whose abundance is related to the abundance of other terrestrial vertebrates including the  big five. The tool we propose exploits state-of-the art advances in signal processing and machine learning to perform biodiversity monitoring, bird species detection and census in a joint framework. Using publicly available data we demonstrate how current acoustic indices of biodiversity can be improved by incorporating machine learning based audio segmentation algorithms. We also show how open source toolkits can be used to build bird species recognition systems.

These pilot projects targeted a number of landscape and climate settings that are challenging for geochemical mapping, and applied increasingly lower sampling densities, from c. 1 site/300 km(2) to c. 1 site/2100 km(2). Selected results are presented from pilot geochemical surveys in the Riverina, Gawler and Thomson regions, as well as results from modelling aimed at testing the robustness of ultra-low sampling densities in Australia. The salient conclusions are that: (1) geochemical surveys sampling surface and near-surface transported regolith are capable of identifying major lithologies and mineralization below the cover; and (2) a sampling strategy targeting outlet sediments of large catchments allows the application of ultra-low sampling densities in Australia. These findings overcome the main hurdles met by earlier attempts at designing a nation-wide geochemical survey. The strategy for the resulting National Geochemical Survey of Australia (NGSA) project, recently approved for funding under the Australian Government's Onshore Energy Security Initiative, is outlined. By 2011, the NGSA will produce a publicly available multi-element, internally consistent and state-of-the-art regolith geochemical database and atlas to support decision-makers.","[de Caritat, Patrice; Lech, Megan E.; McPherson, Andrew A.] Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Geoscience Australia,,Patrice.deCaritat@ga.gov.au,"de+Caritat, Patrice/AAZ-2456-2020","de+Caritat, Patrice/0000-0002-4185-9124",,,,,60,34,34,0,5,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBL HOUSE,BATH,"UNIT 7, BRASSMILL ENTERPRISE CENTRE, BRASSMILL LANE, BATH BA1 3JN, AVON, ENGLAND",1467-7873,2041-4943,,GEOCHEM-EXPLOR ENV A,Geochem.-Explor.

Retrieving AOD from space-borne sensors' observations has become the primary technique for monitoring aerosol loading on a large scale. There is currently a renewed interest in designing new satellite sensors and developing more advanced retrieval algorithms to measure AOD from space in order to better quantify concentrations of particulate matters (PMs) for advanced air quality management, environmental health assessment, and climate change studies. However, retrieving high-resolution AOD at varying scales is still a challenging task due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in sensing, algorithmic synthesis constraints, downscaling issues, and data gaps resulting from adverse impacts such as cloud contamination. Current state-of-the-art technologies still do not permit delicate urban-scale environmental health studies based on appropriate AOD-PMs relationships. This review paper provides a holistic view of the major advances in AOD measurements, elucidates the limitations of current AOD products, presents the challenges with respect to the derivation of high-resolution AOD, and highlights perspectives regarding the possible improvements of satellite-based AOD estimation.","[Wei, Xiaoli; Bai, Kaixu] East China Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xiaoli; Bai, Kaixu] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xiaoli; Chang, Ni-Bin] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Gao, Wei] Colorado State Univ, USDA, UV B Monitoring & Res Program, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gao, Wei] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Colorado State University,"Chang, NB (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",nchang@ucf.edu,"wei, xiaoli/AAO-7139-2021; Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022",,UCF Global Program; China Scholarship Council,UCF Global Program; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),The authors would like to acknowledge the space agencies around the globe which provide data/information used in this study.

However, measuring and testing the tall or complex geometric thermal bridge constructions are rarely done and remain a challenge. Therefore an innovative climate chamber design will be established. It is designed to investigate the performance of multifunctional active fa ade systems, including the roof components and its constructive joints. One of the challenging tasks is the provision of the pre-defined stable boundary conditions. This is an immanent precondition for the calibration and validation of simulation models. Particular difficulties in this setup are the specimen dimensions of up to 4x7 meters and corner details of corresponding size. The specifics of the guard construction for the hot-box side, as well as details of equipment connections, joints and breakthroughs are illustrated and discussed.

The number of new cultivars developed for each of these regions has gradually increased, with each region producing its own typical hemp cultivars for different purposes. In this article, the state of the art of fiber hemp breeding programs in Europe, China, and Canada are reviewed. The breeding strategies and tools used in the breeding of hemp cultivars are discussed. We also provide an overview of genetic diversity in hemp for different traits. In addition, the current knowledge of the main breeding goals for fiber hemp, which are an improvement of fiber quality and fiber yield, breeding for specific cannabinoid profiles, control of flowering behavior, male flowering control, and breeding of cultivars for specific environments are evaluated.

This essay, with reference to three of Anita Desai's early novels, examines post-independence malaise as reflected in the internal conflicts of her female protagonists. These conflicts can be seen as symptomatic of contradictions within the Indian nationalist discourse, as Desai both rejects and reproduces its dominant structures and symbols. The ideological underpinnings of nationalism that are available to Desai and her protagonists are tried and found wanting, but alternative models are either lacking or rendered inarticulate by the political climate. The novels' themes and conceptual frameworks are caught between nationalist rhetoric and women's lived realities, producing impossible double-binds that result only in self-destruction. Desai's work is illuminated by a growing body of scholarship on the gendered construction of Indian nationalism in the colonial period, when art emergent middle class reshaped the figure of Woman to serve nationalist interests. With the current crisis of the Indian nation-state and the search for new conceptual models, it is important to revisit early post-independence women's writing and let women speak for themselves.",,,"Rege, J (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL,HANOVER,NH 03755, USA.",,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,1,CARFAX PUBL CO,ABINGDON,"PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE",0958-9236,,,J GENDER STUD,J.

This new paradigm implies not only a gradual phasing out of fossil fuels as a source of energy but also a move away from crude oil as a source of platform chemicals, polymers, drugs, solvents and many other critical materials, and consumer goods that are ubiquitous in our everyday life. If we are to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, crude oil must be substituted by renewable sources, and in this evolution, biorefineries arise as the critical alternative to traditional refineries for producing fuels, chemical building blocks, and materials out of non-edible biomass and biomass waste. State-of-the-art biorefineries already produce cost-competitive chemicals and materials, but other products remain challenging from the economic point of view, or their scaled-up production processes are still not sufficiently developed. In particular, lignin's depolymerization is a required milestone for the success of integrated biorefineries, and better catalysts and processes must be improved to prepare bio-based aromatic simple molecules.

Some plant-associated bacteria, called Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), may confer growth-promoting advantages to the plant host, through enhancing nutrient uptake, altering hormone homeostasis, and/or improving tolerance to abiotic stress factors and phytopathogens. In this regard, exploring the key ecological and evolutionary interactions between plants and their microbiomes is perquisite to develop innovative approaches and novel natural products that will complement conventional farming techniques. Recently, details of the molecular aspects of PGPR-mediated tolerance to various stress factors have come to light. At the same time the integration of the recent advances in the field of plant-microbiome crosstalk with novel -omic approaches will soon allow us to develop a holistic approach to prime plants against unfavorable environments. This mini review highlights the current state of the art on seed biopriming, focusing on the identification and application of novel PGPR in cultivated plant species under conditions where crop productivity is limited. The potential challenges of commercializing these PGPR as biostimulants to improve crop production under multiple environmental constraints of plant growth, as well as concerns about PGPR application and their impact on ecosystems, are also discussed.","[Mellidou, Ifigeneia] Hellen Agr Org DEMETER, Inst Plant Breeding & Genet Resources, Thermi, Greece; [Karamanoli, Katerina] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Karamanoli, K (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, Thessaloniki, Greece.",katkar@agro.auth.gr,,"Mellidou, Ifigeneia/0000-0002-5320-132X",Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI); General Secretariat for Research and Innovation (GSRI) [705],Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI); General Secretariat for Research and Innovation (GSRI),"This project was funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Innovation (GSRI), under the Grant Agreement No. 705, awarded to IM.",,59,1,1,12,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

One of those consequences is the freshwater flux and the associated cooling and freshening that result from iceberg melting. Despite the potential impact, large uncertainties exist resulting mostly from the complexity to follow icebergs from space, which make the few existing estimates essentially model-based. This study takes advantage of state-of-art machine learning methods to present novel prevalent trajectories and potential freshwater input from 450 icebergs ranging from 1 to 2765 km(2) across the northwestern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. The main results highlight the predominance of a northward flux and the entrance of icebergs up to 10 km(2) into Bransfield Strait associated with the main current systems along the Antarctic Peninsula. The present analysis on such a large number of icebergs unveils an average drift speed of 3.4 +/- 2.7 km day(-1) and an average disintegration rate of similar to 62% per year, representing an integrated potential regional freshwater input of 133.62 Gt yr(-1). Altogether, this study adds new knowledge to the complex problem of autonomous applications for iceberg detection and tracking, further exploring such methods on a very dynamic region of singular importance for the ocean and climate studies.","[Barbat, Mauro M.; Mata, Mauricio M.] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Oceanog, Lab Estudos Oceanos & Clima LEOC, Ave Italia,Km 8 S-N,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Barbat, Mauro M.; Mata, Mauricio M.] Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Criosfera, Grp Estudos Oceano Austral & Gelo Marinho, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,"Barbat, MM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Oceanog, Lab Estudos Oceanos & Clima LEOC, Ave Italia,Km 8 S-N,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;Barbat, MM (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol Criosfera, Grp Estudos Oceano Austral & Gelo Marinho, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",maurobarbat@furg.br,"; Mata, Mauricio/H-4605-2011","Barbat, Mauro/0000-0001-7930-1612; Mata, Mauricio/0000-0002-9028-8284","Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology of the Cryosphere (INCT-CRIOSFERA CNPq) [465680/2014-3]; Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) through the Ministerio do Meio Ambiente (MMA); Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacoes (MCTIC); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [442628/2018-8]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) Foundation [AUXPE 1995/2014]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (INCT-Criosfera FAPERGS) [17/2551-0000518-0]; CNPq [309653/2021-5]","Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology of the Cryosphere (INCT-CRIOSFERA CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) through the Ministerio do Meio Ambiente (MMA); Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacoes (MCTIC); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) Foundation(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (INCT-Criosfera FAPERGS); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","This study is a contribution to the activities of the Brazilian High Latitudes Oceanography Group (GOAL) and the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology of the Cryosphere (INCT-CRIOSFERA CNPq; 465680/2014-3).

Circular Economy emerged as a sustainability paradigm able to de - couple economic growth from resource consumption and waste generation. In the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) industry there is the need for systematically reviewing what the litera- ture has investigated and found in the light of the Circular Economy perspective. Thus, this paper aims to systematize the extensive scientific literature that exists about sustainability in the WEEE industry with a Circular Economy lens. Overall, 115 articles were selected and analyzed according to four aspects: (i.) objectives and methodology, (ii.) geography and approach, (iii.) actors and life cycle phases, (iv.) Circular Economy 4R scheme of Reduce, Reuse, Remanufacture and Recycle strategies. The analysis led to the iden- tification of several research gaps in the literature, which academia is called to fill. This state-of-the-art review provides ten research directions that constitute the backbone of a research agenda about Circular Economy in the WEEE industry, as well as an improved managerial understanding of this research field.

The ability to detect sea ice drift in real-time also contributes to the safe navigation of ships and the prevention of offshore oil platform accidents. In this paper, an Enhanced Delaunay Triangulation (EDT) algorithm for sea ice tracking was proposed for dual-polarization sequential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which was implemented by combining feature tracking with pattern matching based on integrating HH and HV polarization feature information. A sea ice retrieval algorithm for feature detection, matching, fusion, and outlier detection was specifically developed to increase the system's accuracy and robustness. In comparison with several state-of-the-art sea ice drift retrieval algorithms, including Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) method, the results of the experiment provided compelling evidence that our algorithm had a higher accuracy than the SURF and ORB method. Furthermore, the results of our method were compared with the drift vector and direction of buoys data. The drift direction is consistent with buoys, and the velocity deviation was about 10 m. It was proved that this method can be applied effectively to the retrieval of sea ice drift.","[Zhang, Ming; An, Jubai] Dalian Maritime Univ, Informat Sci & Technol Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ming; Yu, Dahua; Wang, Junkai; Lv, Xiaoqi] Inner Mongolia Univ Sci & Technol, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Pattern Recognit & Intelli, Baotou 014010, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lv, Xiaoqi] Inner Mongolia Univ Technol, Hohhot 010051, Peoples R China",Dalian Maritime University; Inner Mongolia University of Science & Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Inner Mongolia University of Technology,"An, JB (corresponding author), Dalian Maritime Univ, Informat Sci & Technol Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.",nkd_zm@imust.edu.cn; jubaian@sohu.com; zhangjie@fio.org.cn; fmydh@imust.edu.cn; wjk_53@126.com; lxiaoqi@imust.edu.cn,"Zhang, Ming/AAO-2192-2021; Yu, Dahua/N-7242-2013; Zhang, Ming/E-3364-2013","Yu, Dahua/0000-0001-7850-7512; Zhang, Ming/0000-0003-2638-9002","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61771266, 81571753, 81871430]; Research Program of science and technology at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China [NJZY18150]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Program of science and technology at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China,"This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation (No. 61771266, 81571753 and 81871430) of China, and in part by the Research Program of science and technology at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (No. NJZY18150) of China.",,43,9,11,1,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2020,3,,,,,,581,10.3390/rs12030581,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12030581,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,KO2QH,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000515393800240,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review introduces and examines a selection of state-of-the-art methods that are applied for multivariate forecasting of wind and solar power production. Methods such as conditional parametric and combined forecasting already see wide use in practice, both commercially and scientifically. In the context of multivariate forecasting, it is vital to model the dependence between forecasts correctly. In recent years, reconciliation of forecasts to ensure coherency across spatial and temporal aggregation levels has shown great promise in increasing the accuracy of renewable energy forecasts. We introduce the methodology used for forecast reconciliation and review some recent applications for wind and solar power forecasting. Many forecasters are beginning to see the benefit of the greater information provided by probabilistic forecasts. We highlight stochastic differential equations as a method for probabilistic forecasting, which can also model the dependence structure. Lastly, we discuss forecast evaluation and how choosing a proper approach to evaluation is vital to avoid misrepresenting forecasts.

Design/methodology/approach This study combines bibliometric and content analysis methods to review 2,347 publications from 15 core EdLAM journals published from 2007 to 2016. Findings The bibliometric analysis identified five EdLAM thematic strands: school leadership for enhancing students' academic achievement and teachers' effectiveness; leadership for educational change, accountability and promoting democratic values; leadership for social justice, equal education and narrowing achievement gaps; principal's instructional leadership for school improvement; and distributed leadership and its impact on organisational climate and teachers' attitudes and stress. The content analysis revealed that the EdLAM research from 2007 to 2016 further developed the following research areas: the dynamics between leaders and teachers in leadership work, the potential risks of distributed leadership and the EdLAM challenges brought by the New Public Management and neoliberalism. Originality/value This study depicts state-of-the-art EdLAM research. It confirms the combination of bibliometric and content analyses as a useful approach for large-scale review studies.

The results of this simulation were used to quantify the ground level concentrations of SO2 in and around the refinery. The evaluation of the CALPUFF and MM5 modeling system was carried out by comparing the estimated results with that of observed data of the same area. The predicted concentrations of SO2 agreed well with the observed data, with minor differences in magnitudes. In addition, the ambient air quality of the area was checked by comparing the model results with the regulatory limits for SO2 set by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs (MECA) in Oman. From the analysis of results, it was found that the concentration of SO2 in the nearby communities of Sohar refinery is well within the regulatory limits specified by MECA. Based on these results, it was concluded that no health risk, due to SO2 emissions, is present in areas adjacent to the refinery.","[Abdul-Wahab, Sabah Ahmed] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Muscat, Oman; [Ali, Sappurd] Natl Engn & Sci Commiss NESCOM, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Sardar, Sabir; Irfan, Naseem] Pakistan Inst Engn & Appl Sci PIEAS, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Al-Damkhi, Ali] Publ Author Appl Educ & Training PAAET, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Kuwait, Kuwait",Sultan Qaboos University; National Engineering & Scientific Commission - Pakistan; Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Science; Public Authority for Applied Education & Training (PAAET) - Kuwait,"Abdul-Wahab, SA (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Muscat, Oman.",sabah1@squ.edu.om; sappurdalisaqib@yahoo.com; sabirsardar31@gmail.com; naseem@pieas.edu.pk; aboanas58@hotmail.com,"Abdul-Wahab, Sabah/AAD-8070-2019",,,,,,35,15,17,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-954X,,,CLEAN TECHNOL ENVIR,Clean Technol.

The SVM methodology provides a statistically sound and robust approach to solving the inverse problem, and thus to building statistical models. EnKF is an extension of the Kalman Filter (KF), a well-known tool in prediction updating. In the present research, ground measurements were used to build a SVM-type soil moisture predictor. Subsequent observations and their statistics were assimilated to update predictions from the SVM model by coupling it with EnKF. In this way, both model predictions and ground data, as well as their statistics, are fused thus minimizing the prediction error and making the predictions and observations statistically consistent. The results are shown for two approaches; one in which update is done at every time step and the other which assumes that data is only available at alternate time steps (in window of 10 time steps) and hence update is performed at those occasions.

The first (CLE) scenario reflects implementation of current air quality legislation around the world, while the second (MFR) represents a more optimistic case in which all currently feasible technologies are applied to achieve maximum emission reductions. We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO2 satellite observations. Large parts of the world are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems. By 2030, global surface ozone is calculated to increase globally by 1.5 +/- 1.2 ppb (CLE) and 4.3 +/- 2.2 ppb (A2), using the ensemble mean model results and associated +/- 1 sigma standard deviations. Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by -2.3 +/- 1.1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by -0.8 +/- 0.6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 +/- 15 and 155 +/- 37 mW m(-2) for CLE and A2, respectively, and decreases by -45 +/- 15 mW m(-2) for MFR. We compute that at present 10.1% of the global natural terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to nitrogen deposition above a critical load of 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1). These percentages increase by 2030 to 15.8% (CLE), 10.5% (MFR), and 25% (A2). This study shows the importance of enforcing current worldwide air quality legislation and the major benefits of going further. Nonattainment of these air quality policy objectives, such as expressed by the SRES-A2 scenario, would further degrade the global atmospheric environment.","Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway; Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, RIVM, MNP, Bilthoven, Netherlands; Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; JAMSTEC, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, EPFL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Baltimore, MD USA; Belgian Inst Space Aeron, Brussels, Belgium; CEA, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Atmospher Sci, Livermore, CA USA; Meteo France, CNRM, GMGEC, CATS, Toulouse, France; Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; NOAA, GFDL, Princeton, NJ USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO USA; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge, England; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Fis, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Baltimore, MD USA",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Edinburgh; University of Oslo; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Meteo France; Max Planck Society; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; University of Cambridge; University of L'Aquila; University of Miami; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Dentener, F (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Via E Fermi 1, I-21020 Ispra, Italy.",frank.dentener@jrc.it,"Hauglustaine, Didier/A-4154-2012; Krol, Maarten C./E-3414-2013; Collins, William/A-5895-2010; Strahan, Susan E/H-1965-2012; Maga√±a, Felipe/B-6966-2013; Peuch, Vincent-Henri/A-7308-2008; Horowitz, Larry/D-8048-2014; Stevenson, David S/C-8089-2012; Van Dingenen, Rita/AAI-3197-2021; Wild, Oliver/A-4909-2009; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Ellingsen, Kjerstin/AAV-5047-2021; SZOPA, Sophie/F-8984-2010; Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012; Bergmann, Daniel J/F-9801-2011; Sudo, Kengo/I-6394-2014; Butler, Tim/G-1139-2011; Savage, Nicholas Henry/AAA-4015-2020; Bouwman, Lex F/B-7053-2012; Pitari, Giovanni/O-7458-2016; Unger, Nadine/M-9360-2015; Krol, Maarten/B-3597-2010; Schultz, Martin G/I-9512-2012; Unger, Nadine/AAI-4462-2021; Bouwman, Lex/F-1444-2015","Hauglustaine, Didier/0000-0002-4826-5118; Krol, Maarten C./0000-0002-3506-2477; Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; Strahan, Susan E/0000-0002-7511-4577; Horowitz, Larry/0000-0002-5886-3314; Stevenson, David S/0000-0002-4745-5673; Van Dingenen, Rita/0000-0003-2521-4972; Wild, Oliver/0000-0002-6227-7035; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; SZOPA, Sophie/0000-0002-8641-1737; Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715; Bergmann, Daniel J/0000-0003-4357-6301; Sudo, Kengo/0000-0002-5013-4168; Savage, Nicholas Henry/0000-0001-9391-5100; Pitari, Giovanni/0000-0001-7051-9578; Schultz, Martin G/0000-0003-3455-774X; Unger, Nadine/0000-0001-7739-2290; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0002-2178-4903; Zeng, Guang/0000-0002-9356-5021; Peuch, Vincent-Henri/0000-0003-1396-0505; Bouwman, Lex/0000-0002-2045-1859; Fiore, Arlene/0000-0003-0221-2122; Butler, Timothy/0000-0002-2219-4657","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C001672/1, NER/J/S/2000/00840] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,21,258,265,1,136,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

The public reception of the performances is mediated by attitudes toward Russian Criminal Law Article 282, the so-called law against religious offenses, in a sociopolitical climate where Orthodoxy is conflated with state patriotism. Through the appropriation of the colloquially resonant behavioral paradigm of the holy fool, the author analyzes how Mavromatti's performance event critiques the concept of judgment (by an Orthodox state and by an Orthodox public) from within a culturally resonant religious tradition. The artist's intervention calls for a secular separation of church and state, but by doing so from within a religious tradition, it illuminates the function of the postsecular as a mode of engagement in contemporary Russian culture.","[Filippova, Darja] Princeton Univ, Comparat Literature, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Filippova, D (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Comparat Literature, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,0,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0333-5372,,,POETICS TODAY,Poetics Today,SEP,2020,3,,SI,,437,460,,10.1215/03335372-8519670,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/03335372-8519670,,,24,Literature,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Literature,OD5DX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000579873500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The system operates at F/1.8, providing high throughput for low-reflectivity water surfaces, while avoiding saturation over bright snow or clouds. The SWIS design utilizes heritage from previously demonstrated instruments on airborne platforms, while advancing the state of the art in compact sensors of this kind in terms of size and spectral coverage. Through frequent repeat observations from space at a moderate spatial resolution, SWIS can address key science questions concerning aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem changes, cryosphere warming and melt behavior, cloud and atmospheric science, and potential impacts of climate change and human activities on the environment. We review the optical design and innovations and key technologies developed for this instrument, as well as its measured optical performance.

This study includes an analysis of the main computational kernels with a special focus on bottlenecks in parallel scalability. Several model enhancements improving this scalability for large numbers of processes are described and tested. Model grids at different resolutions are used on four high-performance computing (HPC) systems with differing computational and communication hardware to demonstrate the model's scalability and throughput. Furthermore, strategies for improvements in parallel performance are presented and assessed. We show that, in terms of throughput, FESOM2 is on a par with state-of-the-art structured ocean models and, in a realistic eddy-resolving configuration (1/10 degrees resolution), can achieve about 16 years per day on 14 000 cores. This suggests that unstructured-mesh models are becoming very competitive tools in high-resolution climate modeling. We show that the main bottlenecks of FESOM2 parallel scalability are the two-dimensional components of the model, namely the computations of the external (barotropic) mode and the sea-ice model. It is argued that these bottlenecks are shared with other general ocean circulation models.","[Koldunov, Nikolay V.] MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Koldunov, Nikolay V.; Aizinger, Vadym; Rakowsky, Natalja; Scholz, Patrick; Sidorenko, Dmitry; Danilov, Sergey; Jung, Thomas] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Aizinger, Vadym] Univ Bayreuth, Chair Sci Comp, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Danilov, Sergey] Jacobs Univ, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Jung, Thomas] Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany","University of Bremen; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Bayreuth; Jacobs University; University of Bremen","Koldunov, NV (corresponding author), MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.;Koldunov, NV (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",nikolay.koldunov@awi.de,"Aizinger, Vadym/AAD-8260-2019; Koldunov, Nikolay V.

Due to climate change, conditions of high ignition propensity are becoming more frequent, leading to an increased need for the development of alternative fire prevention systems that can mitigate the consequences of fire incidents. In this context, this work explores thermal imaging data for early detection of fire outbreaks, aiming for application in a real context. To that end, experimental trials were conducted in laboratory and at the venue of a summer festival under real operation conditions. The datasets acquired are characterized in detail, and a feature engineering process is devised for the analysis of the response of thermal imaging sensors to a fire ignition. To deal with high-dimensional data, the feature construction method follows a statistical color-based approach, that characterizes the dynamic changes in the data using three features. Subsequently, this paper proposes a fuzzy modeling approach based on these variables, which is transparent to interpretation and enables the assessment of patterns modeled. The performance of the classification algorithm for detection of fire outbreaks is evaluated and framed with works in the state-of-the-art for this application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Development on PALM started in 1997, the project currently entails 140 kLOC and is used on HPC farms of up to 43200 cores. The porting took place during the GPU Hackathon TU Dresden/Forschungszentrum Julich in Dresden, Germany, in 2016. The main challenges we faced are the legacy code base of PALM and its size.

Several species are reported here for the first time in nadir view, including nitrous acid, furan, acetylene, propylene, acetic acid, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, observations which were made in a pyrocumulus cloud from the Australian bush fires of February 2009. Being able to observe this large number of reactive trace gases will likely improve our knowledge of source emissions and their impact on the environment and climate. Citation: Clarisse, L., Y.

How can students and teachers located in feminist classrooms, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, safely imagine Muslim bodies and identities outside and within war propaganda, border security measures, hijacked airplanes, racial profiling, and jihad? Given the relentless and overbearing mainstream media propaganda promoting a climate of fear and protection from 'Muslims' and their attributed geographies, physiognomies, and behaviors-essentially reproducing late nineteenth-century colonialist visual anthropological practices; it is incumbent to revisit the cultural activities of contemporary transnational artists in order to conceptually 'shake up' or 'shake off' the psychological effects of US-led foreign policies, British and French imperialist histories, fervent nationalisms, and religious extremisms-all of which continue to forcibly shape and undermine personal identity claims within diasporic Muslim communities. In this paper, I pedagogically reinterpret the 1980s electronic media productions of Mona Hatoum, an extensively documented and culturally hyphenated Palestinian-Lebanese-British performance, video, and installation artist in order to underscore the possibilities of including visual art and media in the teaching and learning of antiracist feminist thought in university classrooms. In particular, I examine the video piece Measures of distance (1988).","[Khan, Mehre Y.] York Univ, N York, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Khan, MY (corresponding author), Keele Campus,S711 Ross Bldg,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",mustang@yorku.ca,,,,,,,45,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1467-5986,1469-8439,,INTERCULT EDUC,Intercult.

Conservatism's rise to political ascendancy has sharpened the contentious ''culture wars'' that surround virtually all aspects of American culture. one important dimension of today's conservative movement is a backlash against the multicultural movement. Conservative defenders of the traditional literary canon, for example, see multicultural literature as a threat to the very fabric of Western civilization. Within children's literature circles, charges abound that advocates of multicultural literature are ignoring traditional literary values and are focusing instead on ill-defined notions of ''political correctness.'' This article explores this complex issue and the challenges it poses to those concerned with the creation, production, distribution, and consumption of children's literature. The discussion. addresses questions that speak to the very nature and function of children's literature: its status as art, as entertainment, as a source of role models and ideology for children's ''impressionable'' minds.

However, existing DLR estimation methods and DLR products are still problematic in terms of both accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution. In this article, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based method to estimate hourly DLR at 5-km spatial resolution from top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature (BT) of the Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) thermal channels, combined with near-surface air temperature and dew point temperature of ERA5 and elevation data. Validation results show that the DCNN-based method outperforms popular random forest and multilayer perceptron-based methods and that our proposed scheme integrating multisource data outperforms that only using remote sensing TOA observations or surface meteorological data. Compared with state-of-the-art CERES-SYN and ERA5-land DLR products, the estimated DLR by our proposed DCNN-based method with physical multisource inputs has higher spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy, with correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.95, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 17.2 W/m(2), and mean bias error (MBE) of -0.8 W/m(2) in the testing period on the Tibetan Plateau.","[Zhu, Fuxin; Qin, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Tang, Wenjun] Chinese Acad Sci Ences, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Tang, Wenjun] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Kun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Sci Syst, Beijing 10084, Peoples R China; [Cuo, Lan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shen, Chaopeng] Penn State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Qin, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Li, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci Ences, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Li, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhufuxin@itpcas.ac.cn; xinli@itpcas.ac.cn; shuairenqin@itpcas.ac.cn; yangk@tsinghua.edu.cn; lancuo@itpcas.ac.cn; tangwj@itpcas.ac.cn; cshen@engr.psu.edu,"Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Yang, Wei/GWV-4107-2022; li, xin/HHS-9461-2022; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Li, Xin/F-7473-2011","Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818; Tang, Wenjun/0000-0003-0219-6556; Shen, Chaopeng/0000-0002-0685-1901",Strategic Priority Research Program Big Earth Data Science Engineering (CASEarth) Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901086],Strategic Priority Research Program Big Earth Data Science Engineering (CASEarth) Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported in part by the Strategic Priority Research Program Big Earth Data Science Engineering (CASEarth) Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDA19070104 and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41901086.,,63,2,2,10,26,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

A wide range of potential applications is using these data including land cover classification, regional planning, catastrophe prediction and management, and climate change estimation. Big remote sensing data are characterized by different types of resolutions (radiometric, spatial, spectral, and temporal), modes of imaging, and sensor types, and this range of options often makes the process of analyzing and interpreting such data more difficult. In this paper, which is the first study of its kind, we propose a novel distributed deep learning-based approach for the classification of big remote sensing images. Specifically, we propose Distributed Convolutional-Neural-Networks for handling RS image classification (RSDCNN). The first step is to prepare the training dataset for RS-DCNN. Then, to ensure a data-parallel training on the top of the Apache Spark framework, a pixel-based convolutional-neural-network model across the big data cluster is performed using BigDL.

They have been applied to environments that have been exposed to poisonous or dangerous substances that are hazardous in nature. The home environment refers to the indoor space with respect to the physical processes the of indoor climate, e.g., temperature change, which are not hazardous in general. However, it can be hazardous when the physical process is in some states, e.g., a state of temperature that can cause heat stroke. If directly applying accident models in such a case, the physical processes are missing. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an accident model by extending the state-of-the-art accident model, i.e., Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) with considering physical processes. Then, to identify causes of abnormal system behaviors that result in physical process anomalies, a hazard analysis technique called System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is tailored and applied to a smart home system for indoor temperature adjustment. The analytical results are documented by a proposed landscape genealogical layout documentation. A comparison with results by applying the original STPA was made, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the tailored STPA to apply in identifying causes in our case.","[Yang, Zhengguo; Lim, Yuto; Tan, Yasuo] Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Informat Sci, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan",Japan Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (JAIST),"Yang, ZG (corresponding author), Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Informat Sci, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.",yangzg@jaist.ac.jp; ylim@jaist.ac.jp; ytan@jaist.ac.jp,"Yang, Zhengguo/R-1045-2019","Yang, Zhengguo/0000-0003-2633-9566; Lim, Yuto/0000-0001-7597-5660",,,,,48,4,4,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

This is attributed to increased sophistication in NWP models, which resolve complex physical processes, advanced data assimilation, increased grid resolution and satellite observations. However, prediction of heavy rains is still a challenge since the models exhibit large error in amounts as well as spatial and temporal distribution. Two state-of-art NWP models have been investigated over the Indian monsoon region to assess their ability in predicting the heavy rainfall events. The unified model operational at National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCUM) and the unified model operational at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator Global (ACCESS-G)) are used in this study. The recent (JJAS 2015) Indian monsoon season witnessed 6 depressions and 2 cyclonic storms which resulted in heavy rains and flooding. The CRA method of verification allows the decomposition of forecast errors in terms of error in the rainfall volume, pattern and location. The case by case study using CRA technique shows that contribution to the rainfall errors come from pattern and displacement is large while contribution due to error in predicted rainfall volume is least.","[Sharma, Kuldeep; Ashrit, Raghavendra; Iyengar, Gopal; Rajagopal, E.

Ironically, though, tourism - in which place is a central concept - has paid little attention to the concept. This paper explores the importance of place in the context of tourism product development and marketing, particularly the linkage between place and culture as a tourism experience. The linkage can be understood through an analogy to the concept of terroir from viniculture. Terroir is the set of qualities that shape the sensory and intellectual appreciation of a wine, including soil, climate, grape variety and wine-making techniques. In the case of placed-based cultural tourism development and promotion, the terroir of a place includes history, local traditions and cultures, religion, industry, the natural environment, cuisine and arts, as well as attractions and events. A key feature of place-based product development and promotion is the identification and telling the story of a place through a variety of narrative techniques. These techniques include the tradition of oral storytelling, but also print, video, graphic and digital media. The paper examines the themes of stories often told in connection with place-based cultural tourism and illustrates these with examples drawn from a Canadian cultural destination.","[Smith, Stephen] Univ Guelph, Sch Hospitality Food & Tourism Management, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Smith, S (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Hospitality Food & Tourism Management, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",stesmith@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,38,45,45,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0250-8281,2320-0308,,TOUR RECREAT RES,Tour.

We use the XRF counts of iron and calcium as a proxy of the relative contribution from calcium carbonate and terrestrial material to construct a new composite depth record. This new composite depth record provides the basis to extend the astronomically calibrated geological time scale into the Middle Eocene and results in revised estimates for the age and duration of magnetochrons C16 through C18. In addition, we find an apparent change in the dominance of orbitally driven changes in obliquity and climatic precession at around 36.7 Ma on our new time scale.

In particular, the agro-food sector (AFS) has been severely affected by such problems as resource scarcity and food loss and waste generation along the supply chain. In addition, climate change and biodiversity loss have helped to define an imperative paradigm shift towards a circular economy. Recently, with the publication of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the scientific research examining the adoption of circular economy (CE) models and tools has increased. In this context, the importance of shifting towards a circular economy has become urgent. In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to investigate the state-of-the-art research related to the adoption of circular economy models and tools along the agro-food supply chain. Furthermore, this review highlights that, due to the complexity of the agri-food supply chain, it is almost utopian to define a unique circular economy model for the whole sector. In addition, it emerges that future researches should be concentrated on the integration of different stages of the supply chain with circular economy models and tools in order to create a closed-loop agri-food system.","[Esposito, Benedetta; Sessa, Maria Rosaria; Sica, Daniela; Malandrino, Ornella] Univ Salerno, Dept Business Studies Management & Innovat Syst, I-84084 Salerno, Italy",University of Salerno,"Esposito, B (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Business Studies Management & Innovat Syst, I-84084 Salerno, Italy.",besposito@unisa.it; masessa@unisa.it; dsica@unisa.it; ornellam@unisa.it,"Sessa, Maria Rosaria/HDM-7210-2022",,,,,,81,55,56,14,57,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,18,,,,,,7401,10.3390/su12187401,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187401,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OK1BU,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000584387500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Interestingly, some cultural representations of wheat emphasize what may be referred to as plant agency. This is particularly striking in North American art and literature. There is often a certain wildness, independence, and power to wheat that are lacking in other cultivated crops. Focusing on the 19th and early 20th centuries, this article examines the active role of wheat in shaping US-American history and society. Starting from the assumption that cultural artefacts help societies to understand and negotiate their norms and values, I take a look at a painting (Emanuel Leutze's Mrs. Schuyler Burning Her Wheat Fields on the Approach of the British from 1852) and a novel (Frank Norris's The Octopus from 1901) to analyze their representation of the human-wheat relationship. Using a historicizing, philological approach, this case study contributes to a debate in the environmental humanities that seeks to redefine the human-crop relationship in times of climate change, diminishing biodiversity, and human population growth. Can the American legacy of wheat help us to reframe the human-wheat relationship? Are there potential pitfalls of crop agency as it is depicted in American representations of wheat?","[Twelbeck, Kirsten] Univ Augsburg, Environm Sci Ctr WZU, Environm Humanities, Univ Str 1a, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Twelbeck, K (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Environm Sci Ctr WZU, Environm Humanities, Univ Str 1a, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",kirsten.twelbeck@wzu.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,43,4,4,1,2,OEKOM VERLAG GMBH,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,2625-5413,,GAIA,GAIA,,2020,4,,,,235,242,,10.14512/gaia.29.4.8,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.29.4.8,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PG6HE,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000599833500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

While direct testing provides point information relative to the total volume of soil, rock, and fluids involved in the engineering question, geophysical methods can cost-effectively survey large subsurface volumes, can supply spatially continuous data (as opposed to point data), and are non-invasive (useful for contaminated sites). Nevertheless, geophysical methods are indirect surveys and can contain inherent ambiguity as well as resolution and site-specific limitations. Thus, clear guidelines that delineate strengths and limitations of the plethora of geophysical techniques available to the ground engineer are important, if a ground investigation is to be successful. Here, attention is drawn to the New Zealand Ground Investigation Specification that was released in 2017. Specifically, chapter 11 of the Master Specification Volume contains inherent flaws regarding several geophysical techniques and applications. New Zealand has a highly variable geology, climate variability, and seismicity, along with active volcanism and broad areas underlain by glacial deposits deposited by formerly extensive glaciers. Hence, a national ground investigation guide that encompasses state-of-the-art knowledge in the application of surface geophysics to developing geological models would be welcome.","[Brook, Martin S.] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Brook, MS (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",m.brook@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,19,0,0,2,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0013-7952,1872-6917,,ENG GEOL,Eng.

Smart grids employ smart meters which are responsible for two-way flows of electricity information to monitor and manage the electricity consumption. In a large smart grid, smart meters produce tremendous amount of data that are hard to process, analyze and store even with cloud computing. Fog computing is an environment that offers a place for collecting, computing and storing smart meter data before transmitting them to the cloud. This environment acts as a bridge in the middle of the smart grid and the cloud. It is geographically distributed and overhauls cloud computing via additional capabilities including reduced latency, increased privacy and locality for smart grids.

A natural turf surface is susceptible to environmental and physical stress and has a limited resistance to wear. A number of technological advances have increased the quality and durability of natural turf surfaces including: sand rootzones; drainage; irrigation; agrochemicals; turfgrass breeding; turf reinforcement; supplementary lighting; ventilation; and advanced stadium architecture. These advances have resulted in an increase in resource consumption and where resources are restricted natural turf viability, performance, and safety is limited. This paper examines these challenges and others facing natural turf by reviewing the state of the art and signposting future research required to ensure performance, safety, and sustainability from natural turf surfaces. More development is required for lower-cost technologies for recreational-level facilities. Synthetic turf surfaces can be used to reduce the intensity of use of natural turf but sustainable natural turf construction and management must focus on resource consumption reduction and resilience to climate change for the continued provision of high performance, safe surfaces for sport. Furthermore, greater user-awareness of resource consumption and the consequences of reduced consumption are important for adoption in the future of more sustainable practices.","Cranfield Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Ctr Sports Surface Technol, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"James, IT (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Ctr Sports Surface Technol, Bldg 37, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",,,,Centre for Sports Surface Technology at Cranfield University,Centre for Sports Surface Technology at Cranfield University,"The support of colleagues at the Centre for Sports Surface Technology at Cranfield University in the preparation of this paper, in particular Dr Mark Bartlett, is gratefully acknowledged.",,67,10,11,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1754-3371,1754-338X,,P I MECH ENG P-J SPO,Proc.

To achieve its potential, this discipline requires the establishment of natural history collections and herbaria that document local and regional biodiversity. Because of the high levels of global biodiversity, taxonomy deserves the same attention as the climate change programs. Several international meetings, since the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, have pointed out the need to imcrease government supportfor taxonomy. One of the main conclusions was to establish a Global Taxonomy Initiative (GTI) in 1998. Governments failed to establish national programs for taxonomy; thus in 2006 the Con- ference of the Parties stressed again the urgency of their implementation. This review lists the problems faced and main progress achieved by the GTI and proposes a road map for Latin America with an emphasis on marine invertebrates. It is recommended that taxonomists and collection managers team together, improve their relationships with policy makers andfunding science agencies, and prepare national initiatives. These initiatives should include a stepwise hiring program in order to improve and diversify the knowledge of the marine biota. At the same time, taxonomic research should involve state of the art bioinformatics and molecular tools, and become a global science.","[Salazar Vallejo, Sergio I.] Colegio Frontera Sur ECOSUR, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Salazar Vallejo, Sergio I.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Schwindt, Evangelina] Univ Nacl Mar Plata, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Schwindt, Evangelina] Ctr Nacl Patagon, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina",El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; National University of Mar del Plata; Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT),"Vallejo, SIS (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur ECOSUR, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",salazar@ecosur.mx; schwindt@cenpat.edu.ar,,"Schwindt, Evangelina/0000-0001-6693-9828",,,,,77,4,4,0,5,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,JUL,2008,7,,,,510,517,,,,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,335GB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000258277700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data assimilation simultaneously optimizes both concentrations and emissions of multiple species through ingestion of a suite of measurements (ozone, NO2, CO, HNO3) from multiple satellite sensors. In spite of substantial model differences, the observational density and accuracy was sufficient for the assimilation to reduce the multi-model spread by 20 %-85% for ozone and annual mean bias by 39 %-97% for ozone in the middle troposphere, while simultaneously reducing the tropospheric NO2 column biases by more than 40% and the negative biases of surface CO in the Northern Hemisphere by 41 %-94 %. For tropospheric mean OH, the multi-model mean meridional hemispheric gradient was reduced from 1.32 +/- 0.03 to 1.19 +/- 0.03, while the multi-model spread was reduced by 24 %-58% over polluted areas. The uncertainty ranges in the a posteriori emissions due to model errors were quantified in 4 %-31% for NOx and 13 %-35% for CO regional emissions. Harnessing assimilation increments in both NOx and ozone, we show that the sensitivity of ozone and NO2 surface concentrations to NOx emissions varied by a factor of 2 for end-member models, revealing fundamental differences in the representation of fast chemical and dynamical processes. A systematic investigation of model ozone response and analysis increment in MOMO-Chem could benefit evaluation of future prediction of the chemistry-climate system as a hierarchical emergent constraint.","[Miyazaki, Kazuyuki; Bowman, Kevin W.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Miyazaki, Kazuyuki; Sudo, Kengo] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Earth Surface Syst Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Yumimoto, Keiya] Kyushu Univ, Res Inst Appl Mech, Kasuga Pk 6-1, Fukuoka 8168580, Japan; [Walker, Thomas] Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Sudo, Kengo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Kyushu University; Carleton University; Nagoya University,"Miyazaki, K (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;Miyazaki, K (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Earth Surface Syst Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",kazuyuki.miyazaki@jpl.nasa.gov,"Bowman, Kevin/L-8786-2019; Sudo, Kengo/I-6394-2014; Miyazaki, Kazuyuki/AAL-1785-2021","Bowman, Kevin/0000-0002-8659-1117; Sudo, Kengo/0000-0002-5013-4168; Miyazaki, Kazuyuki/0000-0002-1466-4655","JSPS KAKENHI [15K05296, 26220101, 26287117, 16H02946, 18H01285]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [2-1803]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","This research has been supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (grant nos. 15K05296, 26220101, 26287117, 16H02946, and 18H01285) and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan (grant no. 2-1803).",,104,27,28,2,9,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

It seeks to contribute to an analysis of the meanings attributed to the North as a scientific environment or an object of study and, in particular, show the wider contextual motivations behind the research of the northern lights as well as phenomena related to physical cold. The analysis will concentrate on the learned discussions taking place between scholars in the Kingdom of Sweden and the Academie des Sciences in Paris. The great scholarly interest in the aurora borealis starting in the early eighteenth century emerged rapidly after the sudden appearance of this striking and enigmatic phenomenon across a large part of Europe during the first decades of the eighteenth century. In a similar manner, cold winters experienced all over Europe during the late seventeenth century had inspired the first scientific societies in Europe to carry out experiments that under ordinary circumstances could not have been pursued. These events underlined the dependency of early empiricists on nature's help when extending the scope of their scientific inquiries. The awareness of the constraints of empirical study, combined with a new ideological view of scientific societies as seats of a collective scientific effort, prompted a new kind of specialization in science. The idea was introduced that each scholar or country should take care of producing experiments and observations that were best attainable in their particular environment. The need became most obvious in research topics such as the cold which - unlike heat - could not be produced artificially. As a demand for observations that were specific to northern tracts emerged in Europe, northern scholars discovered in their expertise on the northern issues a niche to negotiate a new prestige in the European scientific networks. Traditional views had maintained that only the warm, southern climates offered a natural environment for civilisation and arts to flourish. New empirical sciences practised by the scientific societies seemed to provide a convenient break with this assumption.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Cultural & Arts Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Pihlaja, PM (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Cultural & Arts Studies, POB 59, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",paivi.pihlaja@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,49,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0800-3831,1503-111X,,ACTA BOREAL,Acta Boreal.,,2012,2,,SI,,119,136,,10.1080/08003831.2012.732281,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08003831.2012.732281,,,18,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,037OI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000311116000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent laboratory experiments demonstrated the importance of several new processes, including aging of SOA from traditional precursors, aging of primary organic aerosol (POA), and photo-oxidation of intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs). However, evaluating the effect of these processes in the real atmosphere is challenging. Most models used in previous studies are over-simplified and some key reaction trajectories are not captured, and model parameters are usually phenomenological and lack experimental constraints. Here we comprehensively assess the effect of organic aerosol (OA) aging and intermediate-volatility emissions on regional-scale OA pollution with a state-of-the-art model framework and experimentally constrained parameters. We find that OA aging and intermediate-volatility emissions together increase OA and SOA concentrations in Eastern China by about 40% and a factor of 10, respectively, thereby improving model-measurement agreement significantly. POA and IVOCs both constitute over 40% of OA concentrations, and IVOCs constitute over half of SOA concentrations; this differs significantly from previous apportionment of SOA sources. This study facilitates an improved estimate of aerosol-induced climate and health impacts, and implies a shift from current fine-particle control policies.","[Zhao, Bin; Wang, Shuxiao; Wu, Wenjing; Hao, Jiming] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuxiao; Hao, Jiming] State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Donahue, Neil M.; Robinson, Allen L.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Atmospher Particle Studies, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Jathar, Shantanu H.] Univ Calif Davis, Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Huang, Xiaofeng] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Environm & Energy, Key Lab Urban Habitat Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Bin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Zhao, Bin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Tsinghua University; Carnegie Mellon University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Wang, SX (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Wang, SX (corresponding author), State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shxwang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Robinson, Allen L/M-3046-2014; Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020; Donahue, Neil M/A-2329-2008; wang, shuxiao/H-5990-2011; Zhao, Bin/AAQ-9989-2021; Jathar, Shantanu/A-2966-2015","Robinson, Allen L/0000-0002-1819-083X; Donahue, Neil M/0000-0003-3054-2364; wang, shuxiao/0000-0001-9727-1963; Zhao, Bin/0000-0001-8438-9188; Jathar, Shantanu/0000-0003-4106-2358","MEP's Special Funds for Research on Public Welfare [201409002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21521064]; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS 1447056]; Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1447056] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","MEP's Special Funds for Research on Public Welfare; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This work was sponsored by the MEP's Special Funds for Research on Public Welfare (201409002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (21521064), and the U.S. National Science Foundation grant AGS 1447056.

The importance of climate and weather forecasting models in providing warnings against slow and rapid onset rates e.g. drought and dispersion of atmospheric pollutants respectively, is discussed. It is strongly suggested that there is a need for systems, corresponding to crisis situations in the field of environmental hazards and/or human activities in general, that would be able to provide support and information about further possible scenarios with a projected state of both the environment and the possibility of the negative impact of various factors on the population (human communities). Since there are highly developed plans for the construction of a nuclear power plant in Poland, there is an urgent need to prepare adequate tools that will help avoid crisis situations, or at least to minimize their negative effects. The Early Warning System should be considered one such tool, to be used not only for its economic benefits, but also for pro-social areas of services responsible for the appropriate reaction to crisis events.","[Bakowski, Rafal; Achimowicz, Jerzy; Mazur, Andrzej] Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Podlesna St 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Meteorology & Water Management,"Bakowski, R (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Podlesna St 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland.",rafal.bakowski@imgw.pl; jerzy.achimowicz@imgw.pl; andrzej.mazur@imgw.pl,,"Mazur, Andrzej/0000-0002-8463-9703",Polish Ministry of the Environment; National Board of Water Management; National Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute [43/DE/2013],Polish Ministry of the Environment; National Board of Water Management; National Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute,"This work was supported by the Agreement between the Polish Ministry of the Environment, the National Board of Water Management and the National Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute for the award of funding of the National Hydrological and Meteorological Service No. 43/DE/2013.",,18,1,1,0,1,INST METEOROLOGY & WATER MANAGEMENT,WARSAW,"PODLESNA 61, WARSAW, 01673, POLAND",2299-3835,2353-5652,,METEOROL HYDROL WATE,Meteorol.

However, this important parameter is poorly represented utilizing the constant-epsilon assumption in the state-of-the-art land surface models as well as climate models due to lack of observations. Satellite sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer(AVHRR) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer(MODIS) can provide Narrow Band Emissivity (NBE) products. These NBE products need to be preprocessed to produce reliable Broad Band Emissivity (BBE) which can be then assimilated into land surface models. This paper presents a preliminary sensitivity study of land surface energy balance simulation utilizing the long-term Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) BBE product in the arid and semiarid regions of northwestern China. We find that the GLASS-based land surface emissivities in the study region show great spatial and temporal variabilities. Satellite derived emissivity for bare soil ranges from 0.90 to 0.985 and more than half of bare soil grids over our study region have emissivity values less than 0.94. Decreased emissivity would lead to increased surface temperature and sensible heat flux. In-situ simulation results indicate that the ground surface temperature and heat fluxes simulations can be improved when satellite derived emissivity is assimilated.","[Peng Bin; Shi Jiancheng; Lei Yonghui; Zhao Tianjie; Li Dongyang; Xiong Chuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS","Peng, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",,"Peng, Bin/M-2584-2017","Peng, Bin/0000-0002-7284-3010",,,,,11,0,0,1,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-6996,,978-1-4799-5775-0,INT GEOSCI REMOTE SE,,,2014,,,,,,,,10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946402,,,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Geology; Remote Sensing,BC0WG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000349688100061,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rapid global climate change has caused researchers to focus on utilizing CO2 in a green and efficient manner. One of the ways to achieve this is by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals via chemical, photochemical, electrochemical, or enzymatic methods. Among these, the enzymatic method is advantageous because of its high specificity and selectivity as well as the mild reaction conditions required. The reduction of CO2 to formate, formaldehyde, and methanol using formate dehydrogenase (FDH), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (F-ald DH), and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) are attractive routes, respectively. In this review, strategies for overcoming the common limitations of enzymatic CO2 reduction are discussed. First, we present a brief background on the importance of minimizing of CO2 emissions and introduce the three bottlenecks limiting enzymatic CO2 reduction. Thereafter, we explore the different strategies for enzyme immobilization on various support materials. To solve the problem of cofactor consumption, different state-of-the-art cofactor regeneration strategies as well as research on the development of cofactor substitutes and cofactor-free systems are extensively discussed. Moreover, aiming at improving CO2 solubility, biological, physical, and engineering measures are reviewed. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are presented.","[Liao, Qiyong; Liu, Wenfang; Meng, Zihui] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Liangxiang Higher Educ Pk, Beijing 102488, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Liu, WF (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Liangxiang Higher Educ Pk, Beijing 102488, Peoples R China.",liuwenfang@bit.edu.cn,,,,,,,112,1,1,48,48,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0734-9750,1873-1899,,BIOTECHNOL ADV,Biotechnol.

This review article focuses on summarizing the current CCUS state-of-the-art methods used in Europe. Special emphasis has been given to mineralization methods/technologies, especially in basalts and sandstones, which are considered to be suitable for CO2 mineralization. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey was also carried out in order to investigate how informed about CO2 issues European citizens are, as well as whether their background is relative to their positive or negative opinion about the establishment of CCUS technologies in their countries. In addition, social acceptance by the community requires contact with citizens and stakeholders, as well as ensuring mutual trust through open communication and the opportunity to participate as early as possible in the development of actions and projects related to CO2 capture and storage, at all appropriate levels of government internationally, as citizens need to understand the benefits from such new technologies, from the local to the international level.","[Koukouzas, Nikolaos; Christopoulou, Marina; Gianni, Eleni; Karkalis, Christos; Pyrgaki, Konstantina; Krassakis, Pavlos; Petrounias, Petros] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas CERTH, Chem Proc & Energy Resources Inst, Thermi 57001, Greece; [Christopoulou, Marina; Giannakopoulou, Panagiota P.; Rogkala, Aikaterini; Koutsovitis, Petros; Petrounias, Petros] Univ Patras, Dept Geol, Sect Earth Mat, Patras 26504, Greece; [Panagiotaras, Dionisios] Ionian Univ, Dept Environm, M Minotou Giannopoulou 26, Panagoula 29100, Zakynthos, Greece",Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; University of Patras,"Koukouzas, N (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Technol Hellas CERTH, Chem Proc & Energy Resources Inst, Thermi 57001, Greece.",koukouzas@certh.gr,"Gianni, Eleni/ABC-1964-2020","Gianni, Eleni/0000-0001-6008-8014; Panagiotaras, Dr. Dionisios/0000-0002-4393-0908; Krassakis, Pavlos/0000-0002-5002-6802",,,,,153,1,1,22,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2022,15,,,,,,5716,10.3390/en15155716,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15155716,,,30,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,3S7VN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000839799600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, most existing techniques focus solely on forecasting entrance and exit flows of metro stations that do not provide enough useful knowledge for traffic management. In practical applications, managers desperately want to solve the problem of getting the potential passenger distributions to help authorities improve transport services, termed as crowd flow distribution (CFD) forecasts. Therefore, to improve the quality of transportation services, we proposed three spatiotemporal models to effectively address the network-wide CFD prediction problem based on the online latent space (OLS) strategy. Our models take into account the various trending patterns and climate influences, as well as the inherent similarities among different stations that are able to predict both CFD and entrance and exit flows precisely. In our online systems, a sequence of CFD snapshots is used as the training data. The latent attribute evolutions of different metro stations can be learned from the previous trend and do the next prediction based on the transition patterns. All the empirical results demonstrate that the three developed models outperform all the other state-of-the-art approaches on three large-scale real-world datasets.","[Gong, Yongshun; Li, Zhibin; Zhang, Jian; Liu, Wei] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Zheng, Yu] JD COM, JD Digits, Beijing 101111, Peoples R China",University of Technology Sydney,"Gong, YS (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",yongshun.gong@student.uts.edu.au; Zhibin.Li@student.uts.edu.au; jian.Zhang@uts.edu.au; Wei.Liu@uts.edu.au; msyuzheng@outlook.com,"Zheng, Yu/GRJ-5808-2022","Gong, Yongshun/0000-0003-3948-4471; Zhang, Jian/0000-0002-7240-3541; Li, Zhibin/0000-0002-4226-267X",,,,,56,13,13,23,39,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1041-4347,1558-2191,,IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN,IEEE Trans.

Entering adolescence, artistic expression for children ceases to be a part of play and begins to represent child's personality and enduring interests, which is why only some children remain interested in artistic creativity and art. In this paper, we discuss the important determinants of artistic interests in adolescence on a sample of 981 last grade students (67.2 % girls, mean age 18 years). The results indicated that the total of 40% of variance of artistic interests is explained by personality traits and personal values, while the importance of family contextual variables was negligible. Among personal factors, the most prominent role of openness to experience was observed, followed by self-actualization values and extraversion, and to some extent by emotionality and utilitarian values. People with greater artistic interest are more open to new experiences, less extraverted, slightly more emotional, and they also place greater importance on self-actualizing values and somewhat lower importance on utilitarian (materialistic) values. Further, the importance of family intellectual-cultural climate for development of artistic interests in adolescence is very weak, and is likely indirect, through personality traits.","[Sverko, Iva] Ivo Pilor Inst Social Sci, Marulicev Trg 19, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Sverko, I (corresponding author), Ivo Pilor Inst Social Sci, Marulicev Trg 19, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",iva.sverko@pilar.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [1229],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 1229.,,42,0,0,1,1,FAC TEACHER EDUCATION,ZAGREB,"UNIV ZAGREB, SAVSKA CESTA 77, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",1848-5189,1848-5197,,CROAT J EDUC,Croat.

This, in turn, causes massive increase in the fog, cloud network traffic which leads to heavily delayed network operations. In streaming data analytics, the ability to obtain real time data insight is crucial for computational sustainability for many IoT enabled applications such as environmental monitors, pollution and climate surveillance, traffic control or even E-commerce applications. However, such network delays prevent us from achieving high quality real-time data analytics of environmental information. In order to address this challenge, we propose the Fog Sampling Node Selector (Fossel) technique that can significantly reduce the IoT network and processing delays by algorithmically selecting an optimal subset of fog nodes to perform the sensor data sampling. In addition, our technique performs a simple type of query executions within the fog nodes in order to further reduce the network delays by processing the data near the data producing devices. Our extensive evaluations show that Fossel technique outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of latency reduction as well as in bandwidth consumption, network usage and energy consumption.","[Abdullah, Fatima; Peng, Limei; Tak, Byungchul] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engieering, Daegu 41566, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Tak, B (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engieering, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",fatima.abdullah91@gmail.com; auroraplm@knu.ac.kr; bctak@knu.ac.kr,,"Tak, Byungchul/0000-0002-8204-6816; Peng, Limei/0000-0001-9984-9861",National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Korea government(MSIT) [NRF-2019 R1C1C1006990],"National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Korea government(MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No. NRF-2019 R1C1C1006990).,,38,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,23,,,,,,10175,10.3390/su122310175,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122310175,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PD3HL,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000597580000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fact remains that mammalian cells and tissues are grown in vitro using foetal calf serum, a blood -derived nutrient.

Mooncalf is a series of wet lab experiments and artistic outputs that showcase the potential viabil-ity of human menstrual serum for culturing mammalian tissue. These experiments present a direct provocation that problematizes the cellular agriculture industry as it pertains to the production of 'clean meat' and instead works towards a proof-of -concept 'unclean' meat prototype.

Examples include the climate system, migration of animals in the wild, consumption of electricity in the power grid and others. The behavior of such systems, however, is not perfectly periodic. The time series we collect from them are often noisy and incomplete due to limitations of data collection and transmission, or due to sensor malfunction and outages. In addition, there are often multiple periods, for example, air temperature and pressure oscillates daily and yearly with the seasons. Hence, accurate and robust period estimation from raw time series is a fundamental task often employed in downstream applications such as traffic prediction and anomaly detection. In this paper, we study the period estimation problem in noisy time series with multiple periods and missing values. We propose a method based on a Ramanujan periodic dictionary and a vector completion model to estimate missing values. To account for the block structure in the Ramanujan periodic dictionary, we introduce a graph Laplacian group lasso regularization which enables robust and efficient period learning in the presence of missing observations. In our extensive experiments on datasets from diverse domains, our proposed methodology outperforms state-of-art baselines in terms of accuracy of period estimation.","[Zhang, Lin; Bogdanov, Petko] SUNY Albany, Dept Comp Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Comp Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",lzhang22@albany.edu; pbogdanov@albany.edu,,"Bogdanov, Petko/0000-0001-6310-3224",National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) [CMMI-1831547],National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart and Connected Communities (SCC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart and Connected Communities (SC&C) grant CMMI-1831547.,,48,0,0,1,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2472-1573,,978-1-7281-8206-3,PR INT CONF DATA SC,,,2020,,,,,40,49,,10.1109/DSAA49011.2020.00016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DSAA49011.2020.00016,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR3QC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000648720100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigated the monthly, seasonal and annual wave energy characteristics of the Black Sea using the third-generation, state-of-the-art numerical model, MIKE 21 SW, based on 37years of wind data obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. To set up the model and represent actual field conditions, computational mesh of the study domain was optimized and then the model was calibrated using data observed at nine points. According to the results of the study, the maximum mean monthly wave energy was obtained in the months of January and February. In terms of seasons, the maximum mean seasonal wave energy was observed in the winter. The analysis of the results at annual scale showed that the western part of the sea has more wave energy potential than the eastern part.","[Abdollahzadehmoradi, Yasin; Ozger, Mehmet; Altunkaynak, Abduesselam] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Div, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Abdollahzadehmoradi, Y (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Div, Istanbul, Turkey.",abdollahzadeh@itu.edu.tr; ozgerme@itu.edu.tr; altunkay@itu.edu.tr,"Ozger, Mehmet/F-2935-2011; Altunkaynak, Abdusselam/AAC-9587-2021; abdollahzadehmoradi, Yasin/AAU-3015-2020","Ozger, Mehmet/0000-0001-9812-9918; Altunkaynak, Abdusselam/0000-0001-7134-1820; abdollahzadehmoradi, Yasin/0000-0003-2104-9746",TUBTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [112M413],TUBTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This research was funded by TUBTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) under the Project Number 112M413.

DGVMs increase the complexity and the Earth system representation when they are coupled with atmospheric global circulation models (AGCMs) or climate models. However, plant physiological processes are still a major source of uncertainty in DGVMs. The maximum velocity of carboxylation (Vc(max)), for example, has a direct impact over productivity in the models. This parameter is often underestimated or imprecisely defined for the various plant functional types (PFTs) and ecosystems. Vc(max) is directly related to photosynthesis acclimation (loss of response to elevated CO2), a widely known phenomenon that usually occurs when plants are subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 and might affect productivity estimation in DGVMs. Despite this, current models have improved substantially, compared to earlier models which had a rudimentary and very simple representation of vegetation-atmosphere interactions. In this paper, we describe this evolution through generations of models and the main events that contributed to their improvements until the current state-of-the-art class of models. Also, we describe some main challenges for further improvements to DGVMs.","[Rezende, L. F. C.; Von Randow, C.; Tourigny, E.; Ometto, J. P. H.

Data from FIRSC campaigns is being used to select optimum radiometer channels that exhibit good sensitivity to specific cirrus. This new multi-channel radiometer will however have some key advantages over similar spectroscopic instruments for example: portability, increased optical efficiency, a multi-angle field of view and a reduced integration period leading to an improved spatial resolution.

Accurate rainfall prediction can play a great role in agricultural, aviation, natural phenomenon, flood, construction, transport, etc. Weather or climate is assumed to be one of the most complex systems. Again, chaos, also called as butterfly effect, limits our ability to make weather predictable. So, it is not easy to predict rainfall by conventional machine learning approaches. However, several kinds of research have been proposed to predict rainfall by using different computational methods. To accomplish chaotic rainfall prediction system for Bangladesh, in this study, historical data set-driven long short term memory (LSTM) networks method has been used, which overcomes the complexities and chaos-related problems faced by other approaches. The proposed method has three principal phases: (i) The most useful 10 features are chosen from 20 data attributes. (ii) After that, a two-layer LSTM model is designed. (iii) Both conventional machine learning approaches and recent works are compared with the LSTM model. This approach has gained 97.14% accuracy in predicting rainfall (in millimeters), which outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.

However, it can be challenging to conduct complex numerical simulations prior to execute a MO, especially at offshore sites characterized by complex wave conditions, i.e. multimodal directional (2D) wave spectra. In this context, this article introduces a methodology for assessing vessel dynamic responses using characteristics of actual 2D wave spectra and regression models from machine learning. First, a state-of-the-art algorithm is used for 2D spectra partitioning and spectral characterization (climate). This allows identifying wave systems that can occur at a study location, and their integral parameters. For that, a data set for the North Atlantic Ocean, spanning 36 years is used. Then, the main wave parameters of each wave system including significant wave height, peak period and peak direction, are used as features to train and test regression models from machine learning tool kits. Accurate predictions of dynamic responses were obtained with a boosted treesregression model considering all six long-term wave systems (18 features) detected at the site. These findings are valuable as new tools to help on-board personnel make safe and quick decisions.","[Guachamin-Acero, Wilson; Portilla, Jesus] Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Ingn Mecan, Quito, Ecuador; [Portilla, Jesus] Res Ctr Math Modelling MODEMAT, Quito 17012759, Ecuador",Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador,"Guachamin-Acero, W (corresponding author), Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Ingn Mecan, Quito, Ecuador.",wilson.guachamin@epn.edu.ec,,"Portilla-Yandun, Jesus/0000-0003-4985-4325; Guachamin Acero, Wilson/0000-0001-9705-9911", [EPN-PIGR-1908],,Acknowledgments Wave spectra were downloaded from the ECMWF website (https:// www.ecmwf.int/) .

Here we use state-of-the-art, laser-based, remote sensing instruments to study the turbulent wind field in the near-wake region of a mature, open-grown oak tree. Our measurements provide for the first time a full picture of the mixing layer of high turbulence that surrounds the mean wind speed deficit. In this layer, we investigate the validity of a two-dimensional vectorial relation derived from the eddy-viscosity hypothesis, a hypothesis commonly used in modelling the turbulence transport of momentum and scalars in the atmosphere. We find that the momentum fluxes of the streamwise wind component can be adequately predicted by the transverse gradient of the mean flow. Using the mixing-length hypothesis we find that for this tree the corresponding turbulence length scale in the mixing layer can be approximated by one height-independent value. Further, the laser-based scanning technology used here was able to accurately reveal three-dimensional turbulent and spatially varying atmospheric flows over a large plane without seeding or intruding the atmospheric flow. This capability points to a new and more exact way of exploring the complex earth-atmosphere interactions.","[Angelou, Nikolas; Mann, Jakob; Dellwik, Ebba] Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Wind Energy Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Angelou, N (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Wind Energy Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",nang@dtu.dk,"Angelou, Nikolas/U-8831-2019; Dellwik, Ebba/Q-4521-2016; Mann, Jakob/I-9671-2017","Angelou, Nikolas/0000-0002-9627-422X; Dellwik, Ebba/0000-0002-0891-9113; Mann, Jakob/0000-0002-6096-611X",Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond (Independent Research Fund Denmark) (The Single Tree Experiment project) [6111-00121],Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond (Independent Research Fund Denmark) (The Single Tree Experiment project),This research has been supported by the Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond (Independent Research Fund Denmark) (The Single Tree Experiment project (grant no. 6111-00121)).,,48,0,0,2,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Subsequently, we quantified the dimensional features of heat radiation fluxes of China's industrial plants. A total of 12 114 industrial objects were structured in a two-level hierarchical dataset of heat-releasing industries, representing a magnitude of at least 1 order higher than the number enumerated in the state-of-the-art inventory of industrial heat sources across China. The satellite observations helped more completely characterize industrial heat plumes, which represent the industrial heat radiation fluxes with higher levels of densities that prevail in the central-eastern part of China having spatial clustering islands.

Techniques based on X-ray radiation and visible light reflection, such as blue intensity (BI), integrate both the density/composition and the dimensions of the cell walls to derive microdensitometric data. In contrast, the dendroanatomical technique relies only on the dimensions of the cell walls. It is therefore possible to isolate cell wall variables by subtracting data derived using the dendroanatomical technique from data derived using Xray and BI-based techniques. In this study, we explore differences in well-replicated data from parallel X-ray, BI, and dendroanatomical measurements of temperature-sensitive Pinus sylvestris trees from northern Finland. We aim to determine whether cell wall density is critical to the success of X-ray-based MXD, and whether the BI-based parameter counterpart, here termed MXBI, contains useful information about the composition of the cell wall (specifically the lignin). Our results indicate that cell wall density and cell wall BI have no relevant influence on MXD and MXBI measurements. Even in years with severely reduced lignification, identified as so-called blue rings, dendroanatomical MXD (aMXD) measurements do not deviate significantly from their MXD or MXBI counterparts. Moreover, derived chronologies of cell wall density and cell wall BI contain no significant climate signals when correlated with local climate. Maximum latewood density of conifers can thus be obtained without bias using the dendroanatomical technique. Because lignin content appears to play a negligible role for cell wall BI, the cell wall BI likely presents the biggest challenge when producing unbiased MXBI data. This is because BI data is notorious for cell wall color distortion across the heartwood and sapwood, and between living wood and dead wood, and may therefore distort the otherwise strong link with wood density on multidecadal scales.","[Bjorklund, Jesper; Fonti, Marina, V; Fonti, Patrick; von Arx, Georg] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Fonti, Marina, V] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Ecol & Geog, Svobodny Pr 79, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Van den Bulcke, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Lab Wood Technol, Fac Biosci Engn,UGent Woodlab, Ghent, Belgium; [Van den Bulcke, Jan] Univ Ghent, Ctr Xray Tomog UGCT, Ghent, Belgium","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Siberian Federal University; Ghent University; Ghent University","Bjorklund, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",jesper.bjoerklund@wsl.ch,"Fonti, Patrick/B-7400-2011; von Arx, Georg/E-1785-2012","Fonti, Patrick/0000-0002-7070-3292; von Arx, Georg/0000-0002-8566-4599; Bjorklund, Jesper/0000-0003-4238-8173","Swiss National Science Foundation [183571, 200021_182398]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation SERI [SBFI C14.0104]","Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation SERI","We sincerely thank two anonymous referees for their valuable critiques of an earlier version of the manuscript.

The final result - performance of an occupied building depends on informed design decisions, mainly decisions made by architects at the earliest stages of design. Examples of such decisions include massing and orientation of buildings and facade strategies (window placements and shapes, glazing, light shelves and shading devices). This paper presents how new and innovative simulation methods, techniques and tools for analysing building performance can be used to evaluate and validate these design decisions. The analysed office building (sidelit, open-plan, narrow-plan space) is located in the south of Poland (latitude: 50 degrees N, longitude: 20 degrees E, moist continental climate with temperatures in winter to - 20 degrees C and in summer to 32 degrees C). The state-of-the-art DIVA software (Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare, EnergyPlus) and Climate Consultant were used in the research. It is widely accepted that the best orientation for a passive building is along east-west axis but the higher the latitude and the more overcast sky conditions the smaller difference is between the performance in terms of energy and thermal comfort of south-oriented and west-oriented building. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of building orientation (one of the most important geometric aspects - architectural means that the high performance of buildings can be achieved through) at the latitude of 50 degrees N on: illuminances from daylighting; occupants' visual comfort; heating, cooling and lighting energy consumption. The effect that various electric lighting systems and different glazing properties have on energy efficiency was tested in parallel. The paper also presents an example methodology for evaluating the high performance buildings. The results of the research will contribute to the development of design guidelines for office buildings in southern Poland.","[Masly, Dariusz] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Gliwice, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Masly, D (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Gliwice, Poland.",,,"Masly, Dariusz/0000-0002-6961-7725",,,,,12,3,3,0,2,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1095,,978-84-697-6957-7,ICERI PROC,,,2017,,,,,3526,3535,,,,,,10,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BJ9XB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000429975303091,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite relatively robust literature on the temperature sensitivity of carbon cycle at continental to global scales, less is known about the way this sensitivity is affected by precipitation. In this study we investigate how precipitation mediates the response of the carbon cycle to warming over the mid-to-high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (north of 30 degrees N). Based on atmospheric CO2 observations at Point Barrow (BRW) in Alaska, satellite-derived NDVI (a proxy of vegetation productivity), and temperature and precipitation data, we analyzed the responses of carbon cycle to temperature change in wet and dry years (with precipitation above or below the multiyear average). The results suggest that, over the past three decades, the net seasonal atmospheric CO2 changes at BRW were significantly correlated with temperature in spring and autumn, yet only weakly correlated with temperature and precipitation during the growing season. We further found that responses of the net CO2 changes to warming in spring and autumn vary with precipitation levels, with the absolute temperature sensitivity in wet years roughly twice that in dry years. The analyses of NDVI and climate data also identify higher sensitivity of vegetation growth to warming in wet years for the growing season, spring and summer. The different temperature sensitivities in wet versus dry years probably result from differences in soil moisture and/or nutrient availability, which may enhance (inhibit) the responsiveness of carbon assimilation and/or decomposition to warming under high (low) precipitation levels. The precipitation-mediated response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to warming reported here emphasizes the important role of precipitation in assessing the temporal variations of carbon budgets in the past as well as in the future. More efforts are required to reduce uncertainty in future precipitation projections, and to better represent the nonlinearity of carbon cycle responses to climate in current state-of-the-art land surface models.","[Lin, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xin; Li, Junsheng; Luo, Jianwu; Wu, Xiaopu; Tian, Yu; Wang, Wei] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences,"Li, JS (corresponding author), Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lijsh@craes.org.cn,"Lin, Xin/GRJ-1583-2022","wang, wei/0000-0002-3864-4931; Lin, Xin/0000-0002-0605-6430",Environmental Protection Public Service Project of China [201209028],Environmental Protection Public Service Project of China,"This study was supported by the Environmental Protection Public Service Project of China (201209028) (URL: http://kjs.mep.gov.cn/gyxhykyzx/).

Besides structural measures to mitigate flood risk, non-structural measures are known to be highly effective and low-cost. Such non-structural measures include Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS). Effective warning creation and dissemination are crucial to successful FEWS. Despite extensive bodies of research that cross the boundaries between disciplines and application domains, systematic understanding of the detailed aspects contributing to the effectiveness of flood warnings is lacking. We systematically review the state-of-the-art in risk perception and warning communication present in academic (and grey) literature for FEWS. We focus on the elements of risk warnings specifically, rather than reviewing the topic of risk communication in general. We start with exploring how personal attributes affect individual risk perception related to flood warnings. We then deconstruct flood warnings into three basic components: content, format and dissemination channel. Most importantly, we found 21 individual elements (options) for these components, each associated with varying levels of support for their effectiveness in literature. Important caveats were identified, such as a lack of research into the speech format and SMS channel. We then describe and visualise the warning creation process, providing a framework for guidance. Accelerating technological advancement necessitates continued research into the effectiveness of novel formats and channels, rendering the currently most widely supported and researched elements increasingly obsolete. Further research is needed to explore the complex interplay between elements, i.e., how do different combinations impact effectiveness? Finally, little is known about the transferability of our findings to Africa, Asia and South America, as industrialised countries dominate the research. We hope our findings will contribute to improved understanding, and support the practice of creating effective flood warnings.","[Kuller, Martijn; Schoenholzer, Kevin; Lienert, Judit] Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG),"Kuller, M (corresponding author), Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",martijnkuller@gmail.com,"Kuller, Martijn/AAE-1604-2019","Kuller, Martijn/0000-0002-2555-9113; Schoenholzer, Kevin/0000-0001-9892-5869",European Union [780118]; Eawag Discretionary Funding scheme to offset impacts of COVID-19,European Union(European Commission); Eawag Discretionary Funding scheme to offset impacts of COVID-19,"This research was performed as part of a project aimed at developing a flood forecast and early warning system in West Africa called FANFAR (www.fanfar.eu).We thank the FANFAR consortium members, and especially the workshop participants in West Africa, hydrologists and emergency managers, for fruitful discussions about the importance of effective flood warning systems, and inspirations for this paper.

Reflectivity values derived from TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) data are elaborated and compared against the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) freeze/thaw product, while state-of-the-art land cover data are used to select GNSS-R data within an estimated footprint. In spite of the limited data availability due to sparse spatial coverage and calibration issues of TDS-1 observations, the proposed analysis demonstrates the possibility of monitoring the freeze/thaw state by analyzing the calibrated reflectivity, including also the possibility of detecting the transition state between frozen and thawed conditions across seasonal variations. This feature makes the design of next-generation GNSS-R satellite missions a unique opportunity to achieve high-resolution freeze/thaw monitoring with small and low-cost platforms.","[Rautiainen, Kimmo; Cohen, Juval] Finnish Meteorol Inst FMI, Helsinki 00560, Finland; [Comite, Davide; Pierdicca, Nazzareno] Sapienza Univ, Dept Informat Engn Elect & Telecommun DIET, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Cardellach, Estel] Inst Ciencies DelEspai, Consejo Super Invest Cient ICE CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Unwin, Martin] Surrey Satellite Technol Ltd, Guildford GU2 7YE, Surrey, England",Finnish Meteorological Institute; Sapienza University Rome; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd,"Rautiainen, K (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst FMI, Helsinki 00560, Finland.",kimmo.rautiainen@fmi.fi,"Rautiainen, Kimmo/B-4106-2018; Cardellach, Estel/C-9418-2012; Comite, Davide/T-7324-2019","Rautiainen, Kimmo/0000-0003-0321-578X; Cardellach, Estel/0000-0001-8908-0972; Comite, Davide/0000-0002-5080-3966; Cohen, Juval/0000-0001-6396-1536; PIERDICCA, Nazzareno/0000-0002-1232-5377","European Space Agency (ESA) [4000129140]; MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE through the ICE-CSIC/IEEC Contribution [RTI2018-099008B-C22/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]","European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission); MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE through the ICE-CSIC/IEEC Contribution","This work was supported in part by the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of Scout Mission Concepts and System Consolidation Studies under Contract 4000129140 HydroGNSS Scout Study and in part by the Spanish under Grant RTI2018-099008B-C22/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE) through the ICE-CSIC/IEEC Contribution.",,34,2,2,3,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

To explore the prevalence of LGBTIQ + topics in articles published in journals most accessible to PreK-12 classroom teachers, the 13 top practitioner journals across all major content areas (i.e., English/Language Arts, social studies, mathematics, and science) and grade levels were selected. These results produce two salient conclusions. First, LGBTIQ + themes are present in articles published over the years. Second, individuals included under the LGBTIQ + umbrella are silenced. There is evidence of the use of the QLF before and after 2015, indicating that LGBTIQ + topics were addressed. Implications for teacher education and suggestions for future research are included.","[Suarez, Mario, I] Utah State Univ, Sch Teacher Educ & Leadership, 2805 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Meister, Samantha M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Studies, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Lindner, Amanda L.] Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, San Antonio, TX USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Wisconsin System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University San Antonio,"Suarez, MI (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Sch Teacher Educ & Leadership, 2805 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",mario.suarez@usu.edu,,"Suarez, Mario/0000-0001-6008-1664",,,,,107,3,3,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1936-1653,1936-1661,,J LGBT YOUTH,J.

In this study, we propose to predict DBH and AGB of individual trees using tree height (H) and crown diameter (CD), and other metrics extracted from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as input. In the proposed approach, regression methods, such us support vector machine for regression (SVR) and random forests (RF), were used to find a transformation or a transfer function that links the input parameters (H, CD, and other ALS metrics) with the output (DBH and AGB). The developed approach was tested on two datasets collected in southern Norway comprising 3970 and 9467 recorded trees, respectively. The results demonstrate that the developed approach provides better results compared to a state-of-the-art work (based on a linear model with the standard least-squares method) with RMSE equal to 81.4 kg and 92.0 kg, respectively (compared to 94.2 kg and 110.0 kg) for the prediction of AGB, and 5.16 cm and 4.93 cm, respectively (compared to 5.49 cm and 5.30 cm) for DBH.","[Malek, Salim; Miglietta, Franco] CNR, Inst Biometeorol, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Malek, Salim; Gobakken, Terje; Naesset, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Malek, Salim; Gianelle, Damiano; Dalponte, Michele] Fdn E Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sustainable Agroecosyst & Bioresources, V E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR); Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Fondazione Edmund Mach,"Dalponte, M (corresponding author), Fdn E Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sustainable Agroecosyst & Bioresources, V E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",michele.dalponte@fmach.it,"Dalponte, Michele/AAF-8095-2019; Miglietta, Franco/B-6137-2008; Dalponte, Michele/AAF-3772-2020","Miglietta, Franco/0000-0003-1474-8143; Dalponte, Michele/0000-0001-9850-8985","HyperBio project - BIONR program of the Research Council of Norway [244599]; TerraTec AS, Norway","HyperBio project - BIONR program of the Research Council of Norway; TerraTec AS, Norway","This work was supported by the HyperBio project (project 244599) financed by the BIONR program of the Research Council of Norway and TerraTec AS, Norway.",,21,7,8,3,15,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,JUN,2019,,,,,323,329,,10.3832/ifor2980-012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3832/ifor2980-012,,,7,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,IJ1WJ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000475689300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ozone represents one of the most harmful pollutants in urban and peri-urban environments, especially in warm climates. Besides the large interest in reducing anthropogenic and biogenic precursors of O-3 emissions, there is growing scientific activity aimed at understanding O-3 removal by vegetation, particularly trees. The intent of this paper is to provide the state of the art and suggestions to improve future studies of O-3 fluxes and to discuss implications of O-3 flux studies to maximize environmental services through the planning and management of urban forests. To evaluate and quantify the potential of O-3 removal in urban and peri-urban forests, we describe experimental approaches to measure O-3 fluxes, distinguishing laboratory experiments, field measurements, and model estimates, including recent case studies. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches and conclude that the combination of the three levels of investigation is essential for estimating O-3 removal by urban trees. We also comment on the implications of these findings for planning and management of urban forests, suggesting some key issues that should be considered to maximize O-3 removal by urban and peri-urban forests.","[Calfapietra, Carlo; Morani, Arianna; Sgrigna, Gregorio; Di Giovanni, Sara; Muzzini, Valerio; Pallozzi, Emanuele; Guidolotti, Gabriele] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol IBAF, I-05010 Porano, TR, Italy; [Nowak, David] SUNY Syracuse, ESF, Moon Lib 5, Northern Res Stn,USDA Forest Serv, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Fares, Silvano] Res Ctr Soil Plant Syst, Council Agr Res & Econ, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Calfapietra, Carlo] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Ctr, Czechglobe, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Sgrigna, Gregorio] DiBT Molise Univ, UniMol, Dep Biosci & Terr, I-86170 Pesche Is, Contrada Fonte, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biologia Agroambientale e Forestale (IBAF-CNR); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Calfapietra, C (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol IBAF, Via Marconi 2, I-05010 Porano, TR, Italy.",carlo.calfapietra@ibaf.cnr.it,"Fares, Silvano/H-4322-2011; Sgrigna, Gregorio/G-8201-2015","Fares, Silvano/0000-0002-1990-0928; Sgrigna, Gregorio/0000-0002-2914-2171; GUIDOLOTTI, GABRIELE/0000-0002-2052-6523; Pallozzi, Emanuele/0000-0001-5604-5337",European Project COST Action [FP1204]; European Project GREENINURBS; European Project EXPLO3RVOC (FP7-PEOPLE-CIG) [321711]; MIUR project RITMARE; MIUR project PRIN NEUFOR; Scientific Commission of Castelporziano; Multi-disciplinary Center for the Study of Coastal Mediterranean Ecosystems; MIUR-PRIN TREECITY project,"European Project COST Action; European Project GREENINURBS; European Project EXPLO3RVOC (FP7-PEOPLE-CIG); MIUR project RITMARE(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); MIUR project PRIN NEUFOR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Scientific Commission of Castelporziano; Multi-disciplinary Center for the Study of Coastal Mediterranean Ecosystems; MIUR-PRIN TREECITY project(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work was supported by European Projects COST Action FP1204 GREENINURBS, EXPLO3RVOC (FP7-PEOPLE-2012-CIG, proposal n. 321711) and the funded MIUR projects RITMARE and PRIN 2012/2013 NEUFOR.

The Standalone Fire Model (SFM) based on a state-of-the-art large scale mechanistic fire modelling algorithm is used to reproduce historical burned areas reported in the two publicly available datasets - European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). The most recent versions of these sources allow a broader validation of SFM's modelled burned areas at a country level. Our analysis is carried out for the years 2000-2008 for 17 European countries utilising both EFFIS and GFED datasets for model benchmarking. We suggest improving the original model by modifying the fire probability function reflecting fuel moisture. This modification allows for a dramatic improvement of accuracy in modelled burned areas for a range of European countries. We also explore in detail a pixel-level parametrisation of firefighting efficiency in SFM along with modifications of the biomass map. In comparison with the aggregated country-level approach, the advantages of the finer calibration are quite minor for the most recent version of the GFED dataset. Overall, the annual burned areas modelled by this improved SFM version are in good agreement with historical observations.","[Krasovskii, Andrey; Khabarov, Nikolay; Kraxner, Florian; Obersteiner, Michael] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Max Planck Society,"Krasovskii, A (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",,"Migliavacca, Mirco/J-9986-2019","Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; Krasovskiy, Andrey/0000-0003-0940-9366; Kraxner, Florian/0000-0003-3832-6236",,,,,0,9,9,0,4,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1049-8001,1448-5516,,INT J WILDLAND FIRE,Int.

A holistic approach was chosen to define all the main parameters characterizing the sample from the thermal, acoustic, mechanical, optical and environmental points of view. After an accurate state of the art survey, experimental measurements and numerical simulations were performed in order to evaluate the following parameters: thermal transmittance, airborne sound insulation, solar, light and UV transmittance, air permeability, water tightness, resistance to wind load. A LCA study allowed to correlate the energy and environmental impacts. By means of a comprehensive results analysis, a standard configuration of the window was defined (Scenario 0); two optimized scenarios were then selected, one including a solar control film in the glazing (Scenario 1) and another with a warm edge spacer replacing a common aluminium spacer (Scenario 2). A complete energy and environmental analysis was performed for all scenarios achieving a holistic evaluation of the benefits. Results show that in temperate climates the improvement of the window thermal characteristics, obtained through a proper control of solar radiation, is the most relevant criterion to optimize the overall energy and environmental performance of the window.

The foregoing are caused by the misuse of soil(2). The way soil resources have suffered gradual deterioration has become evident in Colombia during recent years; this has been produced by erosion and the removal of mass caused by various factors including physical and chemical erosion. All the above, together with negative events such as global climate change and the sedimentation of rivers, means a negative environmental impact. Soil erosion and desertification are major environmental issues regarding disturbances and threats affecting the arid, semiarid and dry sub-humid Mediterranean region's geo-ecosystems in the third millennium; additionally, economic global change may exacerbate such problems (Ingram etal., 1996; Williams etal., 1996). Regarding soil deterioration, soil vegetation cover and erosion control and mitigation measures should be introduced by using mechanisms which should be as natural as possible and do not induce fresh impacts on the environment.

The internal environments were assessed using a fungal index. The index is a biological climate-parameter, which represents the environmental capacity to allow fungal growth. To determine the index, fungal detectors encapsulating the spores of sensor fungi were placed at the site being examined. The growth response, germination of the spores and hyphal extension, of xerophilic sensor fungi was observed in the storehouse. The values of fungal index predicted propagation of fungi, although dehumidifiers were already in use. Next year, the number of dehumidifiers installed in the storehouse was increased from 3 to 8. After the number of dehumidifiers was increased, the indices were below the detectable limit in the storehouse indicating no fungal contamination will occur. The sensor fungi used in those assessments were five xerophilic and two non-xerophilic strains. In the assessment before countermeasures were taken, Aspergillus penicilhoides showed the highest growth response among the sensor fungi in the fungal detector exposed in the room where the contaminated painting was stored. Eurodum herbariorum showed the highest growth response in other rooms. These two strains were selected as the sensor fungi for assessments of museum environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The influences of human activity, including the crisis of climate change, along with globalized transport, are underlying factors shaping fungal adaptation to increased temperature and expanded geographical regions. Furthermore, the emergence of novel antifungal-resistant strains linked to excessive use of antifungals (in the clinic) and fungicides (in the field) offers an additional challenge to protect major crop staples and control dangerous fungal outbreaks. Hence, the alarming frequency of fungal infections in medical and agricultural settings requires effective research to understand the virulent nature of fungal pathogens and improve the outcome of infection in susceptible hosts. Mycology-driven research has benefited from a contemporary and unified approach of omics technology, deepening the biological, biochemical, and biophysical understanding of these emerging fungal pathogens. Here, we review the current state-ofthe-art multi-omics technologies, explore the power of data integration strategies, and highlight discovery-based revelations of globally important and taxonomically diverse fungal pathogens.

However, the state of the art approaches makes a strong and unrealistic assumption that battery capacity is fixed throughout the deployment time of an application. This results in scenarios where ENO systems over allocate sensing tasks, therefore as battery capacity degrades it causes the system to no longer be energy neutral and then fail unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the problem to maximise the quality-of-service in terms of duty cycle and the battery capacity to extend the deployment lifetime of a sensing application. In addition, we develop a lightweight algorithm to solve the formulated problem. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed method using real sensor energy consumption data captured from micro-climate sensors deployed in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London.

In recent decades, improvements in parallel visualization using state-of-the-art computing techniques have significantly enhanced our capacity to analyse massive geospatial data sets. However, only a few strategies have been developed to maximize the utilization of parallel computing resources to support interactive visualization. In particular, an efficient visualization intensity prediction component is lacking from most existing parallel visualization frameworks. In this study, we propose a data-driven view-dependent visualization intensity prediction method, which can dynamically predict the visualization intensity based on the distribution patterns of spatio-temporal data. The predicted results are used to schedule the allocation of visualization tasks. We integrated this strategy with a parallel visualization system deployed in a compute unified device architecture (CUDA)-enabled graphical processing units (GPUs) cloud. To evaluate the flexibility of this strategy, we performed experiments using dust storm data sets produced from a regional climate model. The results of the experiments showed that the proposed method yields stable and accurate prediction results with acceptable computational overheads under different types of interactive visualization operations. The results also showed that our strategy improves the overall visualization efficiency by incorporating intensity-based scheduling.","[Li, Jing; Liu, Qing] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, Denver, CO USA; [Zhang, Tong] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tong] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Manzhu] George Mason Univ, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Fairfax, VA USA",University of Denver; Wuhan University; George Mason University,"Li, J (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, Denver, CO USA.",Jing.Li145@du.edu,"Yu, Manzhu/J-6953-2019","Yu, Manzhu/0000-0001-6769-7517","Kunshan High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talents Program [31]; University of Denver; Natural Science Foundation of China [91538102, 41271400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund",Kunshan High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talents Program; University of Denver; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund,"This work was supported by the 2014 Kunshan High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talents Program: [Grant Number 31], University of Denver Faculty Research Fund; Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 91538102 and 41271400], Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund;",,20,2,2,0,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1365-8816,1362-3087,,INT J GEOGR INF SCI,Int.

For example, in Chile, the loss of farmable field due to recent earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions as well as the loss of water reserves due to climate changes are affecting the agriculture. Additionally, both countries are facing a same problem: the loss of human labor force. Field workers are migrating from the farm to other fields in the industry which offer them more stable and more profitable jobs (like the mining industry in Chile, or car assembling lines in Argentina). In this adverse scenario, it becomes necessary to introduce and develop agricultural automation and sensing technologies for both primary (harvesting, seeding, fertilizing, spraying) and secondary tasks (grove supervision, weed detection, hauling, mowing). However, fully robotized farms are not yet a possibility since the transition from human labor force dependent farming to autonomous farming needs to be smooth and requires legal regulation not yet in discussion. In this paper, we summarize the state of the art in human-robot interaction in farmable fields, with emphasis in the current constrains associated with flexible automatization of farms in Argentina and Chile. In particular, we introduce the guidelines for designing a human-robot interaction strategy for harvesting tasks, that could be used for other agricultural tasks.","[Auat Cheein, Fernando] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Elect Engn, Ind & Autonomous Robot Res Grp, Valparaiso, Chile; [Herrera, Daniel; Gimenez, Javier; Carelli, Ricardo] Univ Nacl San Juan, Inst Automat, San Juan, Argentina; [Torres-Torriti, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Rosell-Polo, Joan R.; Escola, Alexandre; Arno, Jaume] Univ Lleida, Res Grp AgroICT & Precis Agr, Lleida, Spain",Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Universidad Nacional de San Juan; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universitat de Lleida,"Cheein, FA (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Elect Engn, Ind & Autonomous Robot Res Grp, Valparaiso, Chile.",dherrera@inaut.unsj.edu.ar; jgimenez@inaut.unsj.edu.ar; rcarelli@inaut.unsj.edu.ar; mtorrest@ing.puc.cl; jr.rosell@eagrof.udl.cat; aescola@eagrof.udl.cat; JArno@eagrof.udl.cat,"Carelli, Ricardo/AAC-3596-2019; Cheein, Fernando Auat/H-7817-2012; Rosell-Polo, Joan R./D-4547-2009; Arn√≥, Jaume/F-7049-2011; Cheein, Fernando Auat/AAY-6744-2020; Rosell-Polo, Joan R/HHN-5124-2022; ESCOLA AGUSTI, Alexandre/G-5909-2010","Cheein, Fernando Auat/0000-0002-6347-7696; Rosell-Polo, Joan R./0000-0001-6746-2830; Arn√≥, Jaume/0000-0003-1179-8794; Cheein, Fernando Auat/0000-0002-6347-7696; ESCOLA AGUSTI, Alexandre/0000-0002-9775-5471",,,,,33,15,15,0,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4799-7800-7,,,,2015,,,,,289,295,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BE9HU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000377572200043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such strategies require operational practices that emphasize sustainability by considering economic, energy, and environmental aspects simultaneously. In this paper, a new combined production scheduling model that jointly considers energy control and maintenance implementation to address the concerns of energy consumption, intelligent maintenance, and throughput improvement simultaneously is proposed. Multiple measures are combined and evaluated using a single objective, i.e., cost minimization. Particle swarm optimization, with a local optimal avoidable mechanism and a time varying inertial weight, is used to solve the cost minimization problem to find a near optimal solution of production and maintenance schedules. A numerical case study is implemented and the results show that the cost per unit production can be reduced up to 27% compared to the existing benchmark strategies. The implications to practitioners with respect to the tradeoff between cost and throughput/energy consumption, and the model applicability considering energy tariff structure, are also discussed to provide more insights for using the proposed joint model in the real world. The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art on maintenance and energy scheduling, which is typically performed exclusively. It is expected to guide operational activities on shop floors toward sustainability.","[Sun, Zeyi] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [Dababneh, Fadwa; Li, Lin] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Li, L (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",sunze@mst.edu; fdabab2@uic.edu; linli@uic.edu,,"Dababneh, Fadwa/0000-0002-3205-9002; sun, zeyi/0000-0003-0704-2708",Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration in China [MSV201614],Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration in China,This work was supported by the Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration in China under Grant MSV201614.

An experiment was conducted to retrieve the AWV using the state-of-the-art GPS precise point positioning (PPP) technique. The effects of atmospheric weighted mean temperature model and zenith wet delay constraint on GPS AWV estimates were discussed in the PPP estimation system. The GPS-derived precipitable water vapor (PWV) and slant-path water vapor (SWV) were assessed by comparing with those derived from the Fifth Generation NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5). The results showed the PWV and SWV differences between those derived from both GPS and MM5 are 1.5 mm root mean square (RMS) with a bias of 0.2 and 3.9 mm RMS with a bias of -0.7 mm respectively. These good agreements indicate that the GPS-derived AWV in dynamic environments has a comparable accuracy with that of the MM5 model.

Therefore, it is critical to develop technologies to mitigate this problem. One very promising approach to reducing CO2 emissions is CO2 capture at a power plant, transport to an injection site, and sequestration for long-term storage in any of a variety of suitable geologic formations. However, if the promise of this approach is to come to fruition, capture costs will have to be reduced. The Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program is actively pursuing this goal. CO2 capture from coal-derived power generation can be achieved by various approaches: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion. All three of these pathways are under investigation, some at an early stage of development. A wide variety of separation techniques is being pursued, including gas phase separation, absorption into a liquid, and adsorption on a solid, as well as hybrid processes, such as adsorption/membrane systems. Current efforts cover not only improvements to state-of-the-art technologies but also development of several innovative concepts, such as metal organic frameworks, ionic liquids, and enzyme-based systems.

Academics and practitioners agree that in the global network era knowledge has become a key resource for continuous innovation and competitiveness. The issues of trust, social capital and the management of intellectual property have also attracted more attention in terms of knowledge creation. However, trust, intellectual property and contracts are seldom discussed simultaneously. This paper focuses on the roles of trust and contracts in asymmetric R&D collaboration. We begin by reviewing the state-of-the-art literature on these roles in interfirm collaboration, and continue by examining the potential for balancing trust and contracting in a case study in which a small firm collaborates with a large, global machinery and equipment supplier. We conclude that an understanding of the roles and dynamics of contracts and trust is critical for R&D collaboration. Contracts as such cannot guarantee successful collaboration, but the contracting process may be used purposefully to increase mutual understanding and learning, and to build up trust. We also offer some managerial recommendations on how to balance trust and contracting in asymmetric R&D collaboration. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Grape quality is a complex concept that mainly refers to berry chemical composition, including secondary metabolites such as aroma compounds that in white berries play a key role in the identity of the wine. Terpenes, thiols, C13-norisoprenoids, methoxypyrazines, and nonterpenic alcohols are the most important aroma compounds in white grapes and several of them can be found as free volatiles or bound as glycoconjugate molecules. Agronomic practices in vineyards, such as biostimulant application, irrigation, defoliation, training systems, foliar fertilization, and bunch thinning, can have a positive effect on their concentration. This review aims to highlight the aromatic characteristics of the most utilized white grape cultivars and focus on agronomic techniques in the vineyard to enhance, implement, and intensify their aromatic characteristics. The purpose of this review paper is therefore to investigate the state of the art regarding the exaltation of aroma in white grapes in the scientific literature through sustainable agronomic techniques, but further future investigations are considered necessary given the uncertainty concerning some mechanisms of biosynthesis and their correlation with such agronomic practices.","[Cataldo, Eleonora; Salvi, Linda; Paoli, Francesca; Fucile, Maddalena; Mattii, Giovan Battista] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy",University of Florence,"Cataldo, E (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy.",eleonora.cataldo@unifi.it; linda.salvi@unifi.it; francesca.paoli@unifi.it; maddalena.fucile@unifi.it; giovanbattista.mattii@unifi.it,,"Cataldo, Eleonora/0000-0001-6191-2044; Mattii, Giovan Battista/0000-0002-3826-7304; SALVI, LINDA/0000-0001-5029-9926",,,,,181,10,10,8,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,OCT,2021,10,,,,,,2027,10.3390/agronomy11102027,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11102027,,,19,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WN1JR,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000711532600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The electromechanical powertrain plays a key role in the efficiency of BEVs, which is why the design parameters in the development phase of electromechanical powertrains must be chosen carefully. One of the central design parameters is the maximum speed of the electric machines and the gear ratio of the connected transmissions. Due to the relationship between speed and torque, it is possible to design more compact and lighter electric machines by increasing the speed at constant power. However, with higher speed of the electric machines, a higher gear ratio is required, which results in a larger and heavier transmission. This study therefore examines the influence of maximum speed on the power density of electromechanical powertrains. Electric machines and transmissions with different maximum speeds are designed with the state-of-the-art for a selected reference vehicle. The designs are then examined with regard to the power density of the overall powertrain system. Compared to the reference vehicle, the results of the study show a considerable potential for increasing the power density of electromechanical powertrains by increasing the maximum speed of the electric machines.","[Schweigert, Daniel; Morhard, Bernd; Tripps, Alexander; Lohner, Thomas; Otto, Michael; Stahl, Karsten] Tech Univ Munich, Gear Res Ctr FZG, Boltzmannstr 15, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Gerlach, Martin Enno; Hoffmann, Alexander; Ponick, Bernd] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Drive Syst & Power Elect, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Leibniz University Hannover,"Schweigert, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Gear Res Ctr FZG, Boltzmannstr 15, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",schweigert@fzg.mw.tum.de; martin.gerlach@ial.uni-hannover.de; alexander.hoffmann@ial.uni-hannover.de; morhard@fzg.mw.tum.de; alexander.tripps@tum.de; lohner@fzg.mw.tum.de; otto@fzg.mw.tum.de; ponick@ial.uni-hannover.de; stahl@fzg.mw.tum.de,"; Stahl, Karsten/E-7296-2014; Ponick, Bernd/R-1340-2018; Lohner, Thomas/H-7769-2017","Schweigert, Daniel/0000-0002-5170-8602; Stahl, Karsten/0000-0001-7177-5207; Hoffmann, Alexander/0000-0002-8360-6862; Gerlach, Martin Enno/0000-0002-6932-8480; Ponick, Bernd/0000-0002-7762-2209; Lohner, Thomas/0000-0002-6067-9399",Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy,Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy,Supported by: Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag.,,57,2,2,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-8921,,VEHICLES-BASEL,Vehicles,JUN,2020,2,,,,365,397,,10.3390/vehicles2020020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vehicles2020020,,,33,"Engineering, Mechanical; Transportation Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Transportation,TP3WD,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000677524500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

A quantitative assessment of greenhouse energy consumption and its variability in space and time is strategic to improve the sustainability of the cultivation. The specific environmental features of the cultivation areas can strongly affect the sustainability of the production. A dynamic simulation model of greenhouse energy balance with an hourly time step was developed and parameterized for a state-of-the-art greenhouse to evaluate the heating requirements for cut-flower roses. This ornamental crop has been used as model species for its high energy requirement for flower production. The energy demand for rose production has been analyzed with an energy balance model with an hourly time step. After a preliminary analysis on the period 1973-2019, the final analysis was carried out on the 30-year period (1990-2019), representative of the current climate. Results show a gradient southwest-northeast of energy needs with relevant effects on economic and environmental sustainability. More specifically, four large sub-areas are identified, namely the central-southern Mediterranean (yearly requirements below 600 MJ m(-2) year), the northern Mediterranean, and the area influenced by the mitigating effect of the Atlantic Ocean (600-1200), the central-European area (requirements of 1200-1800), and the Northern European area (above 1800).","[Cola, Gabriele; Mariani, Luigi; Ferrante, Antonio] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci Prod, Landscape, Agroenergy, Via Celoria 2, Milan 201333, Italy; [Toscano, Stefania; Romano, Daniela] Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Via Valdisavoia 5, Catania 95123, Italy",University of Milan; University of Catania,"Ferrante, A (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci Prod, Landscape, Agroenergy, Via Celoria 2, Milan 201333, Italy.;Romano, D (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Via Valdisavoia 5, Catania 95123, Italy.",gabriele.cola@unimi.it; luigi.mariani@unimi.it; stefania.toscano@unict.it; dromano@unict.it; antonio.ferrante@unimi.it,"Ferrante, Antonio/B-1927-2008","Ferrante, Antonio/0000-0001-7781-9784; ROMANO, Daniela/0000-0002-4810-2124; Luigi, Mariani/0000-0002-1144-506X",,,,,32,4,4,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAR,2020,3,,,,,,422,10.3390/agronomy10030422,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10030422,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,LI3ID,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000529377300108,View Full Record in Web of Science

To enhance such experience, we generally look for assistance in planning a tour. Today, the information available on tourism-related aspects on the Internet is boundless and exploring suitable travel package/product/service may be time-consuming. A recommender system (RS) can assist for various tour-related queries such as top destinations for summer vacation, preferable climate conditions for tracking, the fastest way to transport, or photography assistance for specific destinations. In this survey, we have presented a pervasive review on travel and associated factors such as hotels, restaurants, tourism package and planning, and attractions; we have also tailored recommendations on a tourist's diverse requirements such as food, transportation, photography, outfits, safety, and seasonal preferences. We have classified travel-based RSs and presented selection criteria, features, and technical aspects with datasets, methods, and results. We have briefly supplemented research articles from diverse facets; various frameworks for a travel-based RS are discussed.

GCS is an approach being explored globally as a defense mechanism against climate change projections, although it is not without its critics. An important focus has been recently placed on understanding the coupling between rock-fluid geochemical alterations and mechanical changes for CO2 storage schemes in saline aquifers. This article presents a review of the current state of knowledge regarding CO2-induced geochemical reactions in subsurface reservoirs, and their potential impact on mechanical properties and microseismic events at CO2 storage sites. This review focuses, in particular, on the current state of the art in fluid-rock interactions within the GCS context. Key issues to be addressed include geochemical reactions and the alteration of transport and mechanical properties. Specific review topics include the swelling of clays, the prediction of dissolution and precipitation reaction rates, CO2-induced changes in porosity and permeability, constitutive models of chemo-mechanical interactions in rock, and correlations between geochemical reactions and induced seismicity. The open questions in the field are emphasized, and new research needs are highlighted.

In response to the rapidly developing field of critical plant studies, the representation of plants in literatures for children and young adults are now accumulating. Even as the number of studies is increasing, there is as yet no cohesive framework for the analysis of plant representation in children's literature. This article addresses this gap. Inspired by the Nature-in-Culture Matrix, an analytical figure that provides an overarching schema for ecocritical analysis of children's texts and cultures (see Goga et al., 2018), this article presents an analytical framework for plant-oriented analysis, the Phyto-Analysis Map. This map has been developed with reference to central concepts from the field of critical plant studies, and its usefulness is elucidated through literary examples.

Tides could significantly affect mean currents in long, narrow straits due to tide-topography interaction, but it is yet unclear how and to what extent tides control throughflows. Here, we focus on the throughflow in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, which has enormous impacts on the marine environment while its long-term mean characteristics, even the flow direction, are not well described by observations. By using a state-of-the-art ocean model, we show that the simulated throughflow is eastward on annual average and its volume transport is considerably suppressed by tides. It is found that tides enhance mixing and induce time-mean eddies, and both work to reduce the throughflow. A westward throughflow was previously estimated based on an acoustic measurement. The discrepancy between this estimate and our result would be due to whether or not such eddies are taken into account. These findings imply that tides may also suppress the throughflow of the other straits around the world. Revealing such tidal effects may contribute to a better performance of oceanic and climate simulations.","[Kurogi, Masao] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Hasumi, Hiroyasu] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo,"Kurogi, M (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",m_kurogi@jamstec.go.jp,,,"FLAGSHIP2020 project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science through the HPCI System Research project [hp160230, hp170234]","FLAGSHIP2020 project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science through the HPCI System Research project","We thank Dr. H.

The joint collaboration of institutional agencies and multidisciplinary approaches is essential for a successful development of heat-health warning systems and action plans which can reduce the impacts of extreme heat on the population. The present work constitutes a state-of-the-art review of 16 European heat-health warning systems and heat-health action plans, based on the existing literature, web search (over the National Meteorological Services websites) and questionnaires. The aim of this study is to pave the way for future heat-health warning systems, such as the one currently under development in the framework of the Horizon 2020 HEAT-SHIELD project. Some aspects are highlighted among the variety of examined European warning systems. The meteorological variables that trigger the warnings should present a clear link with the impact under consideration and should be chosen depending on the purpose and target of the warnings. Setting long-term planning actions as well as pre-alert levels might prevent and reduce damages due to heat. Finally, education and communication are key elements of the success of a warning system.","[Casanueva, Ana; Burgstall, Annkatrin; Kotlarski, Sven; Spirig, Christoph; Schwierz, Cornelia] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, CH-8058 Zurich Airport, Switzerland; [Casanueva, Ana] Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Meteorol Grp, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Messeri, Alessandro; Morabito, Marco] Univ Florence, Ctr Bioclimatol CIBIC, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Messeri, Alessandro] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Morabito, Marco] CNR, Inst BioEcon, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Flouris, Andreas D.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Exercise Sci, FAME Lab, Trikala 42100, Greece; [Nybo, Lars] Univ Copenhagen NEXS, Dept Nutr & Exercise Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Florence; University of Florence; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR); University of Thessaly,"Casanueva, A (corresponding author), Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, CH-8058 Zurich Airport, Switzerland.;Casanueva, A (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Meteorol Grp, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",ana.casanueva@unican.es,"Morabito, Marco/AAX-7261-2020; Flouris, Andreas/GXG-4893-2022; Casanueva, Ana/L-4055-2015; Spirig, Christoph/D-2471-2014","Morabito, Marco/0000-0002-8799-4866; Casanueva, Ana/0000-0002-7568-0229; Spirig, Christoph/0000-0001-9535-7333; Burgstall, Annkatrin/0000-0002-6834-6222", [668786],,"Financial support for this work is provided by the HEAT-SHIELD Project (HORIZON 2020, research and innovation programme under the grant agreement 668786).",,71,63,64,15,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The research was conducted in a Greek primary school and lasted seven months, involving two fifth grade classes and an integration class. It followed the three stages of a multi-thematic digital story project (preparation, implementation, and evaluation) and learners were called to research and process information, at their own pace, from diverse cognitive domains (art, science, coding). The research tools employed were participatory observation, diary research, and semi-structured interviews.

Grid-connected horizontal-axis hydrokinetic turbines are promising eco-friendly power sources for electrical energy supply to households near middle-to-high discharge rivers, while providing an opportunity to sell the energy surplus. In this work, a rotor design analysis of a hydrokinetic turbine with a 1 m nominal radius is performed based on blade element momentum theory. Then, an economic analysis is presented in terms of the discounted payback period and the internal rate of return. The numerical results show that three-bladed hydrokinetic turbines with a nominal tip speed ratio of 5 and state-of-the art high lift-to-drag ratio hydrofoils (similar to 100) lead to maximum performance with a power coefficient around 0.45. Performance can be further improved in an affordable manner using diffuser-augmented hydrokinetic turbines. The use of hydrokinetic energy in household applications can be profitable in leading economic countries with a discounted payback period of 4-6 years. In energy developing countries, this technological solution can be cost effective accompanied by economic subsides and implementation of a local industry, resulting in similar payback periods.","[Puertas-Frias, Carmen M.; Garcia-Salaberri, Pablo A.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Thermal & Fluids Engn, Leganes 28911, Spain; [Puertas-Frias, Carmen M.] Eurofighter GmbH, Dept Data Documentat & Digitalizat, D-85399 Hallbergmoos, Germany; [Willson, Clinton S.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Garcia-Salaberri, PA (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Thermal & Fluids Engn, Leganes 28911, Spain.",pagsalab@ing.uc3m.es,"; Garcia-Salaberri, Pablo A./H-7993-2015","Willson, Clinton/0000-0002-7914-0596; Garcia-Salaberri, Pablo A./0000-0002-3918-5415","Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid [PID2019-106740RB-I00, EIN2020-112247]",Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion(Spanish Government); Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,This work was supported by projects PID2019-106740RB-I00 and EIN2020-112247 of the Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion.

Food security through productivity enhancement is the major thrust of most of the national and international development agendas. This coupled with increasing population are driving up global food demand thus putting upward pressure on Agricultural productivity. Technological development via Hydroponics can be the potential solution to this issue. With this backdrop, we adapted a global commutable general equilibrium model using latest available GTAP data set to quantify the potential hydroponics production on macro as well as at micro level in Pakistan. Different simulations were designed comprises of increase in the production of fruits and vegetables using hydroponics and reducing the import tariffs of chemical used as an input in this state of art technology.

This approach, however, relies on a thorough understanding of how manganese is incorporated into the shell material - a point that remained controversial so far. Here we clarify this issue, using state-of-the-art X-ray absorption and X-ray emission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations. We verify that in the shells of all studied species manganese is incorporated as high-spin Mn2+, i.e. manganese always has the same valence as calcium. More importantly, the unique chemical sensitivity of valence-to-core X-ray emission enables us to show that manganese is always coordinated by a CO3-octahedron. This, firstly, provides firm experimental evidence for manganese being primarily located in the inorganic carbonate. Secondly, it indicates that the structure of the aragonitic host is locally altered such that manganese attains an octahedral, calcitic coordination. This modification at the atomic level enables the bivalve to accommodate many orders of magnitude more manganese in its aragonitic shell than found in any non-biogenic aragonite. This outstanding feature is most likely facilitated through the non-classical crystallization pathway of bivalve shells.","[Soldati, Analia L.] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geowissensch, Becherweg 21, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Jacob, Dorrit E.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2009, Australia; [Glatzel, Pieter; Swarbrick, Janine C.] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, BP 220, F-38043 Grenoble 9, France; [Geck, Jochen] Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Chem & Phys Mat, Hellbrunner Str 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Soldati, Analia L.] Ctr Atom Bariloche, CONICET, Av Bustillo 9500, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Macquarie University; European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF); Salzburg University; Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica (CNEA); Centro Atomico Bariloche; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Geck, J (corresponding author), Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Chem & Phys Mat, Hellbrunner Str 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",jochen.geck@sbg.ac.at,"Glatzel, Pieter/E-9958-2010; Jacob, Dorrit E/F-8617-2010; Geck, Jochen/AAC-7906-2022","Glatzel, Pieter/0000-0001-6532-8144; Jacob, Dorrit E/0000-0003-4744-6627; Geck, Jochen/0000-0002-2438-0672","ESRF [EC-571]; Emmy Noether program of the DFG [GE1647-1]; ARC Future Fellowship at Macquarie University; Earth System Cycles Research Center, Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz","ESRF; Emmy Noether program of the DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ARC Future Fellowship at Macquarie University(Australian Research Council); Earth System Cycles Research Center, Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz","The shells of Hyriopsis cumingii were obtained from the collection of the Department of Geosciences at the Johannes Gutenberg University.

At the European Union level (EU27 countries), two of the main pillars for achieving carbon neutrality are: (1) The Energy Efficiency First principle in the formulation of energy policy and in taking relevant investment decisions and (2) the electrification of the energy sector, supported by generating electricity through endogenous renewable energy sources. In this context, a comprehensive review was carried out on what has been developed by the scientific community and main international energy organizations on the electrification of the energy sector. Additionally, with the purpose of better understanding the state of the art of a country regarding the decarbonization process, the Portuguese energy vectors were identified in terms of which ones can and should be electrified by 2050, based on the data available from Eurostat (2019). Portugal is a country highly dependent on imported energy (78%), where the largest energy vector is from oil and petroleum products (68%) mostly used in the transport sector, where the electrification of the sector will be increased gradually until 2050. However, other decarbonized solutions, such as biofuels and synthetic (green) fuels cannot be ruled out and should be the subject of future work and considered for the decarbonization goals to be achieved in 2050. The main conclusions reflect that there is still a long way to go, much like the rest of the world, as it is necessary to electrify the equivalent to almost all the energy presently imported by Portugal, a tough challenge considering the need for its generation to be decarbonized. In this context, energy efficiency must play an equivalently important role to significantly reduce current energy demand, leading to more cost-effective and resilient energy services.","[Martins, Fernando; Moura, Pedro; de Almeida, Anibal T.] Univ Coimbra, Inst Syst & Robot, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, P-3030290 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Martins, F (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Inst Syst & Robot, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, P-3030290 Coimbra, Portugal.",fmartins@isr.uc.pt; fmartins@isr.uc.pt; fmartins@isr.uc.pt,"ÈÉ≠, ÈùíÈúû/GZH-2618-2022; Moura, Pedro/B-9227-2011","Moura, Pedro/0000-0003-4852-2812; Martins, Fernando/0000-0002-1729-6907; de Almeida, Anibal/0000-0002-3641-5174",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [UIDB/00048/2020],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),The authors acknowledge Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) for the financial support to the project UIDB/00048/2020.,,135,2,2,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,1759,10.3390/en15051759,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15051759,,,35,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,ZW9KG,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000771522600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geoarchaeological science is widely employed in many regions of the world to contextualise archaeological material and provide an environmental backdrop against which to explore archaeological narratives. However, in Southeast Asia there is an apparent lag in the routine use of this Earth-Science approach despite the abundance of archaeological sites important in explicating past hominin dispersals to and from the region. In this review of the state-of-the-art of geoarchaeological research in Southeast Asia, I examine the role of the discipline in addressing the important issues in archaeology today. I identify where geoarchaeology is being used and to what effect, highlighting gaps in the geoarchaeological dataset. From a methodological point of view it is imperative that archaeologists and geoarchaeologists working in Southeast Asia (and other humid tropical regions of the world) fully appreciate how to interpret the geoarchaeological signatures associated with this climate regime so that methods and practice can be refined. A series of steps that will serve to drive forward geoarchaeological research in the region are also proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to study the way of waveform-based land cover classification using machine learning methods, we utilized decision tree (DT) and Gaussian process (GP) methods to analyze the accuracy of land cover classification. DT classification is a convenient and practical method used in previous reports. GP classification can provide the state-of-the-art recognition performance using an elegant Bayesian framework. To generate the true labels of machine learning classifiers, a solution of the time-matching and location-matching between ICESat/GLAS laser footprints and LANDSAT images has been achieved. Plenty of experiments have been implemented in the Jakobshavn Glacier by evaluating classifiers features selection, training data ratio and classification confusion matrix. Experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the GP classification is solidly higher than DT classification but GP classification consumes more time. At the best training data ratio of 70%, GP classification accuracy is 92.22% which is higher than DT classification accuracy of 87.78%.","[Zhao, Qunchong; Li, Xiaolu; Xu, Lijun] Beihang Univ, Sch Instrument Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Li, XL (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Instrument Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",xiaoluli@buaa.edu.cn,"Li, Xiaolu/AAC-5820-2020","Xu, Lijun/0000-0003-0488-9604","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61671038]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YWF-16-BJ-Y-54, YWF-17-BJ-Y-20]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University [IRT16R02]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)),"The authors would like to thank the National Snow and Ice Data Center and U.S. Geological Survey for their guidelines and data distribution.

As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.","[Michaelides, Angelos] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, Thomas Young Ctr, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Cox, Stephen J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Michaelides, A (corresponding author), UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, Thomas Young Ctr, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",angelos.michaelides@ucl.ac.uk,"Zen, Andrea/O-3076-2019","Zen, Andrea/0000-0002-7648-4078; Sosso, Gabriele Cesare/0000-0002-6156-7399; Michaelides, Angelos/0000-0002-9169-169X; Fitzner, Martin/0000-0001-6790-4301; Chen, Ji/0000-0003-1603-1963; Cox, Stephen/0000-0003-2708-8711",European Research Council under the European Union [616121]; Royal Society,European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Royal Society(Royal Society of London),"This work was supported by the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement 616121 (HeteroIce project).

As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field.

The continuous implementation of renewable energy sources increases energy efficiency, while the reduction of CO2 emissions opens new options for carbon capture technologies to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. The combination of carbon capture with renewable energy balancing production offers excellent potential for fuels and chemical products and can play an essential role in the future energy system. This paper includes a critical review of the state of the art of different CO2 capture engineering pathways and technologies including a techno-economics analysis and focusing on comparing these technologies depending on the final CO2 application. The current cost for CO2 capture is in the range of 60-110 USD/t, likely to halve by 2030. This review offers technical information to select the most appropriate technology to be used in specific processes and for the different carbon capture pathways, i.e., Pre-combustion, Post-Combustion and Direct Air Capture. This comparison includes the CO2 capture approach for biomethane production by biogas upgrading to substitute fossil natural gas and other alternatives fuels production routes which will be introduces in future works performed by this review authors.","[Garcia, Jose Antonio; Villen-Guzman, Maria; Rodriguez-Maroto, Jose Miguel; Paz-Garcia, Juan Manuel] Univ Malaga, Dept Chem Engn, Campus Teatinos S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain; [Garcia, Jose Antonio] Carbotech Gas Syst GmbH, Kronprinzenstr 30, D-45128 Essen, Germany",Universidad de Malaga,"Villen-Guzman, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Dept Chem Engn, Campus Teatinos S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain.",mvillen@uma.com,"Paz-Garcia, Juan Manuel/M-5654-2015","Paz-Garcia, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-1464-6975",,,,,193,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2213-2929,2213-3437,,J ENVIRON CHEM ENG,J.

Moreover, the adverse effects are extending to climate, as well as to human and ecosystem health. Coordinated efforts are often deemed critical to minimize the trade-offs while maximizing the synergies in the use and the effective analysis of the interlinkages among food, energy, and water within urban ecosystems. Data are collected and transformed into useful information through different indicators, which are often applied to guide several policies in the urban domain. However, their different nature now asks for a critical reanalysis to collate them into different groups, understanding their guiding principles and identifying possible gaps for further policy- and design-oriented studies. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art on existing urban FEW nexus indicators. Indicators were found to belong to four main distinct groups, measuring resource fluxes (52%); quantifying environmental impacts (13%), and efficiency aspects (29%). Results highlight a need to develop new indicators, considering the inclusion of all involved factors within new integrated metrics. However, prior to developing an overall sustainability indicator system is presented, it would be vital to incorporate as many flows as possible to represent the entire urban systems.","[Arthur, Mercy; Liu, Gengyuan; Hao, Yan; Zhang, Lixiao; Liang, Sai] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gengyuan; Hao, Yan; Zhang, Lixiao; Liang, Sai] Beijing Engn Res Ctr Watershed Environm Restorat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Asamoah, Ernest Frimpong] Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lombardi, Ginevra Virginia] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy",Beijing Normal University; Macquarie University; University of Florence,"Liu, GY; Hao, Y (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",liugengyuan@bnu.edu.cn; haoyan@bnu.edu.cn,"Asamoah, Ernest Frimpong/A-1755-2019; hao, yan/HGB-0465-2022","Asamoah, Ernest Frimpong/0000-0003-0712-5642; Liang, Sai/0000-0002-6306-5800; Liu, Gengyuan/0000-0002-3488-9536; Lombardi, Ginevra Virginia/0000-0001-6034-6810",Projects of International Cooperation of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51661125010]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0502800]; Beijing Science and Technology Planning Project [Z181100009618030]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673029]; 111 Project [B17005],"Projects of International Cooperation of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Beijing Science and Technology Planning Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work is supported by the Projects of International Cooperation of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51661125010), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFC0502800), Beijing Science and Technology Planning Project (No. Z181100009618030), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71673029) and the 111 Project (No. B17005).",,89,36,37,18,178,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

High-temperature CO2 absorption looping is a promising process that offers a much lower energy penalty than the current state of the art amine scrubbing techniques, but more effective materials are required for widespread implementation. This work describes the experimental characterization and CO2 absorption properties of several new ternary transition metal oxides predicted by high-throughput DFT screening. One material reported here, Li5SbO5, displays reversible CO2 sorption, and maintains similar to 72% of its theoretical capacity out to 25 cycles. The results in this work are used to discuss major influences on CO2 absorption capacity and rate, including the role of the crystal structure, the transition metal, the alkali or alkaline earth metal, and the competing roles of thermodynamics and kinetics. Notably, this work shows the extent and rate to which ternary metal oxides carbonate are driven primarily by the identity of the alkali or alkaline earth ion and the nature of the crystal structure, whereas the identity of the transition ion carries little influence in the systems studied here.","[Gaultois, Michael W.; Dunstan, Matthew T.; Bateson, Adam W.; Grey, Clare P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Chan, Martin S.

PV power output capacity, however, is still low and the associated costs still high, so efforts continue to develop PV converter and its controller, aiming for higher power-extracting efficiency and cost effectiveness. Different algorithms have been proposed for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Since the choice of right converter for different application has an important influence in the optimum performance of the photovoltaic system, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art in research works on non-isolated DC-DC buck, boost, buck-boost, Cuk and SEPIC converters and their characteristics, to find a solution best suiting an application with Maximum Power Point Tracking. Review shows that there is a limitation in the system's performance according to the type of converter used. In can be concluded that the best selection of DC-DC converter which is really suitable and applicable in the PV system is the buck-boost DC-DC converter since it is capable of achieving optimal operation regardless of the load value with negotiable performance efficiency and price issue.

The regulatory framework in environmental licensing for renewable energy sources is specific for each country, however there are basic elements that can be replicated for new markets. This article aims to propose guidelines and policy implications in environmental licensing for offshore wind projects for new markets based on the state of the art and lessons learned from three mature countries and one emerging market. The research involved three phases: literature review on sustainable development and environmental licensing procedures for offshore wind farms; research cases in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, and Taiwan; and the structuring of guidelines and policy implications. As a result, eight guidelines and their policy implications are proposed, among them: (i) Establishment of a national offshore wind energy production target; (ii) Mapping of marine offshore wind zones; (iii) Adoption of a one-stop-shop procedure; (iv) Development of a guide for environmental licensing for offshore wind farms; and others. In conclusion, the establishment of a regulatory framework in environmental licensing for offshore wind projects, based on sustainable development principles and good practices of leading markets, guides public policies of new markets to have a greater probability of sustainable development.","[de Vasconcelos, Rafael Monteiro; Cirilo Silva, Lara Luana; Aguirre Gonzalez, Mario Orestes; Santiso, Andressa Medeiros; de Melo, David Cassimiro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Res Grp Renewable Energy, CREATION, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Cirilo Silva, Lara Luana; Aguirre Gonzalez, Mario Orestes; Santiso, Andressa Medeiros] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Program Prod Engn, Natal, RN, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,"de Vasconcelos, RM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Res Grp Renewable Energy, CREATION, Natal, RN, Brazil.",rafaelmonteirov@yahoo.com.br; lara.cirilo.080@ufrn.edu.br; mario.gonzalez@ufrn.br; andressamsantiso@gmail.com; davidcassi@yahoo.com.br,,"Melo, David/0000-0001-6744-0914","R&D - Electric Sector of ANEEL [PD-00553-0045/ 2016]; Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Brazil (MCTI) [14/2019]","R&D - Electric Sector of ANEEL; Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Brazil (MCTI)","Our acknowledgment to: 1) partnership between Petrobras and Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) and received financial support of the R&D - Electric Sector of ANEEL (PD-00553-0045/ 2016), 2) Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Brazil (MCTI), TED N.. 14/2019; 3) Mrs. Roberta Cox by the critical review, and 4) Mrs. Theresa O'Brien de Brito by English language review.",,88,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2022,,,,,,,113248,10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113248,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5J3XF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000868976300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Classification accuracies of these methods degrade considerably in cross-year mapping. Cross-year crop mapping is more useful as it allows the prediction of the following years' crop maps using previously labeled data. We propose vector dynamic time warping (VDTW), an innovative multi-year classification approach based on warping of angular distances between phenological vectors. The results prove that the proposed VDTW method is robust to temporal and spectral variations compensating for different farming practices, climate and atmospheric effects, and measurement errors between years. We also describe a method for determining the most discriminative time window that allows high classification accuracies with limited data. We carried out tests with Landsat 8 time-series imagery from years 2013 to 2015 for the classification of corn and cotton in the Harran Plain of southeastern Turkey. In addition, we tested VDTW corn and soybean in Kansas, the US for 2017 and 2018 with the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel data. The VDTW method improved cross-year overall accuracies by 3% with fewer training samples compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

Although, conventional precious metal-based catalysts such as platinum, iridium, and ruthenium are able to efficiently catalyze the conversion of chemical to electrical energy, they are often very costly, scarce, and suffer from poor stability, hence impeding their widespread applications. The limitations of the current state-of art catalysts have propelled tremendous efforts in search for alternative catalysts. Notably, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have spurred much enthusiasm because of their natural abundance, low cost, and remarkable catalytic activity. Numerous studies have recounted that doping can tune the properties of TMDs and that vanadium dopants reportedly improve the electrical properties of Group 6 TMDs. Herein, the authors aspire to investigate the effects of doping varying amounts of vanadium on molybdenum dichalcogenides on their electrocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. Despite previous studies bespeaking promising effects, the results here demonstrate both improvements and worsening of electrocatalytic performances from varying the stoichiometry of vanadium dopants in molybdenum dichalcogenides, depending on the type of materials and intended electrochemical applications.","[Chia, Hui Ling] Nanyang Technol Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch, NTU Inst Hlth Technol, 50 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637553, Singapore; [Mayorga-Martinez, Carmen C.; Webster, Richard D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Chem & Biol Chem, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Chia, Hui Ling; Mayorga-Martinez, Carmen C.; Pumera, Martin] Univ Chem & Technol Prague, Fac Chem Technol, Dept Inorgan Chem, Ctr Adv Funct Nanorobots, Tech 5, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Sofer, Zdenek] Univ Chem & Technol Prague, Dept Inorgan Chem, Tech 5, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Lazar, Petr] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Pumera, Martin] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, 91 Hsueh Shih Rd, Taichung 40402, Taiwan; [Pumera, Martin] Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea","Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague; University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague; Palacky University Olomouc; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; Yonsei University","Pumera, M (corresponding author), Univ Chem & Technol Prague, Fac Chem Technol, Dept Inorgan Chem, Ctr Adv Funct Nanorobots, Tech 5, Prague 6, Czech Republic.;Pumera, M (corresponding author), China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, 91 Hsueh Shih Rd, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.;Pumera, M (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",pumeram@vscht.cz,"Pumera, Martin/F-2724-2010; Webster, Richard/A-9118-2008; Lazar, Petr/C-1074-2011; Sofer, Zdenek/A-9690-2010","Pumera, Martin/0000-0001-5846-2951; Webster, Richard/0000-0002-0896-1960; Lazar, Petr/0000-0002-7312-3656; Sofer, Zdenek/0000-0002-1391-4448","Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [EXPRO: 19-26896X, LTAUSA19034]; Ministry of Education Youth and Sports (MEYS)","Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Ministry of Education Youth and Sports (MEYS)(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)",M.P. acknowledges the financial support of Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (EXPRO: 19-26896X).

The specific objective of the analysis is the investigation of structures subjected to high run-up levels and low freeboards, under severe or extreme conditions that are likely to occur in the future due to climate change. The adopted methodology is based on the collection of new experimental and numerical tests of wave overtopping at smooth dikes at various crest levels. The reliability of the new data is checked in terms of average overtopping discharge and wave reflection coefficient, against consolidated predicting methods from the literature. An update and refitting of the existing formulae for the prediction of the extreme flow depths and velocities at the dike off-shore edge is proposed based on the experimental and numerical outcomes. The dynamics of the overtopping flow propagation along the dike crest under breaking and non-breaking waves, in emerged and submerged conditions, is investigated. Guidelines to update the state-of-the-art formulae for a more cautious estimation of the water depths and the velocities of propagation of the flow in the landward area are provided.","[Formentin, Sara Mizar; Gaeta, Maria Gabriella; Palma, Giuseppina; Zanuttigh, Barbara; Guerrero, Massimo] Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Formentin, SM (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",saramizar.formentin2@unibo.it; g.gaeta@unibo.it; giuseppina.palma2@unibo.it; barbara.zanuttigh@unibo.it; massimo.guerrero@unibo.it,"Gaeta, Maria Gabriella/I-8420-2012","Gaeta, Maria Gabriella/0000-0002-3261-4758; Zanuttigh, Barbara/0000-0001-7728-1320; FORMENTIN, SARA MIZAR/0000-0003-1002-0796; Guerrero, Massimo/0000-0001-9486-7980",Horizon 2020 project BRIGAID (BRIdging the GAp for Innovations in Disaster resilience) [700699],Horizon 2020 project BRIGAID (BRIdging the GAp for Innovations in Disaster resilience),"This research was funded by the Horizon 2020 project BRIGAID (BRIdging the GAp for Innovations in Disaster resilience, www.brigaid.eu), grant number 700699.",,40,8,8,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2019,10,,,,,,2197,10.3390/w11102197,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11102197,,,32,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JL5VD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000495598400241,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building on the contributions by Larson and Barr, Keulartz, Bovenkerk and Verweij, and Ramp and Bekoff, I will argue that, in the course of history, the Ark has evolved from a fictional (imaginary) icon into something increasingly real. The agricultural village of the Neolithic era already functioned as a sheltered enclave, a survival machine designed to allow a select number of humans and accompanying species to withstand environmental fluctuations and survival pressure. In the current situation, however, the Ark has developed into a Gestell of planetary dimensions. The concept of the anthropocene basically conveys the idea that we have entered a global symbolical Ark, conceptualised by Teilhard de Chardin as the noosphere (the world-wide web of intelligence and policies, technologies and engineering, research and regulations) and emerging against the backdrop of a necro(s) cene: an ambiance of mass extinction. Increasingly, prospects for survival of a disconcertingly large number of species depend on human behaviour and human decision: on our ability or failure to collectively address the daunting challenges of the present.","[Zwart, Hub] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Philosophy Nat Sci, Fac Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Zwart, Hub] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Philosophy, Fac Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Zwart, H (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Philosophy Nat Sci, Fac Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands.;Zwart, H (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Philosophy, Fac Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",h.zwart@science.ru.nl,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1570-3010,,978-3-319-44206-8; 978-3-319-44205-1,INT LIBR ENVIRON AGR,,,2016,,,,,397,407,,10.1007/978-3-319-44206-8_24,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44206-8_24,10.1007/978-3-319-44206-8,,11,History & Philosophy Of Science; Zoology,Book Citation Index ‚Äì Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index ‚Äì Science (BKCI-S),History & Philosophy of Science; Zoology,BH2LD,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000399027400024,View Full Record in Web of Science

The change in surface temperature is one of the important indicators in detecting climate change. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning model named Spatial Feature Attention Long Short-Term Memory (SFA-LSTM) model to capture accurate spatial and temporal relations of multiple meteorological features to forecast temperature. Significant spatial feature and temporal interpretations of historical data aligned directly to output feature helps the model to forecast data accurately. The spatial feature attention captures mutual influence of input features on the target feature. The model is built using encoder-decoder architecture, where the temporal dependencies in data are learnt using LSTM layers in the encoder phase and spatial feature relations in the decoder phase. SFA-LSTM forecasts temperature by simultaneously learning most important time steps and weather variables. When compared with baseline models, SFA-LSTM maintains the state-of the-art prediction accuracy while offering the benefit of appropriate spatial feature interpretability.

These and other characteristics that the researcher wishes to reveal are useful, within a given discipline, in order to envision the panorama of knowledge around the subject that concern us and also identify little-studied lines of research; allowing us to propose research that contributes to the generation of knowledge in the field. Through specialized software and using the search engines Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, the scientific production about transboundary basins and mountain areas was reviewed, to find the theoretical niches and research problems relating to these geographical units. Journals, authors, frequency indicators of local citations and global citations, research institutions and prominent countries were also identified. As a result, we obtained that, for transboundary basins, there is a research niche related to water policy, water resources and climate change, while in mountain areas the trends are towards local development of rural areas and its depopulation.","[Meza Aliaga, Monica] Univ Playa Ancha, Geog, Valparaiso, Chile; [Meza Aliaga, Monica] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile",Universidad de Playa Ancha; Universidad de Tarapaca,"Aliaga, MM (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Dept Ciencias Hist & Geog, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Av 18 Septiembre, Arica 2222, Chile.",msmezaa@uta.cl,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,DEC,2019,12,,,,698,706,,,,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KA8GX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000506041600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

These abnormal phenomena further cause increasingly serious traffic problems, such as infrastructure damage, traffic congestion, and traffic accidents, which make the road transport system operation vulnerably. Hence the vulnerability evaluation has recently aroused general interests in transportation research. This study aims to construct an effective methodology used for evaluating road transport system vulnerability against meteorological disasters from the view of risk analysis theory. Firstly, the paper reviews the research state of art of vulnerability and establishes the vulnerability evaluation system, which is based on three aspects including physical exposure, disaster loss sensitivity and resistance ability. Secondly, 13 evaluation indices are elaborately selected and quantified, and then the single vulnerability evaluation index is obtained by the combinational method of analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory. Finally, this methodology is applied on Hangzhou regional road network and the results show that Hangzhou road transport vulnerability scores 55.3, and the vulnerability grade belongs to Middle, which indicates this road network is lightly vulnerable to meteorological disasters.

Radiocarbon dating (10 700 +/- 60 BP or 10910-10 680 cal. BC) places it in the Final Palaeolithic, at the end of Weichselian (boundary of the Altered and Younger Dryas). The surface of the artefact bears a complex ornament of zigzag lines and an anthropomorphic drawing, representing most probably a woman with spread legs. Palynological analysis of the deposit in which the object was found indicates forest communities (pine-birch forests) with some open areas, in a cool climate. Ultrastructural examination points to the elk Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758) as the source species; the antler was at the stage of intense growth which indicates that the elk was killed or died in the spring-summer period. The antler was large, and the object made of it was used for a long time, playing a role in rituals and symbolic culture of a hunting group. The ornamentation shows an affinity to the early Mesolithic art and makes it possible to better trace the relations between the hunters of the late Pleistocene and those of the early Holocene.

Hence, studying their properties and recovering them from light scattering measurements is of great importance. State of the art retrieval methods such as pre-computed look-up tables and iterative, physics-based algorithms can suffer from either accuracy or speed limitations. These limitations are becoming increasingly restrictive as instrumentation technology advances and measurement complexity increases. Machine learning algorithms offer new opportunities to overcome these problems, by being quick and precise. In this work we present a method, using invertible neural networks to retrieve aerosol properties from in situ light scattering measurements. In addition, the algorithm is capable of simulating the forward direction, from aerosol properties to measurement data. The applicability and performance of the algorithm are demonstrated with simulated measurement data, mimicking in situ laboratory and field measurements. With a retrieval time in the millisecond range and a weighted mean absolute percentage error of less than 1.5%, the algorithm turned out to be fast and accurate. By introducing Gaussian noise to the data, we further demonstrate that the method is robust with respect to measurement errors. In addition, realistic case studies are performed to demonstrate that the algorithm performs well even with missing measurement data.","[Boiger, Romana; Degen, David; Adelmann, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Sci Comp & Modelling, Forsch Str 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Modini, Rob L.; Moallemi, Alireza; Gysel-Beer, Martin] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, Forsch Str 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute,"Gysel-Beer, M (corresponding author), Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, Forsch Str 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",martin.gysel@psi.ch,"Modini, Rob L./AAF-6036-2019; Gysel-Beer, Martin/C-3843-2008","Modini, Rob L./0000-0002-2982-1369; Gysel-Beer, Martin/0000-0002-7453-1264",PSI Career Return Program; MeteoSwiss; Swiss National Science Foundation (BISAR project; SNSF) [200021_204823],PSI Career Return Program; MeteoSwiss; Swiss National Science Foundation (BISAR project; SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),Romana Boiger was funded by the PSI Career Return Program.

Agricultural crops are increasingly subject to drought due to the effects of global climate change, and the same is true for Croatia due to the constant rise in mean annual temperatures and uneven rainfall distribution. Remote sensing methods have proven to be superior in the detection and monitoring of drought compared to conventional methods of observation from meteorological stations. Information on the condition of crops in the early stages of development indicates potential irregularities in the development of agricultural crops. The objective of this paper is to provide a perspective for the application of remote sensing in crop management using state-of-the-art methods. Analysis of the possible implementation of these methods in Croatia was performed on a macro- and micro-level. Spatial classification, cropland suitability multicriteria analysis, drought assessment, weed detection and crop density calculation were evaluated according to the necessary equipment and data processing segments.

A special focus is given to the use proteomics technologies as a tool in the evaluation of pathogens and host-pathogen interactions and its impact in disease characterization and control. One of the main constraints in aquaculture production is farmed fish vulnerability to diseases due to husbandry practices or external factors like pollution, climate changes, or even the alterations in the dynamic of product transactions in this industry. It is though important to better understand and characterize the intervenients in the process of a disease outbreak as these lead to huge economical losses in aquaculture industries. High-throughput technologies like proteomics can be an important characterization tool especially in pathogen identification and the virulence mechanisms related to host-pathogen interactions on disease research and diagnostics that will help to control, prevent, and treat diseases in farmed fish.

The increase in efficiency and the reduction of pollutant emissions from combustion devices are pivotal to achieving meaningful levels of carbon abatement as part of the ongoing climate change efforts. Computational fluid dynamics featuring adequate combustion models will play an increasingly important role in the design of more efficient and cleaner industrial burners, internal combustion engines, and combustors for stationary power generation and aircraft propulsion. Today, turbulent combustion modelling is hindered severely by the lack of data that are accurate and sufficiently complete to assess and remedy model deficiencies effectively. In particular, the formation of pollutants is a complex, nonlinear and multi-scale process characterized by the interaction of molecular and turbulent mixing with a multitude of chemical reactions with disparate time scales. The use of direct numerical simulation (DNS) featuring a state of the art description of the underlying chemistry and physical processes has contributed greatly to combustion model development in recent years. In this paper, the analysis of the intricate evolution of soot formation in turbulent flames demonstrates how DNS databases are used to illuminate relevant physico-chemical mechanisms and to identify modelling needs.","[Bisetti, Fabrizio; Attili, Antonio] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Clean Combust Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Pitsch, Heinz] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Combust Technol, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; RWTH Aachen University,"Bisetti, F (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Clean Combust Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia.",fabrizio.bisetti@kaust.edu.sa,"Bisetti, Fabrizio/AAX-4009-2021; Attili, Antonio/I-7423-2015; Pitsch, Heinz/E-1082-2014","Attili, Antonio/0000-0003-2771-8832; Pitsch, Heinz/0000-0001-5656-0961; Bisetti, Fabrizio/0000-0001-5162-7805",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) through the Competitive Research Grant 1 (CRG-1) program,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) through the Competitive Research Grant 1 (CRG-1) program,Research reported in this publication was supported by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) through the Competitive Research Grant 1 (CRG-1) program.

It has been recognized that better gravity field models and estimates of the geoid are useful for a wide range of research and application, including ocean circulation and climate change studies, physics of the Earth's interior and height datum connection and unification. The computation of these models will require the solution of large and non-sparse normal equation systems. especially if brute force approaches are applied. Evidently, there is a need for fast solvers. The multigrid approach is not only art extremely fast iterative solution technique. it yields, en passant, a well-defined sequence of coarser approximations as a byproduct to the final gravity field solution. We investigate the implementation of multigrid methods to satellite data analysis using space-domain representations of the anomalous gravity field. Multigrid algorithms are considered as stand-alone solvers as well as for the construction of preconditioners in the conjugate gradient technique. Out' numerical results, concerning two regional gravity inversions from simulated GRACE and GOCE data, show that multigrid solvers run much faster than conjugate gradient solvers with conventional preconditioners.

Through technology entrepreneurship development program (TEDP), academic communities in higher education are expected to support development of new products and enterprises by playing a leading role in generating self employed enterprising graduates. Currently, most universities promote economic development via university-company technology transfer through taught courses, joint university-company research project, and university spin-off creation. In Malaysia, TEDP is promoted through graduate training program, i.e. Master of Science Technopreneurship. However the program falls short in achieving its objective. Many of its graduates are unable to turn their IT skills and business knowledge into business opportunity. This issue has led to the following research questions: (1) what factors influence the success of TEDP? (2) What are the current practices in implementing academic entrepreneurship? and (3) Are there any differences and similarities between Malaysian current TEDP implementation with it's counterparts in the other developed countries? These research questions led to the analysis on related theories and models, and the current practice of TEDP to identify the basic knowledge and to design a basic model framework of the current practice of TEDP. Hopefully, this will provide a guideline for further detail analysis on TEDP in order to fork out an ideal framework for TEDP through a graduate training program.","[Abdullah, Sahadah Hj] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Art & Sci, Sci Technol Entrepreneurship, Changlun, Malaysia; [Osman, Mohd Hassan] Univ Technol Malaysia, Entrepreneurship Dev Unit, Fac Management & Human Resource Dev, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Rahim, Mohd.

This trend poses a significant challenge for distribution system operators (DSO) to ensure that there is uninterrupted power supply to critical loads in their networks. To embed resilience into DSO's decision-making, resilience needs to be first quantified and then integrated into the system-level optimization. Therefore, this paper first develops a novel self-organizing map (SOM) based method (called SomRes) to quantify the time-varying resilience index of a system that can leverage the powerful classification property of SOMs and removes some of the disadvantages of subjective weight assignment methods. Using SomRes, a resilient resource allocation and operational dispatch algorithm is further developed to enhance system resilience against extreme events by considering the SomRes resilience index directly as the feedback. The proposed resilience quantification approach is benchmarked with a state-of-the-art approach and the efficacy of the proposed resilient dispatch algorithm is demonstrated through several deterministic and statistical case studies on the IEEE 123-bus distribution system. Simulation studies show that the proposed SomRes quantification method is an appropriate indicator of system resilience, and the resilient resource allocation and dispatch strategy can significantly reduce critical load shedding under varying event propagation scenarios.","[Utkarsh, Kumar; Ding, Fei] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Power Syst Engn Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Ding, F (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Power Syst Engn Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",fei.ding@nrel.gov,,"Utkarsh, Kumar/0000-0002-3270-8244",National Renewable Energy Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program,National Renewable Energy Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program,"This work was supported in part by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract DE-AC36-08GO28308, and in part by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program.",,24,0,0,6,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1949-3053,1949-3061,,IEEE T SMART GRID,IEEE Trans.

The airborne multispectral LiDAR data are increasingly used for high-resolution and accurate LC classification tasks. However, most of the existing methods lack of the comprehensive extraction of the spatial geometric structure features, and ignore the fusion of multi-scale extracted features. In this paper, a point-wise deep learning-based method is proposed for LC classification based on airborne multispectral LiDAR data. We present a novel convolution operator to efficiently extract the spatial geometric structure features, called attentive graph geometric moments convolution (AGGM Convolution). Besides, to fuse the extracted multi-scale features, we propose a feature up-sampling module and construct a feature pyramid to integrate the features with different scales. The proposed method was evaluated using multispectral LiDAR data acquired with an airborne Teledyne Optech Titan system. In comparison with the previously developed state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation models, the proposed method behaves superiorly with an overall accuracy of 96.9% and a Kappa index of 0.950 on the test scenes. The quantitative assessments demonstrate that the proposed method performs effectively and efficiently in land cover classification tasks.","[Li, Dilong] Huaqiao Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Shen, Xin; Zhang, Guo; Li, Deren] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Guan, Haiyan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Remote Sensing & Geomat Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yongtao] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Fac Comp & Software Engn, Huaian 223003, JS, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hanyun] Informat Engn Univ, Sch Surveying & Mapping, Zhengzhou 45000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Li, Jonathan] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Huaqiao University; Wuhan University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Huaiyin Institute of Technology; University of Waterloo,"Guan, HY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Remote Sensing & Geomat Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",scholar.dll@hqu.edu.cn; xinshen@whu.edu.cn; guanhy.nj@nuist.edu.cn; allennessy@hyit.edu.cn; guozhang@whu.edu.cn; junli@uwaterloo.ca; drli@whu.edu.cn,,"Shen, Xin/0000-0002-9692-822X; Li, Dilong/0000-0002-5826-5568","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62076107, 41971414]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2021J05059]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University [21E01]; Scientific Research Funds of Huaqiao University [605-50Y21026]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University; Scientific Research Funds of Huaqiao University","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62076107 and 41971414, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province under Grant 2021J05059, in part by the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University under Grant 21E01, and in part by the Scientific Research Funds of Huaqiao University under Grant 605-50Y21026.

Since then, a variety of studies have focused on more specific aspects of the moisture budget and the source-sink distribution across the globe by integrating observations, satellite-derived products, physical tracers and numerical modelling. Here, we summarise the main advances in the field related to the impact of the moisture source-sink relationship on rainfall distribution, and add to the scientific debate on the question of the residence time of water vapour. We also revisit some of the recent advances in the role of the major mechanisms of moisture transport at a global scale, mainly Atmospheric Rivers and Low-Level Jet systems (Gimeno et al., 2016), in terms of their effects on precipitation extremes.

Recently these HAM models are being coupled to CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to study the moisture exchange between air and porous materials on a local scale (microclimates). The objective of this research is to develop such a model to study drying phenomena. In this paper the emphasis lies on the modelling of convective drying of porous building materials. An important aspect for the correct modelling of convective drying is the way the air boundary is implemented. A short literature review reveals that different modelling approaches can be used. This paper gives a short overview of the state of the art in conjugate heat and mass transport modelling for convective drying. In this review shortcomings of currently applied modelling approaches are highlighted Finally the newly developed model is used to simulate the convective drying of a sample of ceramic brick.

The tasks are carried out within three working groups concentrated on issues such as data access and availability, methods of spatial interpolation and developing recommendations for standardised GIS applications. The applications that have been adopted mainly focus on three parameters, i.e. precipitation, temperature and energy balance for which three demonstration projects have been formulated. It is expected that the Action will result in recommendations for better and more cost-effective production of state-of-the-art meteorological and climatological information. Also an improvement of the co-operation between European countries in the application of GIS in the field of meteorology, climatology and environmental sciences should be achieved together with better-trained personnel within the operational and scientific divisions of national meteorological services.

The region consists of a population of geologically recent, Late Amazonian-aged flood basalt volcanic plains which are incised by several large fluvial outflow channel systems. Recent understanding of the distribution of paleo-glaciation on Mars, informed by geomorphic indicators and model predictions, suggests that Central Elysium Planitia was an area of likely surface snow and ice accumulation throughout the Amazonian period. Furthermore, the volcanic plains of Central Elysium Planitia contain wide areas with preserved rootless cones, representing among the strongest evidence for past lava-ice interactions on Mars. Consequently, Central Elysium Planitia is of significant interest to understanding the recent Amazonian thermal and hydrologic history of Mars. Here we perform an exploratory assessment of the influence of surficial large-scale lava-ice interactions on the geomorphology of the Central Elysium Planitia volcanic plains and their potential contribution to the formation of the fluvial outflow channels contained within the region. The outflow channels of Central Elysium Planitia are generally interpreted to have formed as a result of catastrophic outbursts of groundwater released from pressurized, confined subsurface aquifers by magmatic dike emplacement. However, the formation of the relatively young Central Elysium Planitia outflow channels by this mechanism is subject to several demanding conditions which are not required of a lava-ice interaction origin. Therefore we revisit the origin of the Central Elysium Planitia outflow channels and explore large-scale lava-ice interactions as a possible alternative mechanism to contribute to, or account for, their formation. This assessment is performed through a case study of Athabasca Valles, a well-characterized outflow channel system which appears to emanate from the Cerberus Fossae fissure system. We find that surface ice and lava-ice interactions could have influenced the geomorphology of Central Elysium Planitia by contributing to the formation of the regions platy-ridged volcanic plains texture and rootless cones. Large-scale lava-ice interactions in Central Elysium Planitia are found to be able to readily supply the water volumes needed to form the Athabasca Valles system, but additional mechanisms are required to cause meltwater confinement and release to supply requisite discharges. Of the several potential mechanisms which could have led to meltwater confinement and release, the most likely are supra/englacial melt accumulation with outflow triggered by the flotation of a confining ice dam, and supra/englacial meltwater accumulation released by topdown supraglacial overflow. A simple analysis of these processes indicates that the rates of discharge necessary to form Athabasca Valles can be supplied while adhering to the geomorphic constraints of the system. Therefore, we conclude that the formation of the Athabasca Valles outflow channel system (and possibly other outflow channels in the region) could plausibly have been the result of surficial lava-ice interactions through meltwater confinement, accumulation, and release, providing an advantageous alternative to classical groundwater outburst models.","[Cassanelli, James P.; Head, James W.] Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Cassanelli, JP (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",James_Cassanelli@Brown.edu; James_Head@Brown.cdu,,, [JPL 1237163],,We are grateful for helpful reviews from John Smellie and an anonymous reviewer which improved the quality of this manuscript.

Absorption technologies are presently the most available and effective approach for post-combustion CO2 capture. However, state-of-the-art amine-based absorption technologies incur intensive energy use, as high as 3 times the thermodynamic minimum, thus resulting in prohibitively high costs. Solvents are key to the performance of absorption technologies. Recently, a new class of solvents, phase change solvents, have attracted growing interest due to their potential to substantially reduce energy use for CO2 capture. Phase change solvents are homogeneous (single-phase) solvents under normal conditions, but undergo a phase transition into a heterogenic (two-phase) system, triggered by changes in polarity, hydrophilicity, ionic strength, or hydrogen bond strength to form a CO2-lean liquid phase and a CO2-enriched liquid or solid phase. This review paper first examines different mechanisms that trigger phase separations in solvents. A comprehensive list of phase change solvents reported in the recent literature, including those subject to chemically or thermally triggered phase changes, non-aqueous or aqueous systems, and those forming either a CO2-enriched solid or a liquid phase are provided and their physiochemical properties for CO2 capture are discussed. Enabled by phase change solvents, different variants of CO2 absorption processes have been developed and tested in laboratory or pilot scales over the past ten years. The status of such emerging processes is summarized and their advantages and challenges for post-combustion CO2 capture are reviewed and commented. Solvent properties such as CO2 loading capacity, lean- and rich-phase partition, desorption pressure, absorption kinetics, viscosity, stability, and volatility are critical for both CO2 capture performance and scalability. Gaps between state-of-the-art and ideal solvents are analyzed, and insights into the research needs such as solvent structure property performance relations, computational solvent design, ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior, and integration of capture processes with post-combustion emission sources are provided.","[Zhang, Shihan; Shen, Yao; Chen, Jianmeng] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Environm, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lidong] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yongqi] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois State Geol Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Zhejiang University of Technology; North China Electric Power University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Lu, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois State Geol Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",yongqilu@illinois.edu,"Zhang, Shihan/Q-1585-2019; Zhang, Shihan/G-3301-2014","Zhang, Shihan/0000-0002-2377-5760",U.S. Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory [DE-FE0026434]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21606204]; Zhejiang University of Technology Startup Research Grant [2017129000729],U.S. Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang University of Technology Startup Research Grant,Yongqi Lu is grateful for the financial support from the U.S. Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory through Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FE0026434.

Cellulose is being deemed as the most valuable renewable resources and cellulosic biofuels have been regarded as the most promising candidates to substitute current fossil fuels. This review aims to depict the state-of-the-art development of solid acidic nanostructured catalysts employed in the selective conversion of cellulose into glucose, fructose, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) via hydrolysis, isomerization, dehydration and etherification. Methods: We try to describe multiple catalytic processes in the catalytic transformation of cellulose into glucose, fructose, HMF and EMF promoted by nanoscale catalysts. Emphasis is also paid to discuss plausible reaction pathways mediated by the nanostructured catalysts with different functionalities. Results: With regards to the efficiently catalytic transformations of cellulose, nano-catalysts are showing great potential in greener processing, higher yield and selectivity's and more favorable economics. 5 tables are presented in details in this review in order to describe the different performance of solid acidic nanostructured catalysts regarding the reaction pathways, including hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose, isomerization of glucose into fructose, dehydration of fructose into HMF, and etherification of HMF into EMF. Likewise, 7 schemes are also described to demonstrate the reaction mechanism of the transformation reactions and the structure-property of the catalysts. This review depicted the state-of-the-art development of solid acidic nanostructured catalysts employed in the selective conversion of cellulose chemicals and biofuels regarding the design and optimization of these materials, and green catalysis. Conclusion: The catalytic conversion of cellulose into fuels alternative and value-added chemicals via different types of reactions has attracted considerable concern in both scientific and industrial communities. Nano-catalysts are showing great potential in greener processing, higher yield and selectivity's and more favorable economics. In order to make these processes practical, environmental-friendly, and cost-competitive, the development of solid catalysis especially nanomaterials mediated catalytic systems able to operate in the aqueous phase is hence critical.","[Zhang, Heng; Pan, Hu; Yang, Song] Guizhou Univ, Ctr Res & Dev Fine Chem,State Key Lab Breeding Ba, State Local Joint Lab Comprehens Utilizat Biomass, Minist Educ,Key Lab Green Pesticide & Agr Bioengn, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Guizhou University,"Yang, S (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, Ctr Res & Dev Fine Chem,State Key Lab Breeding Ba, State Local Joint Lab Comprehens Utilizat Biomass, Minist Educ,Key Lab Green Pesticide & Agr Bioengn, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",jhzx.msm@gmail.com,"Yang, Song/H-2765-2013; Zhang, Heng/L-3335-2016","Yang, Song/0000-0003-1301-3030; Zhang, Heng/0000-0001-8436-5549","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21576059, 21666008]; Key Technologies RD Program [2014BAD23B01]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Technologies RD Program(National Key Technology R&D Program),"We wish to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21576059 & 21666008), and the Key Technologies R&D Program (No. 2014BAD23B01).",,118,15,15,3,107,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1573-4137,1875-6786,,CURR NANOSCI,Curr.

We used a threshold stream power model (SPM) combined with a stochastic distribution of discharges to explore the extent to which this observation can be explained by differences in the mean and variability of discharge between the two regions. Based on the analysis of 199 daily discharge records (record lengths 3-45years; average 18.5years), we parameterized monsoonal discharge with a weighted sum of two inverse gamma distributions. During both high- and low-flow conditions, annual and interannual discharge variabilities are similarly low in each region. Channel widths for 36 rivers indicate, on average, 25% wider streams in Eastern Tibet than in the Himalaya. Because most catchments with Be-10 data are not gauged, we constrained mean annual discharge in these catchments using gridded precipitation data sets that we calibrated to the available discharge records. Comparing Be-10-derived with modeled erosion rates, the stochastic-threshold SPM explains regional differences better than a simple SPM based on drainage area or mean annual runoff. Systematic differences at small k(sn) values can be reconciled with k(sn)-dependent erosion thresholds, whereas substantial scatter for high k(sn) values persists, likely due to methodological limitations. Sensitivity analysis of the stochastic-threshold SPM calibrated to the Himalaya indicates that changes in the duration or strength of summer monsoon precipitation have the largest effect on erosional efficiency, while changes in monsoonal discharge variability have almost no effect. The modeling approach presented in this study can in principle be used to assess the impact of precipitation changes on erosion. Plain Language Summary River incision is the main process that erodes mountain belts such as the Himalaya or Tibet. Existing models of river incision emphasize the role of water discharge and river slopes. More recent research, however, emphasizes the role of discharge variability, i.e., how variable the streamflow of an individual river is over time. Theoretically, it is possible that rivers with less but more variable discharge are more erosive than rivers with more but less variable discharge. Despite growing understanding of the mechanics of river incision it has been difficult to test existing models of river incision with field data. In our study, we combine a state-of-the-art model of river incision with a wealth of empirical data from the Himalaya and Eastern Tibet to test the importance of discharge variability and to assess whether observed differences in centennial to millennial erosion rates can be reconciled with our current understanding of the climatic and topographic controls on river incision. Results show that the importance of discharge variability in the Himalaya is much smaller than expected and plays a role only in gently-sloping rivers. While observations can be reconciled with our model to some degree, remaining discrepancies highlight shortcomings of the model as well as the data used to constrain the model.","[Scherler, Dirk] German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Potsdam, Germany; [Scherler, Dirk] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geol Sci, Berlin, Germany; [DiBiase, Roman A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fisher, G.

Polymer modification and more specifically Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) copolymer modification is one of the most common methods to enhance the physical properties of bitumen. However, the polymer modified bitumens could exhibit different rheological properties compared to original bitumen. In this work, it is aimed to investigate the effects of SBS copolymer on thermorheological properties of bitumen by means of state of art test methods. To this end, a rheological program including small amplitude oscillation shear test (SAOS), construction of master curves by using time-temperature superposition (TTS) principle, determination of zero shear viscosity (ZSV) and multiple shear creep recovery tests (MSCR) were employed along with other fundamental tests. SAOS test result signifies a positive effect of SBS on the viscoelastic deformation nature of bitumen. The master curves of the complex viscosity of binders reveal that SBS modifier reduced the Newtonian flow properties of bitumen. The decrements in non-recoverable creep compliance and the increment in percent recovery signify that SBS modifier has dramatically enhanced the applicability of bitumen as a binder in flexible pavement at mid to high temperature ranges.","[Gunay, Taylan] Ege Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Gunay, T (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Izmir, Turkey.",taylan.gunay@ege.edu.tr,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,0,"PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE, ESCUELA CONSTRUCCION CIVIL",SANTIAGO,"AV VICUNA MACKENNA 4860, SANTIAGO, 0000, CHILE",0718-915X,,,REV CONSTR,Rev.

Consequently, wind speed forecasting is an essential tool in the energy system because it supports economic, regulation, and operational efficiency issues decisions. The development of systems for accurate wind speed forecasting is a difficult task because it presents linear and nonlinear temporal patterns, and is differently influenced by climate and environmental variables. In this paper, we propose a method to search for the best combination of linear, nonlinear forecasts, and exogenous variables, aiming to increase the accuracy of wind speed forecasting. The proposed method performs: (i) the choice of the linear statistical model to forecast the time series; (ii) the error series modeling using a Long Short-Term Memory model; and (iii) the evolutionary search for the most suitable nonlinear combination of linear and nonlinear forecasts with exogenous variables. The proposed method is assessed using hourly and monthly time series of three stations located in northeast Brazil. The evaluation of the results using two traditional measures shows that the proposed method has a better performance than statistical techniques, Machine Learning models, and state-of-the-art hybrid systems in most series.

These methods require the reliable prediction of pavement performance throughout the pavement's design life. One such prediction program is FIexPAVE (TM), which applies three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element analysis with moving loads to calculate the pavement's mechanical responses under traffic loading and given climate data. The simplified viscoelastic continuum damage model and shift model are used to calculate the fatigue damage in the pavement's cross-section and the rut depths, respectively. With regard to fatigue damage, a fatigue transfer function is needed to convert the computed cross-sectional damaged area (i.e., the damage level) to the cracked area on the pavement surface. With regard to rut depth, a rutting transfer function is needed to calibrate the predicted rut depths. In this study, preliminary transfer functions for the predicted fatigue damage and rut depths were developed using four sets of field measurement data obtained from test sections in the United States, Canada, and South Korea that include interstate highways and an accelerated testing facility. Good agreement between the predicted performance and field observations was found after calibration of FIexPAVE (TM). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to assess if the introduction of renewable energy sources (RES) powered seawater desalination in mainland Portugal could allow for the flexibility needed to guarantee water security through a viable model. The Algarve region was chosen as a case study because it is particularly water stressed and subject to highly varying demographics depending on the season. Two scenarios are considered: either one large plant supplies the whole region (centralized) or two smaller ones supply their respective sub-regions (decentralized). Taking the region's potable water seasonal average demand, hourly RES production and electricity consumption profiles, a cost analysis (benchmarked by the state of the art of desalination plants) is performed in order to obtain an estimation for the produced levelised cost of water (LCOW). The resulting 0.83 75 (sic)/m(3) of desalinated water, obtained for the decentralized solution, fits within the industry standard rate although being 85.9% higher than the conventional water supply production cost. The optimization of the operational scheduling will be crucial to reduce the LCOW to a market competitive value.","[Azinheira, Gil; Segurado, Raquel; Costa, Mario] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Mech Engn Dept, IDMEC, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Segurado, R (corresponding author), Inst Super Tecn, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",raquelsegurado@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Segurado, Raquel/I-6220-2019; Costa, M√°rio/G-5329-2010","Segurado, Raquel/0000-0002-4969-4125; Costa, M√°rio/0000-0002-3118-2762","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), through IDMEC, under LAETA [UID/EMS/50022/2013]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), through IDMEC, under LAETA","This work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), through IDMEC, under LAETA, project UID/EMS/50022/2013.",,10,0,0,0,1,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3982,,978-989-97050-9-8,ICEE INT C ENERG,,,2019,,,,,31,36,,,,,,6,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BO0YA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000493896300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This project is a creative-critical meditation on the role of digital sensors in monitoring and representing environmental change. It explores the origins and functioning of the global sensory architectures used to detect and assess these changes, deconstructing the connotations of omniscience, abstraction, and control associated with the top-down', data-driven mappings they generate. In so doing, Waveform enacts a speculative instance of how digital sensors can highlight the ambiguities and tensions of life in an increasingly damaged ecology. This experimental aspect involves capturing images of coastal shorelines using an airborne camera drone, and then analysing these using software that maps the outlines of incoming waves. The resulting data is then processed by software that generates text resembling free-verse poetry. These steps are not autonomous, and are subject to human intervention at each stage, with the generated poems being curated so as to engage themes concerning coast, a changing climate, and scientific knowledge-making. The outcome is an assemblage of artefacts, processes, and representations that can suggest alternative narratives of sensing and sense-making, so as to better apprehend the complexities of the present moment.","[Carter, Richard] Univ Roehampton, Southlands Coll, Dept Media Culture & Language, London SW15 5SL, England",Roehampton University,"Carter, R (corresponding author), Univ Roehampton, Southlands Coll, Dept Media Culture & Language, London SW15 5SL, England.",richard.carter@roehampton.ac.uk,,"Carter, Richard/0000-0002-2024-2491",,,,,18,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0752,,ARTS,Arts,DEC,2018,4,,,,,,70,10.3390/arts7040070,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts7040070,,,15,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,HG5ZO,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000455061000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model is a linear, frequency-domain, efficient tool with four planar degrees of freedom: floater surge, heave, pitch and first tower modal deflection. The model relies on state-of-the-art tools from which hydrodynamic, aerodynamic and mooring loads are extracted and cascaded into QuLAF. Hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads are pre-computed in WAMIT and FAST, respectively, while the mooring system is linearized around the equilibrium position for each wind speed using MoorDyn. An approximate approach to viscous hydrodynamic damping is developed, and the aerodynamic damping is extracted from decay tests specific for each degree of freedom. Without any calibration, the model predicts the motions of the system in stochastic wind and waves with good accuracy when compared to FAST. The damage-equivalent bending moment at the tower base is estimated with errors between 0.2 % and 11.3 % for all the load cases considered. The largest errors are associated with the most severe wave climates for wave-only conditions and with turbine operation around rated wind speed for combined wind and waves. The computational speed of the model is between 1300 and 2700 times faster than real time.","[Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio; Borg, Michael; Bredmose, Henrik] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Nils Koppels Alle 403, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Pegalajar-Jurado, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Nils Koppels Alle 403, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",ampj@dtu.dk,"Bredmose, Henrik/ABF-3287-2020; Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio/ABF-4299-2020","Bredmose, Henrik/0000-0001-6961-0753; Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio/0000-0002-1374-5912",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [640741],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"This work was carried out as part of the LIFES50+ project (http://www.lifes50plus.eu; last access: 16 February 2018).

This technology involves CO2 capture from stationary sources, followed by distribution of CO2 to different intermediate utilization and/or final storage options. CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) by itself offers resource conservation benefits by displacing the need for extracted CO2 from natural sources. On the other hand, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) provides CO2 emissions reduction by sequestration of captured CO2 for long-term storage. Combining CCS and CCU can potentially result in valuable symbiosis, but remains debatable due to gaps between the roles of these technologies in energy engineering. Such gaps have resulted in slower commercial deployment of CO2 -capture. Some important issues resulting from these technologies have been addressed in previous studies through process systems engineering (PSE) methodologies, which are able to provide rigorous decision support during CCUS planning. This review paper provides an in-depth discussion of the state-of-the-art of these tools, and also discusses recent developments on integrating CCUS components in large-scale planning. While recent literature in this area reveals the availability of tools for planning and policy-making, further research opportunities are identified through the bibliometric trends that show how CCUS research can develop further.","[Tapia, John Frederick D.; Tan, Raymond R.] De La Salle Univ, Chem Engn Dept, 2401 Taft Ave, Manila 0922, Philippines; [Lee, Jui-Yuan] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan; [Ooi, Raymond E.

In order to meet consumer demands for electric and hybrid-electric vehicle performance, especially in adverse climates, a battery thermal management system (BTMS) is often required. This work presents a novel experimental method for analyzing BTMS using three sample cooling plate concepts. For each concept, the input parameters (ambient temperature, coolant temperature and coolant flow rate) are varied and the resulting effect on the average temperature and temperature distribution across and between cells is compared. Additionally, the pressure loss along the coolant path is utilized as an indicator of energy efficiency. Using the presented methodology, various cooling plate layouts optimized for production alternative techniques are compared to the state of the art. It is shown that these production-optimized cooling plates provide sufficient thermal performance with the additional benefit of mechanical integration within the battery and/or vehicle system. It is also shown that the coolant flow influences battery cell thermal behavior more than the solid material and that pressure drop is more sensitive to geometrical changes in the cooling plate than temperature changes at the module.

The case study is the simplified model for calculation of energy performance of building envelopes, introduced by the Brazilian regulation for energy efficiency in commercial buildings. The first step of the assessment consisted on evaluating the simplified model results using the BESTEST. This paper presents a straightforward approach to apply the BESTEST in other climates than the original one (Denver, USA). The second step of the assessment consisted on applying the simplified model to evaluate four building typologies, and compare the results with those obtained using a state of the art building energy simulation (BES) program. For some BESTEST cases, the simplified model presented results inside of a confidence interval calculated by the authors. However, the simplified model was found to yield significant difference in the four building typologies analysed. Moreover, in all four building typologies analysed, the simplified model led to a lower energy efficiency label when compared to the label obtained using BES. The paper concludes that the simplified model may require improvements to properly indicate the actual energy performance of commercial building envelopes. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Temporal trends in time series of the stable isotope composition in precipitation were rarely observed, and they are poorly understood. These might be a result of a lack of proper trend detection tools and effort for exploring trend processes. Here, we investigate temporal trends of O-18 in precipitation at 17 observation stations in Germany between 1978 and 2009. We test if significant trends in the isotope time series from different models can be observed. Mann-Kendall trend tests are applied on the isotope series, using general multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrate moving average (ARIMA) models, which account for first and higher order serial correlations. Effects of temperature, precipitation, and geographic parameters on isotope trends are also investigated in the proposed models. To benchmark our proposed approach, the ARIMA results are compared with a trend-free pre-whitening procedure, the state of the art method for removing the first order autocorrelation in environmental trend studies. Moreover, we further explore whether higher order serial correlations in isotope series affects our trend results. Overall, three out of the 17 stations show significant changes when higher order autocorrelation are adjusted, and four show a significant trend when temperature and precipitation effects are considered. The significant trends in the isotope time series generally occur only at low elevation stations. Higher order autoregressive processes are shown to be important in the isotope time series analysis. Results suggest that the widely used trend analysis with only the first order autocorrelation adjustment may not adequately take account of the high order autocorrelated processes in the stable isotope series. The investigated time series analysis method including higher autocorrelation and external climate variable adjustments is shown to be a better alternative.

Biochar (BC) has gathered a great interest in the last years across different research fields, thanks to its special physicochemical characteristics such as high specific surface area, high porosity, ion exchange capacity and because of scientific evidence in removing various contaminants from soil, water, and air. This review aims to give the state of the art on the removal of toxic organic pollutants from wastewater using biochar, activated biochar, functionalized biochar and metal oxide or clay base biochar composites, commenting on the substrates' physiochemical properties, the role of the most used characterization techniques toxicity, activation/functionalization and influencing treatment factors in organic pollutant removal from wastewater. The effect of different operating parameters of the water treatment process is summarized and thoroughly discussed. The toxicity of biochar components such as heavy metals, dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is addressed. The various application processes of biochar in water treatment at both laboratory and pilot scale is also reviewed. The activation techniques, functionalization pathways and biochar basednanocomposite synthesis methods for enhancing the pollutant elimination efficiency are also extensively discussed. Finally, the paper suggests research directions in the field of biochar application in wastewater treatment.","[Zeghioud, Hicham; Fryda, Lydia; Djelal, Hayet; Kane, Abdoulaye] UniLaSalle Ecole Metiers Environm, Cyclann, Campus Ker Lann, F-35170 Bruz, France; [Assadi, Aymen] Univ Rennes, Ecole Natl Super Chim Rennes, CNRS, ISCR UMR 6226, F-35000 Rennes, France",UniLaSalle; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie de Rennes (ENSCR); Universite de Rennes,"Zeghioud, H (corresponding author), UniLaSalle Ecole Metiers Environm, Cyclann, Campus Ker Lann, F-35170 Bruz, France.",hicham.zeghioud@unilasalle.fr,"ZEGHIOUD, Hicham/AAV-1660-2020","ZEGHIOUD, Hicham/0000-0002-3113-041X",INTERREG North-West Europe ThreeC [NWE 1010],INTERREG North-West Europe ThreeC,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the INTERREG North-West Europe ThreeC with the project number NWE 1010, under the umbrella of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) .?",,260,8,8,36,42,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7144,,,J WATER PROCESS ENG,J.

The use of a cost-optimized thermoelectric generator based on total cost of ownership is proposed for this vehicle class with natural gas engines. A holistic model environment is presented that includes all vehicle interactions. Simultaneous optimization of the heat exchanger and thermoelectric modules is required to enable high system efficiency. A generator design combining high electrical power (peak power of about 3000 W) with low negative effects was selected as a result. Numerical CFD and segmented high-temperature thermoelectric modules are used. For the first time, the possibility of an economical use of the system in the amortization period of significantly less than 2 years is available, with a fuel reduction in a conventional vehicle topology of already up to 2.8%. A significant improvement in technology maturity was achieved, and the power density of the system was significantly improved to 298 W/kg and 568 W/dm(3) compared to the state of the art. A functional model successfully validated the simulation results with an average deviation of less than 6%.

This review discusses the most recent advances on the electrochemical transformation of CO2 to alcohols, mainly methanol, ethanol and n-propanol, as a promising way to produce renewable liquid fuels. The main focus is given to copper-based electrocatalyst with different structures (Cu nanoparticles, oxide-derived Cu, and Cu composites) because Cu is up to now the heterogeneous catalyst with the most relevant activity for producing valuable C1+ hydrocarbons and alcohols via CO2 co-electrolysis. Several factors that impact the reaction activity and selectivities, such as the catalyst morphology, composition, surface structure, electrolyte effects and the electrocatalytic cell design (including liquid-phase and catholyte-free systems) are considered and analysed. This review reports an overview of the state-of-the-art with the most recent investigation highlights. It aims to provide guidance on the best experimental practices, new research directions, and strategies to develop efficient electrocatalysts. An outlook about the main challenges to be still resolved for a future practical application of this technology is also provided, toward a future based on sustainability and independence from fossil fuels.","[Guzman, Hilmar; Russo, Nunzio; Hernandez, Simelys] Politecn Torino, CREST Grp, Dept Appl Sci & Technol DISAT, C So Duca degli Abruzzi 24, Turin, Italy; [Guzman, Hilmar; Hernandez, Simelys] Ist Italiano Tecnol Polito, Ctr Sustainable Future Technol, Via Livorno 60, I-10144 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT,"Hernandez, S (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, CREST Grp, Dept Appl Sci & Technol DISAT, C So Duca degli Abruzzi 24, Turin, Italy.;Hernandez, S (corresponding author), Ist Italiano Tecnol Polito, Ctr Sustainable Future Technol, Via Livorno 60, I-10144 Turin, Italy.",simelys.hernandez@polito.it,"Hernandez, Simelys/I-7042-2016","Hernandez, Simelys/0000-0002-6722-0273; Guzman, Hilmar/0000-0002-0536-2233","Eni SpA; R&D Program Energy Transition (Cattura e Utilizzo CO2), the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action program under the Project SunCoChem [862192]; ERC@Polito CO2 Synthesis project - Politecnico di Torino","Eni SpA; R&D Program Energy Transition (Cattura e Utilizzo CO2), the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action program under the Project SunCoChem; ERC@Polito CO2 Synthesis project - Politecnico di Torino","This work has been performed with the financial support of Eni SpA and the R&D Program Energy Transition (Cattura e Utilizzo CO<INF>2</INF>), the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action program under the Project SunCoChem (Grant Agreement No 862192) and the ERC@Polito CO<INF>2</INF> Synthesis project granted by Politecnico di Torino.",,163,18,18,9,47,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,7-Mar,2021,5,,,,1896,1920,,10.1039/d0gc03334k,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc03334k,,,25,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,QW8QR,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000628913600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation is considered to be a major process in reservoir degradation and one of the main processes responsible for the formation of heavy oil deposits and oil sands. In the absence of external electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate, sulfate or Fe(III), fermentation and methanogenesis become the dominant microbial metabolisms. The major end product under these conditions is methane, and the only electron acceptor necessary to sustain the intermediate steps in this process is CO2, which is itself a net product of the overall reaction. We are summarizing the state of the art and recent advances in methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation research. Both the key microbial groups involved as well as metabolic pathways are described, and we discuss the novel insights into methanogenic hydrocarbon-degrading populations studied in laboratory as well as environmental systems enabled by novel cultivation-based and molecular approaches. Their possible implications on energy resources, bioremediation of contaminated sites, deep-biosphere research, and consequences for atmospheric composition and ultimately climate change are also addressed.

The state-of-the art building energy simulation tools requires a high level of multi disciplinary domain expertise from the user and many technical data inputs that curb the usability of such programs. In this paper an IT tool is presented, which has the capability of predicting a building's energy utilization configuration based on the reported annual energy and a few non-technical inputs from the user; and correspondingly generates cost effective energy conservation measures for the intended savings. The approach first identifies the system variables that are critical to a building's energy consumption and searches for the combination of these parameters that would give rise to the annual energy consumption as reported by the facility. Genetic algorithms are utilized to generate this database. A statistical fit is formulated between the system variables and the annual energy consumption from the database. Using this correlation, system configuration for the target energy efficiency is determined with corresponding energy conservation measures. A cost analysis is carried out to prescribe the most cost effective energy conservation measures. Competency of the tool is demonstrated in the paper through case studies on three geographies with different climate conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, a challenge is that the indexes assume the relational data model but the scientific data generally follows the array data model. To match the two data models, we design a generic mapping mechanism and implement an efficient input and output interface for reading and writing the data and their corresponding indexes. To take advantage of the emerging many-core architectures, we also develop a parallel strategy for indexing using threading technology. This approach complements our on-going MPI-based parallelization efforts. We demonstrate the flexibility of our software by applying it to two of the most commonly used scientific data formats, HDF5 and NetCDF. We present two case studies using data from a particle accelerator model and a global climate model. We also conducted a detailed performance study using these scientific datasets.

It is not by chance that the text-world metaphor informs classical aesthetics that, more than anything else, emphasizes emotional involvement. On the contrary, as in much of modern art, self-reflexivity and metafictional attention to the rhetoric of the real, to the framework, to the conventions and to the processes of meaning production, all involve a disenchanted, detached and sceptic vision - in short, an aesthetics of the text as game. By analogy, any analytic style or model that aims to produce a transformative experience must satisfactorily resolve the conflict between immersion (the analyst's emotional participation and sticking to the dreamlike or fictional climate of the session, dreaming knowing it's a dream) and interactivity (for the most part, interpretation as an anti-immersive device that 'wakes' one from fiction and demystifies consciousness). In analytic field theory the setting can be defined - because of the weight given to performativity of language, to the sensory matrix of the transference and the transparency of the medium - the place where an ideal balance is sought between immersion and interaction.",,,"Civitarese, G (corresponding author), Piazza A Botta 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",gcivitarese@venus.it,,,,,,,46,16,16,3,8,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7578,,,INT J PSYCHOANAL,Int.

Real-time continuous soil monitoring (RTCSM) possesses a great potential to revolutionize field measurements by providing first-hand information for continuously tracking variations of heterogeneous soil parameters and diverse pollutants in a timely manner and thus enable constant updates essential for system control and decision-making. Through a systematic literature search and comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art RTCSM technologies, extensive discussion of their vital hurdles, and sharing of our future perspectives, this critical review bridges the knowledge gap of spatiotemporal uninterrupted soil monitoring and soil management execution. First, the barriers for reliable RTCSM data acquisition are elucidated by examining typical soil monitoring techniques (e.g., electrochemical and spectroscopic sensors). Next, the prevailing challenges of the RTCSM sensor network, data transmission, data processing, and personalized data management are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, this review explores RTCSM data application for updating diverse strategies including high-fidelity soil process models, control methodologies, digital soil mapping, soil degradation, food security, and climate change mitigation. Finally, the significance of RTCSM implementation in agricultural and environmental fields is underscored through illuminating future directions and perspectives in this systematic review.","[Fan, Yingzheng; Wang, Xingyu; Funk, Thomas; Rashid, Ishrat; Herman, Brianna; Bompoti, Nefeli; Chrysochoou, Maria; Yang, Meijian; Vadas, Timothy M.; Lei, Yu; Li, Baikun] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Mahmud, Shaad] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Lei, Yu] Univ Connecticut, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Li, Baikun] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Li, BK (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Li, BK (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",baikun.li@uconn.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) Environmental Engineering Program GOALI Project [1706343]; NSF Signal in the soil (SitS) Projects [1935599, 1935578]; NSF Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) project [ECCS- 2018492]; U.S. - Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund [2000009132]; Connecticut SPARK Program; School of Engineering GE Fellowship at University of Connecticut",National Science Foundation (NSF) Environmental Engineering Program GOALI Project(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Signal in the soil (SitS) Projects; NSF Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) project; U.S. - Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)US-Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund); Connecticut SPARK Program; School of Engineering GE Fellowship at University of Connecticut(General Electric),"This study was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Environmental Engineering Program GOALI Project (Grant No. 1706343) , NSF Signal in the soil (SitS) Projects (Grant Nos. 1935599 and 1935578) , NSF Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) project (Grant No. ECCS- 2018492) , U.S. - Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund (Grant No. 2000009132) , and Connecticut SPARK Program.

The data were analyzed using descriptive and statistical methods to infer relationships between the Internet of Things (IoT), emerging technologies, precision agriculture, agriculture 4.0, and improvements in commercial farming. The discussion is situated in the broader context of IoT in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change and global warming in agriculture through the optimization of critical parameters such as temperature and humidity, intelligent data acquisition, rule-based control, and resolving the barriers to the commercial adoption of IoT systems in agriculture. The recent unexpected and severe weather events have contributed to low agricultural yields and losses; this is a challenge that can be resolved through technology-mediated precision agriculture. Advances in technology have over time contributed to the development of sensors for frost prevention, remote crop monitoring, fire hazard prevention, precise control of nutrients in soilless greenhouse cultivation, power autonomy through the use of solar energy, and intelligent feeding, shading, and lighting control to improve yields and reduce operational costs. However, particular challenges abound, including the limited uptake of smart technologies in commercial agriculture, price, and accuracy of the sensors.

Mass transfer intensification is a powerful approach to enhance the energy efficiency and reaction rate in the energy conversion and storage processes. The nature-inspired channels are outstanding tools to uniformly distribute the reactants, fast remove products, and reduce the diffusion distance for mass transfer intensification in monolithic adsorbents, structured catalysts, and electrodes. Besides, hierarchical pores are also a contributor to improve the reactant diffusion rate in the matrix. Additive manufacturing, combining the design of printing material and post-treatment, provides a promising opportunity to accurately control the channels and adjust the pores in electrodes, catalysts, and adsorbents. This review summarizes the main state-of-the-art methods to design ideal channels and to control the sizes and amounts of pores for the optimum hierarchical structure design, as well as the techniques to realize the hierarchical structure by additive manufacturing. In addition, this review also communicates the recently unlocked advantages of the designable channels and hierarchical pores in applications of adsorptions, chemical reactions, and electrochemical energy storage. Lastly, a new approach to design and fabricate the hierarchical structures is proposed, along with its potential benefits.","[Wang, Panfeng; Zhang, Ronghao; Wang, Qiang; Wang, Haoyang; Liu, Houli; Zhang, Li] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech & Power Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Jin] Loughborough Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Zhang, Hao] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland",East China University of Science & Technology; Loughborough University; University of Edinburgh,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech & Power Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Xuan, J (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.;Zhang, H (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland.",j.xuan@lboro.ac.uk; Hao.Zhang-l@ed.ac.uk; lzhang@ecust.edu.cn,"Zhang, HAO/ABD-2997-2021","Wang, Qiang/0000-0001-8840-1535; Zhang, Hao/0000-0002-6227-9815",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51776074],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51776074).,,259,1,1,34,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",2365-709X,,,ADV MATER TECHNOL-US,Adv.

This first part focuses on the steam injecting and recovering aero engine (SIRA) concept. Exhaust heat generated steam is injected into the combustion chamber. By use of a condenser, installed behind the steam generator, the water is recovered from the exhaust gas-steam mixture. Both lead to a noticeable increase in specific power compared to a conventional gas turbine and, foremost, to a significant increase in thermodynamic efficiency. The proposed concept is expected to reduce fuel burn and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by about 15% and nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation can be almost completely avoided compared to state-of-the-art engines of the same technology level. Moreover, the described concept has the potential to drastically reduce or even avoid the formation of condensation trails. Thus, the SIRA concept operated with sustainable aviation fuels offers the potential for climate-neutral aviation. Based on consistent thermodynamic descriptions, preliminary designs and initial performance studies, the potentials of the concepts are analyzed. Complementarily, a detailed discussion on concrete engineering solutions considers the implementation into aircraft. Finally, the impact on emissions is outlined.","[Schmitz, Oliver] MTU Aero Engines AG, Adv Prop Concepts, Technol Program, Dachauer Str 665, D-80995 Munich, Germany; [Schmitz, Oliver] MTU Aero Engines AG, Adv Prop Concepts, Engn Adv Program, Dachauer Str 665, D-80995 Munich, Germany; [Klingels, Hermann; Kufner, Petra] MTU Aero Engines AG, Dachauer Str 665, D-80995 Munich, Germany",MTU Aero Engines; MTU Aero Engines; MTU Aero Engines,"Schmitz, O (corresponding author), MTU Aero Engines AG, Adv Prop Concepts, Technol Program, Dachauer Str 665, D-80995 Munich, Germany.;Schmitz, O (corresponding author), MTU Aero Engines AG, Adv Prop Concepts, Engn Adv Program, Dachauer Str 665, D-80995 Munich, Germany.",oliver.schmitz@mtu.de; hermann.klingels@mtu.de; petra.kufner@mtu.de,,,"German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy [20T1720]; Federal Aviation Research Program V, grant project VerVal","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Federal Aviation Research Program V, grant project VerVal","Research work associated with this publication has been supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under Grant No. 20T1720.

There, he worked briefly for Oscar Niemeyer and visited numerous examples of Brazilian modernism. Settling in Sydney, Seidler became one of Australia's foremost modernist architects. His output quickly shifted from deference to the work of his mentors Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer to formal experiments determined by the peculiarities of Australia's geography and climate. He increasingly adapted elements that reflected his South American experiences. As his practice gained larger commissions, Seidler's engagement with the Australian city was similarly affected. His urbanism - as it developed - ran counter to the Australian city's Anglo-American trajectory that had shaped its form and character since the 1850s. This paper places Seidler's interests in Brazil within the Australian context, where Iberico-American modernism was known and understood but appeared in isolated examples with little or no urban reference. Seidler, instead, proposed a new vision for the Australian city, one that extended Giedion, Sert and Leger's wartime call for a new monumentality and combined architecture, art and landscape in a unified response: it was his answer to an urbanism for the New World.","[Goad, Philip] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Goad, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",p.goad@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,60,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1033-1867,2164-4756,,FABRICATIONS,Fabrications,,2021,1,,,,54,84,,10.1080/10331867.2021.1925490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10331867.2021.1925490,,,31,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,TW9XC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000682742200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent findings A systematic review and metaanalysis on the epidemiology of food allergy in Europe have been performed by the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines Group of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology. The authors had made an extensive search of four different electronic databases which retrieved thousands of hits. A critical appraisal of the documents reduced their number to just over 100 articles covering the period 2000-2012, revealing striking methodological inhomogeneity and blank areas on the map of the continent, particularly for the adult population. A major new development intending to fill in the gaps in the field of food allergy is the launch and implementation of the European Union-funded project 'Prevalence, Cost and Basis of Food Allergy Across Europe,' acronym 'EuroPrevall.' Among the deliverable of the project are several seminal articles on food allergy in adults which are presented in this review. The EuroPrevall project confirmed much more reliably and in more detail the existing inhomogeneity in the prevalence of food allergy, which reflects environmental and climate differences between the separate countries, but possibly also the level of public awareness.","[Popov, Todor A.] Univ Hosp Sv Ivan Rilski, 13 Urvich St, Sofia 1612, Bulgaria; [Mustakov, Tihomir B.; Kralimarkova, Tanya Z.] Univ Hosp Alexandrovska, Sofia, Bulgaria",Medical University Sofia; Medical University Sofia,"Popov, TA (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Sv Ivan Rilski, 13 Urvich St, Sofia 1612, Bulgaria.",ted.popov@gmail.com,"Popov, Todor/Q-9928-2016","Popov, Todor/0000-0001-5052-5866",,,,,20,2,2,3,14,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1528-4050,1473-6322,,CURR OPIN ALLERGY CL,Curr.

This approach may be threatened in current severe times, characterized by rampant individualism and mutual distrust. In crime and justice issues, exclusion and punishment are pushing away approaches based on inclusion and persuasion. In such a socio-cultural climate, restorative justice is threatened indeed to being co-opted as an extension to the predominant punitive and controlling tendency. However, countervailing forces persist in social life, social practice, and in the arts. A social-scientific tendency is also aware of its social responsibility and seeks to serve the quality of social life based on more mutual respect, solidarity, and taking active responsibility. Restorative justice can be a part of these countervailing forces, if it safeguards its roots in this socio-ethical groundstream. It may be a spearhead of what we can call a criminology of trusA a criminology that understands that all policy regarding crime and justice issues must be grounded in respect, inclusion, and persuasion. Particularly, restorative justice's contribution to this is twofold. First, it offers a realistic and more positive alternative to detrimental punitiveness. Second, it contributes to de-dramatizing and demystifying the image of crime and criminals to more realistic dimensions (which are in themselves serious enough).","[Walgrave, Lode] Univ Leuven, Criminol, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Walgrave, L (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Criminol, Leuven, Belgium.",Lode.walgrave@law.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,87,2,2,1,2,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",1933-4192,1933-4206,,NEW CRIM LAW REV,New Crim.

Nucleation of ice at elevated temperatures requires an ice nucleating particle (INP), which results in so-called heterogeneous freezing. Previously reported measurements for the ability of a particle to nucleate ice have been made in the absence of other aerosol which will act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. Here we show that CCN can outcompete INPs for available water vapour thus suppressing ice formation, which has the potential to significantly affect the Earth's radiation budget. The magnitude of this suppression is shown to be dependent on the mass of condensed water required for freezing. Here we show that ice formation in a state-of-the-art cloud parcel model is strongly dependent on the criteria for heterogeneous freezing selected from those previously hypothesised. We have developed an alternative criteria which agrees well with observations from cloud chamber experiments. This study demonstrates the dominant role that competition for water vapour can play in ice formation, highlighting both a need for clarity in the requirements for heterogeneous freezing and for measurements under atmospherically appropriate conditions.","[Simpson, Emma L.; Connolly, Paul J.; McFiggans, Gordon] Univ Manchester, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"McFiggans, G (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",g.mcfiggans@manchester.ac.uk,"Connolly, Paul/ABD-1752-2020; McFiggans, Gordon B/B-8689-2011","Connolly, Paul/0000-0002-3294-7405; McFiggans, Gordon B/0000-0002-3423-7896","NERC studentship [NE/L501591/1]; CCN-Vol [NE/L007827/1]; European Union's 7th Framework Programme BACCHUS [603445]; European Union's Framework 7 EUROCHAMP2 Network of Infrastructures; Horizon research and innovation programme through the EUROCHAMP Infrastructure Activity [730997]; NERC [NE/K006002/1, NE/L007827/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [1365901] Funding Source: researchfish",NERC studentship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); CCN-Vol; European Union's 7th Framework Programme BACCHUS; European Union's Framework 7 EUROCHAMP2 Network of Infrastructures; Horizon research and innovation programme through the EUROCHAMP Infrastructure Activity; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was funded by a NERC studentship, grant number NE/L501591/1.

Given Berlin's and Berliners' long historical relationship with all things sartorial, it is unsurprising that fashion, which offered the opportunity to shed former identities and the trauma of defeat, figured prominently in their dual reconstructions. While scholarship has emphasized the roles that music and art played in the occupiers' strategies as they competed for the hearts and minds of the occupied, an examination of their policies shows that they viewed fashion-its economic potency, employment potential, and transformative cultural power-as a site that warranted attention. The reemergence of fashion-related industries and media from the rubble offered a hopeful future in the midst of utter collapse.

Therefore, our top priority should be to avoid human and material losses. The security area is not only defined by disaster management, but by a wide variety of events that could affect the environment and the population's health. Following the rapid development of urban areas, a present tendency is represented by the study of those factors that place some areas in categories with high risk for natural and anthropic hazard such as landslides. This paper highlights the advantages of using state-of-the-art geodetic technology and specialized software in the study of landslides with a view of generating 3D models of the affected area. The 3D modeling process based on triangulation is a very elaborate one and the authors make comparisons between 2 surface models of a landslide using specialized software.

Attempts to incorporate Trichodesmium in ocean biogeochemical circulation models have, so far, relied on the observed correlation between temperature and Trichodesmium abundance. This correlation may result in part from a direct effect of temperature on Trichodesmium growth rates through the control of cellular biochemical processes, or indirectly through temperature influence on mixed layer depth, light and nutrient regimes. Here we present results indicating that the observed correlation of Trichodesmium with temperature in the field reflects primarily the direct physiological effects of temperature on diazotrophic growth of Trichodesmium. Trichodesmium IMS-101 ( an isolate of T. erythraeum) could acclimate and grow at temperatures ranging from 20 to 34 degrees C. Maximum growth rates (mu(max) = 0.25 day(-1)) and maximum nitrogen fixation rates (0.13 mmol N mol POC-1 h(-1)) were measured within 24 to 30 degrees C. Combining this empirical relationship with global warming scenarios derived from state-of-the-art climate models sets a physiological constraint on the future distribution of Trichodesmium that could significantly affect the future nitrogen input into oligotrophic waters by this diazotroph.","Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 4ZH, Hants, England; Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, IFM, GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",NERC National Oceanography Centre; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel,"Breitbarth, E (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Chem Analyt & Marine Chem, Kemivagen 10, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",eike@chem.gu.se,"LaRoche, Julie/A-1109-2010; Oschlies, Andreas/F-9749-2012","Oschlies, Andreas/0000-0002-8295-4013; LaRoche, Julie/0000-0003-4809-6411",,,,,46,189,195,4,53,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2007,1,,,,53,61,,10.5194/bg-4-53-2007,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-4-53-2007,,,9,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,148LD,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000245075200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additional anthropogenic aerosols released into the atmosphere thus exert a direct radiative forcing on the climate system(1). The degree of present-day aerosol forcing is estimated from global models that incorporate a representation of the aerosol cycles(1-3). Although the models are compared and validated against observations, these estimates remain uncertain. Previous satellite measurements of the direct effect of aerosols contained limited information about aerosol type, and were confined to oceans only(4,5). Here we use state-of-the-art satellite-based measurements of aerosols(6-8) and surface wind speed(9) to estimate the clear-sky direct radiative forcing for 2002, incorporating measurements over land and ocean. We use a Monte Carlo approach to account for uncertainties in aerosol measurements and in the algorithm used. Probability density functions obtained for the direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere give a clear-sky, global, annual average of -1.9 W m(-2) with standard deviation, +/-0.3 W m(-2). These results suggest that present-day direct radiative forcing is stronger than present model estimates, implying future atmospheric warming greater than is presently predicted, as aerosol emissions continue to decline(10).","Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Met Office - UK; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Bellouin, N (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",nicolas.bellouin@metoffice.gov.uk,"Boucher, Olivier/K-7483-2012; Boucher, Olivier/J-5810-2012; Haywood, Jim/GQA-6691-2022","Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Haywood, Jim/0000-0002-2143-6634; Bellouin, Nicolas/0000-0003-2109-9559",,,,,23,355,374,12,140,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Dec,2005,7071,,,,1138,1141,,10.1038/nature04348,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature04348,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,995OF,16372005,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000234111500046,View Full Record in Web of Science

The GRACE mission consists of two identical satellites flying on an almost polar orbit with an altitude of about 300-500 km and satelite-to-satellite ranging of about 220 km. Thanks to the payloads of space-borne GPS receivers, accelerometers and high-precision K-band satelite-to-satellite ranging mesurements, GRACE gravity models are expected to achieve more than one order of magnitude of improvement over previous models at spatial scales of a few hundred kilometers or larger. Recovery of surface mass re-distribution based on GRACE's time-varying gravity models is applied to studies in solid Earth geophysics, oceanography, climatology and geodesy. At secular time scales, GRACE is expected to provide valuable information on global ice changes, whose variations have profound influences on global climate, and in particular, on sea level changes. At seasonal time scales, GRACE is expected to reveal surface water changes with an accuracy of less than 1 cm, or ocean bottom pressure changes with an accuracy of less than 1 mbar (1 mbar =10(2) Pa). These surface mass redistribution measurements would impove our understanding of the global and regional mass and energy cycles that are critical to human life. Using 15 GRACE monthly gravity models covering the period from April 2002 to December 2003, this study compares seasonal water storage changes recovered from GRACE data and hydrology models at global and regional scales, with particular focus on the Yangtze River basin of China. Annual amplitude of 3.4 cm of equivalent water height change is found for the Yangtze River basin with maximum in Spring and Autumn, agreeing with two state-of-the-art hydrology models. The differences between GRACE results and model predictions are less than 1-2 cm. We conclude that satellite gravimetry has huge potentials in monitering water storage changes in large river basins such as Yangtze.","Natl Astron Observ, Shanghai Astron Observ, Ctr Astrogeodynam Res, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; Univ Texas, Ctr Space Res, Austin, TX 78750 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Astronomical Observatory, CAS; Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, CAS; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Hu, XG (corresponding author), Natl Astron Observ, Shanghai Astron Observ, Ctr Astrogeodynam Res, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",hxg@shao.ac.cn,,"Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441",,,,,12,42,50,3,31,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1006-9313,,,SCI CHINA SER D,Sci.

An environmental friendly or low-carbon-oriented industrial transition not only would largely improve the patterns and magnitude of physical exchanges among societies and their natural environment, but would also be inextricably linked with regional sustainable development policies which can be effective to achieve post-fossil carbon societies. Above all, several institutional innovations and rules, such as industrial symbiosis and low carbon pathway optimization should be considered in scenario analysis and path selection. In this study, a long term analysis focusing on the industrial system in China is presented. Carbon emission decomposition analysis is used to evaluate the potential of low carbon development, promote policies regarding regional sustainable development and construction of eco-industry. Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition is applied to carbon emissions in the decomposition of time and space sequence. An analysis of the state of the art of climate change science and of the state of industrial symbiosis attempting to create effective industrial development paths reveals that the LMDI Decomposition method can provide crucial orientation for the negotiations towards a sustainable post fossil carbon societies. Three scenarios are designed for the analysis: the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario, the Carbon Reduction (CR) scenario and the Integrated Low Carbon Economy (ILCE) scenario. Under the assumptions that the share of coal will decline dramatically under the CR and ILCE scenarios from 2009 to 2050 while the share of natural gas and renewable energy will be greatly increased, through the adjustment of energy structure, improvement of energy efficiency and transformation of technical energy merit, energy consumption demand and carbon emission trend in industrial sectors till 2050 in China is simulated, in order to provide the basis for low-carbon industrial transformation in China.

Most of the region, typically monitored with optical sensors, is hidden by a persistent cloud cover for most of the wet season. The necessity for a consistent and reliable deforestation warning system based on cloud-independent radar data is therefore of particular interest. In this paper, we investigated the potential of combining deep learning with Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) short time series (STS), covering only 24 d of acquisitions, to map endangered areas in the Amazon Basin. To this end, we implemented a U-Net-like convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-layer semantic segmentation, trained from scratch with different sets of input features to evaluate the viability of the proposed approach for different operating conditions. As input features, we relied on both multi-temporal backscatter and interferometric coherences at different temporal baselines. We provide a detailed performance benchmark of the different configurations, also considering the current state-of-the-art approaches based on S-1 STS and shallow learners. Our findings showed that, by exploiting the powerful learning capabilities of CNNs, we outperformed the STS-based approaches published in the literature and significantly reduced the computational load. Indeed, when considering the entire stack of Sentinel-1 data at a 6 d revisit time, we were able to maintain the overall accuracy and F-1-score well above 90% and reduce the computational time by more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, by avoiding the generation of handcrafted feature maps. Moreover, we achieved satisfactory results even when only S-1 InSAR acquisitions with a revisit time of 12 d or more were used, setting the groundwork for an effective and fast monitoring of tropical forests at a global scale.","[Dal Molin, Ricardo, Jr.; Rizzoli, Paola] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Microwaves & Radar Inst, D-82234 Wessling, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Dal Molin, R (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Microwaves & Radar Inst, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.",ricardo.dinizdalmolinjunior@dlr.de; paola.rizzoli@dlr.de,,"Rizzoli, Paola/0000-0001-9118-2732; Diniz Dal Molin Junior, Ricardo Simao/0000-0003-4103-7910",,,,,34,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAR,2022,6,,,,,,1381,10.3390/rs14061381,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14061381,,,21,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,0B3NL,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000774545600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The south-west Indian monsoon strongly influences the study area, and heavy rainfall or cyclones which originate from either the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea, also affect the region. Optically stimulated luminescence dating places the 8 m thick sediment sequence in the climate transition phase which ranges from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. Multi-proxy analyses including high-resolution granulometry, magnetic susceptibility, ferromagnetic mineral concentration, facies major oxide geochemistry, and micro-fossil records (from two sedimentary units) are used to study these late Holocene flood events. The latter are characterised by multiple sediment facies, depositional events, changes in channel morphology, and distinctive flood signatures. Integration of these records enables to identify two distinct aggradations viz. phase I and phase II, as well as a relative change in channel morphology. The study describes 11 flooding events and their imprints over multi-proxy records. Historic documents and instrumental records from the town of Bharuch referring to floods, movement of channel sand, channel shallowing, and the dysfunction of the ancient port of Bharuch further validate the inferences drawn from the sedimentary sequence.

Omics have become a vital tool in the field of mycotoxins, especially contributing to the identification of biomarkers with potential use for the detection of mycotoxigenic species and the gathering of information about the biosynthetic pathways of mycotoxins in different environments. This approach has provided tools for the development of prevention strategies and control measures for different mycotoxins. Additionally, research has revealed important information about the impact of global warming and climate change on the prevalence of mycotoxin issues in society. In the context of foodomics, the aim is to apply omics techniques in order to ensure food safety. The objective of the present review is to determine the state of the art regarding the development of analytical techniques based on omics in the identification of biosynthetic pathways related to mycotoxin synthesis.","[Gonzalez-Lopez, Nicolas Mateo; Huertas-Ortiz, Kevin Andrey; Garcia-Castaneda, Javier Eduardo; Rivera-Monroy, Zuly Jenny] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Carrera 45 26-85,Bldg 450, Bogota, Colombia; [Leguizamon-Guerrero, John Emerson; Arias-Cortes, Maria Mercedes; Tere-Pena, Claudia Patricia] Inst Nacl Metrol INM, Ave Carrera 50 26-55, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Rivera-Monroy, ZJ (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Carrera 45 26-85,Bldg 450, Bogota, Colombia.",zjriveram@unal.edu.co,,"Gonzalez Lopez, Nicolas Mateo/0000-0003-0009-1347; Rivera Monroy, Zuly Jenny/0000-0001-6915-8488; Huertas-Ortiz, Kevin Andrey/0000-0002-6176-7331; Garcia Castaneda, Javier Eduardo/0000-0001-6882-4397; Tere Pena, Claudia Patricia/0000-0001-9454-3011",Instituto Nacional de Metrologia (INM); Universidad Nacional de Colombia [HERMES: 47354],Instituto Nacional de Metrologia (INM); Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"This research was conducted with the financial support of the Instituto Nacional de Metrologia (INM) and Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Project code HERMES: 47354).

Ultrathin membranes based on 2D materials (2DMs) are particularly suitable for highly selective separation of ions and effective generation of blue energy because of their unique physicochemical properties and novel transport mechanisms occurring at the nano- and sub-nanometer length scale. However, due to the relatively high costs of fabrication compared to traditional porous membrane materials, their technological transfer toward large-scale applications still remains a great challenge. Herein, the authors present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the development of ultrathin membranes based on 2DMs for osmotic power generation and water purification. The authors discuss several synthetic routes to produce atomically thin membranes with controlled porosity and describe in detail their performance, with a particular emphasis on pressure-retarded osmosis and reversed electrodialysis methods. In the last section, an outlook and current limitations as well as viable future developments in the field of 2DM membranes are provided.","[Pakulski, Dawid; Del Buffa, Stefano; Ciesielski, Artur; Samori, Paolo] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, ISIS, 8 Allee Gaspard Monge, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Pakulski, Dawid; Czepa, Wlodzimierz; Ciesielski, Artur] Ctr Adv Technol, ISIS, Umultowska 89c, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Pakulski, Dawid; Czepa, Wlodzimierz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Chem, Umultowska 89b, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Ciesielski, A; Samori, P (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, ISIS, 8 Allee Gaspard Monge, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.;Ciesielski, A (corresponding author), Ctr Adv Technol, ISIS, Umultowska 89c, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",ciesielski@unistra.fr; samori@unistra.fr,"Ciesielski, Artur/B-5796-2012; Samor√¨, Paolo/A-6381-2010","Ciesielski, Artur/0000-0003-3542-4092; Samor√¨, Paolo/0000-0001-6256-8281; Czepa, Wlodzimierz/0000-0002-3118-4143",,,,,220,36,36,11,250,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1616-301X,1616-3028,,ADV FUNCT MATER,Adv.

However, this technology represents an important burden to the net plant efficiency (losses between 8% and 12%-points). High temperature ceramic membranes, associated with significantly lower efficiency losses, are foreseen as the best candidate to challenge cryogenics for high tonnage oxygen production. Although this technology is still at an embryonic state of development, the three-end membrane operation mode offers important technical advantages over the four-end mode that can be a good technological option in the near future. This paper analyzes the influence of both, the cryogenic and three-end high temperature membrane air separation units on the net oxyfuel plant efficiency considering the same boundary conditions and different equivalent thermal integrations. Moreover, the oxygen permeation rate, heat recovery, and required membrane area are also evaluated at different membrane operating conditions. Using a state-of-the-art perovskite BSCF as membrane material, net plant efficiency losses up to 5.1%-points can be reached requiring around 400,000 m(2) of membrane area. Applying this membrane-based technology it is possible to improve the oxyfuel plant efficiency over 4%-points (compared with cryogenic technology): however, it is still necessary to develop new ceramic materials to reduce the amount of membrane area required.

It poses a major threat to the development of the global community and human civilization. Agriculture, fossil fuel consumption by the industries and automobiles are the major source of greenhouse gases. Effective control or reduction of the greenhouse gases is a global challenge. The major conventional methods that are used for decomposition of the greenhouse gases are absorption, photocatalysis, electrochemical and thermochemical methods. However, the conventional methods have some drawbacks such as high capital cost, low selectivity, conversion and energy efficiency. To overcome this, several innovative approaches are being developed. Plasma technology is one of the approaches which has been intensively studied by various scientific communities. Plasma is a partially ionized gas that contains energetic electrons, ions, active radicals and neutral particles (atoms, molecules) in the ground and excited states. It can produce wide range of temperatures (300-30000 K) and electron number density ranges (up to 1026). Plasma assisted decomposition/reforming provides a complete or partial solution to overcome the limitations of the conventional methods. This review presents the current state of the art the plasma assisted decomposition and reforming of the greenhouse gases.","[Vadikkeettil, Yugesh; Subramaniam, Yugeswaran; Murugan, Ramaswamy] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Phys, Pondicherry 605014, India; [Ananthapadmanabhan, P., V] Power Beam Soc India, Navi Mumbai 400614, India; [Mostaghimi, Javad; Pershin, Larry] Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Batiot-Dupeyrat, Catherine] Univ Poitiers, Inst Chem Environm & Mat Poitiers IC2MP, Poitiers, France; [Kobayashi, Yasukazu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Catalyt Chem, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058565, Japan",Pondicherry University; University of Toronto; Universite de Poitiers; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST),"Subramaniam, Y (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Phys, Pondicherry 605014, India.",yugesh.phy@pondiuni.edu.in,,"Kobayashi, Yasukazu/0000-0001-5438-321X; Ramaswamy, Murugan/0000-0002-6206-5665","Department of Science and Technology (DST) , India [DST/TM/EWO/MI/CCUS/06]; DST-SERB [CRG/2018/002001]","Department of Science and Technology (DST) , India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); DST-SERB(Department of Science & Technology (India)Science Engineering Research Board (SERB), India)","Acknowledgements Authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to Department of Science and Technology (DST) , India for providing the financial support under the MI-Carbon Capture Innovation Challenge (IC#3) programme (Grant No.: DST/TM/EWO/MI/CCUS/06) to conduct this research work.

As a symbol, cloth tells stories of who we are and what we have experienced. Disasters engender change and give birth to new expressions. We have seen the Kutch embroiderers create narrative tapestries on cloth of the aftermath of the earthquake well after the it was over. Unlike other disasters the corona pandemic has not ended. How does one narrate something that has not ended? The face mask of the pandemic may have stories to tell in the future. The mask has made the journey from a medical functional protection to a symbolic engagement and narrative canvas in a matter of months. The cloth mask can be washed and worn like our clothes which makes the wearing of it feel normal to become a part of our everyday. Adapting to the new norm, craftspeople have come to treat the mask as a new canvas on which to portray their art using motifs and elements from their existing visual narratives.

Preparation of biochar from sewage sludge biochar has attained the attention of most of the researchers for their effectiveness in improving soil quality, reduction of uptake of heavy metals and potential benefits in agriculture fields to nourish the soil. In this review, an exhaustive list of sewage sludge biochar (SSBC) production from vast literature has compiled, and their characterization, application, quantification with risk assessment approach, impact on climate change, life cycle and cost analysis have been presented. The high cost of biomass disposal, (transportation, treatment and landfilling), is a serious concern. This paper presents the state of the art review on the applications of SSBC for the adsorption of antibiotics, heavy metals, textile dyes, phenolic compounds as well as minimizing agrochemical pollution. It is evident from the literature that the SSBC has multiple benefits, including revenue generation option. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the structure itself has changed, it retains many important wall paintings. In 1910, the cathedral underwent comprehensive restoration under the direction of Augusto Guidini and the painter Ernesto Rusca, including executing new paintings on undecorated surfaces, adding decorative features such as frames to some existing paintings, and retouching and filling losses to create a harmonious and coherent scheme in which all phases remained legible. By 2000, conservation issues were evident for all painted surfaces, including efflorescence, flaking paint and losses. From 2009 to 2017 another restoration project was carried out. The conservation of the wall paintings proved to be a complex process and two main aspects were important in informing decisions regarding methodology and treatments: the effects of moisture and climate, and the role of the unifying decorative scheme from the Guidini/Rusca intervention. The success of the recent project rested on prioritising the conservation needs of the paintings, considering the changes necessary to satisfy the religious and public function of the building, and wrestling with the historical, ethical, and material issues connected with the earlier intervention.","[Gilardi, Jacopo] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Southern Switzerland, DACD CR, Lugano, Switzerland",,"Gilardi, J (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Southern Switzerland, DACD CR, Lugano, Switzerland.",jacopo.gilardi@supsi.ch,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

In order to have an optimal and adaptive controller, the controller coefficients are tuned online by a novel optimization algorithm, which is called Adaptive Black Hole. In addition, the performance and robustness of the proposed method are tested by the experimental data, the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP - US06). In order to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the suggested novel smart controller, a valid comparison is conducted between the results of the proposed method and recent studies on the same topic like the Model Predictive Control and the conventional online fuzzy PD+I (OFPD+I) controllers.

We used a state-of-the-art modelling framework NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) designed for oceanographic research, operational oceanography, seasonal forecasting, and climate studies to build an eddy-resolving model of the GOF. To evaluate the model skill and performance, two different solutions were obtained on 0.5 km eddy-resolving and commonly used 2 km grids for a 1-year simulation. We also explore the efficacy of non-hydrostatic effect (convection) parameterizations available in NEMO for coastal application. It is found that the solutions resolving submesoscales have a more complex mixed layer structure in the regions of the GOF directly affected by the upwelling/downwelling and intrusions from the open Baltic Sea. Presented model estimations of the upper mixed layer depth are in good agreement with in situ CTD (BED) data. A number of model sensitivity tests to the vertical mixing parameterization confirm the model's robustness. Further progress in the submesoscale process simulation and understanding is apparently not connected mainly with the finer resolution of the grids, but with the use of non-hydrostatic models because of the failure of the hydrostatic approach at submesoscale.","[Vankevich, Roman E.; Sofina, Ekaterina V.; Eremina, Tatiana E.; Molchanov, Mikhail S.; Isaev, Alexey V.] Russian State Hydrometeorol Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Vankevich, Roman E.; Sofina, Ekaterina V.; Ryabchenko, Vladimir A.; Isaev, Alexey V.] Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, St Petersburg Branch, St Petersburg, Russia",Russian State Hydrometeorological University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; St. Petersburg Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Vankevich, RE (corresponding author), Russian State Hydrometeorol Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.;Vankevich, RE (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, St Petersburg Branch, St Petersburg, Russia.",rvankevich@mail.ru,"Isaev, Alexey V./C-1370-2014; Eremina, Tatjana/E-6467-2017; Ryabchenko, Vladimir Alexeevich/R-3877-2016; Sofina, Ekaterina V/E-3920-2014","Isaev, Alexey V./0000-0003-2005-4949; Eremina, Tatjana/0000-0001-5243-1804; Ryabchenko, Vladimir Alexeevich/0000-0003-3909-537X; Sofina, Ekaterina V/0000-0001-9206-8253",Federal Targeted Programme for Research and Development in Priority Areas of Development of the Russian Scientific and Technological Complex [RFMEFI57414X0091],Federal Targeted Programme for Research and Development in Priority Areas of Development of the Russian Scientific and Technological Complex,This work was supported by the Federal Targeted Programme for Research and Development in Priority Areas of Development of the Russian Scientific and Technological Complex for 2014-2020 (grant agreement no.

I identify the so-called Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions as the characteristic form of planetary mediation during the late twentieth century, and argue that our current emergence into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, calls for radically different representational strategies. Whole Earth images draw their strength from their iconographic and indexical qualities-in other words, their seeming ability to ground symbolic discourse in something that is undeniably and materially real. In the Anthropocene, however, physical nature itself has become a medium for the inscription of human messages, and effective planetary mediation can now take place only in virtual environments such as those of Google Earth and advanced climate modeling systems. I analyze the work of Soviet biologist Evgeni Shepelev as a starting point for this form of planetary mediation and discuss the multimedia installation The Place Where You Go to Listen by American composer John Luther Adams in order to show the challenges that contemporary environmental art will still have to overcome if it wants to illuminate our current planetary condition.","[Boes, Tobias] Univ Notre Dame, Dept German & Russian Languages & Literatures, German, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Boes, T (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept German & Russian Languages & Literatures, German, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,,,,,,,29,14,14,0,0,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2201-1919,,,ENVIRON HUMANITIES,Environ.

In coastal areas the dominant dissipative mechanism appears to be bottom friction where the relative strength depends on bottom characteristics, sediment type and bottom ripple geometry. The present state-of-art version SWAN wave model uses three popular formulations for dissipative mechanism due to bottom interaction. The bottom friction coefficient as in SWAN cannot be a constant and needs to be tuned based on prevailing hydrodynamic conditions when applied for a tidal dominant region. A combined wave-current interaction study should take into account varying water levels, reversal of current system and associated shear on the sea-bed. The present work reports on development of a new resistance law for bottom friction under the combined action of waves and currents. This new formulation has been implemented in the SWAN model and further its implication on variability of significant wave height for the Hooghly estuary located in the Bay of Bengal, East coast of India was investigated by comparison with ENVISAT satellite measurement. Based on this study, it could be ascertained that new friction formulation has potential for wind-wave modeling studies in near-shore and coastal waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we assess the applicability of carbon finance instruments for the improvement in building energy efficiency by adopting the high efficiency standards as well as advanced energy supply systems, building on a case study in a northern city in China. We find that upgrading the current Chinese BEE standard to one of the best practices in the world coupled with the state-of-the-art energy supply system implies an abatement cost at 16US$/tCO(2), which is compatible with the international carbon market price. The institutional reorganization turns out to be indispensable to facilitate the implementation of the proposed scheme of local government-led energy efficiency programme in the form of programmatic CDM in China's buildings sector. We show that with international support such as carbon finance, the BEE improvement will facilitate city's transition to low-carbon supply in the longer term. More importantly, it is argued that demand-side energy performance improvement in buildings should be considered a prerequisite to shifting low-carbon energy supply technologies such as fuel-switching, renewable power generation and Carbon Capture and Storage to address climate mitigation in light of cost-effectiveness and environmental integrity.","[Li, Jun] CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Colombier, Michel] Inst Dev Durable & Relat Int, F-75007 Paris, France",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Li, J (corresponding author), CIRED, 45Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",jun.li@centre-cired.fr; michel.colombier@iddri.org,,,,,,,65,13,14,0,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Often characterized by an astonishing range of significant scales and a rich assortment of physical processes, the complexity of such flows generally precludes all but numerical simulation for prediction and understanding-yet even state of the art computational models may be severely challenged by problems such as hurricane intensification. Although a number of significant issues are involved, a major factor is often grid resolution, for which grid adaptivity (GA) can be useful. Our experience has been that MPDATA is particularly well suited for GA. This paper sketches general details of a model that blends MPDATA with continuous GA; highlights a tensor viewpoint of the geometric conservation law; and presents results for both global and regional atmospheric applications. Together, the examples demonstrate the advantages of using GA with MPDATA to resolve fine-scale features-explicit gravity waves generated by flow over orography. Resolution of these waves (or lack thereof) are shown to affect global climate; furthermore, wave resolution is shown to depend upon the regional atmospheric environment. Finally the regional simulations show a Surprising increase in the complexity of the wavefields as resolution is increased to the point of resolving nonhydrostatic effects.

Deep learning (DL) may be an informative and promising tool to enhance seasonal prediction, particularly in regions where the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, using a DL model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we have found that the prediction skill for North China winter temperature (NCWT) can be extended up to five months by considering the remote impact of the Northeast Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) on North China. Based on historical simulations of winter temperatures in North China, we selected six CMIP5 models with relatively small deviations for training the CNN, and the period chosen for training was 1852-1991. The ERA5 data during 1995-2017 were utilized to evaluate the performance of the CNN. Our CNN shows the best performance in a recent 10-year period (2008-2017), showing a significantly improved level of NCWT prediction skill with a correlation skill of 0.65 at a 5-month lead time, which is much better than the forecast skill of the state-of-the-art dynamic seasonal prediction system. Heat map analysis was used to explore the possible physical mechanisms associated with the NCWT anomaly from the perspective of the CNN; the results showed that the SST over the Northeast Pacific is highly relevant to NCWT prediction. The Northeast Pacific warming in the boreal summer is related to the development of the El Nino event in the coming winter, which may induce NCWT anomalies by atmospheric teleconnection. Climate model experiments support the role of Northeast Pacific warming in the boreal summer on NCWT. The improved capability for prediction from using the CNN may help to establish the energy policy for the coming winter and reduce the economic losses from extremely cold in North China.","[Gao, Liang; Yang, Young-Min; Li, Qingqing] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ham, Yoo-Geun; Kim, Jeong-Hwan] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Gwangju 61186, South Korea",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chonnam National University,"Yang, YM (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",gkchcl@163.com; ymyang@hawaii.edu; liqq@nuist.edu.cn; ygham@chonam.ac.kr; spikio19@naver.com,"; Yang, Young-Min/GYR-1847-2022","Kim, Jeong-Hwan/0000-0003-0182-6704; Yang, Young-Min/0000-0002-3048-6430",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42088101],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 42088101.",,41,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAY,2022,5,,,,,,702,10.3390/atmos13050702,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13050702,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,1R2DO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000803186200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It consists in accurately predicting which areas of a territory are at higher risk of fire occurrence each next day, exploiting solely information obtained up until the previous day. The task's requirements in spatial granularity and scale of predictions, as well as the extreme imbalance of the data distribution render it a rather demanding and difficult to accurately solve the problem. This is reflected in the current literature, where most existing works handle a simplified or limited version of the problem. Taking into account the above problem specificities, in this paper, we present a machine learning methodology that effectively (sensitivity > 90%, specificity > 65%) and efficiently performs next day fire prediction, in rather high spatial granularity and in the scale of a country. The key points of the proposed approach are summarized in: (a) the utilization of an extended set of fire driving factors (features), including topography-related, meteorology-related and Earth Observation (EO)-related features, as well as historical information of areas' proneness to fire occurrence; (b) the deployment of a set of state-of-the-art classification algorithms that are properly tuned/optimized on the setting; (c) two alternative cross-validation schemes along with custom validation measures that allow the optimal and sound training of classification models, as well as the selection of different models, in relation to the desired trade-off between sensitivity (ratio of correctly identified fire areas) and specificity (ratio of correctly identified non-fire areas). In parallel, we discuss pitfalls, intuitions, best practices, and directions for further investigation derived from our analysis and experimental evaluation.","[Apostolakis, Alexis; Girtsou, Stella; Giannopoulos, Giorgos; Bartsotas, Nikolaos S.; Kontoes, Charalampos] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Astron Astrophys Space Applicat & Remote Sen, Athens 15236, Greece",National Observatory of Athens,"Apostolakis, A (corresponding author), Natl Observ Athens, Inst Astron Astrophys Space Applicat & Remote Sen, Athens 15236, Greece.",alex.apostolakis@noa.gr; alex.apostolakis@noa.gr; alex.apostolakis@noa.gr; alex.apostolakis@noa.gr; alex.apostolakis@noa.gr,,"Giannopoulos, Giorgos/0000-0002-8252-9869; Apostolakis, Alexis/0000-0002-6091-7887",Greek Government-Ministry of Development & Investments: CLIMPACT: Flagship Initiative for Climate Change and its Impact by the Hellenic Network of Agencies for Climate Impact Mitigation and Adaptation,Greek Government-Ministry of Development & Investments: CLIMPACT: Flagship Initiative for Climate Change and its Impact by the Hellenic Network of Agencies for Climate Impact Mitigation and Adaptation,This paper has been supported by using data and resources from the following Project funded the Greek Government-Ministry of Development & Investments: CLIMPACT: Flagship Initiative for Climate Change and its Impact by the Hellenic Network of Agencies for Climate Impact Mitigation and Adaptation.,,56,0,0,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,1222,10.3390/rs14051222,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14051222,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,ZW0WY,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000770943100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

More specifically, returns must be high enough to also pay out the value of waiting if conversion into more intensive land uses is to become optimal. However, many environmental policies today focus on nature restoration, where conversion has previously taken place. In this study, we therefore reverse the problem and ask when to afforest productive agricultural land, when we face uncertainty about the value of ecosystem services delivered by afforestation. Furthermore, projects such as afforestation are often associated with joint production of forest products and environmental goods, like biodiversity, hunting, groundwater production, carbon storage, recreation etc. Thus, we extend state-of-the-art models to handle two additive ecosystem services, which both are uncertain and may be correlated. The joint production aspect increases the value of conversion, the stopping value, and hence the incentives to afforest. Increasing uncertainty decreases this incentive, as expected. However, contrary to the existing literature evaluating exclusive options, less than perfect correlation between the values of future ecosystem services decreases the value of the real option and increases the set of states, where afforestation is the preferred decision. This causes afforestation to be attractive for a wider set of states of the world than otherwise and has implications where joint production is feasible. We discuss these findings and the potential application of this analysis for handling real options with joint production in other research domains.","[Strange, Niels; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Strange, N (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",nst@ifro.ku.dk; jbj@ifro.ku.dk; bjt@ifro.ku.dk,"Strange, Niels/AAB-5155-2020; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark J/K-8770-2014; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Strange, Niels/0000-0002-8842-8022; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark J/0000-0002-3305-8343; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228",Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF96],Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"The authors thank the Danish National Research Foundation (grant no.

Taking into consideration the high dependency of the performance of reflective insulation systems (RISs) on environmental conditions, in this study, various configurations and main environmental parameters such as climatic context and orientation are investigated comprehensively. Innovative validated calculation models and analysis methods are introduced and used to investigate the internal heating/cooling demands, and energy consumption values in this study. Internal Degree Day (IDD) method was defined, firstly introduced and utilized to identify the thermal requirements, and then the heating, cooling, and total demands are carefully assessed and compared. Subsequently, the corresponding energy consumption values to the thermal demands are investigated. Thus, 22120 numerical models were developed, and wall configurations of RISs are studied in four different climates (hot arid, hot-humid, temperate-humid, and cold). Investigations are conducted in annual periods, and the specimens are vastly studied in entire range of orientations. The performances of RISs are also extensively compared with non-reflective corresponding base line (BL) models. Findings of this study prove the dynamic performance of RISs and show the high potential of these systems in reduction of cooling consumptions (up to 12.48 MJ/m(2)). Orientation can lead to 11.40% variation in relative difference of consumption among the climates. Moreover, RISs have higher average efficiency in reduction of the consumption values (42.34%) than improvement of thermal comfort conditions (28.21%).

The monitoring should be centered around a dashboard of key indicators and targets covering environmental, economic, and social aspects of the bioeconomy. With a focus on the land dimension, this article examines the strengths and weakness of different economic, environmental and integrated models and methods for monitoring and forecasting the development of the EU bioeconomy.

In order to explore changes in temperatures in Mt. Taibai (3767 in a.s.l.), Qinling Mountains, the highest mountain in eastern mainland China, we used temperature microloggers to measure the temperature throughout a year on the northern and southern slopes. The measurement was conducted at 16 different elevations between 1250 and 3250 m from August 2001 to July 2002. The results showed that with an increase of altitude, the annual mean temperature (AMT) decreased at a lapse rate of 0.34 +/- 0.04 and 0.50 +/- 0.02 degrees C/100 m on the southern and northern slopes, respectively. The lapse rates of monthly mean temperatures (MMT) showed a large seasonal difference, with a higher value in the summer than in the winter, ranging from 0.14 +/- 0.05 to 0.43 +/- 0.05 degrees C/100 m on the southern slope, and from 0.29 +/- 0.03 to 0.63 +/- 0.02 degrees C/100 m on the northern slope. The accumulated temperature above 0 degrees C (ATO) decreased at a lapse rate of 98.6 +/- 13.0 and 142.5 +/- 3.75 degrees C days/100 m along the southern and northern slopes, respectively. The annual mean diurnal range of temperature (ADRT) was higher on the southern slope than on the northern slope, while the annual range of temperature (ART) showed a converse pattern. The ART declined at a lapse rate of 0.24 +/- 0.07 and 0.32 +/- 0.04 degrees C/100 m on the southern and northern slopes. Our results revealed that lapse rates of temperature variables showed large spatial and seasonal changes, and these changes should be taken into account for analysis of vegetation-climate relationships in mountainous areas.

Consumers' interest in healthy food requires sustainable tools to manage biotic and abiotic factors and, from this perspective, anti-insect nets represent an excellent green solution. For this purpose, our goal was to compare two different anti-insect nets on microclimate, production, and qualitative traits of Cucurbita pepo L. fresh fruits. The experiment was conducted in three separate polyethylene high tunnels, with 50 mesh anti-insect nets of different porosities being installed on the openings of two tunnels, while the third tunnel was a control without nets. Microclimate measurements, as well as yield, physiological, and phytochemicals variables, were assessed. The 50 mesh net led to a decrease in marketable yield (22.5%), fruit number (18.0%), CO2 net assimilation rate (6.0%), and transpiration rate (29.5%). Total soluble solids, antioxidant activities and total ascorbic acid concentration had an opposite trend. The 50 mesh AirPlus net improved quality aspects of zucchini fruits by increasing total ascorbic acid, total phenols, and antioxidant compounds, with no negative impact on yield.","[Formisano, Luigi; Pannico, Antonio; El-Nakhel, Christophe; De Pascale, Stefania; Rouphael, Youssef] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, Italy; [Starace, Giuseppe] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Poledica, Milena] Sachim Srl, Res & Dev Lab, I-70017 Putignano, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Salento,"De Pascale, S (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, Italy.",luigi.formisano3@unina.it; antonio.pannico@unina.it; christophe.elnakhel@unina.it; giuseppe.starace@unisalento.it; milena.poledica@sachim.it; depascal@unina.it; youssef.rouphael@unina.it,"Rouphael, Youssef/AAK-1472-2021; Starace, Giuseppe/N-4718-2015","De Pascale, Stefania/0000-0002-3653-7497; Pannico, Antonio/0000-0002-2999-1536; Rouphael, Youssef/0000-0002-1002-8651; Formisano, Luigi/0000-0001-6208-4869; El-Nakhel, Christophe/0000-0002-1200-2834; Starace, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4272-7104","Sachim srl, Putignano (BA), Italy (RD Project TEXTILNOVO-Nuovo approccio industriale per tessili tecnici innovativi.-Aiuti ai programmi integrati di investimento promossi da Medie imprese (PIA)-Art. 26 del Titolo II Capo 2 del Reg.

Cemeteries constitute a significant part of green areas in the city with a large potential for passive recreation places for residents. The aim of the research was to attempt to characterize the landscape of municipal cemeteries in Szczecin, as well as to formulate proposals for actions that would improve their current condition. On the basis of research and analyzes, the authors pointed out that the factors that influence the shaping of the landscape of Szczecin cemeteries are varied and can be generally divided into legal, spatial, historical, economic and cultural ones. It was found that the Central Cemetery, as a listed historic object, has the greatest landscape values, however, it lost much of the original landscape and cultural values due to post-war neglect and destruction. The remaining cemeteries are of secondary importance as objects of limited importance and functions of district cemeteries. Their condition is worse, and their landscapes are the least diverse. Cemeteries in Szczecin have a fairly high share of high greenery, and the low greenery is limited mainly to lawns. In order to create a climate favouring to walks and resting, the cemetery areas should be enriched with aesthetic and well thought out plant compositions from shrubs and perennials, designed by a landscape architect. It is proposed to create common garden units where the distance between the graves would be larger and it would be possible to create small plant arrangements. In addition, it is observed that cemeteries lack beautiful and original tombstones, which is why the return to exhibitions of cemetery art forms an important aspect. This would create the possibility of presenting modern and valuable stone art products and inspiring forms of plant arrangements at the graves. This is only part of the authors' proposals, which are quite universal and can therefore also be applied to other municipal cemeteries in Poland and abroad.","[Pilarczyk, Aleksandra; Nowak, Pawel] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Dept Landscape Design, 17 Juliusza Slowackiego St, PL-71434 Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Pilarczyk, A (corresponding author), West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Dept Landscape Design, 17 Juliusza Slowackiego St, PL-71434 Szczecin, Poland.",a.pilarczyk1@wp.pl,"Pilarczyk, Aleksandra/AAK-3723-2021","Pilarczyk, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7340-8774; Nowak, Pawel/0000-0002-3526-1062",,,,,4,2,2,0,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1757-8981,,,IOP CONF SER-MAT SCI,,,2019,,,,,,,92057,10.1088/1757-899X/471/9/092057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/471/9/092057,,,9,"Architecture; Engineering, Civil; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Engineering; Urban Studies,BM5ZD,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000465811804078,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result, they have a considerable impact on the atmospheric planetary boundary layer, the hydrologic cycle, the climate, and the weather. Current parameterizations of the stomatal mechanism in state-of-the-art atmospheric models are based on empirical relations that are established at the leaf scale between stomatal conductance and environmental conditions. In order to evaluate these parameterizations, an experiment was carried out on a potato field in New Jersey during the summer of 1989. Stomatal conductances were measured within a small homogeneous area in the middle of the potato field and under a relatively broad range of atmospheric conditions. A large variability of stomatal conductances was observed. This variability, which was associated with the variability of micro-environmental and physiological conditions that is found even in a homogeneous canopy, cannot be simulated explicitly on the scale of a single agricultural field and, a fortiori, on the scale of atmospheric models. Furthermore, this variability could not be related to the environmental conditions measured at a height of 2 m above the plant canopy simultaneously with the conductances, reinforcing the concept of scale decoupling suggested by Jarvis and McNaughton (1986) and McNaughton and Jarvis (1991). Thus, for atmospheric modeling purposes, a parameterization of stomatal conductance at the canopy scale using external environmental forcing conditions seems more appropriate than a parameterization based on leaf-scale stomatal conductance, as currently adopted in state-of-the-art atmospheric models. The measured variability was characterized by a lognormal probability density function (pdf) that remained relatively stable during the entire measuring period. These observations support conclusions by McNaughton and Jarvis (1991) that, unlike current parameterizations, a parameterization of plant stomata applied on a field (or larger) scale, might not require inclusion of the complex relations found at the leaf scale between stomata and their microenvironment.",,,"AVISSAR, R (corresponding author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT METEOROL & PHYS OCEANOG,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903, USA.",,,,,,,,59,34,34,0,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0006-8314,,,BOUND-LAY METEOROL,Bound.-Layer Meteor.,MAR,1993,2-Jan,,,,127,148,,10.1007/BF00705665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00705665,,,22,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KW913,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1993KW91300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although effects of one or more outdoor weather parameters are sometimes mimicked by means of dynamic schedules, they never fully reproduce the complex interactions of the stochastic processes typical of real climate. The present work introduces improved measurement procedures to determine the solar factor under dynamic conditions, applicable to outdoor test cell experiments and which take into account the variation of internal energy in the control volume. An in-depth uncertainty analysis has been conducted in order to highlight the most relevant uncertainty sources and to suggest improvements to the measurement techniques. Based on an iterative application of the uncertainty analysis, we developed and optimised two new strategies to extract and measure the solar load entering through a test sample and a new design concept of test cell facility, which allows the configuration to be adapted according to various test objectives. In order to accurately analyse the storage and delay effects of the thermal capacities within the control volume of the calorimeter, lumped-parameter models of three alternative designs (the two proposed strategies and a reference, traditional one) have been developed and coded in Matlab. The simulation results suggest that, compared to a traditional solution, the two proposed solutions offer a higher measurement accuracy and measurement precision in the determination of the solar factor. In addition, the results indicate that rapidly variable solar irradiance levels are detrimental to the accuracy level of the solar factor measurement; therefore tests should be carried out under stable clear sky conditions.

In an ongoing attempt to engage people and maintain audiences, new museums as well as those under renovation have acknowledged the importance of offering creative spaces. The pendulum has swung from the museum as a temple to keep treasures to the museum as an active space, a toolbox. Today's audiences are no longer looking for a cold 'white cube' museum experience. Instead, they are looking for warmer, shared experiences, i.e. people can be closer to the artefact and even touch it. This has induced attempts to exhibit museum artefacts in different ways. Nevertheless the exhibition devices for museums ought to be designed or strengthened to comply with the need of safety not only for the artefact but also for the visitors, in the sense established by current codes and regulations. Unfortunately the actions to which the artefacts are actually subjected are of different types. In addition to those related to the climate and environment changes, there are those due to the actions typical of the museum site, like the earthquakes, and those related to the political and cultural changes. The roots of the problem dates back to the first years of the sixties and only recently has been applied to the museum contents. An artefact can be in fact considered a rigid object placed on a shaking base that may enter a rocking motion and result in overturning. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Prediction of droughts is immensely helpful in early warning and preparing the most vulnerable communities to their adverse impacts. For the first time, this study investigated the potential of developing drought prediction models over Pakistan using three state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques; Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). Three categories of droughts; moderate, severe, and extreme considering two major cropping seasons called Rabi and Kharif were estimated using Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) and then predicted using the predictor data obtained from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis database. Also, for the first time in drought modelling, a novel feature selection approach called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used for identifying optimum sets of predictors. In validation, SVM-based models were able to better capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts over Pakistan compared to those by ANN and KNN-based models. KNN which was used in developing drought models for the first time displayed limited performance in comparison to that by SVM and ANN-based drought models, in validation. It was found that in the Rabi season SPEI is positively correlated with relative humidity over the Mediterranean Sea and the region north of the Caspian Sea. In the Kharif season, SPEI is positively correlated with the humid region over the south-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal and the regions north of the Mediterranean and Caspian Seas. In developing a drought prediction model for Pakistan, relative humidity, temperature and wind speed should be considered with a domain which encompasses the Mediterranean Sea, the region north of the Caspian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea.","[Khan, Najeebullah; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Ahmed, Kamal; Shiru, Mohammed Sanusi; Nawaz, Nadeem] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Sachindra, D.

Animal and veterinary sciences have evolved immensely in the past six decades, particularly in genetics, nutrition, housing, management and health. To address major challenges such as those posed by climate change or metabolic disorders, it is of utmost importance to use state-of-the-art research tools. Proteomics and the other post-genomic tools (transcriptomics or metabolomics) are among them. Proteomics has experienced a considerable development over the last decades. This brought developments to different scientific fields. The use and adoption of proteomics tools in animal and veterinary sciences has some limitations (database availability or access to proteomics platforms and funding). As a result, proteomics' use by animal science researchers varies across the globe. In this viewpoint article, we focus on the developments of domestic animal proteomics over the last decade in different regions of the globe and how the researchers have coped with such challenges. In the second part of the article, we provide examples of funding, educational and laboratory establishment initiatives designed to foster the development of (animal-based) proteomics. International scientific collaboration is a definitive and key feature in the development and advancement of domestic animal proteomics. Significance: Animal production and health are very important for food supply worldwide particularly as a source of proteinaceous foods. Animal and veterinary sciences have evolved immensely in the last decades. In order to address the major contemporary challenges facing animal and veterinary sciences, it is of utmost importance to use state-of-the-art research tools such as Proteomics and other Omics. Herein, we focus on the major developments in domestic animal proteomics worldwide during the last decade and how different regions of the world have used the technology in this specific research field. We address also major international efforts aiming to increase the research output in this area and highlight the importance of international cooperation to address specific problems inherent to domestic animal proteomics.","[Almeida, Andre M.; Ribeiro, David M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, LEAF, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ali, Syed Azmal; Jaswal, Shalini; Mohanty, Ashok Kumar] Natl Dairy Res Inst, Anim Biotechnol Ctr, Proteom & Cell Biol Lab, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Ceciliani, Fabrizio] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Vet, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Eckersall, P.

J,"Bayraktar, MS",,,,"Bayraktar, Mehmet Sami",,,A COLLAPSED HISTORICAL WOODEN BRIDGE IN KASTAMONU: BOZKURT - CUMAYANI BRIDGE IN ILISI VILLAGE,SANAT TARIHI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF ART HISTORY,,,Turkish,Article,,,,,,Kastamonu; Black Sea; Ottoman architecture; wooden bridge; rural architecture,,"In this study, a traditional wooden bridge, located in Ilisi Village, 5 km north of Bozkurt District of Kastamonu, but collapsed by a flood that caused significant damage in Bozkurt district and its surroundings on August 11, 2021, will be introduced and evaluated. The bridge, whose construction date could not be documented, was part of our traditional rural architecture. Our study is based on the field research carried out on May 11, 2016. No document or information about the construction date of the bridge has been found. According to the testimonies of the local residents, the bridge, which was once built by the villagers with the collaborative method, was damaged in a flood in 1965 and was repaired the same year. No ornamentation or technical detail was found on the Cumayani Bridge that would allow a precise dating. With the first settlement of the neighborhood where the bridge is located, the need for a bridge must have been felt. However, there is no clear document or information about the first settlement date of the village, which is known to have been founded a few hundred years ago. Considering the wooden bridges in Cankiri, Ordu, Giresun, Trabzon and Rize, which are similar to this structure with their traditional styles, it can be thought that the structure may have been built in the 19th century. The bridge, which was built on the narrowest part of the (cay) streamlet, was part of a rural road network designed to allow pedestrians and animals to cross the river barrier and reach across. The bridge, which had preserved its originality to a great extent before being destroyed, displayed typical rural architectural features of the Black Sea region. For the construction of the bridge, which is included in the group of wooden beam bridges in the context of typology, embankment walls and abutments were built on both sides to prevent the loose texture of the coast, and the beams carrying the bridge were placed on these masonry bridge abutments. Before it was collapsed, Cumayani Bridge was a relatively small-scale rural application of wooden bridges which is one of the traditional rural architectural construction types. All the architectural features of the bridge were in harmony with the features encountered in this type of works and did not contain any unusual elements or features. Cumayani Bridge, which has close similar examples mainly in the Black Sea region in Turkey, also has close similar ones seen in forested areas in various countries. Functionality was prioritized in the design of the unadorned structure. The type of tree used on the bridge is chestnut which is widespread in the region. Chestnut, which is compatible with the abundant rainy climate of the region, is known to be quite durable and long-lasting, and it is a suitable material widely used for bridges. Some common traditional practices were seen in the jointing details of wooden components. Recognition of the Cumayani Bridge, which forms a part of our lesser-known wooden bridges, will be favorable for our art of traditional architecture.

Sporomorphs are abundant and well preserved in these sediments and are used as a proxy to record vegetation change over time. We present results from both palynofloral and clay mineral analyses in the interval approximately 0.4-0.1 my before the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM); a period of transient and intense global warming that had a profound effect on animal and plant groups in high latitudes. An important factor that has a significant bearing on our understanding of turnover across the PETM is that of climate/environmental stability prior to the PETM in terrestrial ecosystems. Palynological analysis with a between sample resolution of <10 ky suggests that the vegetation type characterising the US Gulf Coastal plains was highly stable with no significant changes in composition and diversity that can be successfully correlated with orbital oscillations. Our results indicate considerable stability of the vegetation type on time-scales of 10(4)-10(5) yr. Clay mineral suites show the dominance of smectite and illite throughout the studied section with minor fluctuations in the abundance of kaolinite (ranging from 2 to 10%) that indicates a high seasonality of precipitation throughout our studied section. The exact stratigraphic position of the PETM is unknown on the US Gulf Coast but data from existing publications suggests there is little change in the vegetation type across the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary with no major immigration or turnover events. Dinocysts art: restricted in both diversity and occurrence but Apectodinium homomorphum is present with <similar to>30% abundance throughout the studied section and provides some evidence that the Apectodinium acme is not correlative with the PETM at middle latitudes.

Based on observations, reanalysis and simulations of 16 Coupled Models Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models, the responses of East Asia summer precipitation, as well as some relevant features, to global warming are investigated. The CMIP5 historical simulation reasonably reproduces the climatology of summer rainfall, the associated circulation, the moisture and its transportation, and the mid-troposphere horizontal advection of temperature as well. Under global warming, the rainfall enhancement is robustly projected in the state-of-the-art models over North China, Northeast China, northern coast of Japan and the Kuroshio. As well, the total summer rainfall over East Asia is consistently increased in the models. For the consistent responses, the moisture budget analysis based on the simulations shows that two factors are responsible: one is increased moisture. As East Asia is a climatological ascent region in northern summer, increased moisture induced by global warming leads to more moisture transported upward and thus the rainfall rise. The other is enhanced evaporation, which may be caused by surface warming and provides more precipitable water to the atmosphere column. Furthermore, the results may provide some implications to the long-term variability of East Asia summer rainfall over the last several decades.","[Qu, Xia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Qu, Xia] Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Chengdu 610225, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wen] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Guy Carpenter Asia Pacific Climate Impact Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; City University of Hong Kong","Huang, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",hg@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012; Zhou, Wen/C-3750-2012; Qu, Xia/B-9199-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Zhou, Wen/0000-0002-3297-4841; ","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955604, 2011CB309704]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41205050]; Open Research Fund Program of Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province [PAEKL-2013-K2]; CityU Strategic Research grant [700278]",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Research Fund Program of Plateau Atmosphere and Environment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province; CityU Strategic Research grant,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Program's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table 1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

Decision makers tend to address this challenge by framing adaptation as a decision problem, whereby the responses to impacts of change are addressed within existing decision processes centred on defining the decision problem and selecting options. However, this 'decision-making perspective' is constrained by societal values and principles, regulations and norms and the state of knowledge. It is therefore unsuitable for addressing complex, contested, cross-scale problems. In this paper we argue that simply broadening the decision making perspective to account for institutions and values is not enough. We contend the decision-malting perspective needs to be connected with a broader 'decision-context perspective' that focuses on how the societal system of decision processes affects the manner in which a particular problem is addressed. We describe the decision context as an interconnected system of values, rules and knowledge (vrk). The interaction of systems of vrk both creates and limits the set of practical, permissible decisions; the types of values, rules and knowledge that influence the decision and the capacity for change and transformation in the decision context. We developed a framework to analyse the interactions between values, rules and knowledge and their influence on decision making and decision contexts of adaptation initiatives, and applied it retrospectively to three projects on adaptation to sea-level rise. Our analysis revealed: (1) specific examples of how interactions between vrk systems constrained existing framings of decision making and the development of options for coastal adaptation; (2) limitations in the adaptive management strategies that underpinned the projects and (3) how the linked systems of vrk can allow adaptation practitioners to structure adaptation as a process of co-evolutionary change that enables a broader set of social issues and change processes to be considered. Adaptation projects that focus on the decision context represent a pragmatic alternative to existing decision-focused adaptation. By using the vrk model to diagnose constraints in decision processes, we show how the reframing of adaptation initiatives can reveal new approaches to developing adaptation responses to complex global change problems.

These oscillations were associated with important environmental transformations that culminated in the Pleistocene to the Holocene transition, with latter climate amelioration. However, the changes during this period are not only restricted to the environment, as important cultural transformations took place. The cultural traditions characteristics from the end of the Upper Paleolithic disappear with the emergence of the traits characteristic of the Mesolithic culture. This is clearly attested in the well-known lithic record, but also in other domains of material culture, like bone industry and art. Nevertheless, the extent to which these cultural and environmental transformations were associated with changes in subsistence strategies remains unclear, at least at the Mediterranean basin of the Iberian Peninsula. Apparently, the exploitation of faunal resources during the Mesolithic does not seem to change so much with respect to the end of the Upper Paleolithic, especially concerning the consumption of small prey. The main goal of this paper is (1) to analyze how environmental transformations could or could not intervene on the modes of life of Prehistoric populations during these transitional periods, and (2) to discuss the apparent dichotomy between cultural changes and subsistence strategies at the end of the Upper Paleolithic and the Mesolithic in northeastern Iberia. In that sense, we will include the case of the Moll del Salt site (Catalonia, Spain) as an example to explain these trends. This site has an archaeological sequence from the Upper Magdalenian to the Mesolithic, which makes it a reference place to comprehend the dynamics of human populations during this period.

This paper firstly presents an integrated simulation framework to couple photovoltaic electricity generation to building energy savings through adaptive shading. A high-resolution radiance and photovoltaic model calculates the photovoltaic electricity yield while taking into account partial shading between modules. The remaining solar irradiation that penetrates the window is used in a resistance capacitance building thermal model. A simulation of all possible dynamic configurations is conducted for each hourly time step, of which the most energy efficient configuration is chosen. We then utilise this framework to determine the optimal orientation of the photovoltaic panels to maximise the electricity generation while minimising the building's heating, lighting and cooling demand. An existing adaptive photovoltaic facade was used as a case study for evaluation. Our results report a 20-80% net energy saving compared to an equivalent static photovoltaic shading system depending on the efficiency of the heating and cooling system. In some cases the Adaptive Solar Facade can almost compensate for the entire energy demand of the office space behind it. The control of photovoltaic production on the facade, simultaneously with the building energy demand, opens up new methods of building management as the facade can control both the production and consumption of electricity.

The mechanisms driving tropical expansion are not well known and the recent expansion is underpredicted by state-of-the art GCMs. We use the CAM3 GCM to investigate how tropical width responds to idealized atmospheric heat sources, focusing on zonal displacement of the tropospheric jets. The heat sources include global and zonally restricted lower-tropospheric warmings and stratospheric coolings, which coarsely represent possible impacts of ozone or aerosol changes. Similar to prior studies with simplified GCMs, we find that stratospheric cooling - particularly at high-latitudes - shifts jets poleward and excites Northern and Southern Annular Mode (NAM/SAM)-type responses. We also find, however, that modest heating of the midlatitude boundary layer drives a similar response; heating at high latitudes provokes a weaker, equatorward shift and tropical heating produces no shift. Over 70 % of the variance in annual mean jet displacements across 27 experiments is accounted for by a newly proposed 'Expansion Index', which compares mid-latitude tropospheric warming to that at other latitudes. We find that previously proposed factors, including tropopause height and tropospheric stability, do not fully explain the results. Results suggest recently observed tropical expansion could have been driven not only by stratospheric cooling, but also by mid-latitude heating sources due for example to ozone or aerosol changes.","[Allen, R.

A total of 3804 pertinent documents published, in 1981-2021, were analyzed and discussed. China, the United States, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands have been the most active countries with more than 36% of the relevant literature. The keyword cluster analysis suggested the presence of five principal research topics: energy management and storage; monitoring and control of greenhouse climate parameters; automation of greenhouse operations through the internet of things (IoT) and wireless sensor network (WSN) applications; greenhouse covering materials and microclimate optimization in relation to plant growth; structural and functional design for improving greenhouse stability, ventilation and microclimate. Recent research trends are focused on real-time monitoring and automatic control systems based on the IoT and WSN technologies, multi-objective optimization approaches for greenhouse climate control, efficient artificial lighting and sustainable greenhouse crop cultivation using renewable energy.","[Blanco, Ileana; Luvisi, Andrea; De Bellis, Luigi] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Schettini, Evelia; Vox, Giuliano] Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Mugnozza, Giacomo Scarascia] Polytech Univ Bari, Dept Civil Environm Land Bldg Engn & Chem, I-70125 Bari, Italy",University of Salento; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Politecnico di Bari,"Blanco, I (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",ileana.blanco@unisalento.it,"Blanco, Ileana/I-5210-2015; Schettini, Evelia/E-9252-2012","Blanco, Ileana/0000-0003-2927-3427; Luvisi, Andrea/0000-0002-2207-7493; DE BELLIS, Luigi/0000-0002-6047-3526; Schettini, Evelia/0000-0002-8456-8677",,,,,226,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2311-7524,,HORTICULTURAE,Horticulturae,SEP,2022,9,,,,,,833,10.3390/horticulturae8090833,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae8090833,,,30,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,4U1OE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000858571200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is well-known, that snow shows a higher degree of reflection compared to other ground surfaces. During snow-poor winters, guaranteeing snow covered ski slopes by using snow making may therefore lead to an increase in the albedo of a mountainous region. Since increasing albedo engenders a negative radiative forcing, the cooling potential of snow production on ski slopes is of particular relevance in the context of the current climate debate. Investigations were however generally performed for flat surfaces. Several studies nevertheless demonstrated that the topography leads to a substantial decrease in the mean albedo of a given region. This is attributable to shading effects and to slope inclinations. The present study was therefore dedicated to the accurate simulation of the impact of the albedo increase of ski slopes on the mean albedo and on the resulting change in shortwave radiative budget of a chosen mountainous region. We used therefore a state of the art 3-dimensional radiative transfer model. The investigations were carried out for the skiing area Saalbach-Hinterglemm in Austria. Broadband snow albedo values between 0.61 and 0.62 in cloudless conditions and 0.64 and 0.65 in cloudy conditions for solar zenith angle (sza) between 30 and 80 degrees were used for the simulations. An uncertainty of ?0.17 was taken into account. First a sensitivity study was performed, that showed a substantial decrease in the mean albedo of the ski slopes as a function of slope inclination. A strong impact of topography and of surrounding trees on the mean albedo of the ski slopes of up to 40% and 14% respectively was found at high sza under clear sky conditions. Compared to snow free conditions an increase in albedo between 0.18 and 0.36 was observed, the higher values for smaller sza and assuming no trees in the surroundings. Only related to the ski slopes a radiative forcing between -7 and -35 W/m2 was obtained. If the long-term snow cover conditions were taken into account, snow making lead to a change in albedo, only, in March and April. The increase in albedo was just below 0.10 in April and 0.02 in March, resulting in a radiative forcing around -12 W/m2 and around -1.5 W/m2 respectively. Though, in order to analyze an eventual cooling effect on climate the whole carbon footprint related to the production of technical snow making shall be determined.","[Weihs, P.; Laimighofer, J.; Formayer, H.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria; [Laimighofer, J.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Stat, Vienna, Austria; [Olefs, M.] ZAMG Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Hohe Warte 38, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Weihs, P (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria.",philipp.weihs@boku.ac.at,,"Olefs, Marc/0000-0002-5813-236X",programme Startclim - Osterreich (StartClim2018.C),programme Startclim - Osterreich (StartClim2018.C),This work was funded by the programme Startclim - Osterreich (StartClim2018.C).

Model uncertainty in annual mean rainfall change is locally enhanced along the Gulf Stream. The moisture budget analysis reveals that much of the model uncertainty in rainfall change can be traced back to the discrepancies in surface evaporation change and transient eddy effect among models. Results of the intermodel Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis show that intermodel variations in local sea surface temperature (SST) pattern exert a strong control over the spread of rainfall projection among models through the modulation of evaporation change. The first three SVD modes explain more than 60% of the intermodel variance of rainfall projection and show distinct SST patterns with mode water-induced banded structures, reduced subpolar warming due to ocean dynamical cooling, and the Gulf Stream shift, respectively.","[Long, Shang-Min; Xie, Shang-Ping] Ocean Univ China, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Ocean Atmosphere Interact & Climate Lab, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Long, Shang-Min; Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Ocean University of China; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Long, SM (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Ocean Atmosphere Interact & Climate Lab, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",smlong4861@gmail.com,"Èæô, ‰∏äÊïè/AAF-1231-2019; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325",National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955602]; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers [U1406401]; China Scholarship Council [201406330004],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"We acknowledge the WCRP Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and the climate modeling groups (Table S1) for producing and making available their model outputs.

This study aims to evaluate the water budget of the Amazon basin based on several state-of-the-art land surface model (LSM) outputs. Water budget variables (terrestrial water storage TWS, evapotranspiration ET, surface runoff R, and base flow B) are evaluated at the basin scale using both remote sensing and in situ data. Meteorological forcings at a 3-hourly time step and 1 degrees spatial resolution were used to run 14 LSMs. Precipitation datasets that have been rescaled to match monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) datasets and the daily Hydrologie du Bassin de l'Amazone (HYBAM) dataset were used to perform three experiments. The Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) river routing scheme was forced with R and B and simulated discharges are compared against observations at 165 gauges. Simulated ET and TWS are compared against FLUXNET and MOD16A2 evapotranspiration datasets and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) TWS estimates in two subcatchments of main tributaries (Madeira and Negro Rivers). At the basin scale, simulated ET ranges from 2.39 to 3.26 mm day(-1) and a low spatial correlation between ET and precipitation indicates that evapotranspiration does not depend on water availability over most of the basin. Results also show that other simulated water budget components vary significantly as a function of both the LSM and precipitation dataset, but simulated TWS generally agrees with GRACE estimates at the basin scale. The best water budget simulations resulted from experiments using HYBAM, mostly explained by a denser rainfall gauge network and the rescaling at a finer temporal scale.","[Getirana, Augusto C.

During the construction of the G-VAP data archive, freely available and mature satellite and reanalysis data records with a minimum temporal coverage of 10 years were considered. The archive contains total column water vapour (TCWV) as well as specific humidity and temperature at four pressure levels (1000, 700, 500, 300 hPa) from 22 different data records. All data records were remapped to a regular longitudelatitude grid of 2 degrees x 2 degrees. The archive consists of four different folders: 22 TCWV data records covering the period 2003-2008, 11 TCWV data records covering the period 1988-2008, as well as 7 specific humidity and 7 temperature data records covering the period 1988-2009. The G-VAP data archive is referenced under the following digital object identifier (doi): https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/GVAP/V001. Within G-VAP, the characterization of water vapour products is, among other ways, achieved through intercomparisons of the considered data records, as a whole and grouped into three classes of predominant retrieval condition: clear-sky, cloudy-sky and all-sky. Associated results are shown using the 22 TCWV data records. The standard deviations among the 22 TCWV data records have been analysed and exhibit distinct maxima over central Africa and the tropical warm pool (in absolute terms) as well as over the poles and mountain regions (in relative terms). The variability in TCWV within each class can be large and prohibits conclusions about systematic differences in TCWV between the classes.","[Schroeder, Marc; Lockhoff, Maarit] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Satellite Based Climate Monitoring, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany; [Fell, Frank] Informus GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Forsythe, John] Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Trent, Tim] Univ Leicester, Earth Observat Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Trent, Tim] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Bennartz, Ralf] Vanderbilt Univ, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Bennartz, Ralf; Borbas, Eva] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Space Sci & Engn Ctr, Cooperat Inst Meteorol Satellite Studies, Madison, WI USA; [Bosilovich, Michael G.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modelling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Castelli, Elisa] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Hersbach, Hans] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Kachi, Misako] Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy, Earth Observat Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kobayashi, Shinya] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Tokyo, Japan; [Kursinski, E.

This study focuses on an extreme dust episode occurring on 22 March 2013, where near-surface dust concentrations of up to 7000 mu gm(-3) were encountered in the Dead Sea region. This episode is of great interest as it was accompanied by high wind speeds and a gust front that rapidly passed the Judean Mountains. Wind was even accelerated on the lee side of the Judean Mountains leading to a severe downslope wind. We simulated this situation with the comprehensive online-coupled weather forecast model COSMO-ART. Fair agreement was found between the simulated meteorological variables and the observations. The model was capable of producing a reasonable spatiotemporal distribution of near-surface dust concentration, consistent with available measurements in this area. With respect to the time of the maximum near-surface dust concentration in the Dead Sea valley, the model captured it almost perfectly compared to the observed total suspended particle (TSP) concentrations. COSMO-ART showed that the high near-surface dust concentration in the Dead Sea valley was mainly determined by local emissions. These emissions were caused by strong winds on the lee side of the Judean Mts. The model showed that an ascending airflow in the Dead Sea valley lifted dust particles, originating mainly from the upwind side of the Judean Mts., up to approximately 7 km. These dust particles contributed to the pronounced maximum in modelled dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the valley. Here we highlight the important point that the simulated maximum dust AOD was reached in the eastern part of the Dead Sea valley, while the maximum near-surface dust concentration was reached in the western part of the valley.","[Kishcha, Pavel; Starobinets, Boris; Alpert, Pinhas] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Rieger, Daniel; Metzger, Jutta; Bangert, Max; Vogel, Heike; Corsmeier, Ulrich; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schaettler, Ulrich] Deutsch Wetterdienst DWD, Offenbach, Germany",Tel Aviv University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Kishcha, P (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",pavel@cyclone.tau.ac.il,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Kishcha, Pavel/H-8461-2016","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Kishcha, Pavel/0000-0002-2693-0914; Vullers, Jutta/0000-0002-6483-1159",German Helmholtz Association [VH-VI-527],German Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),"The current study was carried out in the framework of the Virtual Institute DEad SEa Research Venue (DESERVE; www.deserve-vi.net), funded by the German Helmholtz Association under VH-VI-527.

Given the marked phenotypic differences between populations of burrowing parrots we hypothesized an important role of geographical as well climatic heterogeneity in the population structure of this species. LocationSouthern South America. MethodsWe applied a landscape genetics approach to investigate the explicit patterns of genetic spatial autocorrelation based on both geography and climate using spatial principal component analysis (sPCA). This necessitated a novel statistical estimation of the species climatic landscape, considering temperature- and precipitation-based variables separately to evaluate their weight in shaping the distribution of genetic variation in our model system. ResultsGeographical and climatic heterogeneity successfully explained molecular variance in burrowing parrots. sPCA divided the species distribution into two main areas, Patagonia and the pre-Andes, which were connected by an area of geographical and climatic transition. Moreover, sPCA revealed cryptic and conservation-relevant genetic structure: the pre-Andean populations and the transition localities were each divided into two groups, each management units for conservation. Main conclusionssPCA, a method originally developed for spatial genetics, allowed us to unravel the genetic structure related to spatial and climatic landscapes and to visualize these patterns in landscape space. These novel climatic inferences underscore the importance of our modified sPCA approach in revealing how climatic variables can drive cryptic patterns of genetic structure, making the approach potentially useful in the study of any species distributed over a climatically heterogeneous landscape.","[Masello, Juan F.; Wikelski, Martin] Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Masello, Juan F.; Quillfeldt, Petra] Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Montano, Valeria; Nuhlickova, Sona; Moodley, Yoshan] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Vienna, Austria; [Montano, Valeria] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Moodley, Yoshan] Univ Venda, Dept Zool, Thohoyandou, South Africa",Max Planck Society; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Lausanne; University of Venda,"Masello, JF (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, Heinrich Buff Ring 38, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",juan.f.masello@bio.uni-giessen.de,"Nuhl√≠ƒçkov√°, So≈àa/AAK-7718-2020; Quillfeldt, Petra/A-9549-2009; Masello, Juan/C-7133-2009","Nuhl√≠ƒçkov√°, So≈àa/0000-0002-2783-4705; Quillfeldt, Petra/0000-0002-4450-8688; Moodley, Yoshan/0000-0003-4216-2924; Masello, Juan/0000-0002-6826-4016",World Parrot Trust; Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft; Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation; Wildlife Conservation Society,World Parrot Trust; Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft; Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation; Wildlife Conservation Society,"We thank Orlando Amaya, Brent Barrett, Julio Bufelli, Mirta Carbajal, Gabriel Cortez, Maritza Cortes, Francesca Cunninghame, Miguel Escobar, Mauricio Failla, Esteban Fernandez, Victor Fratto, Pablo Giovine, Patricia Gonzalez, Guillermo Luna Jorquera, Mariano Linares, Fabian Llanos, Walter Marcial, Gabriela Murga Velasco, Juanjo Navarro, Sandra Rivera, Sergio Sanchez, Lorenzo Sympson, Adalberto Taux, Ricardo Torres and Luis Valenzuela Riquelme for helping with sample collection, and Gernot Segelbacher and Nadine Klauke for the development of the microsatellite loci.

This study demonstrated how a combination of an IoT environmental sensing network implemented locally outdoors and indoors can help to determine the NV potential and actual utilization throughout the year with the consideration of outdoor climate variance, air pollution levels, and window open/closed status. An NV potential index was developed by analyzing indoor and outdoor PM2.5, and outdoor air temperature and air speed throughout the year at different spatial (from room scale to building level and local weather stations) and temporal (instantaneous, season, and annual) scales. The index was applied on a case building located in Berkeley, California, during the period of August 2018 to the end of 2019. Compared to the potential NV availability, the actual window opening time in typical rooms was less than 35%. These results point out that the actual window usage behavior was the key limiting factor in NV potential utilization. Even during periods when climate- and pollution-wise outdoor conditions allowed use of the NV, many occupants kept their windows closed. Keeping windows open or closed was significantly affected by outdoor climate condition and air pollution levels, especially during the wild-fire period.","[Luo, Maohui] Tongji Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yumeng] China Acad Art, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Pantelic, Jovan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pantelic, Jovan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biosyst, Leuven, Belgium",Tongji University; China Academy of Art; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; KU Leuven,"Pantelic, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Pantelic, J (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biosyst, Leuven, Belgium.",Jovan.pantelic@kuleuven.edu.be,,,CITRIS; Banatao Institute under 2018 CITRIS Seed Funding Program Award,CITRIS; Banatao Institute under 2018 CITRIS Seed Funding Program Award,This study was funded by CITRIS and Banatao Institute under 2018 CITRIS Seed Funding Program Award.

Skeptics have placed the burden of proof of effectiveness upon the shoulders of advocates, but this may lead to pursuing measurement of the immeasurable, deflecting attention away from the more pressing task of defining what we mean by the humanities in medicine. While humanities input can offer a fundamental critical counterweight to a potentially reductive biomedical science education, a new wave of thinking suggests that the kinds of arts and humanities currently used in medical education are neither radical nor critical enough to have a deep effect on students' learning and may need to be reformulated. The humanities can certainly educate for tolerance of ambiguity as a basis to learning democratic habits for contemporary team-based clinical work. William Empson's 'seven types of ambiguity' model for analyzing poetry is transposed to medical education to: (a) formulate seven values proffered by the humanities for improving medical education; (b) offer seven ways of measuring impact of medical humanities provision, thereby reducing ambiguity; and (c) -as a counterweight to (b) - celebrate seven types of ambiguity in contemporary medical humanities that critically reconsider issues of proof of impact.","[Bleakley, Alan] Falmouth Univ, AIR, Grad Sch, Peruyn Campus,Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",,"Bleakley, A (corresponding author), Falmouth Univ, AIR, Grad Sch, Peruyn Campus,Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",alan.bleakley@falmouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,76,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1041-3545,1573-3645,,J MED HUMANIT,J.

In this modeling system, aerosol-enabled CAM5, a state-of-the-art global climate model is downscaled to provide coherent meteorological and chemical boundary conditions for regional WRF-Chem simulations. Aerosol particle emissions originating outside the WRF-Chem domain can be a potentially important nonlocal aerosol source. As a test case, the potential impacts of nonlocal forest fire aerosols on regional precipitation and radiation were investigated over the northeastern United States during the summer of 2004. During this period, forest fires in Alaska and western Canada lofted aerosol particles into the midtroposphere, which were advected across the United States. WRF-Chem simulations that included nonlocal biomass burning aerosols had domain-mean aerosol optical depths that were nearly three times higher than those without, which reduced peak downwelling domain-mean shortwave radiation at the surface by similar to 25 W m(-2). In this classic twin experiment design, adding nonlocal fire plume led to near-surface cooling and changes in cloud vertical distribution, while variations in domain-mean cloud liquid water path were negligible. The higher aerosol concentrations in the simulation with the fire plume resulted in a similar to 10% reduction in domain-mean precipitation coincident with an similar to 8% decrease in domain-mean CAPE. A suite of simulations was also conducted to explore sensitivities of meteorological feedbacks to the ratio of black carbon to total plume aerosols, as well as to overall plume concentrations. Results from this ensemble revealed that plume-induced near-surface cooling and CAPE reduction occur in a wide range of conditions. The response of moist convection was very complex because of strong thermodynamic internal variability.","[Zhao, Zhan; Kooperman, Gabriel J.; Pritchard, Michael S.; Russell, Lynn M.; Somerville, Richard C.

The automatic identification of boats in monitoring images facilitates conservation, research and patrolling efforts. However, the diverse sizes of vessels, the highly dynamic water surface and weather-related visibility issues significantly hinder this task. While recent deep learning (DL)-based object detectors identify well medium- and large-sized boats, smaller vessels, often responsible for substantial disturbance to sensitive marine life, are typically not detected. We propose a detection approach that combines state-of-the-art object detectors and a novel Detector of Small Marine Vessels (DSMV) to identify boats of any size.

A state-of-the-art global model in a high-end computer framework is used to produce a three-member 73-yr ensemble run forced by observed SST to represent the control run. The AEJ as produced by the control is compared with the representation of the AEJ in the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and other observational datasets and found to be very realistic. Five experiments are then performed, each represented by sets of three-member 22-yr-long (1980-2001) ensemble runs. The goal of the experiments is to investigate the role of meridional soil moisture gradients, different land surface properties, and orography. Unlike previous studies, which have suppressed soil moisture gradients within a highly idealized framework (i.e., the so-called bucket model), terrestrial evaporation control is here achieved with a highly sophisticated land surface treatment and with an extensively tested and complex methodology. The results show that the AEJ is suppressed by a combination of absence of meridional evaporation gradients over Africa and constant vegetation, even if the individual forcings taken separately do not lead to the AEJ disappearance, but only its modification. Moreover, the suppression of orography also leads to a different circulation in which there is no AEJ. This work suggests that it is not just soil moisture gradients but a unique combination of geographical features present only in northern tropical Africa that causes and maintains the jet.","[Wu, Man-Li C.; Schubert, Siegfried D.; Suarez, Max J.; Koster, Randy D.; Pegion, Philip J.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Reale, Oreste] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Atmospheres Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Reale, Oreste] Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Wu, MLC (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",man-li.c.wu@nasa.gov,"Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012; Pegion, Philip/E-5247-2012","Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383; ",NASA Earth Science Enterprise's Global Modeling and Analysis Program,NASA Earth Science Enterprise's Global Modeling and Analysis Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),This work was supported by the NASA Earth Science Enterprise's Global Modeling and Analysis Program.,,60,42,42,0,8,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

This portable system is a complete and autonomous wireless platform designed to monitor and cultivate microorganisms directly sampled from their natural environment, particularly from harsh northern environments. Using 96-well plates, the EcoChip can be used in the field for real-time monitoring of bacterial growth. Manufactured with high-quality electronic components, this new EIS monitoring system is designed to function at a low excitation voltage signal to avoid damaging the cultured cells. The high-precision calibration network leads to high-precision results, even in the most limiting contexts. Luminosity, humidity, and temperature can also be monitored with the addition of appropriate sensors. Access to robust data storage systems and power supplies is an obvious limitation for northern research. That is why the EcoChip is equipped with a flash memory that can store data over long periods of time. To resolve the power issue, a low-power micro-controller and a power management unit control and supply all electronic building blocks. Data stored in the EcoChip's flash memory can be transmitted through a transceiver whenever a receiver is located within the functional transmission range. In this paper, we present the measured performance of the system, along with results from laboratory tests in vitro and from two field tests. The EcoChip has been utilized to collect bio-environemental data in the field from the northern soils and ecosystems of Kuujjuarapik and Puvirnituq, during two expeditions, in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We show that the EcoChip can effectively carry out EIS analyses over an excitation frequency ranging from 750 Hz to 10 kHz with an accuracy of 2.35%. The overall power consumption of the system was 140.4 mW in normal operating mode and 81 mu W in sleep mode. The proper development of the isolated bacteria was confirmed through deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing, indicating that bacteria thrive in the EcoChip's culture wells while the growing conditions are successfully gathered and stored.","[Sylvain, Matthieu; Lehoux, Francis; Gosselin, Benoit] Univ Laval, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morency, Steeve; Bharucha, Eric; Messaddeq, Younes] Univ Laval, Ctr Opt Photon & Lasers, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Faucher, Felix; Allard, Michel] Univ Laval, Dept Geog, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Tremblay, Denise M.; Moineau, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Bioinformat, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Raymond, Frederic; Corbeil, Jacques] Univ Laval, Dept Mol Med & Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Sarrazin, Denis] Univ Laval, Ctr Northern Studies, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Laval University; Laval University; Laval University; Laval University,"Gosselin, B (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",matthieu.sylvain.1@ulaval.ca; francis.lehoux.1@ulaval.ca; steeve.morency@copl.ulaval.ca; felix.faucher.2@ulaval.ca; eric.bharucha@sn.ulaval.ca; Denise.Tremblay@greb.ulaval.ca; Frederic.Raymond@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca; Denis.Sarrazin@cen.ulaval.ca; Sylvain.Moineau@bcm.ulaval.ca; Michel.Allard@cen.ulaval.ca; jacques.corbeil@fmed.ulaval.ca; Younes.Messaddeq@copl.ulaval.ca; benoit.gosselin@gel.ulaval.ca,"Raymond, Frederic/I-4135-2019; Corbeil, Jacques/AAW-9739-2020","Raymond, Frederic/0000-0002-3606-4060; Corbeil, Jacques/0000-0002-9973-2740; Messaddeq, Younes/0000-0002-0868-2726; Lehoux, Francis/0000-0002-2143-1788; Gosselin, Benoit/0000-0003-1473-3451",Sentinel North Strategy; Canada First Research Excellence Fund,Sentinel North Strategy; Canada First Research Excellence Fund,This work was funded by the Sentinel North Strategy and the Canada First Research Excellence Fund.,,25,5,5,1,27,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1932-4545,1940-9990,,IEEE T BIOMED CIRC S,IEEE Trans.

Energy savings can be achieved in the building sector by improving the building's dynamic energy performance in terms of sustainable construction management in the urban-based built environments (referred to as an Urban Organism). This study implements the concept of dynamic approach to reflect the unexpected changes in the climate and energy environments as well as in the energy policies and technologies. Research in this area is very significant for the future of the building, energy, and environmental industries around the world. However, there is a lack of studies from the perspective of the dynamic approach and the system integration, and thus, this study is designed to fill the research gap. This study highlights the state-of-the-art in the major phases for a building's dynamic energy performance (i.e., monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting phases), focusing on the operation and maintenance phase. This study covers a wide range of research works and provides various illustrative examples of the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance. Finally, this study proposes the specific future developments and challenges by phase and suggests the future direction of system integration for the development of a carbon-integrated management system as a large complex system. It is expected that researchers and practitioners can understand and adopt the holistic approach in the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance under the new paradigm of an Urban Organism.

The current research is mostly fundamental and little attention has been given to the technical and economic feasibility of plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. In this study, the feasibility of plasma-catalytic ammonia is assessed for small-scale ammonia synthesis. A brief summary of the state of the art of plasma catalysis is provided as well as a targets and potential avenues for improvement in the conversion to ammonia, ammonia separation and a higher energy efficiency. A best-case scenario is provided for plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis and this is compared to the Haber-Bosch ammonia process operated with a synthesis loop. An ammonia outlet concentration of at least 1.0 mol. % is required to limit the recycle size and to allow for efficient product separation. From the analysis, it follows that plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis cannot compete with the conventional process even in the best-case scenario. Plasma catalysis potentially has a fast response to intermittent renewable electricity, although low pressure absorbent-enhanced Haber-Bosch processes are also expected to have fast responses to load variations. Low-temperature thermochemical ammonia synthesis is expected to be a more feasible alternative to intermittent decentralized ammonia synthesis than plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis due to its superior energy efficiency.","[Rouwenhorst, Kevin H.

Establishing international collaborations could provide an efficient, sustainable mechanism to increase knowledge exchange, aiding the development of earthen heritage conservation strategies around the world. However, perceived differences in how Eastern and Western countries value earthen heritage and develop conservation strategies can pose challenges for establishing collaborations. To understand these perceived differences and whether they hinder collaborations, this paper compares British and Chinese heritage conservation policy and practice and then reports the results from an innovative workshop examining the approaches of 13 Chinese and 13 UK based heritage experts and researchers towards earthen heritage conservation. Workshop participants undertook bilingual discussions and completed a co-created questionnaire available in English and Mandarin. Both groups identified historic value as the most important value and maintenance of authenticity and integrity, need for scientific research and site scale conservation as vital considerations for conservation strategies. This study found that to understand the potential for collaboration, individual perspectives need consideration as well as policies and practices. This innovative bilingual, discussion-based approach has potential to aid collaborations for diverse international issues from wildlife conservation to cross-boundary pollution and climate change.","[Richards, Jenny; Wang, Yinghong; Orr, Scott A.; Viles, Heather] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Richards, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",jennifer.richards@ouce.ox.ac.uk; yinghong.wang@ouce.ox.ac.uk; scott.orr@ouce.ox.ac.uk; heather.viles@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Orr, Scott/L-6770-2019","Orr, Scott/0000-0002-2549-9173; Richards, Jenny/0000-0003-4061-240X","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant for the Centre for Doctoral Training Science and Engineering in Art, Heritage and Archaeology [EP/L016036/1]; Getty Conservation Institute; EPSRC Global Challenge Research Fund Institutional Sponsorship 2017","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant for the Centre for Doctoral Training Science and Engineering in Art, Heritage and Archaeology(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Getty Conservation Institute; EPSRC Global Challenge Research Fund Institutional Sponsorship 2017(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research was funded by UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant for the Centre for Doctoral Training Science and Engineering in Art, Heritage and Archaeology (EP/L016036/1) in association with the Getty Conservation Institute.

Many N2O mitigation strategies have since been developed while a holistic view is still missing. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of N2O mitigation studies in wastewater treatment. Through analyzing existing studies, this article presents the essential knowledge to guide N2O mitigations, and the logics behind mitigation strategies. In practice, mitigations are mainly carried out by aeration control, feed scheme optimization, and process optimization. Despite increasingly more studies, real implementation remains rare, which is a combined result of unclear climate change policies/incentives, as well as technical challenges. Five critical technical challenges, as well as opportunities, of N2O mitigations were identified. It is proposed that (i) quantification methods for overall N2O emissions and pathway contributions need improvement; (ii) a reliable while straightforward mathematical model is required to quantify benefits and compare mitigation strategies; (iii) tailored risk assessment needs to be conducted for WWTPs, in which more longterm full-scale trials of N2O mitigation are urgently needed to enable robust assessments of the resulting operational costs and impact on nutrient removal performance; (iv) current mitigation strategies focus on centralized WWTPs, more investigations are warranted for decentralised systems, especially decentralized activated sludge WWTPs; and (v) N2O may be mitigated by adopting novel strategies promoting N2O reduction denitrification or microorganisms that emit less N2O. Overall, we conclude N2O mitigation research is reaching a maturity while challenges still exist for a wider implementation, especially in relation to the reliability of N2O mitigation strategies and potential risks to nutrient removal performances of WWTPs.","[Duan, Haoran; Zhao, Yingfen; Ye, Liu] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Duan, Haoran; Zheng, Min; Yuan, Zhiguo] Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr AWMC, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Koch, Konrad] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Urban Water Syst Engn, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Wells, George F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; Technical University of Munich; Northwestern University,"Ye, L (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",l.ye@uq.edu.au,"Zheng, Min/GZH-2090-2022; Koch, Konrad/A-2849-2014; Yuan, Zhiguo/C-4980-2013; Wells, George/N-7986-2013; Zheng, Min/GLU-7095-2022; Duan, Haoran/G-9007-2016; Wells, George/B-6632-2014","Zheng, Min/0000-0001-9148-7544; Koch, Konrad/0000-0001-5425-0169; Yuan, Zhiguo/0000-0002-7566-1482; Zheng, Min/0000-0001-9148-7544; Duan, Haoran/0000-0001-6679-3240; Wells, George/0000-0002-9100-1628; Zhao, Yingfen/0000-0002-1144-7620",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP180103369]; China Scholarship Council (CSC); University of Queensland; US National Science Foundation [2033793]; Australian Research Council Australian Laureate Fellowship [FL170100086],Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); University of Queensland(University of Queensland); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Australian Research Council Australian Laureate Fellowship(Australian Research Council),This study was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through project DP180103369.

Most studies have investigated Mg and Sr in ostracod shells as proxies for temperature and salinity, and the use of a wide range of trace elements as prospective paleoenvironmental indicators has yet to be developed for lacustrine systems. Only a few preliminary studies have used trace metals in paleolimnological studies such as Cd, Ba and Zn as paleonutrient indicators, or Mn, Fe and U as redox and oxygenation indicators. This paper reviews the state of the art of geochemical analyses in microfossils such as ostracods, foraminifera, and corals, and provides insights in new trace element proxies with the goal to promote the use of trace elements in ostracod shells as paleoenvironmental proxies. In paleoceanography, foraminifera and corals are most prominently used to reconstruct past climate conditions. Well-established proxies such as delta O-18, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca provide information about changes in sea surface temperatures. In addition, a great number of new proxies have been developed recently, such as radiogenic isotopes and redox sensitive trace elements. In paleolimnology, ostracod shell chemistry is widely used to assess paleohydrological changes. Reconstruction of temperature and salinity changes in lake environments is often achieved by oxygen isotopes as well as Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios, but depending on the hydrological and geological settings of the lake system, local calibrations are needed to assess which proxy is suited to reflect which processes. New proxies need to be tested by novel techniques that recently have become available. Compared to conventional instrumentation used in ostracod shell chemistry, methods such as Laser Ablation ICP-MS and NanoSIMS allow single shell analysis and provide high-resolution data. The potential of ostracods in paleolimnology is not yet fully assessed, but can be developed by learning from paleoceanographic studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Thus, we aimed to test whether the specialization of phytophagous insects in insect-plant interaction networks decreases toward cold habitats as predicted by the 'altitude niche-breadth hypothesis' to forecast possible consequences of interaction rewiring under climate change. We used a non-invasive, standardized metabarcoding approach to reconstruct dietary relationships of Orthoptera species as a major insect herbivore taxon along a broad temperature gradient (similar to 12 degrees C) in Southern Germany. Based on Orthoptera surveys, feeding observations, collection of fecal pellets from >3,000 individuals of 54 species, and parallel vegetation surveys on 41 grassland sites, we quantified plant resource availability and its use by herbivores. Herbivore assemblages were richer in species and individuals at sites with high summer temperatures, while plant richness peaked at intermediate temperatures. Corresponding interaction networks were most specialized in warm habitats. Considering phylogenetic relationships of plant resources, however, the specialization pattern was not linear but peaked at intermediate temperatures, mediated by herbivores feeding on a narrow range of phylogenetically related resources. Our study provides empirical evidence of resource specialization of insect herbivores along a climatic gradient, demonstrating that resource phylogeny, availability, and temperature interactively shape the specialization of herbivore assemblages. Instead of low specialization levels only in cold, harsh habitats, our results suggest increased generalist feeding due to intraspecific changes and compositional differences at both ends of the microclimatic gradient. We conclude that this nonlinear change of phylogeny-based resource specialization questions predictions derived from the 'altitude-niche breadth hypothesis' and highlights the currently limited understanding of how plant-herbivore interactions will change under future climatic conditions.","[Koenig, Sebastian; Krauss, Jochen; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Keller, Alexander] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Organism & Cellular Interact, Planegg, Germany; [Bofinger, Lukas] Landesumweltanwaltschaft Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria",University of Wurzburg; University of Munich,"Konig, S (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",sebastian.c.koenig@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Keller, Alexander/D-1221-2009; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014","Keller, Alexander/0000-0001-5716-3634; Konig, Sebastian/0000-0003-3253-8457; Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf/0000-0003-1359-3944",Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art (StMWK); Projekt DEAL,Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art (StMWK); Projekt DEAL,"We are grateful to conservation authorities and the team of the National Park Berchtesgaden, especially Sebastian Seibold and Annette Lotz, for their support, provision of facilities, and permission for field work.

Modern 4th generation and 5th generation district heating networks can be used to integrate sources of waste heat, which allows efficient operation. The design of such heating networks is subject of many optimization models. Most optimization models focus on energy flows and result in Mixed Integer Linear Programs. This requires simplifications, where temperatures and mass flow rates are neglected or simplified. This work presents a Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Program with temperature constraints. A case study is presented, where the integration of low temperature waste heat in a district heating network is optimized. In this case study the positioning of heat pumps at the supply or at the consumers influences network operation. The results show a trade-off between economical and ecological optimal solutions with a range of total annualized costs from 120,000 EUR/a to 307,000 EUR/a and a range of CO2-Emissions from 193 t/a to 605 t/a. Furthermore, the influence of design decisions on the optimal operation is demonstrated. All in all, the quadratic model formulation stresses the influence of temperatures on the optimization outcome and offers pareto optimal solutions for the design of the presented case study.

When the wind speed is increased in the model, the jet shifts poleward, despite the fact that the stirring of vorticity remains statistically constant. The cause is found to be increasing meridional shear that results from increasing the wind speed in a meridionally confined region and reduces the absolute vorticity gradient on the flanks of the jet. This has two related consequences. The first is that wave propagation is discouraged, as a turning latitude is created where the absolute vorticity gradient tends to zero. On the sphere, this occurs first at high latitudes, thereby shifting wave dissipation toward the equator. The reduced high-latitude dissipation causes a poleward shift of the jet. The second consequence occurs when the vorticity gradient actually becomes negative, in which case the waves may overreflect where an instability is present, providing a high-latitude source of pseudomomentum. This may further encourage the jet to shift poleward. The relevance of the barotropic dynamics to more realistic atmospheres is unclear, but the intermodel variability of the poleward shift of the jet in response to increasing CO2 across a suite of state-of-the-art GCMs is consistent with the barotropic dynamics, suggesting that further investigation is warranted.","[Kidston, Joseph] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kidston, Joseph; Vallis, G.

Their natural and anthropogenic emissions have often been in focus, while the role of human metabolic emissions has received less attention. In this study, exhaled, dermal and whole-body CO2 and CH4 emission rates from a total of 20 volunteers were quantified under various controlled environmental conditions in a climate chamber. The whole-body CO2 emissions increased with temperature. Individual differences were the most important factor for the whole-body CH(4 )emissions. Dermal emissions of CO2 and CH4 only contributed ~ 3.5% and ~ 5.5% to the whole-body emissions, respectively. Breath measurements conducted on 24 volunteers in a companion study identified one third of the volunteers as CH(4 )producers (exhaled CH4 exceeded 1 ppm above ambient level). The exhaled CH4 emission rate of these CH4 producers (4.03 +/- 0.71 mg/h/person, mean +/- one standard deviation) was ten times higher than that of the rest of the volunteers (non-CH4 producers; 0.41 +/- 0.45 mg/h/person). With increasing global population and the expected large reduction in global anthropogenic carbon emissions in the next decades, metabolic emissions of CH4 (although not CO2) from humans may play an increasing role in regional and global carbon budgets.","[Li, Mengze; Zannoni, Nora; Pugliese, Giovanni; Wang, Nijing; Ernle, Lisa; Williams, Jonathan] Max Planck Inst Chem, Hahn Meitner Weg 1, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Bekoe, Gabriel; Wargocki, Pawel] Tech Univ Denmark, Int Ctr Indoor Environm & Energy, Dept Civil Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Bekoe, Gabriel] Ajman Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Dept Architecture, POB 346, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Pugliese, Giovanni] Rostock Univ Med Ctr, Dept Anaesthesia & Intens Care, Schillingallee 35, D-18057 Rostock, Germany; [Carrito, Mariana; Cera, Nicoletta; Moura, Catarina; Vasconcelos, Priscila; Nobre, Pedro] Univ Porto, Ctr Psychol Univ Porto CPUP, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Porto, Portugal; [Cera, Nicoletta] Coimbra Inst Biomed Imaging & Translat Res CIBIT, Coimbra, Portugal; [Li, Mengze] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Williams, Jonathan] Max Planck Inst Chem, Mainz, Germany",Max Planck Society; Technical University of Denmark; Ajman University; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Coimbra; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Max Planck Society,"Li, MZ; Williams, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Hahn Meitner Weg 1, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.;Li, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Williams, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Mainz, Germany.",mengze.li@mpic.de; jonathan.williams@mpic.de,"Wang, Nijing/GRX-8410-2022; Nobre, Pedro J./K-3144-2017; Beko, Gabriel/C-8684-2009; Wargocki, Pawel/B-4632-2017","Nobre, Pedro J./0000-0003-2571-6972; Zannoni, Nora/0000-0003-2721-5362; Beko, Gabriel/0000-0001-6107-8336; Carrito, Mariana/0000-0001-8414-5319; Wargocki, Pawel/0000-0003-3865-3560; Cera, Nicoletta/0000-0002-2702-8789",Alfred P.

Illustrative results show how dynamically informed formulations of the coupling matrix (via an Ensemble Kalman Filter, EnKF) can lead to synchronization when observing networks are sparse and how hybrid methods can lead to synchronization when those dynamic formulations are inadequate (due to small ensemble sizes). A large-scale application with a global ocean general circulation model is also presented.

Cold and warm periods, inferred from Paramo and Andean forest elements, respectively, reveal that the warmest periods were registered at similar to 1000 cal. yr BP (similar to AD 1016) (Medieval Climatic Optimum') and in the last century, whereas the coldest ones around 1200 cal. yr BP (AD 831) and 650-150 cal. yr BP (AD 1368-1750) (Little Ice Age'). The pollen signal suggests that warm periods were dry and cold periods were wet. A comparison of these results with some localities of northwestern Colombia, the Caribbean, and South America was made, displaying variations that reflect regional and/or global climatic phenomena such as Intertropical Convergence Zone and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. In the past 50 years, the decrease in Quercus, Weinmannia and Clusia recovery and the increase in Rumex, Plantago, and Gunnera may reflect human impact derived from livestock, agriculture, and/or firewood. Volcanic events of variable magnitude have been identified with an apparent minimal effect on vegetation, reaching a maximum variation of about 10-15% between the beginning and the end of a volcanic event.","[Giraldo-Giraldo, Maria J.] Univ Caldas, Inst Invest Estratig IIES, Manizales, Colombia; [Velasquez-Ruiz, Cesar A.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Bogota, Colombia; [Pardo-Trujillo, Andres] Univ Caldas, Inst Invest Estratig IIES, Dept Ciencias Geol, Calle 65 26-10,Edificio Orlando Sierra,2 Piso, Manizales, Colombia",Universidad de Caldas; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad de Caldas,"Pardo-Trujillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Caldas, Inst Invest Estratig IIES, Dept Ciencias Geol, Calle 65 26-10,Edificio Orlando Sierra,2 Piso, Manizales, Colombia.",andres.pardo@ucaldas.edu.co,,"Pardo-Trujillo, Andres/0000-0001-9678-6818",Vicerrectoria de Investigaciones y Posgrados (VIP) of the Universidad de Caldas (Colombia),Vicerrectoria de Investigaciones y Posgrados (VIP) of the Universidad de Caldas (Colombia),"Thanks to Vicerrectoria de Investigaciones y Posgrados (VIP) of the Universidad de Caldas (Colombia) for financing this Project.

These fundamental changes in terrestrial ecosystems could have major ramifications for the timing and fluxes of carbon and nutrient exports from watersheds and the geochemical signatures of northern rivers. Discontinuous permafrost, which underlies watersheds in Interior Alaska (USA), is expected to degrade rapidly in response to climate warming and this will likely alter subsurface flows and flow paths, water residence times, water-soil, and water-rock interactions. This study of the Chena River in Interior Alaska was undertaken to quantify dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), major ion, strontium isotope, and stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope values during two year-long time series sampling periods. Our goal was to identify the hydrogeochemical signatures associated with the major seasonal flow regimes. Periods of increased discharge such as spring melt and major summer precipitation events yielded elevated DOC and TON concentrations, diluted major ion concentrations, and shifted stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios from base flow toward precipitation values. During dry summer periods nutrient concentrations decreased and strontium isotope values were indicative of a higher proportion of silicate versus carbonate mineral dissolution. Winter base flow had a unique geochemical signal with a slight increase in TDN concentrations compared to typical summer conditions, and a lower proportion of silicate versus carbonate mineral dissolution. Since flow paths in subarctic watersheds can change dramatically over the course of a year we interpreted our results within the context of a schematic model for subsurface flow to identify how permafrost degradation might affect nutrient exports and hydrogeochemical patterns in these watersheds.

SD long-term trends are obtained from analysis of middle stratosphere NCEP and ECMWF data. They are found to be dependent on latitude and attitude. Wind data are available since 1948. The corresponding analysis suggests a breakpoint in the trend at around 1980: SD increases before 1980, and decreases afterwards. Corresponding changes of stratospheric wave activity are analyzed and found to be it major contribution to the SD trends. Long-term computer runs of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM 1b) are consistent with these results. Vegetation data oil the ground indicate similar trends with a break.

Modelling and measuring land-atmosphere carbon exchanges from arable lands are important tasks to predict the influence of vegetation dynamics on climate change and its retroactive effects on crop productivity. We tested the agro-ecosystem model CERES-EGC against gap-filled daily net CO(2) exchanges over crop rotations monitored in three arable sites in Europe. The model parameters were estimated using Bayesian calibration and the model prediction accuracy was assessed with two supplementary independent data sets. As a result, the calibrated model allowed us to compute the net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) for entire crop rotations. The Bayesian calibration method results in an improvement of goodness of fit compared to initial parameter-based simulations. The calibrated model was accurate to estimate the NEP from daily time scale to aggregated NEP for entire crop rotation. The carbon returns from application of organic manure and the carbon uptake from catch crops and crop volunteers generated an important C sink effect on the NBP. Adding the nitrous oxide and methane fluxes from soils to the CO(2) balance will allow us to compute the total greenhouse gas budget of agro-ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, quantifying past changes and projecting future changes in this cycle are important. We analyzed the positive and negative multidecadal trends in the NH mean precipitation since the 1950s that were accurately reproduced by a state-of-the-art Earth system model. Results showed that changes in the interhemispheric heat transport play a major role in the NH atmospheric heat budget, accounting for 59% of the negative-to-positive trend change in NH precipitation through a north-south shift in the tropical precipitation zone, and were strongly linked to Hadley circulation anomaly. The remaining 41% corresponded to changes in atmospheric cooling with small interhemispheric differences, which were primarily related to clear-sky longwave radiation. These findings quantitatively agreed with the results from a multimodel analysis. Plain Language Summary The northern hemisphere (NH) mean precipitation was observed to decrease from the 1950s to the early 1980s and then increase from the mid-1980s onward. We analyzed simulated results obtained using a state of the art Earth system model and investigated the factors contributing to these observed precipitation trends. Results shows that 59% of the negative to positive changes in the NH mean precipitation trends were related to a north-south shift in the tropical precipitation zone and can be attributed to changes in the heat transport across the equator, which are strongly linked to the tropical circulation associated with flows across the equator. When the southward flow in the upper layer and northward flow in the lower layer increase, heat flows out of the NH, and moisture flows into the NH from the southern hemisphere, which increases the precipitation in the NH. The remaining 41% of the change in NH precipitation trends were the global mean component of the precipitation changes, which could mostly be attributed to the effects of radiative cooling in the atmosphere. These findings quantitatively agreed with the results from a multimodel analysis, which indicates their robustness.","[Yukimoto, Seiji; Oshima, Naga; Kawai, Hideaki; Deushi, Makoto; Aizawa, Takuro] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Aizawa, Takuro] Natl Inst Polar Researcn, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan",Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Yukimoto, S (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",yukimoto@mri-jma.go.jp,,"Aizawa, Takuro/0000-0003-0798-8800; Deushi, Makoto/0000-0002-0373-3918; Oshima, Naga/0000-0002-8451-2411; Yukimoto, Seiji/0000-0002-0415-1661","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0717935561]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [JP18H03363, JP18H05292, JP21H03582, JP19H05699, JP20K04070]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20202003, JPMEERF20205001]; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II) [JPMXD1420318865]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [MLIT1753, MLIT2253]","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II); Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","This study was supported by the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU, program Grant No. JPMXD0717935561) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (Grant Nos.

This synthesis, the first such of Mg/Ca data, necessitates consideration of uncertainties and limitations and provides a general perspective on the evolution of deep-sea temperatures over this period. Published Mg/Ca records show temperature patterns through the Miocene that are consistent with those first synthesized by Kennett (1985) utilizing isotope and other data. Accordingly, the early Miocene was an interval of relative warmth culminating in a climatic optimum at similar to 16 Ma that was characterized by the warmest (Mg-derived) temperatures of the past 20 million years. After the climatic optimum, palaeotemperatures dropped by 3-4 degrees C during the second major advance of Antarctic ice between similar to 15 Ma and 13 Ma. For the late Miocene, between 11 and 8.5 Ma, a distinct increase in benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios at two Atlantic sites provides evidence for deep to intermediate water circulation changes. Thereafter, temperatures close to modern are recorded at all sites. Assuming constant seawater Mg/Ca ratios through time, it can be concluded that the early Miocene climate was generally warmer than today and that by the late Miocene temperatures approached modern values.","[Billups, Katharina; Scheiderich, Kathleen] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",University of Delaware,"Billups, K (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.",kbillups@udel.edu,,,,,,,59,13,14,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0141-3600,,978-1-4443-3791-4,SPEC PUBL INT ASS SE,,,2010,,,,,1,16,,,,,,16,Geology; Paleontology,Book Citation Index ‚Äì Science (BKCI-S),Geology; Paleontology,BTL52,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000287219000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The MDP presents policy choices for the development of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The plan offers economically attractive, climate adaptive and environmentally sustainable paths forward in the face of climate change and economic uncertainties. We collected our data using qualitative techniques, including a literature review and interviews. We found convergence between the MDP's agenda and political actors' agendas, though divergences were also detected. Between the delivery of the MDP in 2013 and formal endorsement of its ideas in 2017, the problem stream, policy stream and politics stream were brought together by the actions of policy entrepreneurs (scientists and experts). Our findings suggest that agenda-setting and convergence were a crucial step towards endorsement of the strategic delta planning process for the Mekong Delta.

We use a spatial ecosystem model, forced by a coupled physical-biogeochemical model, to simulate the spatial distribution of functional groups within a marine ecosystem, which depends on their respective tolerances to abiotic factors, trophic interactions, and fishing. We simulate the future long-term spatial developments of the community composition and their potential implications for fisheries under three different nutrient management scenarios and changing climate. The three nutrient management scenarios result in contrasting developments of bottom oxygen concentrations and phytoplankton abundance, with substantial effects on fish production. Nutrient load reduction increases the spatial extent of the areas suitable for the commercially most valuable demersal fish predator and all types of fisheries. This suggests that strategic planning of fishery management strategies could benefit from considering future changes in species distributions due to changes in eutrophication. We show that combining approaches from climate research, physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, biogeography, and trophic ecology with economical information provides a strong foundation to produce scientific knowledge that can support a multisectoral management of ecosystems.","[Bauer, Barbara; Tomczak, Maciej T.] Stockholm Univ, Balt Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Meier, H.

During peat formation, easily decomposable OM is preferentially lost and more recalcitrant moieties accumulate. In a peat profile, OM quality thus scales with depth. Drainage and ongoing climate change poses the risk of rapid OM loss when formerly anoxic peat layers oxidize. During peat decomposition, deeper, more recalcitrant peat is exposed to the oxygen-rich surface, which may influence the decomposition rate. We show that the soil respiration rate of a disturbed temperate peatland is strongly controlled by the peat's quality and especially its polysaccharides content. The polysaccharide content of soil profiles in a wider range of peatland sites with differing degrees of disturbance was inferred by means of solid-state C-13 NMR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The data confirmed a strong decline in polysaccharide content with depth and a poor OM quality of surface peat in soils drained decades ago. We combined the evidence from respiration and spectroscopic measurements to deduce the sensitivity of peatland carbon loss with respect to OM quality by scaling measured quality to a 142-years record of peatland subsidence and carbon loss at one of the sites. According to the functional relationship between quality and respiration, the measured average annual carbon loss rate of 2.5 t C ha(-1) at that site was 20 t C ha(-1) at the onset of peatland drainage and dropped to less than 1 t C ha(-1) in recent times.

Until now, little seismic reservoir response is observed, only at two out of 16 sites seismic events with M-L > 2.0 were detected: at Unterhaching, in 2008, six events with M-L > 2 occurred soon after the onset of circulation; at Poing, in 2016, 5 years after circulation started, two events with M-L similar to 2.1 occurred, both located near the injection well. The analysis of the reactivation potential allows to connect seismicity to fault structures. In the Bavarian Molasse Basin, fault structures generally exhibit low seismic reactivation potential, as long as they trend ENE-WSW. By Monte-Carlo simulation, the geological uncertainty and the sensitivity of the individual parameters are quantified. They show that critically pre-stressed fault segments, e.g. at Unterhaching, combined with minimum change of the hydraulic reservoir conditions can lead to a dramatic increase of the reactivation potential of seismicity. For uncritical fault segments, e.g. at the Poing site, two self-enforcing effects are discussed which increase the reactivation potential over time: first, stress field modification by thermo-hydraulic effects and, second, fault alteration by carbonate dissolution can reduce the fault friction and cohesion. Both effects increase the sensitivity of the reactivation potential to the fault friction and can bring previously uncritical fault segments to critical state. Finally, the possible impact of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical and chemical processes at hydrothermal systems on the reactivation potential is highlighted: at fault segments with high reactivation potential hydro-mechanical effects may dominate whereas at low reactivation potential thermo-mechanical processes can potentially yield to a slow rotation of the stress field.","[Seithel, Robin; Gaucher, Emmanuel; Mueller, Birgit; Kohl, Thomas] KIT, Adenauerring 20b, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Steiner, Ulrich] Erdwerk GmbH, Bonner Pl 1, D-80803 Munich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Seithel, R (corresponding author), KIT, Adenauerring 20b, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",robin.seithel@kit.edu,"Gaucher, Emmanuel/ABF-6617-2021; Kohl, Thomas/M-5704-2013","Gaucher, Emmanuel/0000-0001-5870-4113; Kohl, Thomas/0000-0001-6982-6036","Bavarian Geothermal Alliance (GAB); Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture Science and Art; Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy Baden-Wiirttemberg; Ministry of Science, Research and Art","Bavarian Geothermal Alliance (GAB); Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture Science and Art; Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy Baden-Wiirttemberg; Ministry of Science, Research and Art","We want to thank the operator of the geothermal plants of Unterhaching, Poing and the Stadtwerke Munchen (SWM) and the Bavarian earthquake service for their cooperation, as well as the Bavarian Geothermal Alliance (GAB), which supported this work.

The SDGs provide the construction industry with a new lens through which global needs and desires can be translated into business solutions. This paper explores the role of the construction industry in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The paper uses an explanatory sequential design with an initial quantitative instrument phase, followed by a qualitative data collection phase. Following a comparative review of the literature on the 17 SDGs, a questionnaire was designed and administered among 130 respondents, and 105 responses were received. These data were then validated through semi-structured interviews with 16 sustainable construction experts. Data obtained from the semi-structured validation interviews were analysed through side-by-side comparisons of the qualitative data with the quantitative data. The findings show that the construction industry has a critical role in achieving almost all the 17 SDGs. The roles were, however, prevalent in 10 key SDGs, namely: sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); climate action (SDG 13); clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9); life on land (biodiversity) (SDG 15); gender equality (SDG 5); good health and well-being (SDG 3); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). The study confirmed the role played by the construction industry in achieving these SDGs. The findings from this study provide further insights into the ever-increasing state-of-the-art regarding the construction industry's role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals.","[Fei, Wenmei] Chongqing Coll Architecture & Technol, Fac Real Estate Mkt, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China; [Opoku, Alex] UCL, UCL Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 7HB, England; [Agyekum, Kofi] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Construct Technol & Management, AK 384, Kumasi, Ghana; [Oppon, James Anthony] Cape Coast Tech Univ, Sch Built & Nat Environm, Dept Bldg Technol, CC 156, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Ahmed, Vian] Amer Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Chen, Charles] Univ Phoenix, Coll Business & Informat Technol, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Lok, Ka Leung] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Natl Res Base Intelligent Mfg Serv, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China",University of London; University College London; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; American University of Sharjah; Chongqing Technology & Business University,"Opoku, A (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 7HB, England.",2017025@ctbu.edu.cn; alex.opoku@ucl.ac.uk; kagyekum.cap@knust.edu.gh; james.oppon@cctu.edu.gh; vahmed@aus.edu; kalebiz@email.phoenix.edu; k.l.lok@edu.salford.ac.uk,"Opoku, Alex/H-9180-2018; Oppon, James Anthony/AAG-4399-2021; Agyekum, Kofi/R-1479-2018","Opoku, Alex/0000-0002-5973-512X; Oppon, James Anthony/0000-0002-4869-4414; Agyekum, Kofi/0000-0002-7903-5390; Lok, Ka Leung/0000-0002-4378-8403",,,,,81,12,12,14,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,16,,,,,,9112,10.3390/su13169112,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13169112,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UH4OM,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000689912400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Compared to surface water resources, groundwater resources are more protected from pollution, and their use is less restricted by seasonal and inter-annual flow variations. To support water management in a globalized world, it is necessary to estimate groundwater recharge at the global scale. Here, we present a best estimate of global-scale long-term average diffuse groundwater recharge (i.e. renewable groundwater resources) that has been calculated by the most recent version of the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model WGHM (spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees, daily time steps). The estimate was obtained using two state-of-the-art global data sets of gridded observed precipitation that we corrected for measurement errors, which also allowed to quantify the uncertainty due to these equally uncertain data sets. The standard WGHM groundwater recharge algorithm was modified for semi-arid and arid regions, based on independent estimates of diffuse groundwater recharge, which lead to an unbiased estimation of groundwater recharge in these regions. WGHM was tuned against observed long-term average river discharge at 1235 gauging stations by adjusting, individually for each basin, the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and total runoff. We estimate that global groundwater recharge was 12 666 km(3)/yr for the climate normal 1961-1990, i.e. 32% of total renewable water resources. In semi-arid and arid regions, mountainous regions, permafrost regions and in the Asian Monsoon region, groundwater recharge accounts for a lower fraction of total runoff, which makes these regions particularly vulnerable to seasonal and inter-annual precipitation variability and water pollution. Average per-capita renewable groundwater resources of countries vary between 8m(3)/(capita yr) for Egypt to more than 1 millionm(3)/(capita yr) for the Falkland Islands, the global average in the year 2000 being 2091 m(3)/(capita yr). Regarding the uncertainty of estimated groundwater resources due to the two precipitation data sets, deviation from the mean is 1.1% for the global value, and less than 1% for 50 out of the 165 countries considered, between 1 and 5% for 62, between 5 and 20% for 43 and between 20 and 80% for 10 countries. Deviations at the grid scale can be much larger, ranging between 0 and 186 mm/yr.","[Doell, P.; Fiedler, K.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Doll, P (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany.",p.doell@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"D√∂ll, Petra/A-3784-2009","D√∂ll, Petra/0000-0003-2238-4546",,,,,48,247,251,7,78,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Yet, our understanding of their spatio-temporal dynamics in habitat use associated with the seasonal oscillation of resources is still limited. In this study, we have employed state-of-the-art lightweight GPS loggers to track the yellow-winged bat Lavia frons in a desert in northern Kenya to investigate how seasonality in a desert affects the a) spatial and b) temporal dimensions of movements in a low-mobility bat. Methods Bats were tracked during April-May 2017 (rainy season) and January-February 2018 (dry season) using 1-g GPS loggers. Spatial and temporal dimensions of movements were quantified, respectively, as the home range and nightly activity patterns. We tested for differences between seasons to assess responses to seasonal drought. In addition, we quantified home range overlap between neighbouring individuals to investigate whether tracking data will be in accordance with previous reports on territoriality and social monogamy in L. frons. Results We obtained data for 22 bats, 13 during the rainy and 9 during the dry season. Home ranges averaged 5.46 +/- 11.04 ha and bats travelled a minimum distance of 99.69 +/- 123.42 m/hour. During the dry season, home ranges were larger than in the rainy season, and bats exhibited high activity during most of the night. No apparent association with free water was identified during the dry season. The observed spatial organisation of home ranges supports previous observations that L. frons partitions the space into territories throughout the year. Conclusions Our results suggest that, in low-mobility bats, a potential way to cope with seasonally harsh conditions and resource scarcity in deserts is to cover larger areas and increase time active, suggesting lower cost-efficiency of the foraging activity. Climate change may pose additional pressures on L. frons and other low-mobility species by further reducing food abundances.","[Conenna, Irene; Rocha, Ricardo; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Global Change & Conservat, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Conenna, Irene; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Lopez-Baucells, Adria] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes cE3c, Fac Sci, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopez-Baucells, Adria] Granollers Museum Nat Sci, Granollers 08402, Catalonia, Spain; [Rocha, Ricardo] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Ripperger, Simon] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Ripperger, Simon] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Cambridge; Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Conenna, I (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Global Change & Conservat, POB 65,Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Conenna, I (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",irene.conenna@gmail.com,"Cabeza, Mar/ABC-4297-2020; Rocha, Ricardo/AAM-3749-2021","Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631; Rocha, Ricardo/0000-0003-2757-7347; Lopez-Baucells, Adria/0000-0001-8446-0108",Academy of Finland [257686]; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation [8-6349-18],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation,"The work was supported by the Academy of Finland (grant #257686) and by the Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation (grant #8-6349-18).

However, farming activities are overwhelmingly exposed to the detrimental impacts of drought in this region. The purpose of this paper is to establish differences in farmers' perceptions on the effects of drought on social, economic, and environmental activities between coastal lowland and inland mountain foreland regions. Our research focuses on rural farming communities residing in the towns of Chalus (coastal plain adjacent to the Caspian Sea) and Kelardasht (Alborz mountain foreland). In 2019, questionnaires were distributed to villagers, and subsequently completed by household heads. Sample size was determined using Cochran, with 384 responses per sub-region. Results obtained by statistical analyses using SPSS indicate that farmers in the coastal region perceived stronger drought impacts on food security, agriculture, economy, education, immigration, and the natural environment than those in the adjoining mountainous region. The study demonstrates how location over relatively small distance, but different in topography, distance from the coast, climate, infrastructural development, and societal factors, has profound impact of people's perceptions to, and experiences of, drought in northern Iran.","[Hesam, Mehdi] Univ Guilan, Fac Literature & Humanities, Rasht, Iran; [Roshan, Gholamreza] Golestan Univ, Dept Geog, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Grab, Stefan W.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Shabahrami, Amir Reza] Univ Guilan, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Design, Rasht, Iran",University of Guilan; University of Witwatersrand; University of Guilan,"Roshan, G (corresponding author), Golestan Univ, Dept Geog, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.",ghr.roshan@gu.ac.ir,,,,,,,54,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Changes in terrestrial and ocean carbon reservoirs have been postulated as possible drivers of this relatively large shift in atmospheric CO2, potentially providing insights into the mechanisms and sensitivity of the global carbon cycle. Here we report decadally resolved radiocarbon (C-14) levels in a network of tree-ring series spanning 1700-1950 C.E. located along the northern boundary of, and within, the Southern Ocean. We observe regional dilutions in atmospheric radiocarbon (relative to the Northern Hemisphere) associated with upwelling of (CO2)-C-14-depleted abyssal waters. We find the interhemispheric C-14 offset approaches zero during increasing global atmospheric CO2 at the end of the LIA, with reduced ventilation in the Southern Ocean and a Northern Hemisphere source of old carbon (most probably originating from deep Arctic peat layers). The coincidence of the atmospheric CO2 increase and reduction in the interhemispheric C-14 offset imply a common climate control. Possible mechanisms of synchronous change in the high latitudes of both hemispheres are discussed.","[Turney, Chris S.

The Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone large changes in the 20(th) century related to anthropogenic pressures and climate variability, which have caused ecosystem reorganization. Here, we compiled historical information and identified relationships in our dataset using multivariate statistics and modeling across 31 biotic and abiotic variables from 1925 to 2005 in the Central Baltic Sea. We identified a series of ecosystem regime shifts in the 1930s, 1970s, and at the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s. In the long term, the Central Baltic Sea showed a regime shift from a benthic to pelagic-dominated state. Historically, benthic components played a significant role in trophic transfer, while in the more recent productive system pelagic-benthic coupling was weak and pelagic components dominated. Our analysis shows that for the entire time period, productivity, climate, and hydrography mainly affected the functioning of the food web, whereas fishing became important more recently. Eutrophication had far-reaching direct and indirect impacts from a long-term perspective and changed not only the trophic state of the system but also affected higher trophic levels. Our study also suggests a switch in regulatory drivers from salinity to oxygen. The reference ecosystem identified in our analysis may guide the establishment of an ecosystem state baseline and threshold values for ecosystem state indicators of the Central Baltic Sea.","[Tomczak, Maciej T.; Mueller-Karulis, Barbel; Ehrnsten, Eva; Gustafsson, Bo; Norkko, Alf; Humborg, Christoph] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Blenckner, Thorsten] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Eero, Margit; Timmermann, Karen] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark; [Norkko, Alf] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, Helsinki, Finland; [Otto, Saskia A.] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Hamburg, Germany",Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Technical University of Denmark; University of Helsinki; University of Hamburg,"Tomczak, MT (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",maciej.tomczak@su.se,"Norkko, Alf/L-8736-2019; Gustafsson, Bo/GQH-3048-2022; Ehrnsten, Eva/GWU-7048-2022; Humborg, Christoph/C-4756-2015","Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Ehrnsten, Eva/0000-0002-8960-8252; Humborg, Christoph/0000-0002-0649-5599; Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Eero, Margit/0000-0002-1848-0597","BONUS-BLUEWEBS Blue growth boundaries in the novel Baltic food webs project; BONUS; EU; Academy of Finland; Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; National Centre for Research and Development, Poland; Swedish Research Council Formas; FORMAS; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management","BONUS-BLUEWEBS Blue growth boundaries in the novel Baltic food webs project; BONUS; EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; National Centre for Research and Development, Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management","This work was funded by the BONUS-BLUEWEBS Blue growth boundaries in the novel Baltic food webs project, which received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU, the Academy of Finland, Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany, the State Education Development Agency of Latvia, the National Centre for Research and Development, Poland, and the Swedish Research Council Formas.

The Baltic has a dense network of tide gauges (TGs), and several high-resolution regional hydrodynamic models, making it one of the best-monitored seas for mass variations of this size in the world. We investigate the performance of different GRACE gravity field solutions to recover this oceanic mass variation using in situ measurements of sea-level heights. For GRACE, we use both the standard monthly solutions as well as regional solutions to estimate the total water storage in the Baltic Sea. For the ground truth, we use sea-level measurements in the network of tide gauges around the Baltic Sea. For comparison, we have access to data from two hydrodynamic models. The water mass estimated from the constructed sea surfaces is then compared with different GRACE estimates. At present, we ignore the steric anomalies, as they are small in the Baltic Sea. We also discuss the leakage between land hydrology and the Baltic Sea in the GRACE estimates of water storage.","[Virtanen, J.; Makinen, J.; Bilker-Koivula, M.; Virtanen, H.; Nordman, M.; Kangas, A.] Finnish Geodet Inst, FI-02431 Masala, Finland",The National Land Survey of Finland; Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI),"Virtanen, J (corresponding author), Finnish Geodet Inst, FI-02431 Masala, Finland.",jenni.virtanen@fgi.fi; Jaakko.Makinen@fgi.fi; mirjam.bilker@fgi.fi; heikki.virtanen@fgi.fi; ckshum@osu.edu,"Bilker-Koivula, Mirjam/AFY-8416-2022; Wang, Lei/L-5187-2013","Bilker-Koivula, Mirjam/0000-0003-2892-6633; Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533","Academy of Finland [117094, 116426]; NASA; Ohio State University Climate, Water and Carbon program; UT/CSR; NASA/GSFC","Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Ohio State University Climate, Water and Carbon program(Ohio State University); UT/CSR; NASA/GSFC(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","Funded by the Academy of Finland (decision numbers 117094 and 116426).

Nowadays, it is threatened by environmental cues, which are either of biotic or abiotic origin. This causes tree decline, dieback, and deforestation, which can worsen in a climate change scenario. In the 21st century, biotechnology should take a pivotal role in facing this problem and proposing sustainable management and conservation strategies for forests. As a non-domesticated, long-lived species, the only plausible approach for tree breeding is exploiting the natural diversity present in this species and the selection of elite, more resilient genotypes, based on molecular markers. In this direction, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the tolerance or resistance to stresses, and the identification of genes, gene products, and metabolites related to this phenotype. This research is being performed by using classical biochemistry or the most recent omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) approaches, which should be integrated with other physiological and morphological techniques in the Systems Biology direction. This review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of such approaches for describing and integrating the latest knowledge on biotic and abiotic stress responses in Quercus spp., with special reference to Quercus ilex, the system on which the authors have been working for the last 15 years. While biotic stress factors mainly include fungi and insects such as Phytophthora cinnamomi, Cerambyx welensii, and Operophtera brumata, abiotic stress factors include salinity, drought, waterlogging, soil pollutants, cold, heat, carbon dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation. The review is structured following the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and the omic cascade, from DNA (genomics, epigenomics, and DNA-based markers) to metabolites (metabolomics), through mRNA (transcriptomics) and proteins (proteomics). An integrated view of the different approaches, challenges, and future directions is critically discussed.","[Escandon, Monica; Castillejo, Maria Angeles; Jorrin-Novo, Jesus V.; Rey, Maria-Dolores] Univ Cordoba, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Agroforestry & Plant Biochem, Prote & Syst Biol,UCO CeiA3, Cordoba 14014, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba,"Escandon, M; Rey, MD (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Agroforestry & Plant Biochem, Prote & Syst Biol,UCO CeiA3, Cordoba 14014, Spain.",bb2esmam@uco.es; bb2casam@uco.es; bf1jonoj@uco.es; b52resam@uco.es,"Castillejo, Maria Angeles/AAD-2248-2020; Escandon Martinez, Monica/V-2371-2017; Rey, Maria-Dolores/I-3931-2018; Jorrin Novo, Jesus V/L-1656-2014","Castillejo, Maria Angeles/0000-0003-2017-1029; Escandon Martinez, Monica/0000-0001-5686-106X; Rey, Maria-Dolores/0000-0002-6967-8536; Jorrin Novo, Jesus V/0000-0002-8778-3604","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [ENCINOMICS-2 PID2019-10908RB-100]; Juan de la Cierva-Formacion contract by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [FJCI-2017-31613]; Ramon y Cajal contract by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RYC-2017-23706]; Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion contract by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [IJC2018-035272]","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); Juan de la Cierva-Formacion contract by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; Ramon y Cajal contract by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion contract by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities","This work was supported by grant ENCINOMICS-2 PID2019-10908RB-100 from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities.

J,"Cherry, D",,,,"Cherry, Deborah",,,The Afterlives of Monuments,SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,afterlives; monument; memorials; modernity; replication; conservation,,"This initial essay proposes that monuments have afterlives. The study of the afterlives of monuments encompasses how, where, when and why monuments have been re-modelled, re-used, re-sited, re-made, cast aside, destroyed or abandoned to accommodate changing political and social climates; how they survive through re-invention and transformations. Afterlives accrue through material alteration and they accumulate in representation. The diverse ways in which monuments survive, it is argued, depends on definitions and listings of monuments, practices of monument-making past and present and recent debates over history and memory. The concept is proposed to capture afterlives that co-exist as well as those occur sequentially, and to suggest a model of greater complexity and plurality than a linear or quasi-biographical trajectory. Conflicts over monuments especially over their survival, it is suggested, are as much concerned with projections of a future, as with reconstructions of the past or mnemonic recollection. Monuments - ancient, modern and contemporary-have taken centre stage as different and competing South-Asian communities claim a stake in the making of national, religious, cultural and local histories and identities. In their varied afterlives, monuments emerge as extraordinarily mobile, marked by material change, put to new uses and interpretations, and travelling through image-banks, archives, collections and exhibitions. Their afterlives, like monuments themselves, are multi-media.","[Cherry, Deborah] Univ Arts London, London, England; [Cherry, Deborah] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Arts London; University of Amsterdam,"Cherry, D (corresponding author), Univ Arts London, London, England.",d.cherry@uva.nl,,,"AHRC; British Academy; Nehru Centre London; India High Commission; Amsterdam School of Analysis; University of the Arts Research Centre Transnational Art, Identity, and Nation (TrAIN)","AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); British Academy; Nehru Centre London; India High Commission; Amsterdam School of Analysis; University of the Arts Research Centre Transnational Art, Identity, and Nation (TrAIN)","The papers here were first presented at The Afterlives of Monuments conference (London, April 2010), and I warmly thank all the speakers and participants for several days of inspiring papers and productive discussions, with special thanks to the young scholars: Anisha Saxena, Sneha Raghavan, and Suryanandini Sinha Narain.

We observed one relatively fresh pond and one saline pond on the same ice floe, with similar depth. The comparison of observations and simulations indicates that thermal convection dominates in relatively fresh ponds, but conductive heat transfer dominates in salt-stratified ponds. Using a parameterized surface energy balance, we estimate that the heat flux to the ice is larger under the saline pond than the freshwater pond when averaged over the observational period. The deviation is sensitive to assumed wind, varying between 3 and 14 W/m(2) for winds from 0 to 5 m/s. If this effect persists as conditions evolve through the melt season, our results suggest that this imbalance potentially has a climatologically significant impact on sea-ice evolution. Plain Language Summary Sea ice provides key feedbacks on polar and global climate, with melt ponds being particularly significant. Melt ponds darken the ice surface, thereby increasing the absorption of sunlight and accelerating ice melt. This study provides a new perspective on melt-pond salinity, its previously unrecognized significance in controlling the thermal properties of ponds, and the potential impact on ice melting as we transition toward a younger sea ice cover. Many state-of-the-art sea ice models represent melt ponds as a freshwater layer with a surface temperature of 0 degrees C, consistent with a past Arctic ocean dominated by desalinated perennial ice and relatively fresh ponds. However, perennial ice has diminished in recent decades, with increasing prevalence of young saline ice. This leads to ponds with a wider range of salinities and temperatures. We show that salinity strongly impacts pond temperatures, using observations of adjacent freshwater and saline melt ponds on Arctic sea ice. Combining this data with model simulations, we find that melt-pond salinity impacts heat transfer to the ice below and the resulting melting rate. Our study reveals that melt-pond salinity and salt stratification are key variables influencing heat transfer in melt ponds, which need to be considered in future model development.","[Kim, Joo-Hong] Korea Polar Res Inst, Incheon, South Korea; [Moon, Woosok] Nord Inst Theoret Phys, Stockholm, Sweden; [Moon, Woosok] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wells, Andrew J.; Langton, Tom] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Wilkinson, Jeremy P.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England; [Hwang, Byongjun] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, Scotland; [Hwang, Byongjun] Univ Huddersfield, Dept Biol & Geog Sci, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Granskog, Mats A.] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway; [Jones, David W.

HEMIPTERA; UNITED-STATES; NATURAL ENEMIES; SOYBEAN APHID; BIOTYPE-B; SPECIES HYMENOPTERA,"With greater emphasis being placed on management of the risks attached to natural enemy releases for biocontrol programs and the need to justify research budgets, the efficient selection of effective natural enemies is increasingly important. Historically there has been little agreement regarding how or whether this can be accomplished. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is good correspondence between insect host-finding behavior and attack rates in well-designed laboratory studies and their performance of this behavior in the field. Success in measuring efficacy of candidate agents remains somewhat of an art due to the multitude of factors influencing efficacy, but will be improved by attention to: (1) characterization of natural enemy candidates using morphological taxonomy or genetic markers at the onset of a program, (2) climatic matching candidate agents when possible, and (3) evaluations in semi-field or field cage conditions following quarantine evaluations whenever possible before proceeding with widespread releases. The application of these principles is discussed in regard to US biocontrol programs for Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), Lygus spp., and Aphis glycines Matsumura. Proper project planning and interdisciplinary cooperation will enhance the chances for a successful project.

The approach was tested for Central Finland and Lapland with NFI field data and daily weather data from 2004 to 2008. The approach combines (1) a light use efficiency (LUE) model, (2) a process-based summary model for estimating gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP), and (3) the Yasso07 soil carbon model, which together allow the estimation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Landsat TM 5 satellite images were utilized to generalize the carbon fluxes obtained for field sample plots for all forested areas using the k-NN imputation method. The accuracy of the imputations was examined by leave-one-out cross validation and by comparing the imputed and simulated values with Eddy covariance (EC) measurements. RMSE of the k-NN imputations was slightly better in Central Finland than in Lapland, the bias staying at a similar level. Based on the EC comparisons, the approach seemed to work rather well with GPP estimates in both areas, but in the north the NEE estimates were remarkably biased. The main advantages of the approach include its applicability to basic NFI data and a high output resolution (30 m). The method proved to be a promising way to produce carbon flux estimates based on large-scale forest inventory data and could therefore be easily applied to the whole of Northern Europe. However, there are still drawbacks to the approach, such as lacking parameters for peat lands. One of the future goals is to integrate the approach with an interactive mapping framework, which could thereafter be utilized, for example, in climate change research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Both instantaneous mortality (0.76-1.05) as well as growth rate (0.41-0.82 mm day(-1)) of larval herring were amongst highest observed elsewhere previously. Mortality rates of goby larvae were also high (0.57-1.05), while first ever data on growth rates were provided in this study (0.23-0.35 mm day(-1)). Our study also evidenced that higher growth rate of marine fish larvae did not result in lower mortalities. We suggest that high growth and mortality rates primarily resulted from a rapidly increasing and high (>18 degrees C) water temperature that masked potential food-web effects. The explanation for observed patterns lies in the interactive manner temperature contributed: i) facilitating prey production, which supported high growth rate and decreased mortalities; ii) exceeding physiological thermal optimum of larvae, which resulted in decreased growth rate and generally high mortalities. Our investigation suggests that the projected climate warming may have significant effect on early life history stages of the dominating marine fish species inhabiting shallow estuaries.

Thus, there is a demand for new technical units providing ancillary services. Non-dispatchable renewable energy sources can be balanced by energy storage devices. By large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) grid efficiency and reliability as well as power quality can be increased. A further characteristic of BESSs is the ability to respond rapidly and precisely to frequency deviations, making them technical ideal candidates for primary control provision (PCP). In this paper environmental impacts of PCP by novel Li-ion BESSs are compared to impacts of PCP by state-of-the-art coal power plants (CPPs) using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and considering German control market conditions. The coal power plant stock is characterized by varying properties. Thus, different scenarios of CPP operation are analyzed by varying sensitive parameters like efficiency loss and required must-run capacity. Finally, PCP by BESSs and CPPs are compared in terms of environmental performance. The more must-run electricity generation is attributable to PCP of CPPs, the higher are the environmental impacts of these CPPs. This leads to a better relative environmental performance of BESSs in most scenarios. Contrary, comparative or even better environmental performance of CPPs compared to state-of-the-art BESSs can solely be achieved if power plants without load restrictions for provision of primary control and with extreme low efficiency losses caused by PCP are applied. Consequently, the results of this paper indicate that BESSs are a promising option to reduce environmental impacts of primary control provision. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid further biodiversity loss, area-based protection will form part of new biodiversity targets. We use a state-of-the-art global land-use model, the Land System Modular Model, to explore global and regional human health and food security outcomes under strictly enforced 30% and 50% land protection scenarios. We find protection scenarios cause additional human mortality due to diet- and weight-related changes. Low-income regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest levels of underweight-related mortality, causing an additional 200,000 deaths related to malnutrition in these regions alone. High-income regions, by contrast, are less affected by protection measures. Our results highlight that radical measures to protect areas of biodiversity value may jeopardize food security and human health in the most vulnerable regions of the world. Land conservation remains one of the biggest tools to try to maintain biodiversity targets.

Although mangrove wetlands are sources of ESs worth billions of dollars, there is a lack of modeling tools. This is reflected in our lack of understanding of mangroves' functional and structural attributes. Here, we discuss the state of the art of mangrove models used in the planning and monitoring of R/R projects during the last 30 years. The main objectives were to characterize the most frequent modeling approach, their spatiotemporal resolution, and their current utility/application in management decisions. We identified 281 studies in six broad model categories: conceptual, agent-based (ABM), process-based (PBM), spatial, statistical, and socioeconomic/management (ScoEco). The most widely used models are spatial and statistical, followed by PBM, ScoEco, and conceptual categories, while the ABMs were the least frequently used. Yet, the application of mangrove models in R/R projects since the early 1990s has been extremely limited, especially in the mechanistic model category. We discuss several approaches to help advance model development and applications, including the targeted allocation of potential revenue from global carbon markets to R/R projects using a multi-model and integrated approach.","[Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.; Zhao, Xiaochen; Xue, Zuo George] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Wang, Hongqing] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Xue, Zuo George] Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Studies Inst, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Xue, Zuo George] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Rivera-Monroy, VH (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",vhrivera@lsu.edu,,"Zhao, Xiaochen/0000-0003-1860-6273; Xue, Zuo/0000-0003-4018-0248; /0000-0003-2804-4139","US Department of the Interior South-Central Climate Adaptation Science Center (SC-CASC) [G12AC00002]; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ecosystems Mission Area; National Science Foundation (NSF) Coupled Nature and Human Systems Program [1518471]; Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacion-SENACYT/Panama (Programa de Movilidad Academica) [MOV-47-2021]","US Department of the Interior South-Central Climate Adaptation Science Center (SC-CASC); U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ecosystems Mission Area; National Science Foundation (NSF) Coupled Nature and Human Systems Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacion-SENACYT/Panama (Programa de Movilidad Academica)","This research was funded by the US Department of the Interior South-Central Climate Adaptation Science Center (SC-CASC; Cooperative Agreement Grant #G12AC00002).

The presence of a robust tuning method is essential for successful utility grid integration with the charging stations. The lack of system standardization may hamper the EV uptake as well as successful utility grid integration with the charging stations. The distributed energy resources (DER) and vehicle to grid (V2G) are going to play a vital role in the power system operation and control. The applicability of criterions within the utility grid integration with charging station area is important to the grid operators, charging service providers, manufacturers, fleet operators, and so forth to ensure safety, dependability, and interoperability. Hence, this work tries to deliver a comprehensive and systematic review of standards and best practices for utility grid interaction with charging stations. It will help the specialists of power as well as transport sectors to track down every one of the norms and best practices, which are accessible at one stage to compare different guidelines.

Some fish only spend part of their life history in the pelagic environment before returning to their adult habitat, for example, a coral reef. The sensory systems of larval fish develop rapidly during the first few days of their lives, and here we concentrate on the various sensory cues the fish have available to them for survival in the pelagic environment. We focus on the larvae of reef fishes because most is known about them. We also review the major threats caused by human activities that have been identified to have worldwide impact and evaluate how these threats may impact larval-fish survival and orientation abilities. Many human activities negatively affect larval-fish sensory systems or the cues the fish need to detect. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased numbers of larvae surviving to settlement, and, therefore, to decreased abundance of adult fishes. Although we focus on species wherein the larvae and adults occupy different habitats (pelagic and demersal, respectively), it is important to acknowledge that the potential anthropogenic effects we identify may also apply to larvae of species like tuna and herring, where both larvae and adults are pelagic.","[Siebeck, Ulrike E.; Braun, Christoph] Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [O'Connor, Jack; Leis, Jeffrey M.] Australian Museum, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [O'Connor, Jack] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Studies, Ultimo, Australia; [Leis, Jeffrey M.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Queensland; Australian Museum; University of Technology Sydney; University of Tasmania,"Siebeck, UE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",u.siebeck@uq.edu.au,"Leis, Jeffrey M/E-7502-2012; Braun, Christoph/AFO-4446-2022; Siebeck, Ulrike E/J-6190-2014","Siebeck, Ulrike E/0000-0003-2024-1568; Leis, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0603-3447",ARC [DP 110100695],ARC(Australian Research Council),"We would like to thank Prof. Jiakun Song for inviting our participation in the symposium and for supporting UES' travel to and around Shanghai, Professor Jiakun Song, Professor Art Popper and Professor Shaun Collin for co-organizing the meeting in Shanghai and stimulating the discussions on human impacts on marine organisms.

Improved interpretation of the ever-growing body of ice-core-based paleoclimate records from this region requires a deeper understanding of Antarctic meteorology. As the spatial coverage of the AWS network has expanded year to year, so has the meteorological database. Unfortunately, many of the records are relatively short ( less than 10 yr) and/or incomplete ( to varying degrees) due to the vagaries of the harsh environment. Climate downscaling work in temperate latitudes suggests that it is possible to use GCM-scale meteorological datasets (e.g., ECMWF reanalysis products) to address these problems in the AWS record and create a uniform and complete database of West Antarctic surface meteorology ( at AWS sites). Such records are highly relevant to the improved interpretation of the expanding library of snow-pit and ice-core datasets. Artificial neural network ( ANN) techniques are used to predict 6-hourly AWS surface data ( temperature, pressure) using large-scale features of the atmosphere (e.g., 500-mb geopotential height) from a region around the AWS. ANNs are trained with a calendar year of observed AWS data ( possibly incomplete) and corresponding GCM-scale data. This methodology is sufficient both for high quality predictions within the training set and for predictions outside the training set that are at least comparable to the state of the art. For example, the results presented herein for temperature prediction are approximately equal to those from a satellite-based methodology but with no exposure to problems from surface melt events or sensor changes. Similarly, the significant biases seen in ECMWF surface temperatures are absent from the predictions here, resulting in an rms error that is half as large with respect to the original AWS observations. These results support high confidence in the ANN-based predictions from the GCM-scale data for periods when AWS data are unavailable, for example, before installation. ANNs thus provide a means to expand the surface meteorological records significantly in West Antarctica.","Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, EMS Environm Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Reusch, DB (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, 517 Deike Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dbr@geosc.psu.edu,,,,,,,24,20,20,0,10,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

To report the state of the art of the main actions to manage this structural component of tropical forests, we surveyed the control strategies in the literature in the last 71 years, highlighting research goals, tree-climber interactions, management, restoration, and conservation. Dataset access is at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6678112. Associated metadata are available at https://metadata-.afs.nancy.inra.fr/geonetwork/srv/fre/catalog.search#/metadata/712ff481-.dfa2-.4ddb-.b4fa-.fcbd7 c517842 Context: Lianas (woody vines) are considered structural parasites of tropical trees because they start their development as terrestrial seedlings but need to reach a tree canopy for higher light availability. The tree-liana coexistence usually can damage tree species, thus removing lianas has been suggested as an alternative to reinforce forest regeneration. Aims: The dataset compilation begun during the first author doctoral work and a first dataset on neotropical lianas was published (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050477) in 2020. The present dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6678112) presents an update of the 2020 dataset with additional amend (published articles from 2018 to 2021) and enhanced metadata descriptions. Our aim is providing an updated database extracted from scientific literature compiling information related to the effect of lianas on tree and forest structure and diversity, and to contribute to improve decision making on forest restoration and management. Methods: We made a systematic literature review on lianas in the Neotropical region (native or restored) from 1950 to 2021. First, we selected studies on liana management and described each paper according to the following topics: vegetation status, positive (P), and negative (N) effects of lianas on each species, the species in focus, and the suggested management strategy. Results: Almost 83% of the studies pointed out tree-climber interactions as negative to trees. Cutting was the management strategy adopted in 92% of the studies. Controlled burning, enrichment, and selective cutting were adopted in only one paper. Rainy and seasonal forests were the vegetation types with more studied sites (20 and 17 respectively). Only one study suggested enhancing forest diversity through direct seeding of lianas. Four studies evaluated the impact of lianas on forest diversity and forest fauna. Conclusion: The data collected showed the different impacts of liana management on the diversity and structure of tropical forests. It can endorse environmental control and management practices and evaluate the consequences of these techniques in recovering forests or improving timber production.","[Vargas, Betania da Cunha; Cerdeira Morellato, Leonor Patricia] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP Rio Claro, Inst Biosci, Biodivers Dept, Phenol Lab, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Vargas, Betania da Cunha] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP Rio Claro, Inst Biosci, Biodivers Dept, Grad Program Plant Biol,Phenol Lab, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Grombone-Guaratini, Maria Tereza] Ctr Sustainable Uses Biodivers, Environm Res Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Estadual Paulista,"Grombone-Guaratini, MT (corresponding author), Ctr Sustainable Uses Biodivers, Environm Res Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",mgromboneguaratini@gmail.com,,,"FAPESP; Sao Paulo Research Foundation [2013/50155-0, 2010/51307-0, 2009/54208-6]; CAPES; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel [001]; CNPq [428055/20184]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; MCTIC/CNPq",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); MCTIC/CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Our research was supported by FAPESP, the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Grants #2013/50155-0 FAPESP-Microsoft Research, #2010/51307-0 FAPESPVALE-FAPEMIG and grant #2009/54208-6 EMU).

To address the issue of food security, it is essential to understand how the productivity of spring wheat varies with changes in environmental conditions and agricultural management practices. The goal of this study is to quantify the role of different environmental factors and management practices on wheat production in India in recent years (1980 to 2016). Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and climate change are identified as two major factors that represent changes in the environment. The addition of nitrogen fertilizers and irrigation practices are the two land management factors considered in this study. To study the effects of these factors on wheat growth and production, we developed crop growth processes for spring wheat in India and implemented them in the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM), a state-of-the-art land model. The model is able to simulate the observed leaf area index (LAI) at the site scale and observed production at the country scale. Numerical experiments are conducted with the model to quantify the effect of each factor on wheat production on a country scale for India. Our results show that elevated [CO2] levels, water availability through irrigation, and nitrogen fertilizers have led to an increase in annual wheat production at 0.67, 0.25, and 0.26 Mt yr(-1), respectively, averaged over the time period 1980-2016. However, elevated temperatures have reduced the total wheat production at a rate of 0.39 Mt yr(-1) during the study period. Overall, the [CO2], irrigation, fertilizers, and temperature forcings have led to 22 Mt (30 %), 8.47 Mt (12 %), 10.63 Mt (15 %), and -13 Mt (-18 %) changes in countrywide production, respectively. The magnitudes of these factors spatially vary across the country thereby affecting production at regional scales. Results show that favourable growing season temperatures, moderate to high fertilizer application, high availability of irrigation facilities, and moderate water demand make the Indo-Gangetic Plain the most productive region, while the arid north-western region is the least productive due to high temperatures and lack of irrigation facilities to meet the high water demand.","[Gahlot, Shilpa; Roy, Somnath Baidya] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi 110016, India; [Lin, Tzu-Shun; Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sehgal, Vinay K.; Dhakar, Rajkumar] Indian Agr Res Inst, Dept Agr Phys, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute,"Roy, SB (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi 110016, India.",drsbr@iitd.ac.in,"Jain, Atul/D-2851-2016","Jain, Atul/0000-0002-4051-3228; Dhakar, Rajkumar/0000-0001-6422-1142; Lin, Tzu-Shun/0000-0002-5741-8585; Baidya Roy, Somnath/0000-0002-7677-4972",,,,,43,2,2,2,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2190-4979,2190-4987,,EARTH SYST DYNAM,Earth Syst.

A previous LCIA method quantifying the potential impacts of river water consumption on fish biodiversity, using a species-discharge relationship (SDR), constituted an essential first step. This method is however limited in terms of regionalization and taxa considered, and predicts the potential risk of local species loss only. Here, we address these shortcomings by developing region-specific SDRs for Europe at various scales (continent, country, and eco-region), and including macro-invertebrate biodiversity. SDR exponents vary from 0.06 to 0.45 between regions, underlining the importance of such regionalization. Furthermore, we provide a new regionalized method which considers the location of water consumption within a river basin, by integrating the concept of longitudinal river zonation. This involves the use of a novel measure of potential loss of species richness, standardizing local species loss to an equivalent of global extinction and reflecting species vulnerability. The new method is applied in a Swiss case-study. The consideration of the location of water consumption within a basin was found to be of high importance in the assessment: potential species loss varied between 4.22 x 10(-3) and 3.95 x 10(-1) species (2 orders of magnitude) depending on location. This work thus provides enhancements in the assessment of potential impacts of river water consumption on aquatic biodiversity and contributes to the ecological relevance of the method.","[Tendall, Danielle M.; Gaillard, Gerard] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tendall, Danielle M.; Hellweg, Stefanie; Pfister, Stephan] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Huijbregts, Mark A.

In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.","[Marchant, Rob;

Green public areas contribute to mitigation and adaptation strategies for addressing climate changes, but their maintenance has a significant cost. Frequent grass cutting operations must be carried out during growing periods to ensure the safe livability of UOS to citizens. In the present paper, a geo database was developed to map green public areas of the city of Latina (Lazio Region, Central Italy) by using a multisource dataset according to the European INSPIRE Directive. The GreenCAL Tool was implemented. Two algorithms to determine UOS extension and the necessary budget for grass cutting operations are used, considering the contribution of different mowing (i.e., mulcher, lawnmower, or brush cutter) and UOS extension itself (similar to 160 ha). The implemented processing chain allowed us to simulate forestation of abandoned areas and potential CO2 sequestration values. Two different scenarios of maintenance programs were also implemented to reduce more than 60% of operational cost according to: (1) different use of UOS; (2) their position within the urban area; (3) guidelines of Italian working group on public green management; and (4) management of vegetal residues. The management of the latter, derived by mowing, contribute to more than 23% of the budget allocated to maintain UOS. Besides the long-term environmental and health perspective, the short-term impact of the present applied research is relevant for a geomatic approach, green public procurements, as well as land use and climate interactions. The alternative management of UOS discussed in the present paper can also reduce organic waste production if the mowing within the UOS is managed as a resource for agriculture rather than urban waste.","[Cappucci, Sergio] Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainable Dev EN, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Nappi, Serena] Via Andorra 9, I-04100 Latina, Italy; [Cappelli, Andrea] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Chem Engn Mat Environm, Via Eudossiana 18, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Cappucci, S (corresponding author), Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainable Dev EN, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy.",sergio.cappucci@enea.it; serena.nappi.lt@gmail.com; andrea.cappelli@uniroma1.it,"CAPPELLI, ANDREA/HFZ-8129-2022","CAPPELLI, Andrea/0000-0001-9336-7335; cappucci, sergio/0000-0002-8864-1421",Ministry of Ecological Transition [RIN-DEC-2018-0000155]; Italian Phosphorous Platform,Ministry of Ecological Transition; Italian Phosphorous Platform,"This research received financial support from the Italian Phosphorous Platform (https://www.piattaformaitalianafosforo.it/accessed on 25 May 2022) managed by ENEA and funded by Ministry of Ecological Transition (Law n 205 of 27 December 2017, art. 1, c 122 and Decree RIN-DEC-2018-0000155 del 13/11/2018, art. 2, c. 2).",,81,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUN,2022,6,,,,,,886,10.3390/land11060886,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11060886,,,25,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2K1XQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000816137500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since there exist expectations about their use in geophysics, this work will provide a brief overview on the various developing quantum technologies and their individual state of the art for implementing quantum magnetometers. As one example, the developments on superconducting quantum interference devices, so-called SQUIDs as a specific implementation of a quantum magnetometer, are presented. In the course of this, SQUID instrument implementations and associated demonstrations and case studies will be presented. An airborne vector magnetometer with ultra-low noise (<10fT/Hz will be introduced which has the prospect to be applied for the magnetic method in parallel with electromagnetic methods such as passive audio-frequency magnetics or semi-airborne methods using active transmitters such as elongated grounded dipole sources. The according signals are separated in the frequency domain. A second implementation is an airborne full tensor gradiometer instrument will be discussed which has shown already a number of successful case studies and which turned into commercial operation in the past years. Besides the airborne instrument, a very successful implementation of quantum magnetometers is the SQUID-based receiver for the ground-based transient electromagnetic method. Today it is a mature technology which has been in commercial use for more than a decade and has led to a number of discoveries of conductive ore bodies.

Measurements cover the downward solar and thermal infrared radiation using instruments according to Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) standards. A unique feature of ARAD is its vertical dimension of five stations, covering an altitude range between about 200ma.s.l (Vienna) and 3100ma.s.l. (BSRN site Sonnblick). The paper outlines the aims and scopes of ARAD, its measurement and calibration standards, methods, strategies and station locations. ARAD network operation uses innovative data processing for quality assurance and quality control, utilizing manual and automated control algorithms. A combined uncertainty estimate for the broadband shortwave radiation fluxes at all five ARAD stations, using the methodology specified by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement indicates that relative accuracies range from 1.5 to 2.9% for large signals (global, direct: 1000 W m(-2), diffuse: 500W m(-2)) and from 1.7 to 23% (or 0.9 to 11.5 W m(-2)) for small signals (50 W m(-2)) (expanded uncertainties corresponding to the 95% confidence level). If the directional response error of the pyranometers and the temperature response of the instruments and the data acquisition system (DAQ) are corrected, this expanded uncertainty reduces to 1.4 to 2.8% for large signals and to 1.7 to 5.2% (or 0.9-2.6 W m(-2)) for small signals. Thus, for large signals of global and diffuse radiation, BSRN target accuracies are met or nearly met (missed by less than 0.2 percentage points, pps) for 70% of the ARAD measurements after this correction. For small signals of direct radiation, BSRN targets are achieved at two sites and nearly met (also missed by less than 0.2 pps) at the other sites. For small signals of global and diffuse radiation, targets are achieved at all stations. Additional accuracy gains can be achieved in the future through additional measurements, corrections and a further upgrade of the DAQ. However, to improve the accuracy of measurements of direct solar radiation, improved instrument accuracy is needed. ARAD could serve as a useful example for establishing state-of-the-art radiation monitoring at the national level with a multiple-purpose approach. Instrumentation, guidelines and tools (such as the data quality control) developed within ARAD are intended to increase monitoring capabilities of global radiation and thus designed to allow straightforward adoption in other regions, without high development costs.","[Olefs, Marc; Geyer, Florian] ZAMG Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Vienna, Austria; [Baumgartner, Dietmar J.] Graz Univ, Kanzelhohe Observ Solar & Environm Res, Graz, Austria; [Obleitner, Friedrich] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Bichler, Christoph; Foelsche, Ulrich; Pietsch, Helga; Rieder, Harald E.] Graz Univ, IGAM, IP, Graz, Austria; [Bichler, Christoph; Foelsche, Ulrich; Rieder, Harald E.] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria; [Rieder, Harald E.; Schoener, Wolfgang] Austrian Polar Res Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Weihs, Philipp] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Meteorol, Vienna, Austria; [Haiden, Thomas] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Schoener, Wolfgang] Graz Univ, Inst Geog & Reg Res, Graz, Austria","University of Graz; University of Innsbruck; University of Graz; University of Graz; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Graz","Olefs, M (corresponding author), ZAMG Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Vienna, Austria.",marc.olefs@zamg.ac.at,"Philipp, Weihs/AAF-9027-2019; Foelsche, Ulrich/AAK-6102-2020; Sch√∂ner, Wolfgang/AAW-8026-2020; Rieder, Harald/Y-8951-2019; Obleitner, Friedrich/H-2657-2012","Philipp, Weihs/0000-0001-7452-0330; Foelsche, Ulrich/0000-0002-9899-6453; Sch√∂ner, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6546-0639; Rieder, Harald/0000-0003-2705-0801; Olefs, Marc/0000-0002-5813-236X; Obleitner, Friedrich/0000-0001-8520-8684","Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy","Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy","The ARAD project is financed in part by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy.

Our work shows the value of multi-scalar geoarchaeological study when excavating and re-excavating rockshelters in a highly dynamic sedimentary environment where erosion is prominent. Here we present our work on Kisese II rockshelter, Tanzania, originally excavated in the 1950s and largely unpublished, that preserves an important Pleistocene-Holocene archaeological record integral to understanding the deep history of the Kondoa Rock-Art World Heritage Center. Unlike rockshelters in quiescent tectonic settings, like much of central Europe or South Africa, Kisese II exists in highly dynamic sedimentary environments associated with the active tectonics of the Great Rift Valley system exacerbated by human-induced environmental and climate change. We report on our 2017 and 2019 exploratory research that includes integrated regional-, landscape-, and site-scale geoarchaeological analyses of past and present sedimentary regimes and micromorphological analyses of the archaeological sediments. Historical records and aerial photographs document extensive changes in vegetation cover and erosional regimes since the 1920s, with drastic changes quantified between 1960 and 2019. Field survey points to an increased erosion rate between 2017 and 2019. To serve future archaeologists, heritage specialists, and local populations we combine our data in a geoarchaeological catena that includes soil, vegetation, fauna, and anthropogenic features on the landscape. At the site, micromorphological coupled with chronological analyses demonstrate the preservation of in situ Pleistocene deposits. Comparison of photographs from the 1956 and 2019 excavations show a maximum sediment loss of 68 cm in 63 years or >10% of >6-m-thick sedimentary deposit. In the studied area of the rockshelter we estimate ~1 cm/yr of erosion, suggesting the ongoing removal of much of the higher archaeological sediments which, based on the coarse stratigraphic controls and chronology of the original Inskeep excavations, would suggest the loss of much of the archaeological record of the last ~4000 years. These multi-scalar data are essential for the construction of appropriate mitigation strategies and further study of the remaining stratigraphy.","[Patania, Ilaria] Univ Haifa, Zinman Inst Archaeol, Haifa, Israel; [Patania, Ilaria] Univ Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, Haifa, Israel; [Porter, Samantha T.] Univ Minnesota, Liberal Arts Technol & Innovat Serv, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Keegan, William F.; Skosey-Lalonde, Elena; Tryon, Christian A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Anthropol, Storrs, CT USA; [Keegan, William F.] Heritage Consultants LLC, Newington, CT USA; [Dihogo, Rukia; Frank, Sara] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Hist & Archaeol Dept, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Lewis, Jason] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY USA; [Lewis, Jason] SUNY Stony Brook, Turkana Basin Inst, New York, NY USA; [Mashaka, Husna] Univ Nairobi, Dept Hist & Archaeol, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ogutu, Julius] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Geog & Hist, Madrid, Spain; [Skosey-Lalonde, Elena] Univ Algarve, Interdisciplinary Ctr Archaeol & Evolut Human Beh, Faro, Portugal; [Tryon, Christian A.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Human Origins Program, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Niespolo, Elizabeth M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Niespolo, Elizabeth M.] Berkeley Geochronol Ctr, Berkeley, CA USA; [Colarossi, Debra] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, Leipzig, Germany; [Colarossi, Debra] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Wales; [Ranhorn, Kathryn L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Ranhorn, Kathryn L.] Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Haifa; University of Haifa; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Connecticut; University of Dar es Salaam; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Nairobi; Complutense University of Madrid; Universidade do Algarve; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Berkeley Geochronolgy Center; Max Planck Society; Aberystwyth University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Patania, I (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Zinman Inst Archaeol, Haifa, Israel.;Patania, I (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, Haifa, Israel.",ilariapat@gmail.com,,"Porter, Samantha/0000-0003-1064-307X; Colarossi, Debra/0000-0002-3704-8249",Graduate Women in Science; American School of Prehistoric Research; Leakey Foundation;  [IMSL-IR-171675],Graduate Women in Science; American School of Prehistoric Research; Leakey Foundation; ,"& nbsp;Funding for excavation and analyses of Kisese II was provided by Graduate Women in Science (with support from Adele Lewis, Nell Mondy, and Eloise Gerry), the American School of Prehistoric Research, and the Leakey Foundation.",,71,0,0,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Until now, no information is given about the light output of any TBPs and the question Are the TBPs capable of producing the necessary lighting levels for exterior lighting? is unanswered. For this reason, a new methodology is proposed for selecting and analyzing the lighting output potential of transgenic plants ted for specific climatic conditions. This methodology considers growth and reduction factors, as well as a formulae for estimating the plants' luminous output by performing light measurements. Results show that transgenic plants in medium growth can emit a median luminous flux of up to 57 lm, a value that can definitely support low lighting requirements when used in large numbers of plants. From the lighting measurements and calculations performed in this research, the light output of the TBPs for a typical road with 5m width was found equal to 2lx. The amount of plants required was 40 at each side of the road for every 30m of streets with P6 road class. The results show that the use of bioluminescent plants can actually contribute to the reduction of energy consumption, concerning only the lighting criterium, thus creating an enormous opportunity for a new state-of- the-art market and research that could potentially minimize CO2 emissions and light pollution, improve urban and suburban microclimate, mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as provide an alternative means of lighting affecting both outdoor lighting design and landscape planning in suburban and urban settings. Moreover, further research should be applied considering also other possible ecological impacts before applying TBPs for exterior lighting applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, because of the relatively dry environment in the central North Pacific, nonlinear responses of moisture process including latent heat flux and low-level atmosphere moisture advection induce asymmetric diabatic heating (Q(d)): in WSST, Q(d) tends to increase in the middle-lower troposphere but decrease in the middle-upper level, whereas it always increases in the whole troposphere in CSST. Thus, Q(d) has the same low-level positive vertical gradient in both CSST and WSST, which produces similar atmospheric circulation anomalies in the lower troposphere. In turn, the asymmetric responses of low-level temperature advection further modify air temperature meridional gradient as well as atmospheric baroclinicity in the lower troposphere, significantly shifting the transient eddy activities southward in CSST and greatly weakening their intensity in WSST, respectively. Accordingly, the transient eddy vorticity forcing primarily determines the upper-level atmospheric responses in CSST, but it has unsystematic effects in WSST that are overtaken by Q(d). Therefore, the dominance of diabatic heating in WSST and transient eddy forcing in CSST over the central North Pacific lead to the asymmetric atmospheric responses among which the asymmetry of moisture plays an essential role.","[Tao, Lingfeng; Sun, Xuguang; Yang, Xiu-Qun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Inst Climate & Global Change Res, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Sun, XG; Yang, XQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Inst Climate & Global Change Res, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xgsun@nju.edu.cn; xqyang@nju.edu.cn,"Yang, Michael/G-9716-2013; Sun, Xuguang/A-7998-2012","Yang, Michael/0000-0003-3716-9152; Tao, Lingfeng/0000-0002-5607-9956; Sun, Xuguang/0000-0002-7960-0425","Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41621005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775074, 41330420]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505803]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University",Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University,"This work was jointly funded by the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41621005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41775074 and 41330420), the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1505803), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University.

Among the factors that affect the environmental suitability, the LAI is important, with an increase in the LAI generally being advantageous.

The results show that the aspect ratios of streets can directly affect their thermal environment. With the aspect ratio increases, the air temperature decreases and the wind speed increases. At the same time, facade openings can make the average globe temperature significantly increased in the streets.

Seasonal forecasting is a promising tool to help mitigate these impacts on society. Previous studies have highlighted some predictive capacity of seasonal forecast systems for specific strong heatwaves such as those of 2003 and 2010. To our knowledge, this study is thus the first of its kind to systematically assess the prediction skill of heatwaves over Europe in a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast system. One major prerequisite to do so is to appropriately define heatwaves. Existing heatwave indices, built to measure heatwave duration and severity, are often designed for specific impacts and thus have limited robustness for an analysis of heatwave variability. In this study, we investigate the seasonal prediction skill of European summer heatwaves in the ECMWF System 5 operational forecast system by means of several dedicated metrics, as well as its added-value compared to a simple statistical model based on the linear trend. We are able to show, for the first time, that seasonal forecasts initialized in early May can provide potentially useful information of summer heatwave propensity, which is the tendency of a season to be predisposed to the occurrence of heatwaves.","[Prodhomme, Chloe; Ardilouze, Constantin; Batte, Lauriane; Guemas, Virginie] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Mete France, CNRM,UMR3589, Toulouse, France; [Prodhomme, Chloe; Garcia-Serrano, Javier] Univ Barcelona UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Prodhomme, Chloe; White, Rachel H.] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain; [Materia, Stefano] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, CSP Div, Bologna, Italy; [White, Rachel H.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Fragkoulidis, Georgios] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Toulouse; University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); University of British Columbia; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Prodhomme, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Mete France, CNRM,UMR3589, Toulouse, France.;Prodhomme, C (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain.;Prodhomme, C (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain.",chloe.prodhomme@meteo.fr,"Garc√≠a-Serrano, Javier/I-5058-2015; Fragkoulidis, Georgios/P-7550-2014","Garc√≠a-Serrano, Javier/0000-0003-3913-0876; Fragkoulidis, Georgios/0000-0002-1767-4189; MATERIA, Stefano/0000-0001-5635-2847; Batte, Lauriane/0000-0002-7903-9762",Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union [690462]; Spanish Juan de la Cierva program [IJCI-2016-30802]; Ramon y Cajal program [RYC-2016-21181]; European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant [797961],Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union; Spanish Juan de la Cierva program(Spanish Government); Ramon y Cajal program(Spanish Government); European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant,"This work is a contribution to the HyMeX program through the project ERA4CS-MEDSCOPE, co-funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Program of the European Union (Grant agreement 690462).

The long-term relationship between dust and Atlantic TC activity shows that dust aerosols are negatively associated with hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin, especially with the major hurricanes in the western Atlantic region. Numerical simulations with the WRF for specific cases during the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA) experiment show that, when vertical temperature and humidity profiles from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) were assimilated into the model, detailed features of the warm and dry SAL, including the entrainment of dry air wrapping around the developing vortex, are well simulated. Active tropical disturbances are found along the southern edge of the SAL. The simulations show an example where the dry and warm air of the SAL intruded into the core of a developing cyclone, suppressing convection and causing a spin down of the vortical circulation. The cyclone eventually weakened. To separate the contributions from the warm temperature and dry air associated with the SAL, two additional simulations were performed, one assimilating only AIRS temperature information (AIRST) and one assimilating only AIRS humidity information (AIRSH) while keeping all other conditions the same. The AIRST experiments show almost the same simulations as the full AIRS assimilation experiments, whereas the AIRSH is close to the non-AIRS simulation. This is likely due to the thermal structure of the SAL leading to low-level temperature inversion and increased stability and vertical wind shear. These analyses suggest that dry air entrainment and the enhanced vertical wind shear may play the direct roles in leading to the TC suppression. On the other hand, the warm SAL temperature may play the indirect effects by enhancing vertical wind shear; increasing evaporative cooling; and initiating mesoscale downdrafts, which bring dry air from the upper troposphere to the lower levels.","[Sun, Donglian; Boybeyi, Zafer; Yang, Chaiwei; Yang, Ruixin] George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Lau, W.

Citizens' spatial and activity preferences during heat stress conditions are under investigation in this paper. Citizens' outdoor activity choices in different thermal environments were surveyed in Adelaide from September 2013 to April 2014. The post-activity questionnaire survey of outdoor activities in Adelaide indicates that necessary, optional and social activities decreased during outdoor heat stress more than any other thermal conditions. Outdoor activities were chosen the most in neutral and warm thermal environments. Outdoor activity choices were affected significantly by the urban microclimate parameter of solar radiation. Tree canopy, shading ( from buildings or temporary elements) and water features were the most attractive public space features for outdoor participants during heat stress conditions in Adelaide. Meanwhile, essential shopping and dining facilities and social events affect citizens' outdoor activity choices during heat stress conditions. Thus, increased green infrastructures and supportive land uses are a prerequisite of urban transformation towards high-performance built environment in the context of climate change.

CO2 storage is the last step in the CCS chain and can be implemented mainly through oceanic and underground geological sequestration, and mineral carbonation. This review paper aims to provide state-of-the-art developments in CO2 storage. The review initially discussed the potential options for CO2 storage by highlighting the present status, current challenges and uncertainties associated with further deployment of established approaches (such as storage in saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs) and feasibility demonstration of relatively newer storage concepts (such as hydrate storage and CO2-based enhanced geothermal systems). The second part of the review outlined the critical criteria that are necessary for storage site selection, including geological, geothermal, geohazards, hydrodynamic, basin maturity, and economic, societal and environmental factors. In the third section, the focus was on identification of CO2 behaviour within the reservoir during and after injection, namely injection-induced seismicity, potential leakage pathways, and long-term containment complexities associated with CO2-brine-rock interaction. In addition, a detailed review on storage capacity estimation methods based on different geological media and trapping mechanisms was provided. Finally, an overview of major CO2 storage projects, including their overall outcomes, were outlined. This review indicates that although CO2 storage is a technically proven strategy, the discussed challenges need to be addressed in order to accelerate the deployment of the technology. In addition, beside the necessity of techno-economic aspects, public acceptance of CO2 storage plays a central role in technology deployment, and the current ethical mechanisms need to be further improved.","[Aminu, Mohammed D.; Nabavi, Seyed Ali; Manovic, Vasilije] Cranfield Univ, Combust Carbon Capture & Storage Ctr, Bedford MK43 OAL, Beds, England; [Rochelle, Christopher A.] British Geol Survey, Environm Sci Ctr, Nicker Hill, Keyworth, Notts, England",Cranfield University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Geological Survey,"Manovic, V (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Combust Carbon Capture & Storage Ctr, Bedford MK43 OAL, Beds, England.",v.manovic@cranfield.ac.uk,"Aminu, Mohammed D./AAF-4516-2021","Aminu, Mohammed/0000-0003-1649-081X; Nabavi, Seyed Ali/0000-0002-3346-0754; Manovic, Vasilije/0000-0002-8377-7717","Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria [PTDF/E/OSS/PHD/AMD/724/14]; Natural Environment Research Council [bgs05017] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [bgs05017] Funding Source: UKRI","Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","Mohammed D.

Toba, Sumatra, 75,000 y ago, which produced voluminous ash deposits found across much of the Indian Ocean, Indian Peninsula, and South China Sea. A major climatic downturn observed within the Greenland ice cores has been attributed to the cooling effects of the ash and aerosols ejected during the eruption of the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT). These events coincided roughly with a hypothesized human genetic bottleneck, when the number of our species in Africa may have been reduced to near extinction. Some have speculated that the demise of early modern humans at that time was due in part to a dramatic climate shift triggered by the supereruption. Others have argued that environmental conditions would not have been so severe to have such an impact on our ancestors, and furthermore, that modern humans may have already expanded beyond Africa by this time. We report an observation of the YTT in Africa, recovered as a cryptotephra layer in Lake Malawi sediments, > 7,000 km west of the source volcano. The YTT isochron provides an accurate and precise age estimate for the Lake Malawi paleoclimate record, which revises the chronology of past climatic events in East Africa. The YTT in Lake Malawi is not accompanied by a major change in sediment composition or evidence for substantial temperature change, implying that the eruption did not significantly impact the climate of East Africa and was not the cause of a human genetic bottleneck at that time.","[Lane, Christine S.] Univ Oxford, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3QJ, England; [Chorn, Ben T.; Johnson, Thomas C.] Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Chorn, Ben T.; Johnson, Thomas C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol Sci, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",University of Oxford; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Lane, CS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Archaeol & Hist Art Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3QJ, England.",Christine.Lane@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Lane, Christine S/G-7998-2015","Lane, Christine/0000-0001-9206-3903",National Science Foundation [EAR 0902714]; Leverhulme Trust,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"We thank V.

This omission has potentially prevented forest hydrologists from effectively identifying critical research topics and collaborating with policymakers, practitioners, and researchers in related fields to assist policymaking. To remedy this omission, the current study elaborates why models were needed in the first place and how models were developed historically. Models were developed to overcome limitations of traditional meta-analyses of measurement studies (i.e., inability to explain between-site variations in evapotranspiration changes with forest management) that had been recognized since the 1960s. With the improvement of the understandings about evapotranspiration processes, forest hydrologists proposed models that could predict changes in evapotranspiration with forest management around 1990. Among the models proposed around 1990, models for large scales were widely used for practical purposes (e.g., assessing the impact of large-scale deforestation on the continental and global water cycle). However, models for small scales were not widely used for assessing the impacts of forest management on water resources and other practical purposes. One major reason for this was that models for small scales proposed around 1990 were primarily designed as research tools. To improve practical applicability, forest hydrologists then started developing simple, practical models for small scales that focused on applications to a particular area, species, and purpose around 2000. Considering the necessity of human society to adapt to emerging environmental challenges within a limited time frame, we conclude that the primary role of forest hydrologists in this era is to quickly detect emerging environmental challenges and then develop practical models for connecting different stakeholders for collective decision-making. This paper also suggests that the use of practical models can be a starting point to rearticulate the role of forest hydrologists in policymaking.","[Komatsu, Hikaru] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Komatsu, Hikaru] Minist Educ Youth & Sport, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Kume, Tomonori] Kyushu Univ, Shiiba Res Forest, Miyazaki 7610312, Japan",Kyoto University; Kyushu University,"Komatsu, H (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.",kmthkr@gmail.com,,,"Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Enhancement of Societal Resiliency Against Natural Disasters (Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST)","Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Enhancement of Societal Resiliency Against Natural Disasters (Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST)","This work was supported by Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Enhancement of Societal Resiliency Against Natural Disasters (funding agency: Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST).",,288,12,12,6,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

The transition to the Neolithic in Arabia occurred during this period of climatic amelioration. Various forms of stone structures are abundant in northern Arabia, and it has been speculated that some of these dated to the Neolithic, but there has been little research on their character and chronology. Here we report a study of 104 'mustatil' stone structures from the southern margins of the Nefud Desert in northern Arabia. We provide the first chronometric age estimate for this type of structure - a radiocarbon date of ca. 5000 BC - and describe their landscape positions, architecture and associated material culture and faunal remains. The structure we have dated is the oldest large-scale stone structure known from the Arabian Peninsula. The mustatil phenomenon represents a remarkable development of monumental architecture, as hundreds of these structures were built in northwest Arabia. This 'monumental landscape' represents one of the earliest large-scale forms of monumental stone structure construction anywhere in the world. Further research is needed to understand the function of these structures, but we hypothesise that they were related to rituals in the context of the adoption of pastoralism and resulting territoriality in the challenging environments of northern Arabia.","[Groucutt, Huw S.; Stewart, Mathew] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Extreme Events Res Grp, Hans Knoll Str 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Groucutt, Huw S.; Guagnin, Maria; Stewart, Mathew; Petraglia, Michael D.] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany; [Groucutt, Huw S.; Stewart, Mathew] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Breeze, Paul S.; Drake, Nick] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Shipton, Ceri] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Shipton, Ceri] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London, England; [Zahrani, Badr; Al Omarfi, Abdulaziz] Minist Tourism Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Alsharekh, Abdullah M.] King Saudi Univ, Coll Tourism & Archaeol, Dept Archaeol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Petraglia, Michael D.] Smithsonian Inst, Human Origins Program, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Petraglia, Michael D.] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; University of London; King's College London; Australian National University; University of London; University College London; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; University of Queensland,"Groucutt, HS (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Extreme Events Res Grp, Hans Knoll Str 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",hgroucutt@ice.mpg.de,"Groucutt, Huw/GNM-5500-2022; Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021","Guagnin, Maria/0000-0002-7995-8611; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727",Max Planck Society; European Research Council [295719]; Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2019-538]; King Saud University [RSP-2019/126]; Saudi Ministry of Tourism,Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); King Saud University(King Saud University); Saudi Ministry of Tourism,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work was supported by the Max Planck Society, the European Research Council [295719], the Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2019-538], The Researchers Supporting Project of King Saud University [RSP-2019/126], and the Saudi Ministry of Tourism.",,81,16,16,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,DEC,2020,12,,,,1767,1779,9.60E+14,10.1177/0959683620950449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620950449,,20-Aug,13,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Physical Geography; Geology,OC8NK,33132543,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000560413700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Habitat hindcasts for 24 western North American tree species were validated against 931 palaeoecological records from 6000, 11000, 14000, 16000 and 21000 yr before present. In addition, we evaluate regional extrapolations based on geographic splits of >55000 sample plots. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated excellent predictive accuracy for cross-validations (median AUC of 0.90) and fair accuracy for independent regional and palaeoecological validations (0.78 and 0.75). Surprisingly, we found little evidence for over-parameterisation in any method. Also, given high correlations found between model accuracies in non-independent and independent evaluations, we conclude that non-independent evaluations are effective model selection tools. Ecosystem-based modelling approaches performed below average with respect to model sensitivity but excelled in specificity statistics and robustness against extrapolations far beyond training data, suggesting that they are well suited to reconstruct historical biogeographies and glacial refugia.","[Roberts, David R.; Hamann, Andreas] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Roberts, DR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",drr3@ualberta.ca,,"Hamann, Andreas/0000-0003-2046-4550; Roberts, David/0000-0002-3437-2422",NSERC through Government of Canada [RGPIN-330527-07]; Alberta Ingenuity through Government of Alberta [200500661],NSERC through Government of Canada; Alberta Ingenuity through Government of Alberta,"We kindly thank the custodians of the extensive data we have used, in particular Art Dyke for making his fossil and pollen databases available to us.

Excavation of the Malarrak 1 rockshelter and analysis of its sediments revealed many impacts on site formation processes within the deposit. We attribute the disturbance to possible erosion or sediment deposition during periods of intense rainfall and also to the construction of timber structures within the site. This is supported by modern and historical observations and is the focus of this paper. The extent of the disturbance to Malarrak 1 provides a cautionary tale for other excavations in the region that may be affected by similar Indigenous site occupation, as these anthropogenic activities enhance the risk of further impacts arising from biological and geomorphological processes that can impinge on the stratigraphic integrity of the cultural deposits.","[Wesley, Daryl; Moffat, Ian] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Dept Archaeol, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Litster, Mirani; O'Connor, Sue] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Sch Culture Hist & Language, Dept Archaeol & Nat Hist, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [O'Connor, Sue] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Australian National University; Australian National University,"Wesley, D (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Dept Archaeol, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",daryl.wesley@flinders.edu.au,"Litster, Mirani/AAL-5581-2021; CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019; Litster, Mirani/AAL-6537-2021","Litster, Mirani/0000-0002-0843-1628; Wesley, Daryl/0000-0002-3537-5668; Moffat, Ian/0000-0002-2171-7145","Australian Research Council [LP0882985, DE170101447, DP160100703]; Linkage Partners Bushfires Council NT; Department of Sustainability, Environment Heritage and Water","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Linkage Partners Bushfires Council NT; Department of Sustainability, Environment Heritage and Water","This work was funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage Project program [LP0882985] with contributions from the Linkage Partners Bushfires Council NT and the Department of Sustainability, Environment Heritage and Water.

The microspheres are macroscopic in the bulk particle size (several hundreds to more than 1000 mu m), but they are actually composed of P25 nanoparticles as the building units. Although it is simple in the assembly of P25 nanoparticles, the structure of the as-prepared TiO2 microspheres becomes unique because a hierarchical porosity composed of macropores, larger mesopores (ca. 12.4 nm), and smaller mesopores (ca. 2.3 nm) has been developed. The interconnected macropores and larger mesopores can be utilized as fast paths for mass transport. In addition, this hierarchical nanostructure may also contribute to some extent to the enhanced photocatalytic activity due to increased multilight reflection/scattering. Compared with the state-of-the-art photocatalyst, commercial Degussa P25 TiO2, the as-prepared TiO2 microsphere catalyst has demonstrated significant enhancement in photodriven conversion of CO2 into the end product CH4. Further enhancement in photodriven conversion of CO2 into CH4 can be easily achieved by the incorporation of metals such as Pt. The preliminary experiments with Pt loading reveal that there is still much potential for considerable improvement in TiO2 microsphere based photocatalysts. Most interestingly and significantly, the synthesis strategy is simple and large quantity of TiO2 microspheres (i.e., several hundred grams) can be easily prepared at one time in the lab, which makes large-scale industrial synthesis of TiO2 microspheres feasible and less expensive.","[Fang, Baizeng; Bonakdarpour, Arman; Reilly, Kevin; Xing, Yalan; Taghipour, Fariborz; Wilkinson, David P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Fang, Baizeng; Bonakdarpour, Arman; Reilly, Kevin; Xing, Yalan; Taghipour, Fariborz; Wilkinson, David P.] Clean Energy Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Wilkinson, DP (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, 2360 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",dwilkinson@chbe.ubc.ca,"Fang, Baizeng/AAH-7462-2019; Fang, Baizeng/GPX-8156-2022; Bonakdarpour, Arman/I-7625-2018","Fang, Baizeng/0000-0001-5855-7766; Xing, Yalan/0000-0002-0775-7386",Carbon Management Canada (CMC) [B222]; Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS),Carbon Management Canada (CMC); Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS),"The authors would like to thank Carbon Management Canada (CMC project B222) and the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS) for financial support, and to thank Dr. Alfred Lam and Greg Afonso for help with designing and fabricating the reactors.",,66,130,131,1,203,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

The as-prepared hollow spherical TiO2 nanoparticles possess unique structural characteristics, namely, large surface area and a hierarchical nanoarchitecture composed of a hollow macroporous core connected with large mesopores in the shell. The large surface area provides a great number of surface active sites for the reactant adsorption and reaction whereas the hierarchical nanoarchitecture enables fast mass transport of reactant and product molecules within the porous framework. In addition, the hollow macroporous core-mesoporous shell nanostructure favors multilight scattering/reflection, resulting in enhanced harvesting of exciting light.

However, it is noticeable that even after decades of invasion process in Europe, the vector mosquito has not yet been established in all its environmentally suitable areas. Natural barriers and human-mediated transport play a role, but the potential of wind speed to explain Ae. albopictus' absences and its inability to establish in its suitable areas are largely unknown. This study therefore evaluates the potential of wind speed as an explanatory parameter of the non-occurrence of Ae. albopictus. We developed a global ecological niche model with relevant environmental parameters including wind speed and projected it to current climatic conditions in Europe. Differences in average wind speed between areas of occurrence and non-occurrence of Ae. albopictus within its modeled suitable areas were tested for significance. A second global ecological niche model was trained with the same species records and environmental parameters, excluding windspeed parameters. Using multiple linear regression analyses and a test of average marginal effect, the effect of increasing wind speed on the average marginal effect of temperature and precipitation on the projected habitat suitability was estimated. We found that climatically suitable and monitored areas where Ae. albopictus is not established (3.12 ms-1 +/- 0.04 SD) have significantly higher wind speed than areas where the species is already established (2.54 ms-1 +/- 0.04 SD). Among temperature-related bioclimatic variables, the annual mean temperature was the most important variable contributing to the performance of both global models. Wind speed has a negative effect on the predicted habitat suitability of Ae. albopictus and reduces false-positive rates in model predictions. With increasing wind speed, the average marginal effect of annual mean temperatures decreases but that of the annual precipitation increases. Wind speed should be considered in future modeling efforts aimed at limiting the spread and dispersal of Ae. albopictus and in the implementation of surveillance and early warning systems. Local-scale data collected from fieldwork or laboratory experiments will help improve the state of the art on how wind speed influences the distribution, flight, and dispersal activity of the mosquito.","[Adeleke, Emmanuel Damilare; Shittu, Ridwan Adeyemi; Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Thomas, Stephanie Margarete] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Bayreuth, Germany; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Thomas, Stephanie Margarete] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth,"Thomas, SM (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Bayreuth, Germany.;Thomas, SM (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany.",stephanie.thomas@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Shittu, Ridwan Adeyemi/0000-0002-8456-8079",,,,,74,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

In this study, the application of the PMV model in Qatar with dry, subtropical desert climate is evaluated. An experiment was conducted in an office building in Doha, Qatar to reveal the occupant perception of indoor thermal comfort. Using collected data, the PMV indexes were calculated using Fanger's theory and compared with the Actual Thermal Sensation (ATS) of the occupants to assess the applicability of the PMV model to predict the indoor thermal comfort in air conditioned buildings in the climate zone of Qatar.

Historically, Black Greek-letter organizations (BGLOs) were created in the early twentieth century in response to the racism Black students experienced on college campuses. While previous literature provides evidence for the positive effects of BGLOs for Black members, less is known about if and how these effects of BGLO membership extend to non-Black members. Drawing on 34 in-depth interviews with non-Black members of BGLOs, we seek answers to three yet unasked questions: First, why do non-Blacks come to identify with BGLOs? Second, what are the responses and reactions to this identification process and experience? And finally, how does this identification relate to larger shifts in the United States's racial hierarchy? We find that campus racial climate acts as a catalyst for BGLO membership and that BGLOs continue to serve their purpose as a necessary counter-space but that also, non-Blacks come to identify with these organizations in order to develop meaningful interracial solidarity and oppose their hostile campus climates.","[Laybourn, Wendy M.] Univ Maryland, Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Goss, Devon R.; Hughey, Matthew W.] Univ Connecticut, Sociol, Storrs, CT USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Connecticut,"Laybourn, WM (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Parren Mitchell Art Sociol Bldg Bldg 146, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",wendyml@umd.edu,,"Laybourn, SunAh/0000-0002-6217-3674",,,,,59,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2332-6492,2332-6505,,SOCIOL RACE ETHNIC,Sociol.

However, these processes are not represented in large-scale atmospheric models (e.g., general circulation models), which have an inappropriate grid-scale resolution. With the assumption that atmospheric variables can be separated into large scale, mesoscale, and turbulent scale, a set of prognostic equations applicable in large-scale atmospheric models for momentum, temperature, moisture, and any other gaseous or aerosol material, which includes both mesoscale and turbulent fluxes is developed. Prognostic equations are also developed for these mesoscale fluxes, which indicate a closure problem and, therefore, require a parameterization. For this purpose, the mean mesoscale kinetic energy (MKE) per unit of mass is used, defined as E = 0.5 [u(i)'2], where u(i) represents the three Cartesian components of a mesoscale circulation (the angle bracket symbol is the grid-scale, horizontal averaging operator in the large-scale model, and a tilde indicates a corresponding large-scale mean value). A prognostic equation is developed for E, and an analysis of the different terms of this equation indicates that the mesoscale vertical heat flux, the mesoscale pressure correlation, and the interaction between turbulence and mesoscale perturbations are the major terms that affect the time tendency of E. A state-of-the-art mesoscale atmospheric model is used to investigate the relationship between MKE, landscape discontinuities (as characterized by the spatial distribution of heat fluxes at the earth's surface), and mesoscale sensible and latent heat fluxes in the atmosphere. MKE is compared with turbulence kinetic energy to illustrate the importance of mesoscale processes as compared to turbulent processes. This analysis emphasizes the potential use of MKE to bridge between landscape discontinuities and mesoscale fluxes and, therefore, to parameterize mesoscale fluxes generated by such subgrid-scale landscape discontinuities in large-scale atmospheric models.",,,"AVISSAR, R (corresponding author), RUTGERS UNIV,DEPT METEOROL & PHYS OCEANOG,COOK CAMPUS,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903, USA.",,"Chen, Fei/B-1747-2009","Chen, Fei/0000-0003-2573-3828",,,,,38,96,96,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0022-4928,,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) produces detailed 3D maps of forest canopy structure from which aboveground carbon density can be estimated. Working with a ALS dataset collected over the 8049-km(2) Wellington Region of New Zealand we create maps of indigenous forest carbon and evaluate the influence of wind by examining how carbon storage varies with aspect. Storms flowing from the west are a common cause of disturbance in this region, and we hypothesised that west-facing forests exposed to these winds would be shorter than those in sheltered east-facing sites. Methods: The aboveground carbon density of 31 forest inventory plots located within the ALS survey region were used to develop estimation models relating carbon density to ALS information. Power-law models using rasters of top-of-the-canopy height were compared with models using tree-level information extracted from the ALS dataset. A forest carbon map with spatial resolution of 25 m was generated from ALS maps of forest height and the estimation models. The map was used to evaluate the influences of wind on forests. Results: Power-law models were slightly less accurate than tree-centric models (RMSE 35% vs 32%) but were selected for map generation for computational efficiency. The carbon map comprised 4.5 million natural forest pixels within which canopy height had been measured by ALS, providing an unprecedented dataset with which to examine drivers of carbon density. Forests facing in the direction of westerly storms stored less carbon, as hypothesised. They had much greater above-ground carbon density for a given height than any of 14 tropical forests previously analysed by the same approach, and had exceptionally high basal areas for their height. We speculate that strong winds have kept forests short without impeding basal area growth. Conclusion: Simple estimation models based on top-of-the canopy height are almost as accurate as state-of-the-art tree-centric approaches, which require more computing power. High-resolution carbon maps produced by ALS provide powerful datasets for evaluating the environmental drivers of forest structure, such as wind.","[Coomes, David A.; Safka, Daniel] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Safka, Daniel; Shepherd, James] Massey Univ, Landcare Res, Riddet Rd, Palmerston North 4474, New Zealand; [Dalponte, Michele] Fdn Edmund Mach, Reserch & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sustainable Agroecosyst & Bioresources, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [Holdaway, Robert] Landcare Res, 54 Gerald St, Lincoln 7608, New Zealand",University of Cambridge; Landcare Research - New Zealand; Massey University; Fondazione Edmund Mach; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Coomes, DA (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",dac18@cam.ac.uk,"Dalponte, Michele/AAF-8095-2019; Dalponte, Michele/AAF-3772-2020; Dalponte, Michele/E-5117-2011","Dalponte, Michele/0000-0001-9850-8985; Dalponte, Michele/0000-0001-9850-8985; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE))","We are grateful to the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment for permission to use the LiDAR survey and LUCAS natural forest plots for this work, as retrieved from the National Vegetation Survey (NVS) Databank.

Recently, deep learning-based methods are becoming the dominating method for precise land cover mapping. However, the large-scale application of them is deeply hindered by the domain shift between different images, which is easily caused by illumination, climate, regional divergence, and so on. With the aim to cope with the problem of domain shift, many domain adaptation (DA) methods have been provided and great achievements have been made, especially the newborn adversarial DA, which usually contains a generator and a discriminator. Among these methods, the pixel-level methods are of high memory consumption, whereas feature-level methods are found hard to decode the structured information for semantic segmentation tasks due to the lack of low-dimensional information. Therefore, we propose an adversarial domain adaptation framework with Kullback-Leibler constraint (KL-ADDA) for remote sensing land cover classification. A state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation network is utilized as the generator, which directly outputs the segmentation results to the discriminator to retain more low-level information. Besides, a Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence is calculated to improve the discriminative ability of the discriminator and thus enhance the generator's performance. Experiments on the international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing (ISPRS) data set and two simulated target data sets have shown the effectiveness of KL-ADDA for DA.","[Liu, Mengxi; Zhang, Pengyuan; Shi, Qian; Liu, Mengwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Liu, MW (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",liumx23@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zhangpy9@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; shixi5@mail.sysu.edu.cn; liumw8@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Mengxi/0000-0001-5237-4758",Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2019A1515011057]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61976234]; Guangzhou Applied Basic Research Project [202002030402],Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangzhou Applied Basic Research Project,"This work was supported in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation under Grant 2019A1515011057, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61976234, and in part by the Guangzhou Applied Basic Research Project under Grant 202002030402.",,26,0,0,3,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

Therefore, many research efforts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction community have recently tried introducing AI into building asset management (AM) processes. Since AM encompasses a broad set of disciplines, an overview of several AI applications, current research gaps, and trends is needed. In this context, this study conducted the first state-of-the-art research on AI for building asset management. A total of 578 papers were analyzed with bibliometric tools to identify prominent institutions, topics, and journals. The quantitative analysis helped determine the most researched areas of AM and which AI techniques are applied. The areas were furtherly investigated by reading in-depth the 83 most relevant studies selected by screening the articles' abstracts identified in the bibliometric analysis. The results reveal many applications for Energy Management, Condition assessment, Risk management, and Project management areas.

Classical regression-based models are mainly developed for stationary time series, while power load is typical non-stationary one. Shallow neural network model usually cannot capture complicated non-linear pattern efficiently, while power load features complicated varying patterns due to the numerous factors such as region, climate, economics, industry. Deep neural network, especially recurrent neural network (RNN) methods, like long short-term memory (LSTM), can model complicated pattern efficiently with the state-of-the-art performance, but the training of the deep network becomes much harder with the increase of input sequence length. Since the power load holds large span of periodicity from daily through yearly, LSTM cannot fully exploit the inner correlation of power load. In this paper, ensemble deep learning method is proposed to exploit both non-linear pattern by LSTM and large-span period by similar day method. The proposed method integrates several LSTM networks, and each network is fed with different input time sequences which are selected regarding the similarity of load pattern. Experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method when comparing with exiting methods.","[Guo, Haibo; Tang, Lingling; Peng, Yuexing] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, MoE, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Guo, HB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, MoE, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",guohaibo1993@foxmail.com; linglingt@bupt.edu.cn; yxpeng@bupt.edu.cn,,,NSFC [61171106]; China Unicom Network Technology Research Institute,NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Unicom Network Technology Research Institute,This work was supported partly by the NSFC under grant 61171106 and partly by China Unicom Network Technology Research Institute.,,19,2,2,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-0548-2,,,,2018,,,,,86,90,,10.1109/MSN.2018.00021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2018.00021,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BO1AH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000494359100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within this scope, many studies are performed on performance and environmental assessments of many types of energy systems. This paper, different from previous studies, aims to prove exergy performance of a low-emission combustor of an aero-engine. Design/methodology/approach It is a well-known fact that, with respect to previous exergy analysis, highest exergy destruction occurs in the combustor component of the engine. For this reason, it is required to evaluate a low-emission aero-engine combustor thermodynamically to understand the state of the art according to the authors' best of knowledge. In this framework, combustor has been operated at numerous conditions (variable engine load) and evaluated. Findings As a conclusion of the study, the impact of emission reduction on performance improvement of the aero-engine combustors exergetically is presented. It is stated that exergy efficiency of the low-emission aero-engine combustor is found to be 64.69, 61.95 and 71.97 per cent under various operating conditions. Practical implications Results obtained in this paper may be beneficial for researchers who are interested in combustion and propulsion technology and thermal sciences. Originality/value Different from former studies, the impact of operating conditions on performance of a combustor is examined from the viewpoint of thermodynamics.","[Sohret, Yasin] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Airframe & Powerplant Maintenance, Isparta, Turkey; [Karakoc, T.

As many dams are more than 50 years of age, this problem is becoming more and more serious nowadays. Reservoir sedimentation leads to various severe problems such as a decisive decrease of the active reservoir volume leading to both loss of energy production and water available for water supply and irrigation. These problems will intensify in the very next future, because sediment supply tends to increase due to climate change. Therefore countermeasures have to be developed. They can be divided into the three main categories sediment yield reduction, sediment routing and sediment removal. This paper focuses on sediment routing by means of sediment bypass tunnels. Sediment bypass tunnels are an effective measure to stop or at least decrease the reservoir sedimentation process. By routing the sediments around the reservoir into the tailwater in case of flood events sediment accumulation of both bed load and suspended load is reduced significantly. However, the number of sediment bypass tunnels in the world is limited primarily due to high investment and above all maintenance costs. The state-of-the-art design criteria of constructing bypass tunnels are summarized herein; major problems such as tunnel invert abrasion are discussed. The need for further research regarding sediment transport in bypass tunnels and invert abrasion is highlighted.","[Auel, C.; Boes, R.

In this study, using a state-of-art Community Land Model (CLM) developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), we simulated soil moisture in East Asia and its possible response to global warming through a long off-line experiment under 0.5 degrees (longitude) x 0.5 degrees (latitude) resolution and real atmospheric forcing of the National Center for Environmental Protection/Department of Energy (NCEP/DOE) reanalysis during 1979 through 2003. The 25-year simulation is examined and compared with limited observations. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) Soil moisture takes time in response to the atmospheric forcing. The equilibration time depends on the depth of the soil and is as much as 20 years in deep layers (> 1.5 m); (2) In comparison with observations, the CLM reasonably reproduces the seasonal and inter-annual variability, spatial structure, and vertical pattern of soil moisture in East Asia; (3) The soil tends to be drier in the past 25 years in northeastern Asia-including northern China north of 30 degrees N-while wetter in the southern China and the Tibetan Plateau, especially in summer. Our analysis shows that the regional drying is attributed to increase of the land-surface evaporation induced by global warming.","[Du, ChuanLi; Liu, XiaoDong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710075, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Du, ChuanLi] Shaanxi Prov Meteorol Inst, Xian 710014, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, WanLi] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Earth Environment, CAS; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA","Du, CL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710075, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",duchuanli@foxmail.com,,,NSFC National Excellent Young Scientists Fund [40825008]; MOST Special Fund for Nonprofit Organizations [GYHY200706029]; MOST Special Fund for State Key Laboratory [LQ0701]; Program for Construction of Infrastructure of National ST Conditions [2006DKA32300],NSFC National Excellent Young Scientists Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOST Special Fund for Nonprofit Organizations; MOST Special Fund for State Key Laboratory; Program for Construction of Infrastructure of National ST Conditions,"This work was supported by the NSFC National Excellent Young Scientists Fund (40825008), MOST Special Fund for Nonprofit Organizations (GYHY200706029), for State Key Laboratory (LQ0701), and Program for Construction of Infrastructure of National S&T Conditions (2006DKA32300).",,16,1,3,0,0,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",1674-3822,,,SCI COLD ARID REG,Sci.

These measurements are critical for understanding the Earth's atmosphere, atmospheric chemistry, and systemic forces driving climactic changes. For these measurements, detectors with high quantum efficiency and near background limited performance detectivity over a wide wavelength range are necessary. In this article, we will review the state-of-the-art single and multicolor detector technologies over a wide spectral-range, for use in space-based and airborne remote sensing applications. Simultaneous detection in multi-wavelength bands with a single focal plane array (FPA) will result in reduction or elimination of heavy and complex optical components now required for wavelength differentiation in atmospheric remote sensors leading to smaller, lighter, simpler instruments with better performance. Discussions are focused on current and the most recently developed FPA in addition to emphasizing future development in UV-to-Far infrared multicolor FPA detectors for next generation space-based instruments to measure water vapor and greenhouse gases. This novel detector component will make instruments designed for these critical measurements more efficient while reducing complexity and associated electronics and weight.

Yet, very few studies have reported on their increasing occurrences in sub-Saharan Africa's low-density and medium-sized cities and towns. This study uses Enhanced Fujita's F-scale matrix to estimate the intensity and rank the damage severity of a windstorm on June 16, 2018 that ruined more than 30 lives and thousand buildings and other essential structures within the 2-h of its destructive span in Bauchi city in northern Nigeria. A pictorial ranking of some typical damage was carried out to supplement the results of the F-scale decision matrix. In total, 1,236 buildings and structures were identified with varying levels of damage. Two techniques - Average Nearest Neighbor and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) were implemented using Geographic information system (GIS) in mapping out the spatial patterns and damage hotspots. The results of the F-scale matrix reveal that the dominant wind speed with the most significant damage to buildings and structures is 67 +/- 20 ms (-1) with the traditional parts of the city being the worst hit by the disaster. The art and science of visual ranking and hotspots mapping can support policymakers, first respondents, and other stakeholders to co-design strategies and co-produce effective solutions for the increasing climate extreme events and their related disaster risk.","[Kafi, Kamil Muhammad; Barau, Aliyu Salisu] Bayero Univ, Fac Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Kano, Nigeria; [Aliyu, Abdulkadir] Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Univ, Fac Environm Technol, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Bauchi, Nigeria",Bayero University,"Kafi, KM (corresponding author), Bayero Univ, Fac Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Kano, Nigeria.",kmkafi.urp@buk.edu.ng,"Barau, Aliyu Salisu/D-2936-2015","Barau, Aliyu Salisu/0000-0002-1259-3929; Aliyu, Abdulkadir/0000-0003-0247-1263; Kafi, Kamil/0000-0002-5617-6633",,,,,40,1,2,0,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Considering climate change, measurement methods capable of providing continuous observations are needed to assess and predict the effects of increasing uncertainty. Therefore, a technology gap remains for continuous near-bed measurements. To address this gap, we have developed a multimodal flow measurement device, the hydromast. The hydromast uses a combination of pressure and inertial sensing to measure the near-bed (< 30 cm) velocity. We have previously shown that the device can be used to classify river hydromorphological units. Encouraged by these results, we now show that the same device is also capable of continuously measuring the near-bed velocity in rivers. Ten hydromast prototypes were built and calibrated over the range of 0.01 - 2 m/s in a large-scale laboratory tow tank and validated under natural conditions (0.35 - 1.2 m/s) using 118 turbulent flow measurements in a river. It was found that the streamwise, time-averaged velocity mean estimation error from the hydromast in continuous tests with different methods was 0.095 m/s, as compared with a state-of-the-art acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The contribution of this study is a new method for continuous near-bed velocity measurements, verified with turbulent field data from a river.","[Ristolainen, Asko; Tuhtan, Jeffrey A.; Kruusmaa, Maarja] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst, Ctr Biorobot, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Ristolainen, A (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst, Ctr Biorobot, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",asko.ristolainen@taltech.ee,"Tuhtan, Jeffrey Andrew/AAQ-5037-2020","Tuhtan, Jeffrey Andrew/0000-0003-0832-7334; Kruusmaa, Maarja/0000-0001-5738-5421; Asko, Ristolainen/0000-0003-3029-9667","European Union [635568, IUT-339]; Estonian Base Financing under Grant B53; Octavo; ETAg PUT Grant 1690 through bioinspired flow sensing",European Union(European Commission); Estonian Base Financing under Grant B53; Octavo; ETAg PUT Grant 1690 through bioinspired flow sensing,"This work was supported in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Lakhsmi Project under Grant 635568 and Grant IUT-339.

In contrast, the immersion freezing of larger dropsrainis usually represented by a liquid volume-dependent approach, making the parameterizations of rain freezing independent of specific aerosol types and concentrations. This may lead to inconsistencies when aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation shall be investigated, since raindrops consist of the cloud dropletsand corresponding aerosol particlesthat have been involved in drop-drop-collisions. Here we introduce an extension to a two-moment microphysical scheme in order to account explicitly for particle accumulation in raindrops by tracking the rates of selfcollection, autoconversion, and accretion. This provides a direct link between ice nuclei and the primary formation of large precipitating ice particles. A new parameterization scheme of drop freezing is presented to consider multiple ice nuclei within one drop and effective drop cooling rates. In our test cases of deep convective clouds, we find that at altitudes which are most relevant for immersion freezing, the majority of potential ice nuclei have been converted from cloud droplets into raindrops. Compared to the standard treatment of freezing in our model, the less efficient mineral dust-based freezing results in higher rainwater contents in the convective core, affecting both rain and hail precipitation. The aerosol-dependent treatment of rain freezing can reverse the signs of simulated precipitation sensitivities to ice nuclei perturbations.","[Paukert, M.; Hoose, C.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Paukert, M.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Simmel, M.] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS),"Hoose, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",corinna.hoose@kit.edu,"Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009","Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789; Paukert, Marco/0000-0002-6447-0437","Helmholtz Association through the Climate Initiative REKLIM; President's Initiative and Networking Fund [VH-NG-620]; DFG [FOR 1525, HO 4612/1-1, HO 4612/1-2]",Helmholtz Association through the Climate Initiative REKLIM(Helmholtz Association); President's Initiative and Networking Fund; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors would like to thank Axel Seifert for helpful discussions, and Bernhard Vogel and Max Bangert for providing the model basis used in this study.

Hence, the proper design of buildings which are the most vital energy consumers and producers of greenhouse gases can be an effective step in order to improve the existing situation. Since there are numerous intervener factors to increase the quality and efficiency of the building, considering all the factors simultaneously seems very difficult. The current paper is based on the crucial designing decisions which determine the amount of final consumed energy by a building, are taken by architects in initial levels of designing. Therefore, we try to help architects to obtain the designs which are compatible with the environment in order to reduce the energy consumption by understanding the climate and designing solutions.","[Nabavizadeh, Darya; Razavi, Seyedeh Zeinab Emadian] Yazd Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Yazd, Iran",University of Yazd,"Nabavizadeh, D (corresponding author), Yazd Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Yazd, Iran.",d.nabavizade@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,INST INTEGRATIVE OMICS & APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY,KOLKATA,"NONAKURI, PURBA MEDINIPUR, WEST BENGAL, KOLKATA, 721 172, INDIA",0976-3104,,,IIOAB J,IIOAB J.,,2018,,,,,36,40,,,,,,5,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,GH7UF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000433693000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

These elements appear contradictory in regard to environmental factors. Following a general literature review of environmental aspects of timber buildings and their components, building elements are analyzed in regard to their relevance for both issues. Particular advantages for material efficiency and carbon storage in regard to specific building elements are discussed. The first section summarizes what currently qualifies as the state of art in environmental standards of timber buildings on building level, looking at influence on the sector and on the competition on wooden material for material or energetic use. Calculations on carbon storage of exemplary timber buildings are shown in the following section. A factor for material efficiency of wooden use is hereby introduced. The interdependencies of carbon storage and material efficiency are discussed on the level of building elements and according to necessary requirements. Results show that there is no best timber construction that fulfills all requirements, as each building and with that each specific construction needs to fulfill varying circumstances. It is thus demonstrated that it is not enough to only focus on one of the issues. It is important to keep these interconnections in mind for climate discussions in regard to timber buildings and to further optimize timber constructions and buildings to meet both targets.","[Hafner, Annette; Schaefer, Sabrina] Ruhr Univ, Resource Efficient Bldg,Univ Str 150,IC5-159, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Hafner, A (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ, Resource Efficient Bldg,Univ Str 150,IC5-159, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",Annette.hafner@rub.de,,,"Waldklimafonds; Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety","Waldklimafonds; Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety","The named research project Greenhouse gas balances for timber buildings-Implementation of new requirements for life-cycle-assessments and calculation of empiric substitution factors (GHG-timber buildings) was funded by the Waldklimafonds, a joined research grant of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety.

We have extended HiCMA to provide a high-performance implementation on distributed-memory systems of one of the most widely used matrix factorization in large-scale scientific applications, i.e., the Cholesky factorization. It employs the tile low-rank data format to compress the dense data-sparse off-diagonal tiles of the matrix. It then decomposes the matrix computations into interdependent tasks and relies on the dynamic runtime system StarPU for asynchronous out-of-order scheduling, while allowing high user productivity. Performance comparisons and memory footprint on matrix dimensions up to eleven million show a performance gain and memory saving of more than an order of magnitude for both metrics on thousands of cores, against state-of-the-art open-source and vendor optimized numerical libraries.

The typical HT-PEMFC operating temperatures are in the range of 100-200 degrees C which allows for co-generation of heat and power, high tolerance to fuel impurities and simpler system design. This paper reviews the current literature concerning the HT-PEMFC, ranging from cell materials to stack and stack testing. Only acid doped PBI membranes meet the US DOE (Department of Energy) targets for high temperature membranes operating under no humidification on both anode and cathode sides (barring the durability). This eliminates the stringent requirement for humidity however, they have many potential drawbacks including increased degradation, leaching of acid and incompatibility with current state-of-the-art fuel cell materials. In this type of fuel cell, the choice of membrane material determines the other fuel cell component material composition, for example when using an acid doped system, the flow field plate material must be carefully selected to take into account the advanced degradation. Novel research is required in all aspects of the fuel cell components in order to ensure that they meet stringent durability requirements for mobile applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the United Kingdom, hydrogen technologies are at the forefront of the net zero-emission roadmaps of many industrial clusters. However, with impending timeframes linked to emission targets and other decarbonization objectives, it is increasingly important to understand how to accelerate such transitions to hydrogen. There is, to date, a notable gap in the academic literature concerning the acceleration of sustainability transitions. Using the case of the hydrogen agenda in England's North West region, we explore how the transition to hydrogen can be accelerated and thus begin to contribute toward filling this omission. In doing so, we use data collected through semi-structured interviews and from the public domain to unpack and develop upon an existing framework that emerged from the European Commission funded-project Accelerating and Rescaling Transitions to Sustainability (ARTS). The framework comprises five acceleration mechanisms which local sustainability transition initiatives have adopted. This analysis generates novel findings in relation to why actors in the region have faced difficulties in instrumentalizing as well as the mechanism's overall importance in acceleration. We use these challenges to inform several recommendations which policy makers could adopt to accelerate the North West's, and wider UK's, transition to hydrogen.","[Edwards, Reace; Howe, Joseph] Univ Chester, Dept Phys Math & Engn Sci, Chester, England; [Font-Palma, Carolina] Univ Hull, Dept Engn, Kingston Upon Hull, England; [Howe, Joseph] Univ Chester, Dept Phys Math & Engn Sci, Parkgate Rd, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England",University of Chester; University of Hull; University of Chester,"Howe, J (corresponding author), Univ Chester, Dept Phys Math & Engn Sci, Parkgate Rd, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England.",j.howe@chester.ac.uk,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,1548-7733,,SUSTAINABILITY-SCI P,Sustainability-Sci.

In response to this complexity, professional design practice has pursued new ways of working. More design projects are becoming more interdisciplinary and less hierarchically structured, involving more collaborative project teams with a variety of backgrounds in architecture, urban design, landscape and interior architecture, engineering, ecological sciences and art. At universities, the design-learning studio which pedagogically champions the authentic replication of design practice projects, has also bifurcated. While teaching design through the traditional disciplinary-based problem-solving processes of an individual project is still understandably commonplace, a new type of studio has emerged, led by group work and interdisciplinary collaborations, and framed by the complexity of a seemingly irreconcilable problematic subject. This emergent domain warrants more research into pedagogical structures, teaching techniques and learning activities; and this paper explains such investigations undertaken through the live educational practice of two interdisciplinary studios in two years, drawing conclusions from student feedback gathered via questionnaires and focus group interviews. The findings suggest that teaching formats in this type of studio need to facilitate a balance between trusting relationships and immersive experiences; and that effective teaching techniques entail the development of more accessible communication techniques in conceptual diagramming and linguistic idiom.","[Bryant, Martin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Architecture, Fac Design Architecture Bldg, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Bryant, M (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Architecture, Fac Design Architecture Bldg, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",martin.bryant@uts.edu.au,,,University of Technology Sydney,University of Technology Sydney,This research received no external funding.

As a rare combination of the residential area, atelier, and gathering place for Munich's intellectual elite, Villa Stuck is an original invention of Franz von Stuck, It is explicitly marked by formal and conceptual references to ancient Greece and Rome, often present in the rest of Stuck's oeuvre, The Music Salon of Villa Stuck stands out as a fascinating case study for understanding the far-reaching impact and long duration of originally Classical Antique elements until the turn of the 20th century, The core and starting point of the analysis is Stuck's paintings and sculptures incorporated within the Music Salon.

Photocatalytic conversion of CO2, which uses solar light energy to recycle CO2 into fuels and chemicals, provides a promising and straightforward strategy to simultaneously reduce the atmospheric CO2 level and fulfil the future energy demand. However, the lack of substantial development of state-of-the-art materials remains a major bottleneck of this technology. In recent years, graphene-based composite photocatalysts have gained increasing interest in CO2 conversion due to the introduction of graphene with a series of unique physicochemical properties, which has shown to play a significant role in promoting the photocatalytic solar energy conversion efficiency. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the typical literature reports on graphene-based composites for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to produce solar fuels and chemicals. The main types of the reported graphene-based composites and the role of graphene in the composites in improving the photocatalytic performance have been elaborated. In particular, we have highlighted the possible role of graphene in tuning the product selectivity of photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Finally, perspectives on the existing problems and future research on graphene-based composites toward photocatalytic conversion of CO2 are critically discussed.","[Yang, Min-Quan; Xu, Yi-Jun] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Photocatalysis Energy & Environm, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China; [Yang, Min-Quan; Xu, Yi-Jun] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Chem, New Campus, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University; Fuzhou University,"Xu, YJ (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Photocatalysis Energy & Environm, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China.;Xu, YJ (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Coll Chem, New Campus, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China.",yjxu@fzu.edu.cn,"Yang, Min-Quan/L-3019-2015; Xu, Yi-Jun/B-2566-2016","Yang, Min-Quan/0000-0001-7419-5240; Xu, Yi-Jun/0000-0002-2195-1695",,,,,114,147,148,6,185,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2055-6756,2055-6764,,NANOSCALE HORIZ,Nanoscale Horiz.,,2016,3,,,,185,200,,10.1039/c5nh00113g,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5nh00113g,,,16,"Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,DN7YQ,32260621,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000377296500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address climate change, many countries had studied into and set out strategies from energy-saving to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Since the 20th century, social economy had made remarkable progress, and work opportunities and business activities were mostly centered along urban areas, leading population to flow into cities - a low density expansion which was termed urban sprawl. Whereas the concept of low carbon city was put forward amid the balancing of environment preservation against economy development, it was a wish of many administrations to achieve sustainable development whilst fulfilling environmental preservation. Once consumption and shocks to environment are reduced, the tension between economy development and environmental protection will be offered with solutions. In this research, it mainly engages residents of Shaanxi Province for questionnaire and survey. During the process, questionnaires sent out totalled 500, and 433 effective ones were collected back, accounting for 87% of the total. According to research result: (i) In hierarchy 2 evaluating construct, the most valued construct was low carbon life, following that respectively are: energy index, building and environment, green transportation, resource recycling; (ii) Among 20 evaluation indexes, the most valued 5 indexes are: low carbon education initiative, renewable resources, carbon management and promotion, greening area ratio, low carbon transportation means. Lastly, in light of research results, certain advices were put forward in the hope of assisting and guiding cities to set out appropriate environment planning strategy, and to advance towards the goal of low carbon and sustainable development.","[Xin, Wang] Xian Acad Fine Arts, Dept Ind Design, Acad Design Arts, Xian, Peoples R China; [Yan, Wang] Xian Polytech Univ, Dept Prod Design, Appeal & Art Design Coll, Xian, Peoples R China",Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts; Xi'an Polytechnic University,"Yan, W (corresponding author), Xian Polytech Univ, Dept Prod Design, Appeal & Art Design Coll, Xian, Peoples R China.",510522628@qq.com,,,,,,,14,2,2,2,10,SCIBULCOM LTD,SOFIA,"PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",1311-5065,,,J ENVIRON PROT ECOL,J.

This task is of vital importance in fulfilling the low energy criteria under the policies to tackle energy shortage and climate change. According to the intelligent EC modeling in 3DP, the multisource data consists in three parts including pixel-source, motion-source, and processing-source. Compared with existing solutions, which either only harness the geometric characteristics of computer-aided design (CAD) models or simply integrate the processing parameters into the prediction, the proposed 3DPECP-Net is able to seamlessly fuse relevant data in 3DP, taking full advantage of the complementary information of diverse datasources for more accurate prediction. Specifically, the multisource fusion frame (MSFF) stacks multiple transformer blocks to catch global spatial information, and convolutional blocks to catch local feature details. Furthermore, we propose a continual attention memory network (CAMN) to ably extract and store the inter-layer consistency, enforcing to efficiently learn an exhaustive representation for 3DP EC prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3DPECP-Net achieves a superior prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods.","[Yu, Lequan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lequan] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kang; Xu, Jinghua; Zhang, Shuyou] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Hong Kong; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, SY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zsy@zju.edu.cn,,,Project of Strategic Importance in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University;  [1-ZE2Q];  [MHP/014/20],Project of Strategic Importance in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ; ,"Acknowledgment This research was supported by the Project of Strategic Importance in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (No. 1-ZE2Q) , and Innovation and Technology Fund-Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme (No. MHP/014/20) .",,46,0,0,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Heat pumps (HP) are one of the technologies that are extremely validated and utilised in the European heat decarbonisation pathways. However, many challenges and uncertainties still lie ahead of HPs in research, practices and policymaking. Practical evidence from real-world case studies could mitigate some of these uncertainties and accelerate the rollout of HPs. Hence, this research aims to present an overview of the key issues and challenges which emerge from the heat decarbonisation practices through HP technologies across the EU. Adopting the evidence-based approach, experiences from the best practices are synthesised, as well as addressing the state-of-the-art and trends of HPs in the EU. Finally, the key factors and insights which are needed to be considered over the design, implementation and operation of HPs are identified and discussed. The conclusions highlight the significant potential of HPs in consolidated solutions such as hybrid HPs, local heat synergies and heat networks. Heat pumps combined with complementary technologies are ready to serve the first wave of heat transition across Europe. However, regulatory provisions, building upgrades and development of other complementary components must be accelerated to keep pace with the HP initiatives.","[Abbasi, Mohammad Hosein; Abdullah, Badr; Ahmad, Muhammad Waseem; Rostami, Ali; Cullen, Jeff] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University,"Abbasi, MH (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",M.H.Abbasi@2019.ljmu.ac.uk; B.M.Abdullah@ljmu.ac.uk; M.W.Ahmad@ljmu.ac.uk; A.Rostami@ljmu.ac.uk; J.D.Cullen@ljmu.ac.uk,,"Ahmad, Muhammad Waseem/0000-0002-7269-4369; Abbasi, Mohammad Hosein/0000-0001-7163-9571",,,,,153,10,10,9,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

The state-of-the-art turbulence detection methods used on board commercial aircraft include pilot reports and online algorithms based on in situ eddy dissipation rate. They provide turbulence observations but not their predictions. Weather radar on the other hand only detects turbulence in wet air without any precise announcement about the timing. Equipped with a large number of sensors coming from different aircraft systems, the flight variables (multivariate time series generated by sensors) as well as their relationship may contain useful information indicating upcoming turbulence. Our approach aims at representing raw time series as functions which enable not only discovering the underlying function behind raw measurements but also implicitly removing data noise. Functional geometry features, which can capture the dynamic relation between variables, are deduced from the multidimensional path in functional representation. Based on the transformed geometry features, an outlier detection method is further deployed to detect specific behaviors indicating upcoming severe turbulence. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach reaches a 0.532 true positive rate while keeping a zero false positive rate, which meets the zero false alarm requirement for optimizing the passenger experience.","[Li, Tianyi; Mothe, Josiane; Teste, Olivier] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IRIT UMR 5505, Toulouse, France; [Li, Tianyi; Goupil, Philippe] Airbus, Aircraft Control, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Airbus; Airbus France S.A.S.,"Li, TY (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IRIT UMR 5505, Toulouse, France.;Li, TY (corresponding author), Airbus, Aircraft Control, Toulouse, France.",Tianyi.Li@irit.fr; Philippe.Goupil@airbus.com; Josiane.Mothe@irit.fr; Olivier.Teste@irit.fr,"Teste, Olivier/C-6850-2012","Teste, Olivier/0000-0003-0338-9886",ANRT (CIFRE contrat NDEG) [2020-0205],ANRT (CIFRE contrat NDEG)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This work is sponsored by ANRT (CIFRE contrat N degrees 2020-0205).,,31,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2375-9232,,978-1-6654-2427-1,INT CONF DAT MIN WOR,,,2021,,,,,1087,1093,,10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00142,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00142,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS9CY,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000779306300135,View Full Record in Web of Science

The gravitational potential induced by tidal mass redistribution is routinely modeled for global gravity analysis and orbit determination, although generally by assuming a spherical Earth and a uniform seawater density. The inadequacy of these simplifications is here addressed. We have developed an accurate yet efficient algorithm to compute the ocean tidal geopotential, allowing for Earth's elliptical shape and variable seawater density. Using this new computation, we find that (1) the effect of ellipticity is several percent of the tide signal over mid to high-latitude regions, which is comparable to elevation error in the state-of-the-art ocean tide models; (2) the effect of seawater density variations on the potential is as large as 2-3 cm in water-height equivalent, primarily in deep water where density increases 2%-3% from compressibility. Our analysis of new Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) laser ranging interferometer measurements reveals evident errors when ellipticity and density variations are ignored. When accounted for, the GRACE-FO residual tidal gravity perturbations are reduced by half, depending on the adopted tide model; only the remaining half likely represents actual model elevation error. The use of a spherical surface and a uniform seawater density is no longer tenable given the precision of gravity measurements from GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites.","[Han, Shin-Chan; Ghobadi-Far, Khosro] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Ray, Richard D.] NASA, Geodesy & Geophys Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Papanikolaou, Thomas] Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Newcastle; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Geoscience Australia,"Han, SC (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",shin-chan.han@newcastle.edu.au,"Papanikolaou, Thomas/AAY-6767-2020","Han, Shin-Chan/0000-0003-1810-1670; Ghobadi-Far, Khosro/0000-0001-8146-252X; Papanikolaou, Thomas/0000-0001-7127-0428",University of Newcastle; Australian Research Council [DP170100224]; US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (GRACE Science Team),University of Newcastle; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (GRACE Science Team),"This work was funded by the University of Newcastle to support NASA's GRACE and GRACE Follow-On projects as an international science team member to the missions, by Australian Research Council Discovery Program (DP170100224), and by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (GRACE Science Team).

Supercooled droplet icing with liquid water contents up to 3 gm(-3) can be reproduced. The unique aspect of this facility is the combination of an icing tunnel with a cloud chamber system for making ice particles. These ice particles are more realistic in shape and density than those usually used for mixed phase and ice crystal icing experiments. Ice water contents up to 20 gm(-3) can be generated. We further show how current state-of-the-art measurement techniques for particle sizing are performed on ice particles. The data are compared to those of in-flight measurements in mesoscale convective cloud systems in tropical regions.

Numerous systems combining different cooling processes or cooling machines have been proposed and investigated in the literature. A properly selected hybrid cooling system offers a great reduction in energy consumption and a coefficient of performance improvement varying according to different climates and system designs. This paper provides a detailed review of existing hybrid cooling systems with their corresponding individual cooling machines. A brief state of the art of the most common individual cooling systems in hybrid cooling for building use is firstly presented. Then, the hybrid cooling systems are classified into five main categories according to the combination of cooling processes or machines: Vapor compression based cooling, absorption based cooling, adsorption based cooling, desiccant-evaporative and multi-evaporator cooling. In each category, the studied configurations and the benefits of each hybridization method are presented. It is found that each hybrid system combines the advantages of the different cooling processes used. However, a hybrid system could have a negative repercussion if it does not match the climatic zone where it will be used. Consequently, a selection scheme to recommend the best hybrid cooling system for minimum energy consumption and pollution emissions in buildings according to different parameters is proposed.

Studies focusing on building heating alternatives in subarctic climate are limited and hence, this work can help with the development of such systems in remote off-grid communities. Shallow geothermal potential was mapped for Kuujjuaq, the largest village in Nunavik. Four ground-coupled heat pump scenarios were analysed for a simulated 5-occupant residential dwelling, with heating needs of 71 MWh/ year. Resulting maps show a relatively high ground potential for such cold region, ranging between 5.8MWh/year and 22.9 MWh/year per borehole for heat exchanger lengths of 100 m-300 m. A 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of such systems reveal that a compression heat pump with electricity derived from solar photovoltaic panels has a net present cost as low as approximately CAD$179,000, representing the most economically attractive heating option in Kuujjuaq as compared to the currently subsidized, diesel furnace heating at CAD$277,000.

Resulting impacts of stickleback on coastal and offshore foodwebs have been observed, highlighting the need for increased knowledge on its population characteristics. In this article, we quantify abundance, biomass, size structure, and spatial distribution of stickleback using data from the Swedish and Finnish parts of the Baltic International Acoustic Survey (BIAS) during 2001-2014. Two alternative methods for biomass estimation suggest an increase in biomass of stickleback in the Baltic Proper, stable or increasing mean size over time, and larger individuals toward the north. The highest abundance was found in the central parts of the Baltic Proper and Bothnian Sea. The proportion of stickleback biomass in the total planktivore biomass increased from 4 to 10% in the Baltic Proper and averaged 6% of the total planktivore biomass in the Bothnian Sea. In some years, however, stickleback biomass has ranged from half to almost twice that of sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in both basins. Given the recent population expansion of stickleback and its potential role in the ecosystem, we recommend that stickleback should be considered in future monitoring programmes and in fisheries and environmental management of the Baltic Sea.","[Olsson, Jens; Kaljuste, Olavi; Bergstrom, Ulf] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Skolgatan 6, S-74243 Oregrund, Sweden; [Jakubaviciute, Egle] Nat Res Ctr, Akad Str 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Larsson, Niklas; Casini, Michele; Cardinale, Massimiliano; Hjelm, Joakim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, S-45330 Lyskeil, Sweden; [Bystrom, Par] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Linneus Vag 6, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Nature Research Center - Lithuania; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University,"Olsson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Skolgatan 6, S-74243 Oregrund, Sweden.",jens.olsson@slu.se,,"Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236",Baltic 2020 foundation; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185); EU; Swedish Research Council Formas; project Plant-Fish - Formas [2013-1074],Baltic 2020 foundation; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art 185); EU(European Commission); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); project Plant-Fish - Formas,"This study was financed by the Baltic 2020 foundation to Par Bystrom.

Pollen spectra from the semidesert region have a clear palynological signal characterised by an abundance of Chenopodiaceae. Differentiation of oak forest, upper tree-line and subalpine communities is more difficult: all are dominated by arboreal pollen (AP) types.

Despite the fact that wheat production has significantly increased over the past decades, future wheat production will face unprecedented challenges from global climate change, increasing world population, and water shortages in arid and semi-arid lands. Furthermore, excessive applications of diverse fer-tilizers and pesticides are exacerbating environmental pollution and ecological deterioration. To ensure global food and ecosystem security, it is essential to enhance the resilience of wheat production while mini-mizing environmental pollution through the use of cutting-edge technologies. However, the hexaploid genome and gene redundancy complicate advances in genetic research and precision gene modifications for wheat improvement, thus impeding the breeding of elite wheat cultivars. In this review, we first introduce state-of-the-art genome-editing technologies in crop plants, especially wheat, for both functional genomics and genetic improvement. We then outline applications of other technologies, such as GWAS, high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping, speed breeding, and synthetic biology, in wheat. Finally, we discuss existing challenges in wheat genome editing and future prospects for precision gene modifica-tions using advanced genome-editing technologies. We conclude that the combination of genome editing and other molecular breeding strategies will greatly facilitate genetic improvement of wheat for sustainable global production.","[Li, Shaoya; Zhang, Chen; Li, Jingying; Yan, Lei; Wang, Ning; Xia, Lanqin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, Inst Crop Sci ICS, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS","Xia, LQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, Inst Crop Sci ICS, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",xialanqin@caas.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, China [2020YFE0202300]; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program, China [CAAS-ZDRW202002]; Innovation and Talent Supportive Program of the CAAS, China; National Engineering Laboratory of Crop Molecular Breeding","National Key Research and Development Program of China, China; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program, China; Innovation and Talent Supportive Program of the CAAS, China; National Engineering Laboratory of Crop Molecular Breeding","Some works mentioned in this review are partly funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, China (2020YFE0202300), the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program, China (CAAS-ZDRW202002), the Innovation and Talent Supportive Program of the CAAS, China, and the National Engineering Laboratory of Crop Molecular Breeding to L.X.",,163,13,13,20,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-3462,,,PLANT COMMUN,Plant Commun.,12-Jul,2021,4,,,,,,100211,10.1016/j.xplc.2021.100211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xplc.2021.100211,,21-Jul,16,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,TM3OZ,34327324,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000675463100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, collecting missions on farm and in situ were carried out by various institutes, with special emphasis given to ex situ collections serving as a reference for the identification of olive germplasm. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) represent the easiest and cheapest markers for olive genetic fingerprinting and have been the tool of choice for studying the genetic diversity of this crop in Tunisia, to resolve cases of homonymy and synonymy among the commercialized varieties, to identify rare cultivars, to improve knowledge about the genetic variability of this crop, to identify a hot spot of olive biodiversity in the Tunisian oasis of Degache, and to enrich the national reference collection of olive varieties.

Climate change, rapid population growth, freshwater pollution, and depletion are among the factors that aggravate the situation. Although not yet exhaustively exploited, reclamation and reuse of wastewater are considered as potential mechanisms to mitigate the challenge. In relation to reclamation, conventional wastewater treatment plants are designed to remove organic matter, total solids, and nutrients but fail to remove the emerging micropollutants. A decentralized wastewater treatment system is another potential and emerging approach for sustainable water reuse at the point of the wastewater generation. However, its application is not exclusively independent of the centralized system; rather the integration of the two systems is recommendable to depend on the local situations. To remove micropollutants, integrating advanced wastewater technologies should be considered as well as advanced analytical instruments for proper monitoring. Although the reuse of reclaimed water in crop irrigation is a well-established practice, it lacks uniformity across the globe. Furthermore, if not properly monitored, the reuse of reclaimed water also has adverse effects on the soil properties and public health. Therefore, the aim of this work is to review the impacts of global freshwater scarcity, water resources management and monitoring practice, state-of-the-art (waste)water treatment technologies and experience of reusing reclaimed water, particularly in agricultural irrigation.","[Fito, Jemal; Van Hulle, Stijn W.

In particular, thanks to the availability of the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) data over high-latitude regions, remote sensing of sea ice based on spaceborne GNSS-R has been rapidly growing. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the state-of-the-art methods for sea ice remote sensing offered by the GNSS-R technique. In this review, the fundamentals of these applications are described, and their performances are evaluated. Specifically, recent progress in sea ice sensing using TDS-1 data is highlighted including sea ice detection, sea ice concentration estimation, sea ice type classification, sea ice thickness retrieval, and sea ice altimetry. In addition, studies of sea ice sensing using airborne and ground-based data are also noted. Lastly, applications based on various platforms along with remaining challenges are summarized and possible future trends are explored. In this review, concepts, research methods, and experimental techniques of GNSS-R-based sea ice sensing are delivered, and this can benefit the scientific community by providing insights into this topic to further advance this field or transfer the relevant knowledge and practice to other studies.","[Yan, Qingyun; Huang, Weimin] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Huang, WM (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada.",qy2543@mun.ca; weimin@mun.ca,"Huang, Weimin/AAU-1568-2020; Yan, Qingyun/Q-9299-2019","Huang, Weimin/0000-0001-9622-5041; Yan, Qingyun/0000-0001-6693-957X","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [NSERC RGPIN-2017-04508, RGPAS-2017-507962]; Canadian Space Agency CubeSat Grant [17CCPNFL11]",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Canadian Space Agency CubeSat Grant,"This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants (NSERC RGPIN-2017-04508 and RGPAS-2017-507962), and the Canadian Space Agency CubeSat Grant (17CCPNFL11) to W.

Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions on the Earth caused by power industries put a high pressure on the existing power grids. Consequently, smart grid (SG) has emerged to address these challenges. The SG can achieve improved load balancing through accessing instantaneous electricity demand information via two-way communication and power flows, which help power plants match their output to the demand precisely. To this end, SG works based on the exchanges of a large amount of information generated from metering, sensing, and monitoring. Hence, the choice of communication infrastructure for SG is critical to provide secure, reliable, and efficient data delivery between various SG components. Cognitive radio (CR) network has been recognized as a promising technology to address communication requirements, standardization, and security problems of SG. Moreover, possible solutions in CR-based SG communications are also identified. In particular, we identify the major challenges of communication architecture, standardization, and security issues to implement CR-based SG communications. The aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art researches on CR-based SG communications, to highlight what have been investigated and what still remain to be addressed, particularly, in standardization and security aspects.","[Le, Trong Nghia] Le Quy Don Tech Univ, Dept Control Tech, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Chin, Wen-Long; Chen, Hsiao-Hwa] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",Le Quy Don Technical University; National Cheng Kung University,"Le, TN (corresponding author), Le Quy Don Tech Univ, Dept Control Tech, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam.",nghiahp79@gmail.com; wlchin@mail.ncku.edu.tw; hshwchen@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2221-E-006-117, 105-2221-E-006-019-MY2, 102-2221-E-006-008-MY3, 104-2221-E-006-081-MY2]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant 104-2221-E-006-117, Grant 105-2221-E-006-019-MY2, Grant 102-2221-E-006-008-MY3, and Grant 104-2221-E-006-081-MY2.",,130,35,35,0,24,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",,1553-877X,,IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT,IEEE Commun.

The micro-theoretic models of phase equilibrium of HBS could model the phase equilibrium very well; however, complexity in expression and acquire hardly is the limitation of its application about geotechnical engineering problem in the exploitation of hydrate.","[Wei Hou-zhen; Yan Rong-tao; Wei Chang-fu; Wu Er-lin; Chen Pan; Tian Hui-hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Rock & Soil Mech, State Key Lab Geomech & Geotech Engn, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Institute of Rock & Soil Mechanics, CAS","Wei, HZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Rock & Soil Mech, State Key Lab Geomech & Geotech Engn, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.",weihouzhen@163.com,"Chen, Pan/V-6049-2019","Chen, Pan/0000-0002-9691-8494",,,,,46,1,3,0,2,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-7598,,,ROCK SOIL MECH,Rock Soil Mech.,AUG,2011,8,,,,2287,+,,,,,,9,"Engineering, Geological",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,VA9HA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000410721400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ground-based measurements of snow properties are needed both to improve understanding of surface-atmosphere exchange processes and to provide ground truth to new remote-sensing algorithms. This justifies a review of techniques to measure snow in combination with establishment of criteria for the suitability of the methods for process studies. This review assesses the state-of-art in ground-based snow-measurement techniques in the end of the 1990s in view of their accuracy, time resolution, possibility to automate, practicality and suitability in different terrain. Methods for snow-pack water equivalent, depth, density, growth, quality, liquid-water content and water leaving the snow pack are reviewed. Synoptic snow measurements in Fennoscandian countries are widely varying and there is no single standard on which process-related studies can build. A long-term, continuous monitoring of mass and energy properties of a snow cover requires a combination of point-measurement techniques. Areally representative values of snow properties can be achieved through a combination of automatically collected point data with repeated manual, areally covering measurements, remote-sensing data and digital elevation models, preferably in a GIS framework.","Lulea Univ Technol, Div Water Resources, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Inst Earth Sci Hydrol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology; Uppsala University,"Lundberg, A (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Div Water Resources, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",,"Halldin, Sven/A-2403-2016","Halldin, Sven/0000-0002-8151-1739; Lundberg, Angela/0000-0003-2047-7896",,,,,117,16,19,0,16,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

It is marked by more pronounced seasonality and reduced greenhouse gases (GHGs) than the present state, as well as by the presence of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and glacial meltwater perturbation. This paper performs experiments under pre-industrial and different early-Holocene regimes with AWI-ESM (Alfred Wegener Institute-Earth System Model), a state-of-the-art climate model with unstructured mesh and varying resolutions, to examine the sensitivity of the simulated Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to early-Holocene insolation, GHGs, topography (including properties of the ice sheet), and glacial meltwater perturbation. In the experiments with early-Holocene Earth orbital parameters and GHGs applied, the AWI-ESM simulation shows a JJA (June-July-August) warming and DJF (December-January-February) cooling over the mid and high latitudes compared with pre-industrial conditions, with amplification over the continents. The presence of the LIS leads to an additional regional cooling over the North America. We also simulate the meltwater event around 8.2k. Big discrepancies are found in the oceanic responses to different locations and magnitudes of freshwater discharge. Our experiments, which compare the effects of freshwater release evenly across the Labrador Sea to a more precise injection along the western boundary of the North Atlantic (the coastal region of LIS), show significant differences in the ocean circulation response, as the former produces a major decline of the AMOC and the latter yields no obvious effect on the strength of the thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, proglacial drainage of Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway leads to a fast spin-down of the AMOC, followed, however, by a gradual recovery. Most hosing experiments lead to a warming over the Nordic Sea and Barents Sea of varying magnitudes, because of an enhanced inflow from lower latitudes and a northward displacement of the North Atlantic deep convection. These processes exist in both of our high- and low-resolution experiments, but with some local discrepancies such as (1) the hosing-induced subpolar warming is much less pronounced in the high-resolution simulations; (2) LIS coastal melting in the high-resolution model leads to a slight decrease in the AMOC; and (3) the convection formation site in the low- and high-resolution experiments differs, in the former mainly over northeastern North Atlantic Ocean, but in the latter over a very shallow subpolar region along the northern edge of the North Atlantic Ocean. In conclusion, we find that our simulations capture spatially heterogeneous responses of the early-Holocene climate.","[Shi, Xiaoxu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Sidorenko, Dmitry; Yang, Hu] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Lohmann, G (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",Gerrit.Lohmann@awi.de,"Yang, Hu/AAA-1437-2021","Yang, Hu/0000-0003-2054-2256; Sidorenko, Dmitry/0000-0001-8579-6068; Shi, Xiaoxu/0000-0001-7793-9639","PACMEDY project of the Belmont Forum; State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS [SKLLQG1920]; PALMOD project","PACMEDY project of the Belmont Forum; State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); PALMOD project","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the PACMEDY project of the Belmont Forum, the PALMOD project, and the open fund of State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, CAS (grant no.

Transformation of low-volatility gaseous precursors to new particles affects aerosol number concentration, cloud formation and hence the climate. The clustering of acid and base molecules is a major mechanism driving fast nucleation and initial growth of new particles in the atmosphere. However, the acid-base cluster composition, measured using state-of-the-art mass spectrometers, cannot explain the measured high formation rate of new particles. Here we present strong evidence for the existence of base molecules such as amines in the smallest atmospheric sulfuric acid clusters prior to their detection by mass spectrometers. We demonstrate that forming (H2SO4)(1)(amine)(1) is the rate-limiting step in atmospheric H2SO4-amine nucleation and the uptake of (H2SO4)(1)(amine)(1) is a major pathway for the initial growth of H2SO4 clusters. The proposed mechanism is very consistent with measured new particle formation in urban Beijing, in which dimethylamine is the key base for H2SO4 nucleation while other bases such as ammonia may contribute to the growth of larger clusters. Our findings further underline the fact that strong amines, even at low concentrations and when undetected in the smallest clusters, can be crucial to particle formation in the planetary boundary layer.","[Cai, Runlong; Yin, Rujing; Deng, Chenjuan; Hao, Jiming; Jiang, Jingkun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Cai, Runlong; Yan, Chao; Dada, Lubna; Kangasluoma, Juha; Kontkanen, Jenni; Paasonen, Pauli; Petaja, Tuukka; Kerminen, Veli-Matti; Bianchi, Federico; Kulmala, Markku; Worsnop, Douglas R.] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Fac Sci, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Yan, Chao; Liu, Yongchun] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Aerosol & Haze Lab, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dongsen; Ma, Yan; Zheng, Jun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Dada, Lubna] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Halonen, Roope] Tianjin Univ, Ctr Joint Quantum Studies, Sch Sci, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Halonen, Roope] Tianjin Univ, Dept Phys, Sch Sci, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuhui] Beijing Inst Technol, Key Lab Cluster Sci, Minist Educ China, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Atmospher Particle Pollut & Prev, Dept Environm Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Smith, James N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Chem Dept, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Atmospher Particle Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Worsnop, Douglas R.] Aerodyne Res Inc, Billerica, MA 01821 USA","Tsinghua University; University of Helsinki; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Ministry of Education, China; Fudan University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University; Aerodyne Research","Jiang, JK (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Kulmala, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Fac Sci, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",markku.kulmala@helsinki.fi; jiangjk@itsinghua.edu.cn,"Liu, Yongchun/F-3892-2011; Dada, Lubna/X-7559-2018; Bianchi, Federico/G-8428-2012; Wang, Lin/E-8546-2010; Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020; Pet√§j√§, Tuukka/A-8009-2008; Halonen, Roope/AAY-8561-2021","Liu, Yongchun/0000-0002-6758-2151; Dada, Lubna/0000-0003-1105-9043; Bianchi, Federico/0000-0003-2996-3604; Wang, Lin/0000-0002-4905-3432; Pet√§j√§, Tuukka/0000-0002-1881-9044; Halonen, Roope/0000-0002-8537-1921; Kangasluoma, Juha/0000-0002-1639-1187; Kontkanen, Jenni/0000-0002-5373-3537","National Natural Science Foundation of China [22188102, 21876094, 41730106, 92044301]; Academy of Finland [332547, 316114]; Samsung [PM2.5 SRP]; US National Science Foundation [AGS2132089]; US Department of Energy [DE-SC0019000]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Samsung(Samsung); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22188102, 21876094, 41730106 and 92044301), the Academy of Finland (332547 and 316114), the Samsung PM2.5 SRP, the US National Science Foundation (AGS2132089), and the US Department of Energy (DE-SC0019000).",,68,1,1,22,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2095-5138,2053-714X,,NATL SCI REV,Natl.

Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure. This fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control.","[Jess, Brandi; Brusey, James; Gaura, Elena; Gyamfi, Kojo Sarfo] Coventry Univ, Ctr Computat Sci & Math Modeling, Coventry, England; [Rostagno, Matteo Maria; Merlo, Alberto Maria] Ctr Ric Fiat SCpA, Orbassano, Italy",Coventry University; FCA Group,"Jess, B (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Ctr Computat Sci & Math Modeling, Coventry, England.",jessb@uni.coventry.ac.uk,,"Jess, Brandi/0000-0003-1316-8016",,,,,29,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-3079,,FRONT MECH ENG-SWITZ,Front.

Considering the seafood industry discards half of its fish-product mass in the ocean, a proper valorization of its residues would decrease not only the ocean contamination but also improve the management of marine resources and increase the sector competitiveness. With these goals in mind, ocean-based industries are adopting new sustainable production models, similar to biorefineries, which are effective for waste valorization, namely, converting low-value biomass into commercially relevant by-products. Based on a deeper knowledge of aquatic feedstocks, the development and implementation of a marine biorefinery can be fundamental to consolidate a greener socioeconomic development, similar to that observed in green chemistry. However, biorefineries are sophisticated multi-step systems with numerous feedstocks and commodities. Therefore, their implementation requires expertise in all stages of manufacturing, in addition to a clear vision of all raw materials, residues, and products. In this sense, with this perspective, we provide an initial overview of the current state-of-the-art on marine biorefineries and the sources and applications of their by-products. Afterward, we suggest how to integrate green chemistry and blue economy principles into ocean-based industries, aiming to support a more sustainable, profitable, and conscious ocean economy.","[Verissimo, Nathalia Vieira; Mussagy, Cassamo Ussemane; Nobrega Mendonca, Carlos Miguel; Pessoa Junior, Adalberto; de Souza Oliveira, Ricardo Pinheiro] Sao Paulo Univ USP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Av Prof Linen Prestes 580,B16,Cidade Univ, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Oshiro, Ariane Alves; Santos-Ebinuma, Valeria de Carvalho; Brandao Pereira, Jorge Fernando] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Engn Bioproc & Biotechnol, Rodovia Araraquara Jau Km 01, BR-14800903 Araraquara, SP, Brazil; [Brandao Pereira, Jorge Fernando] Univ Coimbra, Dept Chem Engn, CIEPQPF, Rua Silvio Lima,Polo 2 Pinhal de Marrocos, P-3030790 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade de Coimbra,"Pereira, JFB (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Engn Bioproc & Biotechnol, Rodovia Araraquara Jau Km 01, BR-14800903 Araraquara, SP, Brazil.;Pereira, JFB (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Chem Engn, CIEPQPF, Rua Silvio Lima,Polo 2 Pinhal de Marrocos, P-3030790 Coimbra, Portugal.",jfbpereira@eq.uc.pt,"Pereira, Jorge F.

Energy management of systems having such a high inertia can be improved by optimizing the restart time thanks to both occupancy and weather anticipation. Predictive control is suitable for systems with numerous constrained inputs and outputs whose objective function varies over time such as buildings with intermittent occupancy. This work proposes to use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) for one TABS in particular: a floor heating system (FHS) of an experimental building. Conventional control techniques and a state of the art on the predictive control of FHS are presented. A complete control loop (sensor, actuator, controller) was implemented on an experimental room. The predictive controller that integrate the model selected in Part I is compared with two conventional control strategies. The energy saving potential of the predictive controller is confirmed by both local experimentation and simulation on three climates. The energy saving is close to 40% over the whole heating season with an improved or equivalent comfort situation compared to the other two reference strategies. The absolute gain is constant over the heating period but the most significant relative gains are obtained in the mid-season. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is a large opportunity for the Australian turfgrass industry to play a role in providing solutions to Australia's land stabilisation issues. If 10% of these denuded landscapes can be vegetated by turfgrasses, the turfgrass industry as a whole can benefit greatly, particularly in the current economic climate, where the hangover from the global financial crisis has persisted. Collectively, the areas to be stabilised are enormous and to date the methods used to revegetate these land masses are limited. Hydrosprigging (HS) is an inexpensive, automated method of delivering grass sprigs (stolons) with a hydraulic pump to large areas of bare soil. In this study, we present our latest research on developing state-of-the-art HS methods. Significant differences for stolon sprouting of up to about 30% were identified among 12 bermudagrass genotypes harvested from the field. We hypothesise that the sprouting potential and vigour of shoots may be a function of the levels of nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) present in the stolons at the time of planting. We also suggest that photothermal quotient, the ratio of solar radiation to temperature during the growing period, may provide the theoretical basis for predicting when levels of NSC may be optimum through the growing season.","[Tran, T.

The present study is focused on the major winter storms that occurred in December 2013 and January 2014. The wave prediction system used for simulations is based on two state-of-the-art spectral phase averaged wave models. For the wave generation at ocean scale WAM (WAve prediction Model) was used, while for the coastal transformation SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) model was applied. Both wave models were forced with the reanalysis wind field of NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2. The comparison of the in situ measured and modelled wave parameters showed that, in general, the extreme wave conditions were predicted with a reasonable accuracy. Nevertheless, both under evaluations and over evaluations of the significant wave heights have been noticed in the case of the extreme peaks. In order to correct such situations a data assimilation scheme for the multi satellite altimeter data has been implemented. This data assimilation scheme was applied only to the significant wave height fields that are output of the SWAN model, generating the analysis fields. Furthermore, the impact of the data assimilation on the wave predictions has been evaluated by performing comparisons against buoy measurements. The results show very clearly that the statistical parameters are considerably better in the case of the assimilated significant wave heights.","[Rusu, L.; Soares, C.

The GU model mainly attempts to address challenges encountered by dynamically changing cities around the globe due to the reduced number of urban greeneries transforming into built-up areas. A framework has been designed to develop a greenery-based conceptual model (GBCM) towards attaining sustainable healthy livable (SHL) environment. The model is discussed in terms of greenery-based urban strategies and methodologies to deal with the social and economic contexts particularly in Dhaka city. In this context, we first revisit the present state-of-the-art of greeneries in Dhaka, then examine whether Dhaka a SHL-city and finally, an attempt has been taken to revive GU in Dhaka to bring a sustainable healthy environment. The model has reconfirmed that greeneries are the roots of adopting green urbanism which could bring a number of fundamental environmental benefits including reduction in energy use, pollution, waste generation, emission of greenhouse gas, impacts on climate and occurrence of natural disasters etc. The model thus developed has an implication on how city planners can adapt a priori approach to ensure sustainable health of populations combating unprecedented social, economic and environmental challenges that make cities unsustainable, unhealthy, and unlivable (3U-cities) due to insufficient greeneries.","[Neema, M.

Continuous monitoring of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) primarily relies on passive microwave images. However, passive microwave images have coarse spatial resolution, resulting in SIC production with significant blurring at the ice-water divides. In this article, a novel multi-image super-resolution (MISR) network called progressive multiscale deformable residual network (PMDRnet) is proposed to improve the spatial resolution of sea ice passive microwave images according to the characteristics of both passive microwave images and sea ice motions. To achieve image alignment with complex and large Arctic sea ice motions, we design a novel alignment module that includes a progressive alignment strategy and a multiscale deformable convolution alignment unit. In addition, the temporal attention mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the effective spatiotemporal information across image sequence. The sea ice-related loss function is designed to provide more detailed sea ice information of the network to improve super-resolution performance and further benefit finer Arctic SIC results. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDRnet significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art MISR methods and can generate super-resolved SIC products with finer texture features and much sharper sea ice edges. The code and datasets of PMDRnet are available at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k3j9kd590.","[Liu, Xiaomin; Feng, Tiantian; Shen, Xiaofan; Li, Rongxing] Tongji Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Sustainable Dev Applic, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Feng, TT (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Sustainable Dev Applic, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",14xiaomin@tongji.edu.cn; fengtiantian@tongji.edu.cn; lunashen0920@foxmail.com; rli@tongji.edu.cn,,"Li, Rongxing/0000-0001-9837-5115; Liu, Xiaomin/0000-0002-3199-0735","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603100]; National Science Foundation of China [41801335, 41941006]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFA0603100 and in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 41801335 and Grant 41941006.,,62,0,0,10,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

Accurately obtaining soil crack networks is essential to understand the cracking mechanism. Inspired by recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in computer vision, we propose a new automatic soil crack recognition method based a novel network architecture, named Attention Res-UNet. Deep Res-UNet inherits both the advantages from residual learning for training deeper networks and U-Net for semantic segmentation. Moreover, attention mechanism is utilized to alleviate the influences caused by the uneven illumination conditions. Firstly, the soil crack images under different uneven illumination conditions are collected to create a new soil cracking image dataset. Then, traditional method and multiple state-of-the-art deep learning based different semantic segmentation models are tested on our collected dataset. Finally, a professional evaluation standard, which considers both the overall metrics (precision, recall, dice, surface crack ratio) and details (crack total length, average crack width, number of crack segments) of the soil crack features is proposed to evaluate the recognition results of the different models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Attention Res-UNet approach compared with traditional methods and other deep learning models in recognizing soil cracks under complex environmental conditions. Our method is also suitable for crack recognition of other materials under complex environmental conditions.","[Xu, Jin-Jian; Tang, Chao-Sheng; Cheng, Qing; Tian, Ben-gang; Liu, Bo; Shi, Bin] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hao] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Tang, CS (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",Xujianjian@smail.nju.edu.cn; haozhangcn@nuaa.edu.cn; tangchaosheng@nju.edu.cn; chengqing@nju.edu.cn; tianbengang@smail.nju.edu.cn; liubo@smail.nju.edu.cn; shibin@nju.edu.cn,"Zhang, Hao/AAP-9462-2020","Zhang, Hao/0000-0003-1923-589X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC1509902, 2020YFC1808101, 2020YFC1808000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41925012, 41902271, 41772280]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20211087]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Acknowledgments All data in this study are available online (https://doi.org/10 .17632/nvrpk43zsm.1) .

However, due to the highly dynamic technology and manufacturing developments, there is a lack of understanding of the stateof-the-art global FCV industry chain and associated supply risks. This study fills such a research gap by mapping global FCV industry chain during the period 2017e2019, and assessing the supply risks of relevant key commodities. The results show that significant supply risks existed in global FCV industry chain, especially in upstream commodities like platinum and gas diffusion layer (GDL). The combined indicator of Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and Worldwide Governance-Indicator (HHI-WGI) is used to quantify the supply risks, showing that HHI-WGI of platinum is on the highest level. On the national level, supply risks are identified primarily in platinum for Japan, in vehicles for the United States, and along the entire industry chain for China. Network analysis is conducted to visualize and analyze how countries, companies and commodities are connected, showing that the highest supply risks were identified in GDLs. It is recommended that country-specific measures should be taken to mitigate supply risks, including building up national stocks of critical materials, investing overseas, enhancing the guidance over industry policies, and stepping up infrastructure construction.

However, a major challenge lies in the slow kinetics of Li-ion intercalation/extraction within metal-oxide electrodes. Here, it is shown that ultrafast charge storage is realized by confining anatase TiO2 nanoparticles in carbon nanopores to enable a high-rate anode for Li-HSCs. The porous carbon with interconnected pore walls and open channels not only works as a conductive host to protect TiO2 from structural degradation but also provides fast pathways for ion/electron transport. As a result, the assembled cells exhibit remarkable rate capabilities with a specific capacity of approximate to 140 mAh g(-1) at a slow charge and approximate to 60 mAh g(-1) at a 3.5 s fast charge. While the charge/discharge process can be completed as fast as that of state-of-the-art electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), the produced nanocomposites show three to seven times higher volumetric capacitance than activated carbons used in commercial EDLCs with acetonitrile-based electrolytes. Equally important for some applications in cold climates or the space, the Li-HSCs can operate at subzero temperatures as low as -40 degrees C, which is likely only limited by thermal properties of the acetonitrile (melting point of -45 degrees C).","[Fu, Wenbin; Ma, Ruiying; Yang, Yang; Magasinski, Alexandre; Yushin, Gleb] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhao, Enbo; Sun, Zifei] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Sevilla, Marta; Fuertes, Antonio B.] CSIC, Inst Nacl Carbon, Fco Pintado Fe 26, Oviedo 33011, Spain",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Ciencia Tecnologia del Carbono INCAR-CSIC,"Yushin, G (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",yushin@gatech.edu,"Fuertes, Antonio B/H-6905-2015; Solis, Marta Sevilla/H-7674-2015; Sun, Zifei/GRF-0634-2022","Fuertes, Antonio B/0000-0002-5931-1669; Solis, Marta Sevilla/0000-0002-2471-2403; Yushin, Gleb/0000-0002-3274-9265","Sila Nanotechnologies, Inc., a Georgia Tech startup","Sila Nanotechnologies, Inc., a Georgia Tech startup","W.F. and E.Z. contributed equally to this work.

In this study, all these challenges were overcome by selectively and chemically assembly of oxygen-deficient Bi2WO6 nanosheets onto BiOI nanosheets, forming a novel surface defect-engineered 2D/2D motif with builtin nanoscale p-n heterojunctions. This rational cascade configuration with internal electric field renders ultrafast directional migration and spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the oxygen vacant sites with abundant trapped electrons serve as the active sites for CO2 reduction and extend the light absorption of the photocatalytic system to NIR region. Combining these propitious properties, our delineated nanoscale p-n heterojunction on the basis of 2D/2D assembly of surface defect-engineered nanosheets presents a new and unprecedented concept for effective generation of charge carriers, directional steering of charge flow and manipulation of surface active sites, which cooperatively lead to superior photocatalytic performance. Notably, our developed oxygen-deficient Bi2WO6/BiOI binanosheets exhibit a remarkably high production yield of CH4, which represents the state-of-the-art visible light-driven CH4 production activity among all the existing 2D BiOI-based and Bi2WO6-based composites.","[Kong, Xin Ying; Lee, Wai Qin; Chai, Siang-Piao] Monash Univ, Sch Engn, Chem Engn Discipline, Multidisciplinary Platform Adv Engn, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mohamed, Abdul Rahman] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Engn, LCE Grp, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Chai, SP (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Engn, Chem Engn Discipline, Multidisciplinary Platform Adv Engn, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.",chai.siang.piao@monash.edu,"Chai, Siang-Piao/J-1596-2014; Mohamed, Abdul Rahman/A-9667-2010","Chai, Siang-Piao/0000-0002-8635-1762",Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under NanoMITe Long-term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) [203/PJKIMIA/6720009],Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under NanoMITe Long-term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS),This work was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under NanoMITe Long-term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) (Ref. no.: 203/PJKIMIA/6720009).,,65,138,140,69,682,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Recently, several cities have enacted laws mandating owners of large buildings to publicly display an energy efficiency rating for their properties. While such transparency is necessary for market-driven energy reduction policies, the reliance on public-facing energy efficiency grades raises non-trivial questions about the robustness and reliability of methods used to measure and benchmark the energy performance of existing buildings. In this paper, we develop a building energy performance grading methodology using machine learning and city-specific energy use and building data. Leveraging the growing availability of data from city energy disclosure ordinances, we develop the GREEN grading system: a framework to facilitate more accurate, fair, and contextualized building energy benchmarks that account for variations in the expected and actual performance of individual buildings. When applied to approximately 7500 residential properties in New York City, our approach accounts for the differential impact of design, occupancy, use, and systems on energy performance, out-performing existing state-of-the-art methods. Our model and findings reinforce the need for more robust, localized approaches to building energy performance grading that can serve as the basis for data-driven urban energy efficiency and carbon reeduction policies.","[Papadopoulos, Sokratis; Kontokosta, Constantine E.] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 370 Jay St,12th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Papadopoulos, Sokratis; Kontokosta, Constantine E.] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, 370 Jay St,12th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York University,"Kontokosta, CE (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 370 Jay St,12th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",ckontokosta@nyu.edu,,"Kontokosta, Constantine/0000-0003-4831-9996",National Science Foundation [1653772],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors would like to thank the NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability for access to relevant datasets, and for comments on early versions of the methodology.

A significant contribution to non-reproducibility is rounding error introduced into calculations by the non-associativity of floating point addition. Scientific applications that rely on accumulation of many small values, such as climate and N-body simulations, are susceptible to this type of error. This paper proposes a variant of an existing fixed-point method for real number summation that yields sums with perfect precision, and which are invariant to summation order and system architecture. The new method improves upon the existing technique by exhibiting improved performance for large numbers of summands, introducing tunable fractional precision to place precision where it is needed, and eliminating the aliasing problem of the original method. The proposed technique is described and its performance is demonstrated in the OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, and Xeon Phi parallel programming environments. In particular, the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art for larger problems involving over one million summands at high precision. With the anticipated convergence of exascale high-performance computing and big data analytics on hybrid architectures, computational reproducibility will become an even more difficult problem than it is today. Use of numerical techniques such as the method proposed here can help to mitigate the impact of error and variation within simulations at these large scales.","[Small, Patrick E.; Kalia, Rajiv K.; Nakano, Aiichiro; Vashishta, Priya] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Dept Comp Sci,Collaboratory Adv Comp & Simulat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Small, PE (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Dept Comp Sci,Collaboratory Adv Comp & Simulat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",patrices@usc.edu; rkalia@usc.edu; anakano@usc.edu; priyav@usc.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1530-2075,,978-1-5090-2140-6,INT PARALL DISTRIB P,,,2016,,,,,152,160,,10.1109/IPDPS.2016.41,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2016.41,,,9,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BG7EZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000391251800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among many potential solutions, advances in membrane technology afford direct, effective and feasible approaches to solve these sophisticated issues. Membrane technology encompasses numerous technology areas including materials science and engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, separation and purification phenomena, molecular simulation, as well as process and product design. Currently, polymeric hollow fiber membranes made using a non-solvent-induced phase inversion process are the dominant products because polymers offer a broad spectrum of materials chemistry and result in membranes with desirable physicochemical properties for diverse applications. Their low cost and ease of fabrication make polymeric membranes superior to inorganic membranes. Therefore, this review focuses on state-of-the-art polymeric hollow fiber membranes made from non-solvent-induced phase inversion and the potential of membrane processes for sustainable water and energy production. The specific topics include: (i) basic principles of hollow fiber membrane formation and the phase inversion process; (ii) membranes for energy (natural gas, H-2, and biofuel) production; (iii) membranes for CO2 capture; and (iv) emerging desalination technologies (forward osmosis and membrane distillation) for water production. Finally, future opportunities and challenges for the development of advanced membrane structures are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Its apolitical stance, inspired to a large extent by the Catholic philosophy of personalism, meant that within certain limits it enjoyed remarkable freedom. This article considers Tygodnik's place in the early postwar Polish landscape, including its avowedly apolitical approach (dubbed minimalism) as it compared with that of other Catholic groups, how it dealt with increasing communist pressure, and what it managed to achieve before its closure. Among Tygodnik's primary concerns were the defence of Polish society and culture against the war's lingering psychological aftereffects, for example by encouraging discussions of what now would be called society's post-traumatic shock, and reconciliation with the Germans. The newspaper also sought to defend Polish culture against communisation, in part by providing a forum for unconventional writers (who were at least nominally Catholic), resisting socialist realism and publishing information on nonsocialist-realist art and music, and addressing the changes being implemented by the communists in terms of secularisation. With mounting pressure, however, Tygodnik found it increasingly difficult to make acceptable compromises, until finally in 1953 its editorial board deemed it impossible to continue its coexistence with the communist regime. As a result, it was closed by authorities until a change in the political climate enabled Tygodnik to renew publication in 1956.",,,"Manetti, C (corresponding author), POB 99097, Lakewood, WA 98496 USA.",manetti@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,45,3,3,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0888-3254,,,E EUR POLIT SOC,East Eur.

Nowadays, aerosol particles are detected, quantified and monitored by remote sensing techniques using low Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary (GEO) satellites. In the present article, the use of satellite-derived AOD (aerosol optical depth) products is investigated in order to quantify on a daily basis the ARF at the surface level (SARF). By daily basis we mean that an average SARF value is computed every day based upon the available AOD satellite measurements for each station. In the first part of the study, the performance of four state-of-art different AOD products (MODIS-DT, MODIS-DB, MISR, and SEVIRI) is assessed through comparison against ground-based AOD measurements from 24 AERONET stations located in Europe and Africa during a 6-month period. While all AOD products are found to be comparable in terms of measured value (RMSE of 0.1 for low and average AOD values), a higher number of AOD estimates is made available by GEO satellites due to their enhanced frequency of scan. Experiments show a general lower agreement of AOD estimates over the African sites (RMSE of 0.2), which show the highest aerosol concentrations along with the occurrence of dust aerosols, coarse particles, and bright surfaces. In the second part of this study, the lessons learned about the confidence in aerosol burden derived from satellites are used to estimate SARF under clear sky conditions. While the use of AOD products issued from GEO observations like SEVIRI brings improvement in the SARF estimates with regard to LEO-based AOD products, the resulting absolute bias (13 W/m(2) in average when AERONET AOD is used as reference) is judged to be still high in comparison with the average values of SARF found in this study (from -25 W/m(2) to -43 W/m(2)) and also in the literature (from -10 W/m(2) to -47 W/m(2)).

Also, the technological uses of carbon dioxide are emergent to the earlier realization of the Paris Climate Agreement. This research was innovatively designed to produce carbon nanofibers from Wyoming Powder-River-Basin coal-derived supercritical extraction liquid (referred to raw coal tar) along with predetermined percentages of polyacrylonitrile by electrospinning, fiber stabilization with carbon dioxide, and subsequent carbonization treatment. The effects of raw coal tar additives to polyacrylonitrile nanofibers regarding the structural, textural and surface properties were investigated. Attenuated total reflection and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform analyses reveal the difference in the dynamic evolution pathways of surface functional groups during the state-of-the-art oxygen-based and the new carbon dioxide-based fiber stabilization processes. In terms of mechanical properties, raw coal tar modifications give significant rise to the tensile strength of annealed polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, regardless of oxidative stabilization options. Additionally, the synergy of raw coal tar containing (30 wt %) polymeric precursor and carbon dioxide stabilization produces carbon nanofibers with a superior area-normalized electric double-layer capacitance of 1408.9 mu F/cm(2), which is approximately 4 times higher than the oxygen-stabilized pure polyacrylonitrile-derived ones.

However, the cessation of industrial production creates a need for redevelopment of the altered areas in order to counteract both irreversible environmental damage and visual changes affecting the natural landscape. The effects of soil bioengineering techniques on the redevelopment of disused quarries and their effectiveness in enhancing erosion control and slope stabilization are analyzed, showing on the one hand their variability in association with parameters such as latitude, climate, and so on, and on the other hand their positive influence on the environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of soil bioengineering strategies, focusing on how their development could be affected by geographical conditions. For this reason, the current state of the art has been examined in two different European contexts. Austria, in the central European region, and then Spain, in the Euro-Mediterranean Region, have been taken into consideration. Some indicators have also been introduced in order to compare the usefulness of soil bioengineering techniques in these regions with the current situation in Italy. In light of the above, the valuable impact of soil bioengineering on the environment has been highlighted, and conclusive recommendations include the integration of soil bioengineering techniques with projects for the redevelopment of altered and degraded areas.","[Furcas, Carla; Balletto, Ginevra] Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Architecture, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Furcas, C (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Architecture, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",,"BALLETTO, GINEVRA/AAD-1498-2022; Furcas, Carla/D-9494-2011","BALLETTO, GINEVRA/0000-0003-0876-0605; Furcas, Carla/0000-0002-8039-6089",,,,,20,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2012,,,,,757,764,,,,,,8,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,BB9OZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000348536400102,View Full Record in Web of Science

Technologies for environmental remediation are thus becoming increasingly important. One very promising class of candidate materials for these applications is Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Owing to their ultrahigh surface areas and the tunability of their chemical structures, these porous materials show enormous promise in catalysis, adsorption and separations. To date, MOFs have not been well represented in industry, in part due to difficulties in shaping and handling the polycrystalline powders. 3D printing offers a powerful and versatile approach to shape MOFs into monoliths with a broad range of uses from gas storage and separations to light generation. This review focuses on recent progress in shaping MOFs via 3D printing with the current state-of-the-art in energy and environmental applications. Several techniques are examined including Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), Digital Light Processing (DLP), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and direct ink writing (also know as robocasting). At present, the latter technique is most compatible with MOFs and is represented in almost every application examined herein. However, more complex techniques, such as DLP and SLS, show great promise, and as the techniques continue to develop may also become prominent methods for shaping industrially applied MOF-based technologies.","[Kearns, Eleanor R.; D'Alessandro, Deanna M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Chem, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Gillespie, Rohan] Southern Green Gas Ltd, DFK Kidsons, Level 6-30 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",University of Sydney,"D'Alessandro, DM (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Chem, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",deanna.dalessandro@sydney.edu.au,"D'Alessandro, Deanna/H-7593-2013","D'Alessandro, Deanna/0000-0002-1497-2543",Australian Research Council [FT170100283],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),DMD gratefully acknowledges the support of the Australian Research Council (FT170100283).,,105,6,6,39,95,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7488,2050-7496,,J MATER CHEM A,J.

Several biofuels are successful in addressing environmental concerns, but some create skepticism on their global sustain ability. This study is built around key topics related to four generation biofuels development, aiming to highlight advantages, drawbacks, negative externalities, and constraints, for their effective commercialization. It offers a short state-of-the-art review of terrestrial and marine biomass conversion into automotive and jet biofuels, and focuses on the biochemical and thermochemical conversion pathways and the role of processing conditions to maximize the production of renewable fuels. It concludes that there is still no clear answer on which generation biofuels meets the global sustainability criteria better. In all cases, it is important to take into account the scale of economy, bioresources availability and planetary boundaries for biomass supply, to design viable technologies and consider the Food-Energy Water and Carbon-Nitrogen Nexus challenges. Although the European Commission is looking at cost-efficient ways to make the European economy more climate-friendly and less energy-consuming by addressing the importance of biomass availability, proper legislation must deal with the multifaceted confrontation of the global sustainability which should also be driven by the socio-economic criteria.

In the prior-art grid resilience studies, the hurricanes or wildfires are mainly defended in terms of expected line damages, while they are prone to trigger short-circuit fault (SCF) evolved with dynamic influence in reality. In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost. The proposed model and techniques are validated using the IEEE 39-bus New-England test system and realistic meteorological data.","[Guo, Chao; Ye, Chengjin; Ding, Yi] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Wang, Peng] Sch Nanyang Technol Univ, Elect & Elect Engn Sch, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Zhejiang University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Ye, CJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.",11710014@zju.edu.cn; yechenjing@zju.edu.cn; yiding@zju.edu.cn; epwang@ntu.edu.sg,"WANG, Peng/GSN-5263-2022","Chengjin, YE/0000-0002-6449-8384",China NSFC [51807173],China NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The work was supported by the China NSFC under Grant 51807173.

A series of state-of-the-art geological, geo-mechanical, hydrogeological and computational models supported by experimental tests and techno-economical assessments have been developed for the evaluation of UCG-CCS schemes. Research efforts have been focused on the development of site selection requirements for UCG-CCS, estimation of CO2 storage volumes, review of the practical engineering requirements for developing a commercial UCG-CCS storage site, consideration of drilling and completion issues, and assessments of economic feasibility and environmental impacts of the scheme. In addition, the risks of subsidence and groundwater contamination have been assessed in order to pave the way for a full-scale trial and commercial applications. The current research confirms that cleaner and cheaper energy with reduced emissions can be achieved and the economics are competitive in the future European energy market. However the current research has established that rigorous design and monitor schemes are essential for productivity and safety and the minimisation of the potential environmental impacts. A platform has been established serving to inform policy-makers and aiding strategies devised to alleviate local and global impacts on climate change, while ensuring that energy resources are optimally harnessed.","[Sheng, Yong; Eshiet, Kenneth Imo-Imo; Sarhosis, Vasilis; Yang, Dongmin] Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Green, Michael] UCG Engn Ltd, Meadow House,17 Brighton Rd, London KT6 5LR, England; [Kempka, Thomas; Nakaten, Natalie] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect 5-3 Hydrogeol, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Gorka, Torsten; Schlueter, Ralph] DMT GmbH & Co KG, Technol Pk 1, D-45307 Essen, Germany; [Bukolska, Donka; Hristov, Nikolay; Kortenski, Jordan] Overgas Inc AD, 5 Philip Kutev St, Sofia 1407, Bulgaria; [Katsimpardi, Ismini; Koukouzas, Nikolaos] Chem Proc & Energy Resources Inst CERTH CPERI, Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Egialias 52, GR-15125 Athens, Greece; [da Gama, Carlos Dinis; Torres, Vidal Navarro; Verissimo, Ana Carina] Inst Super Tecn, Pavilhao Minas,3 Piso Av RoviscoPais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Benderev, Aleksey; Vesselinov, Velemir] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Geol, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria",University of Leeds; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Sheng, Y (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",y.sheng@leeds.ac.uk; aleksey@geology.bas.bg; donka_bukolska@overgas.bg; k.i.i.eshiet@leeds.ac.uk; dgama@ist.utl.pt; Torsten.Gorka@dmt.de; michael.green@ucgengineering.com; Nikolai_Hristov@overgas.bg; katsimpardi@certh.gr; kempka@gfz-potsdam.de; jordan_kortenski@abv.bg; koukouzas@certh.gr; natalie@gfz-potsdam.de; sarhosisv@Cardiff.ac.uk; Ralph.Schlueter@dmt.de; vntorres@ist.utl.pt; carina.verissimo@gmail.com; velimir.vesselinov@gmail.com; d.yang@leeds.ac.uk,"Sarhosis, Vasilis/AAR-6142-2021; Vesselinov, Velimir/P-4724-2016; Kempka, Thomas/F-1910-2015","Vesselinov, Velimir/0000-0002-6222-0530; Kempka, Thomas/0000-0001-6317-5113; Sarhosis, Vasilis/0000-0003-4495-9902; Kortenski, Jordan/0000-0002-7588-992X; Hristov, Nikolay/0000-0001-8242-6758; Nakaten, Natalie Christine/0000-0002-4558-982X; Yang, Dongmin/0000-0002-4811-5443; Sarhosis, Vasileios/0000-0002-5748-7679",European Commission [RFC-PR-09022],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was supported by the European Commission, Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) under the grant RFC-PR-09022.

Advanced imaging technologies coupled with automation make HT phenotyping in the greenhouse not only feasible, but practical. Monsanto has a state of the art automated greenhouse (AGH) facility. Handling of the soil, pots water and nutrients are all completely automated. Images of the plants are acquired by multiple hyperspectral and broadband cameras. The hyperspectral cameras cover wavelengths from visible light through short wave infra-red (SWIR). In-house developed software analyzes the images to measure plant morphological and biochemical properties. We measure phenotypic metrics like plant area, height, and width as well as biomass. Hyperspectral imaging allows us to measure biochemcical metrics such as chlorophyll, anthocyanin, and foliar water content. The last 4 years of AGH operations on crops like corn, soybean, and cotton have demonstrated successful application of imaging and analysis technologies for high throughput plant phenotyping.

Plants are produced year-round in greenhouses by maintaining the environment at or near optimum levels regardless of extreme weather conditions. Many scientific discoveries and technological advancements that happened in the past two centuries paved the way for current state-of-the-art greenhouses. These include, but are not limited to, advancements in climate-specific structural designs and glazing materials, and temperature control, artificial lighting, and hydroponic production systems. Greenhouse structures can be broadly grouped into four distinct designs, including tall Venlo greenhouses of the Netherlands, passive solar greenhouses of China, low-cost Parral greenhouses of the Mediterranean region, and gutter-connected polyethylene houses of India and African countries. These designs were developed to suit local climatic conditions and maximize the return on investment. Although glass and rigid plastic options are available for glazing, the development of low-cost and lightweight plastic glazing materials (e.g., polyethylene) enabled wide-spread growth of the greenhouse industry in the developing world. For temperate regions, supplemental lighting technology is crucial for year-round production. This heavily relies on advancements in electro-lighting during the 19th and 20th centuries. The development of hydroponic production systems for the controlled delivery of nutrients further enhanced crop productivity.

To bridge this gap, we build on a multidisciplinary collaboration exploring the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and open access multispectral satellite imagery, for quantifying the archaeological evidence located within a prospective reservoir area before dam construction. Based on previous research by Marchetti (2020) claiming the necessity for ad hoc protocols to document and monitor the impact of dams on cultural heritage, we selected two complementary situations: the planned dam of Halabiyeh in Syria and the under construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. These case studies were analyzed with state-of-the-art methodologies to develop a feasible workflow that may contribute to fostering the use of satellite imagery in operational contexts such as those represented by these particular cases, and be replicated by archaeologists in other areas. The workflow is designed to be integrated to ground-truthing methodologies into two dedicated protocols named Pre-Construction Archaeological Risk Assessment (PCARA) and Pre-Flooding Rescue Archaeological Program (PFRAP) which could eventually become a standard procedure for rescue archaeology in dams areas.","[Zaina, Federico] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Tapete, Deodato] Italian Space Agcy ASI, Via Politecn Snc, I-00133 Rome, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI),"Tapete, D (corresponding author), Italian Space Agcy ASI, Via Politecn Snc, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",federico.zaina@polimi.it; deodato.tapete@asi.it,"Tapete, Deodato/AAB-7528-2021","Tapete, Deodato/0000-0002-7242-4473; Zaina, Federico/0000-0003-1525-1462",,,,,86,4,4,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2022,4,,,,,,1009,10.3390/rs14041009,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14041009,,,26,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,ZN5RO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000765091500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the state-of-the-art of teamwork literature in SAE. A total of 37 research papers were reviewed and the results were organized according to the input-mediator-output-input (IMOI) framework. Findings Based on 37 empirical research papers, the findings suggest that the teams working in SAE are challenged with contextual (e.g. time, isolation and confinement), collective (e.g. autonomy, culture) and individual (e.g. personality) attributes. These are inputs to team processes (e.g. interpersonal processes; communication) and emergent states (e.g. climate; emotions), which mediate team (e.g. performance; cohesion) and individual (e.g. psychological well-being) outputs. Research limitations/implications Given the review nature of the manuscript, the final proposed model depicting empirical findings lacks validation evidence when considered in its entirety, although pieces have been validated.

Breeding climate-smart and stress-tolerant cultivars is considered the most suitable way to accelerate barley improvement. However, the conventional breeding framework needs to be changed to facilitate genomics-based breeding of barley. The continuous progress in genomics has opened up new avenues and tools that are promising for making barley breeding more precise and efficient. For instance, reference genome assemblies in combination with germplasm sequencing to delineate breeding have led to the development of more efficient barley cultivars. Genetic analysis, such as QTL mapping and GWAS studies using sequencing approaches, have led to the identification of molecular markers, genomic regions and novel genes associated with the agronomic traits of barley. Furthermore, SNP marker technologies and haplotype-based GWAS have become the most applied methods for supporting molecular breeding in barley. The genetic information is also used for high-efficiency gene editing by means of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, the best example of which is the cv. Golden Promise. In this review, we summarize the genomic databases that have been developed for barley and explain how the genetic resources of the reference genome, the available state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools, and the most recent assembly of a barley pan-genome will boost the genomics-based breeding for barley improvement.","[Riaz, Asad; Kanwal, Farah; Dai, Fei] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Agr & Biotechnol, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Boerner, Andreas] Leibniz Inst Plant Genet & Crop Plant Res IPK, Corrensstr 3, D-06466 Gatersleben, Germany; [Boerner, Andreas; Pillen, Klaus; Alqudah, Ahmad M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Betty Heimann Str 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Zhejiang University; Leibniz Institut fur Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Dai, F (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Agr & Biotechnol, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.;Alqudah, AM (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Betty Heimann Str 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",asad.riaz76@gmail.com; 11816105@zju.edu.cn; boerner@ipk-gatersleben.de; klaus.pillen@landw.uni-halle.de; daifeijx@163.com; ahmad.alqudah@landw.uni-halle.de,"Pillen, Klaus/I-6511-2012; Alqudah, Ahmad M./I-7062-2012","Pillen, Klaus/0000-0003-4646-6351; Alqudah, Ahmad M./0000-0002-0436-9724; Riaz, Asad/0000-0002-4561-1783",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFD1000706]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31871607]; German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) IPAS grant BARLEY-DIVERSITY [FZ 031A352A],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) IPAS grant BARLEY-DIVERSITY(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFD1000706), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31871607), and the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) IPAS grant BARLEY-DIVERSITY (FZ 031A352A).",,109,4,4,8,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,MAY,2021,5,,,,,,894,10.3390/agronomy11050894,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11050894,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,SG2XB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000653305400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, we explore the potential of a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast system to predict wave conditions, particularly significant wave height. Since this information is not directly provided by models, a statistical downscaling method is applied to infer significant wave height based on model outputs such as sea level pressure, which drive waves over large wave generation areas beyond the target location over time. This method may be beneficial for seasonal forecasting since skill from wide generation areas can be propagated to wave conditions in (distant and smaller) target regions. We consider seasonal predictions with a one-month lead time of the CFSv2 hindcast in two regions: the Western Pacific around Indonesia during the June-July-August (JJA) season and the North Atlantic Ocean during the January-February-March (JFM) season. In the former case, skillful predictions are found, which are higher during decay years after ENSO warm phases when a negative anomaly of the significant wave height is expected. In contrast, statistical downscaling in the North Atlantic Ocean cannot add value to the signal given by the predictor, which is also very weak.","[Camus, P.; Losada, I.

One of the key technologies toward a higher implementation of biomass is thermal gasification, which enables a wide span of downstream applications. In order to improve efficiencies, flexibility and possibly costs of current biomass power generating systems, a power plant concept combining solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and gasification is investigated experimentally. The aim of the study is to examine the commercial operation system potential of these two technologies. Investigations are done by combining the commercial TwoStage Viking gasifier developed at the Technical University of Denmark and a state-of-the-art SOFC stack from Topsoe Fuel Cell for high efficiency power generation. A total of 5 tests were performed including polarization tests at various gas flows to study part-load operation; and a longer test to investigate stability. The study shows experimentally the potential and feasibility of a SOFC-gasification system with a commercial gasifier and a SOFC stack by measuring the highest reported values of such a system, with biomass-to-electricity efficiencies up to 43%. Results from related modeling studies are also presented, showcasing the intriguing potential of the system with modeled cycle electric efficiencies up to 62%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical models provide a vital tool to explore these interactions, given their capability to investigate multiple connected components of the system and the sensitivity to multiple drivers, including potential future conditions. A major driver for ecosystem model development is the demand for quantitative tools to support ecosystem-based management initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to review approaches to the modelling of marine ecosystems with a focus on the North Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent shelf seas, and to highlight the challenges they face and suggest ways forward. We consider the state of the art in simulating oceans and shelf sea physics, planktonic and higher trophic level ecosystems, and look towards building an integrative approach with these existing tools. We note how the different approaches have evolved historically and that many of the previous obstacles to harmonisation may no longer be present.

Alexei Kurbanovsky argues that Freudianism would have seemed very tempting to those early Soviet theorists who believed that they must appropriate the relevant discoveries of western psychology and adopt them for their own revolutionary ends: creating the new communist man. The application of Freudian techniques to the analysis of some classical Russian writers as well as painters is documented in writings from the 1920s by Ivan Ermakov; the artistic tendencies of the Russian avant-garde were quite often viewed as reflecting the latest achievements of science and technology. So aspiring Soviet critics might well have attempted psychoanalytical readings of innovatory artifacts. Vladimir Tatlin stands as one of their possible model cases. Kurbanovsky argues that Tatlin's famous spiral tower could be psychoanalytically interpreted in reference to the Oedipal refutation of father-figures. Such an interpretation seems in tune with the general cultural climate where other phenomena (such as the October revolution) were seen as having a hidden, Freudian aspect. Examining the psychoanalytical underpinnings of the theory of Soviet avant-garde allows us to more fully appreciate its historical and cultural significance.",,,,,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,3,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SLAVIC STUDIES,CAMBRIDGE,"HARVARD UNIV, 8 STORY ST, 3RD FL, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",0037-6779,,,SLAVIC REV,Slavic Rev.,WIN,2008,4,,,,892,+,,10.2307/27653029,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/27653029,,,16,"Area Studies; Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Area Studies; Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,378XK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000261357900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This letter applies the diffusivity approximation on radiance measurements of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) to derive TOA infrared fluxes and compares these fluxes with the state-of-the-art CERES outgoing radiative fluxes. We find that the mean difference between the two kinds of instantaneous flux that were estimated at the window channel is similar to 1 W.m(-2), with a root-mean-square error of similar to 1.7 W.m(-2). This result shows that radiance measurement at a fixed VZA of 53 degrees is a simple and effective method in the remote sensing of the infrared flux for satellite missions that monitor some specific climate processes and require longwave/window TOA fluxes, such as the Broad Band Radiometer instrument on EarthCARE; however, this approach may involve errors from an inhomogeneous scene or non-Lambertian emission of the surface. A careful design of the VZA and scan mode, such as a conical scan at 53 degrees, would produce much more convenient infrared flux measurements for the Earth-atmosphere system than other designs.","[Sun, Wenbo] Hampton Univ, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Hampton, VA 23668 USA; [Sun, Wenbo; Hu, Yongxiang; Loeb, Norman G.; Lin, Bing; Mlynczak, Martin G.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA",Hampton University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center,"Sun, WB (corresponding author), Hampton Univ, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Hampton, VA 23668 USA.",w.sun@larc.nasa.gov,"Loeb, Norman/ABC-7817-2021; Hu, Yongxiang/K-4426-2012; Mlynczak, Martin/K-3396-2012; Hu, Yongxiang/M-9102-2019; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Hu, Yongxiang/0000-0001-8526-108X; Sun, Wenbo/0000-0002-9901-6031",,,,,13,0,0,1,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

Existing research is commonly based on either physics-based numerical models or data-based models. Physical modeling and machine learning are traditionally considered as two unrelated fields for the sea subsurface temperature prediction task, with very different scientific paradigms (physics-driven and data-driven). However, we believe that both methods are complementary to each other. Physical modeling methods can offer the potential for extrapolation beyond observational conditions, while data-driven methods are flexible in adapting to data and are capable of detecting unexpected patterns. The combination of both approaches is very attractive and offers potential performance improvement. In this article, we propose a novel framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a numerical model to predict sea subsurface temperature. First, a GAN-based model is used to learn the simplified physics between the surface temperature and the target subsurface temperature in the numerical model. Then, observation data are used to calibrate the GAN-based model parameters to obtain a better prediction. We evaluate the proposed framework by predicting daily sea subsurface temperature in the South China Sea. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.","[Meng, Yuxin; Rigall, Eric; Gao, Feng] Ocean Univ China, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xueen] Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Dong, Junyu] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Oceanog, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sheng] Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; University of Southampton,"Gao, F (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.;Dong, JY (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Oceanog, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",mengyuxin520@126.com; rigall1214397@163.com; xchen@ouc.edu.cn; gaofeng@ouc.edu.cn; dongjunyu@ouc.edu.cn; sqc@ecs.soton.ac.uk,"Chen, Sheng/F-7835-2011","Chen, Sheng/0000-0001-6882-600X; Dong, Junyu/0000-0001-7012-2087; Gao, Feng/0000-0002-1825-328X; Rigall, Eric/0000-0002-0882-814X",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018AAA0100602]; National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Projects of China [41927805],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Projects of China,This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018AAA0100602 and in part by the National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Projects of China under Grant 41927805.,,53,1,1,16,31,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

The assessment of the realistic potential for Norwegian hydropower to deliver flexibility is based on two pillars, adequate hydropower modelling and the sufficient geographical area covered in the model. Analyses are done with state-of-the-art models including a detailed description of cascaded water-courses with more than thousand reservoirs. Interoperability between hydropower and renewable energy sources is ensured as the entire European electricity generation from renewables with high geographic and temporal resolution is included in the study. To properly account for the full uncertainty of weather variables, many historic years of climate data are applied. The results show that without more flexibility in generation or demand, power prices become very volatile and show expedient periods with capacity deficit and curtailment of demand. Prices vary significantly both from hour-to-hour and from year-to-year. Increases in flexible hydropower provide large benefits to the system: significantly decreasing peak prices and reducing the involuntary shedding of demand. As short-term effects become increasingly important due to large-scale integration of renewable energy sources the correct modelling of flexible hydropower is highly important. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the on-going price increase of fossil resources, their uncertain availability, and their environmental concerns, the feasibility of oil exploitation is predicted to decrease in the near future. Therefore, alternative solutions able to mitigate climate change and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels should be promoted. The replacement of oil with biomass as raw material for fuel and chemical production is an interesting option and is the driving force for the development of biorefinery complexes. In biorefinery, almost all the types of biomass feedstocks can be converted to different classes of biofuels and biochemicals through jointly applied conversion technologies. This paper provides a description of the emerging biorefinery concept, in comparison with the current oil refinery. The focus is on the state of the art in bio-fuel and biochemical production, as well as discussion of the most important biomass feedstocks, conversion technologies and final products. Through the integration of green chemistry into biorefineries, and the use of low environmental impact technologies, future sustainable production chains of biofuels and high value chemicals from biomass can be established. The aim of this bio-industry is to be competitive in the market and lead to the progressive replacement of oil refinery products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of energy use in buildings is for the provision of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). High-level performance of HVAC systems in building lifecycle is critical to building sustainability. As a quality-oriented process, commissioning has been recognized as a valid means to improve performance of buildings and HVAC systems in both energy and environment aspects and should be conducted regularly or continuously throughout the whole building lifecycle. At the same time, building automation systems (BAS) are now standard in most modern buildings. Besides automatic monitoring and control of building services systems, automatic commissioning is a new expectation on modern BAS to save labor, time and cost required by manual commissioning and improve the effectiveness of commissioning. This paper firstly takes a brief look at current situation of building commissioning in research and application world wide, and then summarizes state-of-the-art techniques for automatic commissioning of HVAC systems. It is concluded that, to maximize benefits from commissioning for enhancing building sustainability, more efforts should be made to develop automatic commissioning toots which can be integrated with modern BAS.

This difficulty has resulted in limited applications of SAR as an operational source of soil moisture in hydrology despite the demonstrated benefits of high-resolution distributed soil moisture. Technical and methodological advances such as multi-configuration radar and forthcoming SAR constellations are increasingly mitigating the shortcomings of SAR with respect to soil moisture estimation at the field and catchment scale. At the same time, progress in data assimilation and a better understanding of the impact of phenomena, such as climate change, are revealing the hydrological importance of soil moisture spatial distribution. Thus, despite the currently modest retrieval accuracy, SAR is an important source of soil moisture state information for the hydrological community. Towards the end of increasing the hydrological utilization of SAR soil moisture, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to provide the state-of-the-art of SAR soil moisture retrieval methodology, its limitations and potential. Following the methodology review, a discussion of the benefits and limitations of soil moisture data retrieved from SAR is used to outline the scope of SAR derived soil moisture for hydrological applications.

From an industrial standpoint, eCO(2)RR provides specific advantages over thermochemical and photochemical pathways in terms of much broader product scope, high product specificity, and easy adaptability to the renewable electricity infrastructure. However, unlike water electrolyzers, the lack of suitable cathode materials for eCO(2)RR impedes its commercialization due to material design challenges. The current state-of-the-art catalysts in eCO(2)RR suffer largely from low reaction rates, insufficient C2+ product selectivity, high overpotentials, and industrial-scale stability. Overcoming the scientific and applied technical hurdles for commercial realization demands a holistic integration of catalytic designs, deep mechanistic understanding, and efficient process engineering. Special emphasis on mechanistic understanding and performance outcome is sought to guide the future design of eCO(2)RR catalysts that can play a significant role in closing the anthropogenic carbon loop. This article provides an integrative approach to understand principles of robust eCO(2)RR catalyst design superimposed with underlying mechanistic projections which strongly depend on experimental conditions viz. choice of electrolyte, reactor and membrane design, pH of the solvent, and partial pressure of the CO2.","[Bagchi, Debabrata; Roy, Soumyabrata; Sarma, Saurav Ch; Peter, Sebastian C.] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, New Chem Unit, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India; [Bagchi, Debabrata; Roy, Soumyabrata; Sarma, Saurav Ch; Peter, Sebastian C.] Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Sch Adv Mat, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India",Department of Science & Technology (India); Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR); Department of Science & Technology (India); Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR),"Peter, SC (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, New Chem Unit, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India.;Peter, SC (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr Adv Sci Res, Sch Adv Mat, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India.",sebastiancp@jncasr.ac.in,,"Chirambatte Peter, Sebastian/0000-0002-5211-446X; Roy, Soumyabrata/0000-0003-3540-1341","Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR); Department of Science and Technology, India (DST) [DST/TM/EWO/MI/CCUS/13(G), DST/TMDEWO/CCUS/CoE/2020/JNCASR (C)]; DST [DST/SJF/CSA-02/2017-18]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; UGC-CSIR, Govt. of India; JNCASR","Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Department of Science and Technology, India (DST)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); UGC-CSIR, Govt. of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India); JNCASR","D.B., S.R., and S.C.S. contributed equally to this work.

Predictive information can help local water managers to alleviate or manage the adverse effects posed by CyanoHABs. Previous works have led to various approaches for predicting cyanobacteria abundance by feeding various environmental variables into statistical models or neural networks. However, these models alone may have limited predictive performance owing to their inability to capture extreme situations. In this paper, we consider the possibility of a hybrid approach that leverages the merits of these methods by integrating a statistical model with a deep-learning model. In particular, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were used in tandem to better capture temporal patterns of highly dynamic observations. Results show that the proposed ARIMA-LSTM model exhibited the promising potential to outperform the state-of-the-art baseline models for CyanoHAB prediction in highly variable time-series observations, characterized by nonstationarity and imbalance. The predictive error of the mean absolute error and root mean square error, compared with the best baseline model, were largely reduced by 12.4% and 15.5%, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential for the hybrid model to assist in cyanobacterial risk assessment and management, especially in shallow and eutrophic waters.","[Li, Hu; Qin, Chengxin; Sun, Fu; Du, Pengfei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [He, Weiqi] Tsinghua Univ, Res Inst Environm Innovat Suzhou, Suzhou 215163, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Du, PF (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",dupf@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Jin, Maojun/AGX-5515-2022","Li, Hu/0000-0001-5369-8455",Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2017ZX07301006]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20191181]; Natural Science Foundation of China [51878372],Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is funded by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2017ZX07301006), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20191181), and the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51878372).

It has been designed using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components to reduce the cost of each unit and to allow to have multiple units monitoring simultaneously at different sites and also incorporate an open-access citizen science approach. The hardware-core of each PACKMAN units, weights around 600 g and consumes about 500 mA of current at 12 V. PACKMAN has been deployed at multiple latitudes and altitudes ranging from stratospheric heights (corroborating its TRL8 maturity) to subsurface depths of around 1 km. The data from PACKMAN have been compared with the state-of-the-art ground-based observatories, and satellites and scientific observations have been documented. A 3-D network of PACKMAN units operating continuously around the globe, from the subsurface to the stratosphere, would help to improve the understanding of the space weather phenomena, and its implications on the climate and infrastructures. PACKMAN is also an excellent tool for education and outreach. This article outlines the building instructions of two types of PACKMAN units: PACKMAN-S for ground-based measurements and PACKMAN-B for stratospheric measurements aboard high-altitude balloons.

Significant progress has been made towards understanding sea ice variability in the Antarctic region. Based on various studies in polar regions, it has been observed that during last few decades, Arctic is showing the consistent decline of summer sea ice cover, in contrast to Antarctica which is showing regional anomalies with positive and negative trends. Role of sea ice concentration in Indian monsoon has also been examined. Relation of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sea ice extents have been studied.

Williamson and his collaborators at the National Center for Atmospheric Research introduced a set of numerical experiments of increasing complexity to serve as a standard set for testing proposed numerical schemes. They also provided a software package that solved the equations by methods that are currently state of the art in the field. The authors recently introduced a new method (called odd-even splitting) for solving a wide variety of partial differential equations which has several advantages. In this paper a variation of this method, called the dual-copy splitting method of time stepping, is applied to several of the test cases of Williamson et al. using for the spatial discretization the same spectral transform model as they used. The method has the following features that are novel, so fnr as the authors know. First, the order of accuracy in time can be increased from the usual first or second order, without additional memory requirements to store fields at intermediate time steps. Second, gravity waves, which impose a prohibitively small time step for usual explicit schemes, have been handled here exactly while retaining the advantages of implicit schemes. Indeed, it is believed that this treatment of gravity waves is in fact superior to implicit methods.","Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Wright, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, Mail Code 0402, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

This article reports on an inquiry that examines whether and how national research funding has supported the development of translation studies as an academic discipline in China, employing the example of the National Social Science Fund of China (NSSFC) subsidy, as allocated to the field of translation studies. Firstly, we accessed the NSSFC database for all programs featuring translation and translation studies between 2010 and 2019. Secondly, we coded, categorized, and processed the data in a quantitative manner. Our examination of the number of grants, research focuses, and frequently examined issues of these programs has led us to conclude the fact that NSSFC has facilitated the increase in translation studies as an academic discipline in China. Further investigation into the positive relationship between NSSFC funding policies and mechanism and the growth in academic translation studies has also identified the ways NSSFC boosts translation studies as an academic discipline in China: to promote and increase the market, interdisciplinary, and multimodal applicability of the research output. The findings also suggest that revisions may be needed to further refine the NSSFC mechanism so that translation studies will develop into a balanced, continuously innovative discipline.","[Jiang, Zhiwei; Wu, Yun] Tongji Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Tsung, Linda] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Tongji University; University of Sydney,"Wu, Y (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",1910079@tongji.edu.cn; wuyun@tongji.edu.cn; linda.tsung@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,43,0,0,3,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,18,,,,,,7241,10.3390/su12187241,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187241,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OP8RR,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000588358900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, distributed sensing in realistic application often gives rise to spatiotemporal signals, which can be characterized through new tools of graph signal processing as a time-varying graph signal. It calls upon the development from static graph signal studies to the joint space-time analysis. In this paper, we study the problem of learning graphs from time-varying graph signals. Based on the correlated properties in observed signals, a dynamic graph-based model is first presented, which particularly takes into account space-time interactions in signal representation. Considering the case that the time correlation pattern is unavailable, the graph learning problem is cast as a joint correlation detecting and graph refining problem. Then it is solved by the proposed correlation-aware and spatiotemporal smoothness-based graph learning method (CASTS), which novelly introduces the spatiotemporal smooth prior to the field of time-vertex signal analysis. By promoting such smoothness in each learning steps, the graph learning accuracy can be efficiently improved. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the improvement of the proposed CASTS over current state-of-the-art graph learning methods, and meanwhile show the capability of dynamic prediction in climate analysis.","[Liu, Yueliang; Yang, Lishan; You, Kangyong; Guo, Wenbin; Wang, Wenbo] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yueliang; Guo, Wenbin] Sci & Technol Informat Transmiss & Disseminat Com, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Guo, WB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.;Guo, WB (corresponding author), Sci & Technol Informat Transmiss & Disseminat Com, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China.",gwb@bupt.edu.cn,"You, Kangyong/AAC-8447-2021","Liu, Yueliang/0000-0002-8997-7023","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61271181, 61571054]; Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory Foundation; BUPT Excellent Ph.D.; Students Foundation [CX2018101]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory Foundation; BUPT Excellent Ph.D.; Students Foundation,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61271181 and Grant 61571054, in part by the Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory Foundation, and in part by the BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation under Grant CX2018101.",,49,8,10,4,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,,,,,62372,62386,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916567,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916567,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IA2GO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000469379800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, a spatial model is fit to the tornado counts aggregated in counties with terms that control for changes in observational practices over time. Results provide a long-term view of risk that delineates the main tornado corridors in the United States where the expected annual rate exceeds two tornadoes per 10,000 square km. A few counties in the Texas Panhandle and central Kansas have annual rates that exceed four tornadoes per 10,000 square km. Refitting the model after removing the least damaging tornadoes from the data (EFO) produces a similar map but with the greatest tornado risk shifted south and eastward. Second, a space-time model is fit to the counts aggregated in raster cells with terms that control for changes in climate factors. Results provide a short-term view of risk. The short-term view identifies a shift of tornado activity away from the Ohio Valley under El Nino conditions and away from the Southeast under positive North Atlantic oscillation conditions. The combined predictor effects on the local rates is quantified by fitting the model after leaving out the year to be predicted from the data.

OFNP creatively combines state-of-the-art light water reactors and floating platforms similar to those used in offshore oil/gas operations. A reliable and cost-effective global supply chain exists for both technologies; therefore, robust expansion in the use of nuclear energy becomes possible on a timescale consistent with combating climate change in the near future. OFNP is a plant that can be entirely built within a floating platform in a shipyard; transferred to the site, where it is anchored within 12 nautical miles (22 km) off the coast in relatively deep water (>= 100 m); and connected to the grid via submarine transmission cables. OFNP eliminates earthquakes and tsunamis as accident precursors; its ocean-based passive safety systems eliminate the loss of ultimate heat sink accident by design. The OFNP crews operate in monthly or semimonthly shifts with onboard living quarters, like on oil/gas platforms. OFNP is a reactor for the global market: It can be constructed in one country and exported internationally; it lends itself to a flexible and mobile electricity generation approach, which minimizes the need for indigenous nuclear infrastructure in the host country; and it does not commit the customer to a 40-to 60-year-long project.","[Buongiorno, J.; Jurewicz, J.; Golay, M.; Todreas, N.] MIT, Nucl Sci & Engn Dept, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Buongiorno, J (corresponding author), MIT, Nucl Sci & Engn Dept, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jacopo@mit.edu,,,MIT Research Support Committee,MIT Research Support Committee,"This project is funded by the MIT Research Support Committee.

Of major concern is the movement of water and air and the transport, erosion and deposition of sand and mud. These processes result in an ever-changing morphology (topography/bathymetry) of the islands, tidal channels, inter-tidal shoals and tidal flats. This dynamic development of the shape and nature of the Wadden area forms together with the biotic systems, the present Wadden system. The morphodynamic development of the Wadden Sea is influenced by changing environmental conditions e.g. sea-level rise as well as by human interferences. For the management and protection of the Wadden system knowledge on the morphodynamic development is essential. However, our present knowledge is not sufficient to predict the effects of human interferences under different climate change scenarios in sufficient detail and accuracy. This paper identifies the existing knowledge gaps, based on a review of the state of the art on morphodynamics of the Wadden Sea that is confronted with major requirements from a coastal zone management point of view. The identified knowledge gaps have to inspire and stimulate research in the fields of the large-scale sediment budgets, morphodynamic changes at smaller scales, processes and mechanisms of sediment transport, erosion and deposition and modelling tools.

These encounters result in a multitude of symptoms, ranging from mild erythema to death. This work aims to review the state-of-the-art regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and relevant clinical and forensic aspects of jellyfish stings. There are three major classes of jellyfish, causing various clinical scenarios. Most envenomations result in an erythematous lesion with morphological characteristics that may help identify the class of jellyfish responsible. In rare cases, the sting may result in delayed, persistent, or systemic symptoms. Lethal encounters have been described, but most of those cases happened in the Indo-Pacific region, where cubozoans, the deadliest jellyfish class, can be found. The diagnosis is mostly clinical but can be aided by dermoscopy, skin scrapings/sticky tape, confocal reflectance microscopy, immunological essays, among others. Treatment is currently based on preventing further envenomation, inactivating the venom, and alleviating local and systemic symptoms. However, the strategy used to achieve these effects remains under debate. Only one antivenom is currently used and covers merely one species (Chironex fleckeri). Other antivenoms have been produced experimentally but were not tested on human envenomation settings. The increased number of cases, especially due to climate changes, justifies further research in the study of clinical aspects of jellyfish envenoming.","[Cunha, Sara Almeida; Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Forens Sci & Med Educ, P-4200319 Porto, Portugal; [Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge] Univ Inst Hlth Sci IUCS, CESPU, CRL, TOXRUN Toxicol Res Unit, P-4585116 Gandra, Portugal; [Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge] Univ Porto, Fac Pharm, Dept Biol Sci, UCIBIO REQUIMTE Appl Mol Biosci Unit,Lab Toxicol, P-4050313 Porto, Portugal; [Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge] MTG Res & Dev Lab, P-4200604 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Dinis-Oliveira, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Forens Sci & Med Educ, P-4200319 Porto, Portugal.;Dinis-Oliveira, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Inst Hlth Sci IUCS, CESPU, CRL, TOXRUN Toxicol Res Unit, P-4585116 Gandra, Portugal.;Dinis-Oliveira, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Pharm, Dept Biol Sci, UCIBIO REQUIMTE Appl Mol Biosci Unit,Lab Toxicol, P-4050313 Porto, Portugal.;Dinis-Oliveira, RJ (corresponding author), MTG Res & Dev Lab, P-4200604 Porto, Portugal.",up201603632@edu.med.up.pt; ricardo.dinis@iucs.cespu.pt,"Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge/D-9186-2013","Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge/0000-0001-7430-6297; Almeida Saraiva dos Reis Cunha, Sara/0000-0003-4988-3281",,,,,232,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Recovery of non-serotinous pines after large wildfires is often determined by their ability to grow under the canopy of promptly established resprouters. Mechanisms of facilitation or competition between resprouters and pines will thus have a profound effect on forest dynamics. We examined here the effect of neighboring oak resprouts on Pinus nigra Arts. ssp. salzmannii saplings 18 years after a wildfire. We determined the net outcome of interactions between oaks and pines and how they vary with the life stage and size of the interacting plants or the environmental conditions. We did not find any net facilitative effects of oaks on pine sapling growth. The sensitivity of pines to neighbors varied markedly with pine size, and to a lesser extent, with water availability during the growing season. Our findings suggest a self-reinforcing hierarchical process by which early-dispersed seedlings growing in low-competitive microsites can grow faster, mitigating neighboring competition in the later stage of canopy closure. These results entail a potentially critical role of management practices to promote post-fire recovery of non-serotinous pines under expected changing conditions of disturbance regimes.","[Sanchez-Pinillos, Martina; Ameztegui, Aitor; Coll, Lluis] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Ameztegui, Aitor; Coll, Lluis] Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn EAGROF, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Ameztegui, Aitor; Coll, Lluis] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, Dept Ecol, INIBIOMA CONICET, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina",Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Universitat de Lleida; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue,"Sanchez-Pinillos, M (corresponding author), Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain.",martina.sanchezpinillos@ctfc.es,"S√°nchez-Pinillos, Martina/GPX-7415-2022; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Ameztegui, Aitor/C-2587-2009; S√°nchez-Pinillos, Martina/J-2619-2019; Coll, Llu√≠s/E-8724-2015; Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Ameztegui, Aitor/0000-0003-2006-1559; S√°nchez-Pinillos, Martina/0000-0002-1499-4507; Coll, Llu√≠s/0000-0002-8035-5949; Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121",MINECO via EST_RES project [AGL2015-70425-R]; EC through the ERA-NET Foresterra project INFORMED [29183]; MINECO [BES-2013-063019]; mobility fellowship [EEBB-I-17-12279]; MINECO through a Juan de la Cierva fellowship [FJCI-2014-20739],MINECO via EST_RES project; EC through the ERA-NET Foresterra project INFORMED; MINECO(Spanish Government); mobility fellowship; MINECO through a Juan de la Cierva fellowship,This study was funded by MINECO via EST_RES project (AGL2015-70425-R) and the EC through the ERA-NET Foresterra project INFORMED (grant number: 29183).

As such, storms represent a major threat to human activities concentrated along the coasts worldwide. In order to better understand the frequency of extreme events like storms, climate science must rely on longer-time records than the century-scale records of instrumental weather data. Proxy records of storm-wave or storm-wind induced activity in coastal barrier systems deposits have been widely used worldwide in recent years to,document past storm events during the last millennia. This review provides a detailed state-of-the-art compilation of the proxies available from coastal barrier systems to reconstruct Holocene storm chronologies (paleotempestology). The present paper aims (I) to describe the erosional and depositional processes caused by storm-wave action in barrier and back-barrier systems (i.e. beach ridges, storm scarps and washover deposits), (ii) to understand how storm records can be extracted from barrier and back-barrier sedimentary bodies using stratigraphical, sedimentological, micro-paleontological and geochemical proxies and (iii) to show how to obtain chronological control on past storm events recorded in the sedimentary successions. The challenges that paleotempestology studies still face in the reconstruction of representative and reliable storm chronologies using these various proxies are discussed, and future research prospects are outlined.

In the observation, the climatology of DTR during 1979-2014 displays a horizontal tile from southwest to northeast over East Asia. In addition, the observed DTR also presents an obviously declining trend in recent decades, with the magnitude of roughly-0.10 ? decade(-1). The historical all-forcing simulations well reproduce the geographical distributions and magnitude of climatology and trends of winter DTR over East Asia in 1979-2014. Furthermore, the winter DTR exhibits a continuous declining trend from the historical scenario to the future SSP245 scenario over East Asia, with the most significant declining during the first half of twenty-first century (i. e., 2021-2060). Based on the individual forcing experiments, it suggests that the greenhouse gases forcing plays a primary role in driving the climatology and trends of DTR over East Asia, especially for the SSP245 scenario. Further analysis indicates that the increasing precipitation under greenhouse gases forcing largely explain the declining DTR trends over East Asia, especially over the northern East Asia both in historical and SSP245 scenarios.","[Liu, Lin] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Inst Atmospher Composit, Key Lab Atmospher Chem CMA, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zizhen; Gong, Hainan; Wang, Lin; Chen, Wen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zizhen; Gong, Hainan; Wang, Lin; Chen, Wen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zizhen] Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Wu, Renguang] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Yunnan University; Zhejiang University","Gong, HN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Gong, HN (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",ghn@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41925020, 42075033, 41805126]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41925020, 42075033, and 41805126) .

The use of more environmentally friendly electric vehicles has become widespread and brought tackling climate change to forefront, especially for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the demand for rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles and the need for the nickel in the production of these batteries will increase as well. In addition to those, nickel prices significantly impact mine investment decisions, mine planning, economic development of nickel companies, and countries that depend on nickel resources. However, there is uncertainty about how the nickel price will trend in the future, and the solution to this problem attracts the attention of researchers. For forecasting nickel price, this paper proposes recurrent neural networks-based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, classified as deep learning algorithms. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used as the performance measure to compute the accuracy of the proposed techniques. As a result, it has been determined that the LSTM and GRU networks are very useful and successful in forecasting the nickel price variations owing to having average MAPE values of 7.060% and 6.986%, respectively. Furthermore, it has been observed that GRU networks surpassed the LSTM networks by 33% in terms of average computational time.","[Ozdemir, Ali Can] Cukurova Univ, Dept Min Engn, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey; [Bulus, Kurtulus] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Discovery Brain Sci, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Zor, Kasim] Adana Alparslan Turkes Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Adana, Turkey",Cukurova University; University of Edinburgh; Adana Alparslan Turkes Science & Technology University,"Ozdemir, AC (corresponding author), Cukurova Univ, Dept Min Engn, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey.",acozdemir@cu.edu.tr; s1834500@ed.ac.uk; kzor@atu.edu.tr,"Zor, Kasƒ±m/F-4743-2018; Ozdemir, Ali Can/F-1957-2018","Zor, Kasƒ±m/0000-0001-6443-114X; Ozdemir, Ali Can/0000-0003-3064-4264",Scientific Project Unit of ?; ukurova University [FBA-2019-11998]; Science and Technology University [21103013],Scientific Project Unit of ?; ukurova University; Science and Technology University,Funding sources This work was supported by the Scientific Project Unit of ?ukurova University [grant number FBA-2019-11998] and by the Scientific Proj-ect Unit of Adana Alparslan T?rkes?

To that end, its elaboration method and the geometric order that structures it are described in three types of statements: simple propositions, axioms of proportion, and poetic theorems. Over the course of these descriptions, the poetic and critical value of the artistic practice understood as a long-term graphic performance is revealed. The 1:1 scale map of tactile relationships is part of a broader research on the art-science relationship in the modern botanical episteme, where this way of knowing the plant world is identified as one of the key elements that makes up our current climate situation, well expressed by Isabelle Stengers as the intrusion of Gaia. In the artistic practice of elaborating the 1:1 scale map of tactile relationships, there is an appropriation of the methods of the critically reconfigured modern botanical episteme. In it, key elements of modernity are questioned, such as the hierarchy established between subject-scientist object-plant, universal measurements, the notion of species and the value of truth or objectivity of the scientific method. On the other hand, the geometric method used proposes to re-visit a spinosite modernity that gives important hints for the critique of hegemonic modernity.","[Cajiao, Eulalia De Valdenebro] Univ Nacl Colombia, Escuela Artes Plast & Visuales, Bogota, Colombia; [Cajiao, Eulalia De Valdenebro] Univ Paris 08, St Denis, France; [Cajiao, Eulalia De Valdenebro] Univ Nacl Colombia, Artes Plast & Visuales, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universite Paris-VIII; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Cajiao, ED (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Escuela Artes Plast & Visuales, Bogota, Colombia.;Cajiao, ED (corresponding author), Univ Paris 08, St Denis, France.;Cajiao, ED (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Artes Plast & Visuales, Bogota, Colombia.",eulaliadeval@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"PONTIFICIA UNIV JAVERIANA, FAC ARTES",BOGOTA,"CARRERA 7 NO 40-62, EDIF PABLO VI PISO 2, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA",1794-6670,2215-9959,,CUAD MUSIC ARTES ESC,Cuad.

Moreover, the Digital Intensity Index developed by Eurostat was used. The progress made by food industry enterprises in terms of digitalization was assessed in terms of their relevance to the prospects of building a more sustainable food system in the EU. The conducted analysis allows to conclude that even though the pace of digitalization in the sector's enterprises has accelerated in recent years, the level and scope of digital changes is still limited. What is more, large inequalities in the level of digitalization, visible both within the sector itself and between EU Member States, remain a problem. The directions of using digital solutions show that digitalization is seen mainly to increase production efficiency and attract new customers and sales channels. Parallel possibilities to support environmental and climate protection are not yet sufficiently exploited.

Our response to this crisis? In a word: Sustainability. No longer a buzzword or clever term-of-art, sustainability is, for many, both religion and a dogma that has emerged as the single most important driver in how we will educate and train the next generation of architects. But what of this `religion'? This dogma. Is it the root of yet another blind faith? Or is it perhaps the beginning of a new chapter - a new testament, if you will - upon which we, as architects, will lead a return to first-principles in sustainable design and re-affirm the architect as responsible steward of our built environment.

A pressing issue is the analysis of the oldest, highly thinned ice core sections, where the identification of paleoclimate signals is particularly challenging. For this, state-of-the-art imaging by laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has the potential to be revolutionary due to its combination of micron-scale 2D chemical information with visual features. However, the quantitative study of record preservation in chemical images raises new questions that call for the expertise of the computer vision community. To illustrate this new inter-disciplinary frontier, we describe a selected set of key questions. One critical task is to assess the paleoclimate significance of single line profiles along the main core axis, which we show is a scale-dependent problem for which advanced image analysis methods are critical. Another important issue is the evaluation of post-depositional layer changes, for which the chemical images provide rich information. Accordingly, the time is ripe to begin an intensified exchange between the two scientific communities of computer vision and ice core science. The collaborative building of a new framework for investigating high-resolution chemical images with automated image analysis techniques will also benefit the already wide-spread application of laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry chemical imaging in the geosciences.","[Bohleber, Pascal; Roman, Marco; Barbante, Carlo; Vascon, Sebastiano; Pelillo, Marcello] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Barbante, Carlo] CNR, Inst Polar Sci, Venice, Italy; [Vascon, Sebastiano; Pelillo, Marcello] European Ctr Living Technol, Venice, Italy; [Siddiqi, Kaleem] McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Siddiqi, Kaleem] McGill Univ, Ctr Intelligent Machines, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Polari (ISP-CNR); McGill University; McGill University,"Bohleber, P (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy.",pascal.bohleber@unive.it,"Roman, Marco/HCI-7752-2022","Barbante, Carlo/0000-0003-4177-2288","European Union [790280, 815384]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); PNRA; IPEV through the Concordia Station system",European Union(European Commission); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); PNRA; IPEV through the Concordia Station system,"PB gratefully acknowledges funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 790280.

Twelve years later in 2005 a restudy of the same areas was undertaken. The aim was to understand what had happened to individuals and clusters in the intervening period in terms of their adaptability and resilience to HIV and AIDS, and to assess whether the cluster, or livelihood network methodology was an effective approach to explore the impact of AIDS on farming, livelihoods, and social change. Significant changes had occurred at meso and national levels; Mpongwe had become a district capital, agricultural subsidies had been removed, health services had been decentralized and ART was becoming more available. As predicted by the first study, in 2005 Mpongwe was experiencing the full-blown impact of AIDS. However, the most significant finding of the study, which the livelihoods network methodology helped to highlight, was how social units had adapted and how livelihoods had remained surprisingly resilient. In Teta, AIDS impacts had been much less and a shift back to more traditional farming systems was seen. Because the future holds an inevitable increase in shocks and stresses, with now climate change too, the study highlights the need for more creative and informed approaches for buttressing the social protection functions of livelihood networks.","[Samuels, Fiona] Overseas Dev Inst, London, England; [Drinkwater, Michael] WayFair Associates, Boston, MA USA",,"Samuels, F (corresponding author), Overseas Dev Inst, London, England.",,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",2153-957X,2153-9588,,ANN ANTHROPL PRACT,Ann.

Findings - The master for teleoperation WiRo-6.3 has been designed and constructed and is fully operative, thanks to the following theoretical analyses: positional and orientation workspace(s), forward and inverse kinematics, statics, overall control strategies. The mechanical details are also presented. Research limitations/implications - The WiRo-63 is suitable to those applications in which human command is necessary but potentially harmful, and where a force-feedback interface is preferred to obtain better control over the task to be accomplished. A possible field of interest could be the control of robot arms in dangerous environments, nuclear applications, uncomfortable climates, remote operations. Originality/value - The master WiRo-63 is a novel device both for its geometric structure and for the wire actuation choice; those characteristics provide very interesting results in terms of dexterity, force feedback performance and overall user-friendliness.","Politecn Turin, Dept Mech, Turin, Italy; ENEA, Robot Sect, Casaccia Res Ctr, Rome, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Ferraresi, C (corresponding author), Politecn Turin, Dept Mech, Turin, Italy.",,,"FERRARESI, Carlo/0000-0002-9703-9395; Pescarmona, Francesco/0000-0003-4389-6428",,,,,11,0,0,3,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BRADFORD,"60/62 TOLLER LANE, BRADFORD BD8 9BY, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-991X,,,IND ROBOT,Ind.

The survey shows that Europe has been active in the implementation and development of large-scale gasification systems, with various trends occurring that reflect the need of new knowledge and cost-competitive technologies. Large-scale gasification processes are becoming increasingly considered for biofuels and biochemicals synthesis and the economy of generating renewable bioproducts from biomass is becoming more attractive than power. However, large-scale gasification plants still entail significant issues (e.g., biomass collection and processing, producer gas cleaning costs) that decrease the projects economic viability and may cause the interruption of operation of existing plants. This study shows that the commercial breakthrough of large-scale biomass gasification must be supported by: high integration of low-cost wastes as co-feedstocks, development of cost-efficient gas upgrading processes, usage of recognized operational strategies from demonstration/industrial plants (e.g., adjusting the availability and accessibility of catalytically active ash components), improvement of governmental policies (e.g., carbon tax increase) and integration of the process in comprehensive biorefinery designs. These aspects are mandatory for biomass gasification technologies to be able to represent an important role in the combat against climate change.","[Pio, D. T.; Tarelho, L. A.

Therefore, quantification of precipitation variability in such data-limited regions relies on remote sensing estimates, due to their global coverage and near real-time availability. However, strong underestimation of precipitation associated with low-level orographic enhancement often limits the quantitative use of these data in applications. This study utilizes state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction simulations, toward the reduction of quantitative errors in satellite precipitation estimates and an insight on the nature of detection limitations. Satellite precipitation products based on different retrieval algorithms (Climate Prediction Center morphing method, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System, and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) are evaluated for their performance in a number of storm events over mountainous areas with distinct storm characteristics: Upper Blue Nile in Ethiopia and Alto Adige in NE Italy. High-resolution (1 and 2km) simulations from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System/Integrated Community Limited Area Modeling System are used to derive adjustments to the magnitude of satellite estimates. Finally, a microphysical investigation is presented for occurrences of erroneous precipitation detection from the satellite instruments.

In addition to its intrinsic scientific interest, an understanding of the mechanisms determining the thermal conductivity of ice might be relevant in climate modelling and planetary science. Accurate microscopic models can provide important molecular insight into these mechanisms. In this work, we quantify using molecular simulations and state of the art forcefields, the thermal conductivity of ice Ih, VI, VII and a plastic phase that has been proposed very recently at pressures in the GPa range. The TIP4P models used in this study underestimate significantly the thermal conductivity of ice Ih and ice VII, while they show good agreement with experimental measurements of ice VI. The discrepancies observed are examined by investigating the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity. The simulations indicate that the models are too anharmonic and they potentially feature a higher structural disorder than the experimental systems. We suggest that at high pressures the simulated thermal conductivities can be rationalized in terms of the performance of the models in predicting the equation of state of ice. The thermal conductivity of the plastic phase is very similar to that of the coexisting ice VII. Since the water molecules in the plastic phase feature orientational disorder, these results indicate that the hydrogen bond network does not play a significant role in defining the thermal transport mechanisms of ice at high pressures.","[Iriarte-Carretero, Irene; Gonzalez, Miguel A.; Bresme, Fernando] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Gonzalez, Miguel A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quim Fis 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Imperial College London; Complutense University of Madrid,"Gonzalez, MA; Bresme, F (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Gonzalez, MA (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quim Fis 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",m.gonzalez12@imperial.ac.uk; fbresme@imperial.ac.uk,"Gonzalez, Miguel Angel/GLV-3004-2022","Gonzalez, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-6419-5263",EPSRC [EP/J003859/1],EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work has been funded through the EPSRC grant EP/J003859/1.

However, limited consideration is given to the security of such networks, despite the fact that the unique characteristics of UANs make these networks vulnerable to various malicious attacks. In this paper, we address future aspects of how to improve security in UANs. We start by reviewing and discussing the state-of-the-art security threats for underwater networks along with their existing solutions. We then identify the open research issues and challenges in the design of secure protocols for communication in UANs. We propose innovative approaches based on node cooperation, cross-layering, software-defined cognitive networking and context-aware communication in order to effectively provision new or strengthen existing security frameworks in UANs. By using these approaches, we address the problem of detecting malicious behaviours and rogue nodes in order to address the major security issues in UANs. We also investigate the use of a covert channel based detection mechanism which needs to be considered when monitoring or deploying UANs at sea.

Monitoring programs detecting the presence of toxic algae before they bloom are of paramount importance to protect aquatic ecosystems, aquaculture, human health and local economies. Rapid and reliable species identification methods using molecular barcodes coupled to biosensor detection tools have received increasing attention over the past decade as an alternative to the impractical standard microscopic counting-based techniques. This work reports on a PCR amplification-free electrochemical genosensor for the enhanced selective and sensitive detection of RNA from multiple Mediterranean toxic algal species. For a sandwich hybridization (SHA), we designed longer capture and signal probes for more specific target discrimination against a single base-pair mismatch from closely related species and for reproducible signals. We optimized experimental conditions, viz., minimal probe concentration in the SHA on a screen-printed gold electrode and selected the best electrochemical mediator. Probes from 13 Mediterranean dinoflagellate species were tested under optimized conditions and the format further tested for quantification of RNA from environmental samples. We not only enhanced the selectivity and sensitivity of the state-of-the-art toxic algal genosensors but also increased the repertoire of toxic algal biosensors in the Mediterranean, towards an integral and automatic monitoring system.

Moreover, we introduce a novel backpack version of mobile laser scanning equipment for surveying applications in the field of natural sciences where the requirements include precision and mobility in variable terrain conditions. In addition to presenting a technical description of the systems, we discuss the performance of the solutions in the light of various applications in the fields of urban mapping and modeling, fluvial geomorphology, snow-cover characterization, precision agriculture, and in monitoring the effects of climate change on permafrost landforms.

Future growth within the chemical process industries is likely to involve even keener competition with greater impact from factors such as raw material and energy availability, climate change mitigation, sustainability, and inherent security. The future will probably see an expanded role for the systematic generation process synthesis paradigm, including an increased interdependency with process and catalytic chemistry on one hand and operability and control expertise on the other. Advances from artificial intelligence may inspire new process synthesis paradigms incorporating more effective representations of the underlying physical sciences and engineering art, new social concerns, new design strategies, and new computerized implementations. The future may also see a collaboration of the systematic generation and superstructure optimization process synthesis paradigms in which systematic generation is used to create the superstructure for simultaneous discrete and continuous variable optimization. As the resulting process designs will certainly be evaluated from additional points of view including social considerations, superstructure optimization will need to produce families of good designs for multi-criteria Pareto optimization. There are many challenges, but continued progress will be made and these challenges will be met. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, the world relies on coal, crude oil and natural gas for energy generati on. However, the energy crisis together with climate change and depletion of oil have become major concerns to all countries. Therefore, alternative energy resources such as wind energy attracted interest from both public and private sectors to invest in energy generation from this source extensively. Both Vertical and Horizontal axis wind turbine can be used for this purpose. But, Horizontal axis is the most promising between them due to its efficiency and low expense. Bangladesh being a tropical country does have a lot of wind flow at different seasons of the year. However, there are some windy locations in which wind energy projects could be feasible. In this project a detailed review of the current st ate-of-art for wind turbine blade design is presented including theoretical maximum efficiency, Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) blade design, simulation power and COP values for different blade material. By studying previously collected data on the wind resources available in Bangladesh at present and by analyzing this data, this paper will discuss the scope of wind energy in Bangladesh.","[Khan, Md.

Temperature variations, effective as time delay variations, were identified as a dominating error source that degrades the capabilities of carrier phase GPS based time and frequency transfer considerably. For purely code-based measurements with uncertainties in the ns range is temperature rarely an issue. In contrast carrier phase observations offer potentially a two orders of magnitude better accuracy and are therefore suitable for exploiting the characteristics of maser quality clocks. However, the stability of the environment around the receiver equipment defines the achievable accuracy. Four distinct parts of the receiver chain were subject to systematic measurements of the temperature-delay dependency: antenna preamplifier, antenna and clock cables, power distribution devices and geodetic receivers. A temperature controllable climate chamber was deployed with the respective component to follow a long time-constant temperature stepping. Signal through devices were mainly tested in a vector-voltmeter approach. Zero base line GPS processing was used to test receivers. With individual component temperature dependence being far above the expected accuracy of carrier phase based time and frequency transfer it underlines the necessity to include temperature as an important parameter into time/frequency solutions.","SP Swedish Natl Testing & Res Inst, S-50115 Boras, Sweden",,"Rieck, C (corresponding author), SP Swedish Natl Testing & Res Inst, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden.",,,,,,,,4,9,9,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1075-6787,,0-7803-7688-9,P IEEE INT FREQ CONT,,,2003,,,,,326,331,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics,BY39D,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000189158900062,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper discusses an active learning approach being implemented throughout the university, and gives an outline of its application within nursing education. Practising as a confident, competent, reflective practitioner in the profession of nursing cannot automatically commence on the day of registration. Rather, the philosophical underpinnings necessary should be fostered throughout the initial nursing education curricula. In a political climate where there is a strong emphasis on efficiency, nurse teachers need to reconsider how the acquisition of nursing knowledge is facilitated. A description of how an active learning approach is being further developed in the nursing skills laboratory and the physiology laboratory is given. Art outline identifies how these facilities may help students of nursing to gain knowledge and skills in relation to respiration. The authors recognize that while laboratories have been used widely in general education, their use has been limited in nursing education, particularly in the UK. informal feedback from students implies that not only do they enjoy learning in these facilities, but also motivation towards learning is raised, an important element in the learning process. it is suggested that this will result ultimately in increased nursing competence.

The preponderance of the nation's drinking water, as well as agricultural and industrial water, comes from groundwater. Groundwater level is becoming increasingly challenging to replenish due to climate change. Fertilizer application and improper processing of industrial waste are the two major anthropogenic drivers of groundwater pollution. Arsenic and cadmium are two of the principal heavy metal pollutants that have affected groundwater quality by human activity. When people are exposed to both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic contaminants for an extended period, toxic effects might occur. It can have detrimental health effects from long-term exposure to contaminants, even in low amounts. As a result, metal contamination concentrations and fractions can be used to determine potential health concerns. At the same time, contaminants also need to be removed or converted to harmless products by groundwater remediation. Remediation of groundwater quality can be accomplished in several ways, including natural and artificial means. The purpose of this review is to explore a wide range of factors that affect groundwater quality, including their possible health effects.

In a country like Ethiopia, with its complex topography and synoptic-scale spatiotemporal circulation patterns, the analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of precipitable water vapor (PWV) is very challenging, and is hampered by the lack of long observational datasets. In this study, we process the PWV over eight Ethiopian global positioning system (GPS) sites and one close to the Ethiopian eastern border, for the available common period 2013-2020, and compare with the PWV retrieved from the state-of-the-art ERA5 reanalysis. Both PWV datasets agree very well at our sample, with correlation coefficients between 0.96 and 0.99, GPS-PWV show a moderate wet bias compared to ERA5-PWV for the majority of the sites, and an overall root mean square error of 3.4 mm. Seasonal and diurnal cycles are also well captured by these datasets. The seasonal variations of PWV and precipitation at the sites agree very well. Maximum diurnal PWV amplitudes are observed for stations near water bodies or dense vegetation, such as Arbaminch (ARMI) and Bahir Dar (BDMT). At those stations, the PWV behavior at heavy rainfall events has been investigated and an average 25% increase (resp. decrease) from 12 h before (resp. 12 h after) the start of the rainfall event, when the PWV peaks, has been observed.","[Koji, Abdisa Kawo] Ethiopian Space Sci & Technol Inst, Dept Geodesy & Geodynam, POB 33679, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Van Malderen, Roeland; Van Schaeybroeck, Bert] Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium RMIB, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Uccle, Belgium; [Pottiaux, Eric] Royal Observ Belgium ROB, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Uccle, Belgium",Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium,"Koji, AK (corresponding author), Ethiopian Space Sci & Technol Inst, Dept Geodesy & Geodynam, POB 33679, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",abdisa09kawo@gmail.com; roeland.vanmalderen@meteo.be; eric.pottiaux@oma.be; bertvs@meteo.be,,"Van Schaeybroeck, Bert/0000-0002-9507-7929; Van Malderen, Roeland/0000-0002-1369-8853",Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence (STCE); Belgian Federal Science Policy Office,Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence (STCE); Belgian Federal Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),"This work has been partly funded by the Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence (STCE), supported by the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office.",,65,2,2,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,686,10.3390/rs14030686,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14030686,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,ZC1SF,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000757307900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fossil fuels are presently the major source of energy consumed worldwide. However, this is not sustainable. Fast depletion of limited resources and climate change problem due to emission from these fuels are of major concern. Increasing overall efficiency of energy conversion and use is one option. Moreover, exploring new systems with better utilization of renewable resources may be a possible future sustainable option. Decentralized polygeneration to meet energy and other utility demand with rational use of local resources is emerging as a suitable option. To match the varying demand with intermittent renewable resources, storage could be a good solution. However, suitable low-cost and reliable storage is not yet fully developed. Hybridization of different intermittent renewable resources is a possible option. Countries with enough solar insolation like India may develop suitable hybrid polygeneration with solar inputs. Depending on local need, both solar thermal and photovoltaic utilities may be included in this polygeneration. Efficient system integration with possible optimization of different available local resources based on local needs is the key to successful polygeneration design. In this chapter, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art solar-based polygeneration will be presented.

Clouds control Earth's radiation balance, atmospheric water vapour is the strongest 'greenhouse' gas, and non-equilibrium relative humidity at the air-sea interface drives evaporation and latent heat export from the ocean. On climatic time scales, melting ice caps and regional deviations of the hydrological cycle result in changes of seawater salinity, which in turn may modify the global circulation of the oceans and their ability to store heat and to buffer anthropogenically produced carbon dioxide. In this paper, together with three companion articles, we examine the climatologically relevant quantities ocean salinity, seawater pH and atmospheric relative humidity, noting fundamental deficiencies in the definitions of those key observables, and their lack of secure foundation on the International System of Units, the SI. The metrological histories of those three quantities are reviewed, problems with their current definitions and measurement practices are analysed, and options for future improvements are discussed in conjunction with the recent seawater standard TEOS-10. It is concluded that the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM, in cooperation with the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, IAPWS, along with other international organizations and institutions, can make significant contributions by developing and recommending state-of-the-art solutions for these long standing metrological problems in climatology.","[Feistel, R.] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res IOW, D-18119 Warnemunde, Germany; [Wielgosz, R.] Bur Int Poids & Mesures, Pavillon Breteuil, F-92312 Sevres, France; [Bell, S.

For example, the microscopic photosynthetic organisms living within provide 50% of the oxygen we breathe, and much of our food and mineral resources are extracted from the ocean. In a time of ecological crisis and major changes in our society, it is essential to turn our attention towards the sea to find additional solutions for a sustainable future. Remarkably, while we are overexploiting many marine resources, particularly the fisheries, the planktonic compartment composed of zooplankton, phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses, represents 95% of marine biomass and yet the extent of its diversity remains largely unknown and underexploited. Consequently, the potential of plankton as a bioresource for humanity is largely untapped. Due to their diverse evolutionary backgrounds, planktonic organisms offer immense opportunities: new resources for medicine, cosmetics and food, renewable energy, and long-term solutions to mitigate climate change. Research programs aiming to exploit culture collections of marine micro-organisms as well as to prospect the huge resources of marine planktonic biodiversity in the oceans are now underway, and several bioactive extracts and purified compounds have already been identified. This review will survey and assess the current state-of-the-art and will propose methodologies to better exploit the potential of marine plankton for drug discovery and for dermocosmetics.","[Abida, Heni; Bowler, Chris] CNRS, INSERM U1024 UMR8197, IBENS, Environm & Evolutionary Genom Sect, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Ruchaud, Sandrine; Bach, Stephane] CNRS, KISSf, Stn Biol Roscoff, USR Prot Phosphorylat & Human Dis 3151, F-29688 Roscoff, France; [Rios, Laurent] Greentech France, Biopole Clermont Limagne, F-63360 St Beauzire, France; [Humeau, Anne] Soliance France, Ctr Marine Biotechnol, Anse Pors Gelin Ile Grande, F-22560 Plemeur Bodou, France; [Probert, Ian] CNRS, USR 3151, Stn Biol Roscoff, Roscoff Culture Collect, F-29688 Roscoff, France; [De Vargas, Colomban] CNRS, USR 3151, Stn Biol Roscoff, EPPO Lab, F-29688 Roscoff, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Givaudan SA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Bach, S (corresponding author), CNRS, KISSf, Stn Biol Roscoff, USR Prot Phosphorylat & Human Dis 3151, CS 90074, F-29688 Roscoff, France.",abida@biologie.ens.fr; sruchaud@sb-roscoff.fr; laurentrios@greentech.fr; a.humeau@soliance.com; probert@sb-roscoff.fr; vargas@sb-roscoff.fr; bach@sb-roscoff.fr; cbowler@biologie.ens.fr,"Probert, Ian/M-9807-2019; Bowler, Chris/AAC-6256-2019; Ruchaud, Sandrine/AAJ-2179-2021; BACH, St√©phane/ABD-5865-2020","Bowler, Chris/0000-0003-3835-6187; de Vargas, Colomban/0000-0002-6476-6019; Probert, Ian/0000-0002-1643-1759",ANR/Investissements d'Avenir program by means of the Oceanomics project [ANR-11-BTBR-0008]; EU Micro B3 project; ERC; ANR,ANR/Investissements d'Avenir program by means of the Oceanomics project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); EU Micro B3 project; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"Work in our laboratories is funded by the ANR/Investissements d'Avenir program by means of the Oceanomics project (grant No. ANR-11-BTBR-0008).

The state-of-the-art National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) is used to examine, for the United States: (a) the potential role of technological progress on energy supply, consumption, and prices in U.S. energy markets and their impact on carbon emissions; (b) how success on one side of the supply or demand equation may reduce the potential benefits of technological progress on the other side; and (c) the sensitivity of energy intensity in the U.S. to technological change and adoption. Some of the key findings of the analysis include: (a) technological progress alone (without significant and effective new policies) is insufficient to achieve reduction of carbon emissions at or near 1990 levels by 2010; (b) successful R&D programs that improve the availability and market acceptance of cost-efficient transportation technologies, coupled with successful oil and gas supply R&D programs, could have a significant impact on reducing U.S. dependence on imported oil; (c) the annual rate of decline of energy intensity (primary energy used per dollar of GDP) between 1996 and 2015 appears to be bounded by 1.25 percent when real energy prices are relatively stable or gradually rising, even when more advanced technologies are made available to the market.","Off Integrated Analy & Forecasting, Energy Informat Adm, Washington, DC 20585 USA",,"Kydes, AS (corresponding author), Off Integrated Analy & Forecasting, Energy Informat Adm, 1000 Independence Ave SW,Mailstop EI-80, Washington, DC 20585 USA.",,,,,,,,10,8,11,0,10,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERGY J,Energy J.,,1999,3,,,,93,121,,,,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,216LE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000081443500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to help the world better combat COVID-19 and reduce its death toll, this study focuses on the COVID-19 mortality. First, using the multiple stepwise regression analysis method, the factors from eight aspects (economy, society, climate etc.) that may affect the mortality rates of COVID-19 in various countries is examined. In addition, a two-layer nested heterogeneous ensemble learning-based prediction method that combines linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) is developed to predict the development trends of COVID-19 mortality in various countries. Based on data from 79 countries, the experiment proves that age structure (proportion of the population over 70 years old) and medical resources (number of beds) are the main factors affecting the mortality of COVID-19 in each country. In addition, it is found that the number of nucleic acid tests and climatic factors are correlated with COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, when predicting COVID-19 mortality, the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning-based prediction method shows better prediction ability than state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as LR, SVM, ELM, random forest (RF), long short-term memory (LSTM) etc. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The primary source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for energy. As societys demand for energy increases and more CO2 is produced, it becomes imperative to decrease the amount emitted to the atmosphere. One promising approach to do this is to capture CO2 at the effluent of the combustion site, namely, power plants, in a process called postcombustion CO2 capture. Technologies to achieve this are heavily researched due in large part to the intuitive nature of removing CO2 from the stack gas and the ease in retrofitting existing CO2 sources with these technologies. As such, several reviews have been written on postcombustion CO2 capture. However, it is a fast-developing field, and the most recent review papers already do not include the state-of-the-art research. Notable among CO2 capture technologies are amine-based technologies. Amines are well-known for their reversible reactions with CO2, which make them ideal for the separation of CO2 from many CO2-containing gases, including flue gas. For this reason, this review will cover amine-based technology developed and published in and after the year 2013.","[Dutcher, Bryce; Fan, Maohong] Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Fan, Maohong; Russell, Armistead G.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University of Wyoming; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Fan, MH (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",mfan@uwyo.edu,"Fan, Maohong/H-3624-2015","Fan, Maohong/0000-0003-1334-7292; Dutcher, Bryce/0000-0002-3333-9591",National Science Foundation; Department of Energy,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.,,84,510,530,72,706,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

This new service model is closely related to previous well-known distributed computing initiatives such as Web services and grid computing. In the current socio-economic climate, the affordability of cloud computing has made it one of the most popular recent innovations. This has led to the availability of more and more cloud services, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly difficult for service consumers to find and access those cloud services that fulfil their requirements. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced platform that will assist in the process of discovering the cloud services that best match user needs. This fully-fledged system encompasses two basic functions: the creation of a repository with the semantic description of cloud services and the search for services that accomplish the required expectations. The cloud service's semantic repository is generated by means of an automatic tool that first annotates the cloud service descriptions with semantic content and then creates a semantic vector for each service. The comprehensive evaluation of the tool in the ICT domain has led to very promising results that outperform state-of-the-art solutions in similarly broad domains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It has produced more than 40 hominin remains, including several very informative skulls, found in direct association with faunal remains and numerous lithic artifacts. To date, fossil amphibians and reptiles are one of the few proxies that have been used to propose quantitative climate reconstructions for the time where the hominins were living at Dmanisi. The aim of the present study is to review and amplify the previous paleoclimatic interpretation given by Blain et al. (2014), with an enhanced methodology using geographic information system and based on uncertain distribution area occupied distribution area discrimination technique. This procedure permits to approach to a more precise common species distribution area and then using the WorldClim v. 2.1 climate database to propose for the first time monthly reconstructions for temperature and rainfall, in addition to annual parameters. The same technique is used to infer dominant ecoregions through the study area and potential tree coverage. Dmanisi climate is newly reconstructed as warm and semi-arid, similar to the present-day Mediterranean climate. New estimates however suggest warmer temperatures than previously reconstructed, together with a slightly higher but much more irregular amount of rainfall. The aridity indexes suggest a six months dry period, from May to October. Associated regional paleoenvironment is mainly characterized by Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub, and the potential tree coverage is around 25%, that is, much less forested than today. New estimates agree with the & lsquo;Iberian & rsquo; hominin ecological model, and with other proxies (large mammals, small mammals and archaeobotanical remains) that indicate a period of increased aridity contemporaneous with human occupations of the site.

Based upon a contemporary understanding of stress and a set of stressors that is a substantial update to existing scales, the Digital Stressors Scale (DSS) advances the measurement of digital stress. Initially, 138 items were constructed for the instrument and grouped into a set of 15 digital stressors. Based on a sample of N = 1,998 online questionnaires completed by individuals representative of the US employed population, the scale was refined using exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and PLS-SEM. The resulting and final scale consists of ten stressor categories reflective of one higher-order construct and a total of 50 items. Through a nomological network that includes important outcome variables of digital stress (emotional exhaustion, innovation climate, job satisfaction, user satisfaction) it was then demonstrated that the DSS provides substantial explanatory power, particularly related to emotional exhaustion and user satisfaction. Thus, the DSS constitutes a state-of-the-art self-report instrument to measure the extent of distress appraisal related to digital technologies in the workplace and helps to explain further how and why information and communication technologies can lead to adverse outcomes in individuals, thereby providing the starting point for job related organizational interventions.","[Fischer, Thomas] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Digital Business, Linz, Austria; [Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Bonn, Germany; [Riedl, Rene] Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Sch Business & Management, Digital Business, Steyr, Austria; [Riedl, Rene] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Business Informat Informat Engn, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz; University of Bonn; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Fischer, T (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Digital Business, Linz, Austria.;Reuter, M (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Bonn, Germany.;Riedl, R (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Sch Business & Management, Digital Business, Steyr, Austria.;Riedl, R (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Business Informat Informat Engn, Linz, Austria.",thomas.fischer@jku.at; martin.reuter@uni-bonn-diff.de; rene.riedl@fh-steyr.at,"zhang, zeyu/GLR-4184-2022",,Austrian Science Fund as part of the project 'Technostress in Organizations' at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria [P 30865],Austrian Science Fund as part of the project 'Technostress in Organizations' at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,This research was funded by the Austrian Science Fund as part of the project 'Technostress in Organizations' (grant no.

Consequently, there is a momentous incentive to shift to more resource-efficient soilless greenhouse production systems. Though there is considerable empirical and theoretical research devoted to specific issues related to control and management of soilless culture systems, a comprehensive approach that quantitatively considers relevant physicochemical processes within containerized soilless growth modules is missing. An important first step towards development of advanced soilless culture management strategies is a comprehensive characterization of hydraulic and physicochemical substrate properties. In this study we applied state-of-the-art measurement techniques to characterize six soilless substrates and substrate mixtures [i.e., coconut coir, perlite, volcanic tuff, perlite/coconut coir (50/50 vol.-%), tuff/coconut coir (70/30 vol.-%), and Growstone(R)/coconut coir (50/50 vol.-%)] that are used in commercial production in Israel and the United States. The measured substrate properties include water retention characteristics, saturated hydraulic conductivity, packing and particle densities, as well as phosphorus and ammonium adsorption isotherms. In addition, integral water availability and integral energy parameters were calculated to compare investigated substrates and provide valuable information for irrigation and fertigation management.","[Gohardoust, Mohammad R.; Effati, Mohaddese; Tuller, Markus] Univ Arizona, Dept Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Bar-Tal, Asher] Agr Res Org ARO, Volcani Ctr, Inst Soil Water & Environm Sci, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel",University of Arizona; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Tuller, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",gohardoust@email.arizona.edu; abartal@volcani.agri.gov.il; effati@email.arizona.edu; mtuller@email.arizona.edu,"Gohardoust, Mohammad/ABE-1992-2020","Tuller, Markus/0000-0003-3659-2768","United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) [US-4764-14 R]; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Hatch/Multi-State project [ARZT-1370600-R21-189]","United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Hatch/Multi-State project","This research was funded by The United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), grant number US-4764-14 R, and by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Hatch/Multi-State project number ARZT-1370600-R21-189.",,83,9,9,9,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,SEP,2020,9,,,,,,1403,10.3390/agronomy10091403,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10091403,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,OE3IJ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000580428100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The starting points were the improvement of pest management by the biocontrol of spider mites and the control of grape berry moths by mating disruption and an optimal soil management, followed over the years by state-of-the-art sprayer calibration, development of disease forecasting models (AgroMeteo, VitiMeteo), leaf-area adapted dosage of plant protection products, enhanced biodiversity, water and cover crop management.

Where mechanisation is possible, herbicides can progressively be replaced by mechanical technics, which is not possible in steep vineyards.

However, the stress field of new developments is strong and characterized by challenging demands from the market: Further improvement of the annual energy efficiency, reduced system complexity and a decreased cost of ownership. One key to success in commercial refrigeration is the application of a new generation of energy efficient CO2 compressors in a so-called baseline system. The features of this highly efficient compressor range, which is called ECOLINE+, is explained in this paper. The European standard EN13215 is considered as the standard method for the evaluation of the annual energy efficiencies. A more complex and time consuming method to calculate the annual energy efficiency is to consider the prevailing climate, more specific load profiles, the system configuration, operating times and resulting operating conditions of the compressors applied. This work provides an analytical study of different methods to calculate the annual energy efficiency for the new compressor generation compared to the standard compressor range and discusses the results of the comparison. The work proves that the relative potential for savings of the new generation of compressors can be determined with the two different methods and is in the range of 13 % for the discussed compressor models.","[Javerschek, Oliver; Pfaffl, Julian; Karbiner, Julian; Yi, Wang] BITZER Kuehlmaschinenbau GmbH, Peter Schaufler Str 3, D-72108 Rottenburg Ergenzingen, Germany",,"Javerschek, O (corresponding author), BITZER Kuehlmaschinenbau GmbH, Peter Schaufler Str 3, D-72108 Rottenburg Ergenzingen, Germany.",oliver.javerschek@bitzer.de; julian.pfaffl@bitzer.de; julian.karbiner@bitzer.de,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,INT INST REFRIGERATION,PARIS,"177 BLVD MALESHERBES, F-75017 PARIS, FRANCE",0151-1637,,978-2-36215-024-1,REFR SCI T,,,2018,,,,,348,355,,10.18462/iir.iccc.2018.0046,http://dx.doi.org/10.18462/iir.iccc.2018.0046,,,8,"Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BP0LZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000535355400043,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the path forward remains unclear and under-supported. Educators must take the initiative by bridging partnerships with clinical colleagues to create quality interprofessional learning experiences. Simulation is one such pedagogical tool, as it provides students a safe, controlled clinical setting in which to practice interprofessional communication and teamwork, while reinforcing skills learned in class. This philosophy gave rise to the University of Delaware's (UD) Healthcare Theatre program. Created in 2009 when the College of Health Sciences (Nursing, Physical Therapy, and Behavioral Health and Nutrition) partnered with the College of Arts and Sciences (Theatre and Medical Anthropology) and affiliated tertiary care hospitals, the program provides high-impact, low-cost educational opportunities that both students and teachers have found to be extremely valuable.

Snowpack information is crucial for assessing such things as the probability of a skier triggering an avalanche in between storms or the probability and size of natural avalanches during and after storms. However, profile evaluation is considered an art. There are few standard procedures and most forecasters have their own method. Some expert systems have been developed to interpret snow profiles but their knowledge base is not documented. The avalanche forecasting service in Switzerland has to analyse about 110 snow profiles recorded by its observers twice a month. This task is presently quite time-consuming, and the results are not fully consistent. Therefore, part of the decision-making process of some experienced forecasters at the Swiss Federal Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research was explored. Based on this broad experience, each parameter observed in a snow profile with a stability test has been described in view of stability evaluation. A tentative snowpack stability rating scheme is proposed for dry snow conditions in transitional or intermountain climate zones. The principal criteria are: rutschblock score, hardness, presence and type of weak layers, grain type and size. It should help the forecasters in the future to more consistently interpret snow profiles. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the construction of isolated active sites not only influences catalytic activity but also limits the understanding of the structure-catalyst relationship of CO2 reduction. Herein, we develop a universal synthetic protocol to fabricate different single-atom metal sites (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Ru) anchored on the triazine-based covalent organic framework (SAS/Tr-COF) backbone with the bridging structure of metal-nitrogen-chlorine for high-performance catalytic CO2 reduction. Remarkably, the as-synthesized Fe SAS/Tr-COF as a representative catalyst achieved an impressive CO generation rate as high as 980.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and a selectivity of 96.4%, over approximately 26 times higher than that of the pristine Tr-COF under visible light irradiation. From X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory calculations, the superior photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergic effect of atomically dispersed metal sites and Tr-COF host, decreasing the reaction energy barriers for the formation of *COOH intermediates and promoting CO2 adsorption and activation as well as CO desorption. This work not only affords rational design of state-of-the-art catalysts at the molecular level but also provides in-depth insights for efficient CO2 conversion.","[Ran, Lei; Li, Zhuwei; Cao, Jiaqi; Zhao, Yue; Song, Yurou; Hou, Jungang] Dalian Univ Technol, Frontiers Sci Ctr Smart Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, R China, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Ran, Lei; Leung, Michael K.

Aquaponics is an environmentally-friendly system that makes full reuse of wastes that are used as fertilizers for plants. At the same time it is more productive than soil-based agriculture and has consistent water savings, which makes it the ideal technology to produce food in resource-limited and climate-change affected areas. The chapter seeks to provide an understanding of aquaponics by giving an overview of the state of the art of past and current research and by outlining advantages and disadvantages of aquaponics against traditional agriculture (soil, soilless) and aquaculture. A comprehensive description of the aquaponic components is given together with a summary of the different systems in use, providing keys for understanding their characteristics and suitability in different climatic and operating conditions. Beside the production of quality crops for both market and backyard consumption, aquaponics could be a tool to address food insecurity in developing countries. Furthermore, new opportunities for aquaponics are also seen in the use of saline waters to provide tool for bioremediation of brackish-water and marine aquaculture, but management systems need to be adapted to the range of salt-tolerant plants and seaweeds available for either food, feed or fuel, as well as the market demand.","[Pantanella, Edoardo] CIHEAM IAM Bari, Valenzano, BA, Italy",CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI,"Pantanella, E (corresponding author), CIHEAM IAM Bari, Valenzano, BA, Italy.",edpantanella@gmail.com,,,,,,,77,6,6,0,25,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-73257-2; 978-3-319-73256-5,APPL ENV SCI ENG SUS,,,2018,,,,,191,248,,10.1007/978-3-319-73257-2_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73257-2_7,10.1007/978-3-319-73257-2,,58,Fisheries,Book Citation Index ‚Äì Science (BKCI-S),Fisheries,BL8II,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000456436200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The comparative study focusses on the way aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and structural dynamics are treated for DeepWind's 5MW Darrieus rotor mounted on a modified OC3 spar platform. The relevant modelling differences are described, followed by an introduction to the spar VAWT concept and selected load cases. Isolation of the aerodynamic model is achieved using an equivalent rigid land-based VAWT in steady wind-only environments. The added complexity in SIMO-RIFLEX-AC's aerodynamic model has shown to increase aerodynamic torque at tip-speed ratios above 2.5. Differences in the hydrodynamic and structural models were brought forward through fully coupled analyses in turbulent wind and irregular wave climates. It is found that the simplified mooring system in HAWC2 introduces a 2P yaw response (1P in SIMO-RIFLEX-AC), stronger motion coupling in surge-heave and a largely reduced mooring line tension since the dynamics of mooring lines are not considered. Indications are given that a higher tower mode is excited by 4P aerodynamic loading; an effect that is significantly stronger in HAWC2. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Parallels between psychoanalysis, art history and the social and natural sciences underline the idea of sexuality as a construct that can be revisited The nature of sexuality depends on how its irreducible biological basis is interpreted by a particular society at a particular time. The importance of revisiting is illustrated by Klein's concept of a position, which revisits the theoretical construct of a developmental stage. Freud's own construction of sexuality is based on his view of drive as comprising source, aim and object. Freud, in the Darwinian climate of his time, considered the object in terms of whether it served the fulfilment of the aim, bur his paradigm can today be understood more broadly than Freud himself was able to. A discussion of perversion shows that psychoanalysis has moved from seeing it as defensive against instinctual derivatives to seeing it as defensive against object-relatedness. This reflects a shift in the analytic conceptualisation of sexuality in general. Freud's paradigm for the sexual drive can be reconceived in terms of source, aim and quality of relatedness to object. Such a view of sexuality also has implications for gender issues, for the comparison of male and female perversion, and for the relation between sexuality and love.",,,"Parsons, M (corresponding author), 1 Offerton Rd, London SW4 0DH, England.",,,,,,,,42,26,26,0,26,INST PSYCHO-ANALYSIS,LONDON,"63 NEW CAVENDISH STREET, LONDON W1M 7RD, ENGLAND",0020-7578,,,INT J PSYCHOANAL,Int.

Their close access to consumers, profitable business models, and important roles in educational, social, and physical entertainment benefit both developing and developed nations. In this sense, Urban Water Resource Reclamation Facilities (WRRFs) can play a pivotal role in the sustainable implementation of urban agriculture. Reclaimed water as a recovered resource has less supply variability and in certain cases can be of higher quality than other water sources used in agriculture. Another recovered resource, namely, biosolids, as byproduct from wastewater treatment can be put to beneficial use as fertilizers, soil amendments, and construction material additives. The renewable electricity, heat, CO2, and bioplastics produced from WRRFs can also serve as essential resources in support of urban agriculture operation with enhanced sustainability. In short, this review exhibits a holistic picture of the state-of-the-art of urban agriculture in which WRRFs can potentially play a pivotal role.

Hyperspectral image (HSI) is one of the dominant remote sensing imaging modalities that captures information beyond the visible spectrum. The evolution of deep learning has made a significant impact on HSI analysis, mainly for its classification. The spatial-spectral feature-based classification model improves the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, these models are computationally expensive, and redundancy exists in the spatial dimension of features. This research work proposes a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) for HSI classification. The proposed model uses principal component analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing technique for optimal band extraction from HSIs. The hybrid CNN classification technique extracts the spectral and spatial features using three-dimensional CNN (3D CNN). These features are fed into a two-dimensional CNN (2D CNN) for further feature extraction and classification. The redundancy in spatial features of the hybrid CNN model is reduced by octave convolution (OctConv) instead of standard vanilla convolution. OctConv factorizes the spatial features into lower and higher spatial frequencies, and different convolutions are performed on them based on their frequencies. The hybrid model is compared against various state-of-the-art CNN-based techniques and found that the accuracy is boosted with a lesser computational cost.","[Mohan, Alkha; Sundaram, Venkatesan Meenakshi] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mangalore 575025, Karnataka, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka,"Mohan, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mangalore 575025, Karnataka, India.",mohan.alkha@gmail.com; venkisakthi77@gmail.com,,"MOHAN, ALKHA/0000-0002-1702-9235",,,,,37,6,6,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1861-8200,1861-8219,,J REAL-TIME IMAGE PR,J.

Lubricant-infused slippery surfaces (LISSs) with a homogeneous and ultra slippery surface are expected to be a reliable icephobic technique. Hence, the fabrication of simple and scalable bioinspired LISSs is important for practical applications. Experiments: Durable one-step LISSs consisting of silicone oil and polymer mixtures were fabricated. A grid map based on added oil and silica nanoparticles was developed to tune wettability, morphology, and slippery behavior of surfaces. A similar framework for ice adhesion of lubricant-infused coatings was also presented for the design of optimal icephobic materials. Findings: LISSs with slight hydrophobicity yield slippery properties, resulting in an order of magnitude lower ice adhesion compared to SHSs. The stable 20-w% silicone-oil-infused slippery coating with slight hydrophobicity and silica nanoparticles was found to be effective in anti-icing. The nanoparticles firmly anchor the oil overlayer and eliminate contamination by drying the surface. The LISSs made of polymers with surface energy ranging from 29 to 31 mJ/m(2) show the potential to achieve low ice adhesion. As a result, the use of systematic frameworks highlights the role of material parameters. One-production strategy can be broadly used to design icephobic materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Exploiting bio-renewables, viz., inedible saccharides, to reduce the anthropogenic carbon footprint upon providing a sustainable and promising technology that is of interest to different groups of scientists, to overcome demerits associated with the current state-of-the-art aqueous amine scrubbing agents, following a green chemistry guideline, by employing materials with properties relevant to the environment toward sustainable development.

The future research directions are discussed to provide insight toward achieving sustainable development through implementing bio-renewables.","[Qaroush, Abdussalam K.; Alazzeh, Shrouq S.; Abeskhron, Ream H.] Univ Jordan, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Alshamaly, Hiba S.; Eftaiha, Ala'a F.] Hashemite Univ, Dept Chem, POB 150459, Zarqa 13115, Jordan; [Assaf, Khaleel I.] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Life Sci & Chem, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",University of Jordan; Hashemite University; Jacobs University,"Qaroush, AK (corresponding author), Univ Jordan, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Amman 11942, Jordan.;Eftaiha, AF (corresponding author), Hashemite Univ, Dept Chem, POB 150459, Zarqa 13115, Jordan.;Assaf, KI (corresponding author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Life Sci & Chem, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",a.qaroush@ju.edu.jo; k.assaf@jacobs-university.de; alaa.e.aiha@hu.edu.jo,"Qaroush, Abdussalam K./I-7175-2017; Eftaiha, Alaa F./HGD-7091-2022; Assaf, Khaleel/I-8807-2017","Qaroush, Abdussalam K./0000-0001-6549-7693; Eftaiha, Alaa F./0000-0003-4285-2546; Assaf, Khaleel/0000-0003-4331-8492","Hashemite University, Jordan","Hashemite University, Jordan","AFE acknowledges research support from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the Hashemite University, Jordan.",,104,23,23,1,61,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2041-6520,2041-6539,,CHEM SCI,Chem.

However, autonomous navigation of outdoor trails remains a challenging problem. Recent work has sought to address this issue using deep learning. Although this approach has achieved state-of-the-art results, the deep learning paradigm may be limited due to a reliance on large amounts of annotated training data. Collecting and curating training datasets may not be feasible or practical in many situations, especially as trail conditions may change due to seasonal weather variations, storms, and natural erosion. In this paper, we explore an approach to address this issue through virtual-to-real-world transfer learning using a variety of deep learning models trained to classify the direction of a trail in an image. Our approach utilizes synthetic data gathered from virtual environments for model training, bypassing the need to collect a large amount of real images of the outdoors. We validate our approach in three main ways. First, we demonstrate that our models achieve classification accuracies upwards of 95% on our synthetic data set. Next, we utilize our classification models in the control system of a simulated robot to demonstrate feasibility. Finally, we evaluate our models on real-world trail data and demonstrate the potential of virtual-to-real-world transfer learning.","[Iuzzolino, Michael L.; Walker, Michael E.; Szafir, Daniel] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Szafir, Daniel] Univ Colorado, ATLAS Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Iuzzolino, ML (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",michael.iuzzolino@colorado.edu; michael.walker-1@colorado.edu; daniel.szafir@colorado.edu,,"SZAFIR, DANIEL/0000-0003-1848-7884",NSF CRII Award [1566612]; Air Force [SMC FA8810-17-C-0006]; NASA's Space Technology Research Grants Program [NNX16AR58G],NSF CRII Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Air Force; NASA's Space Technology Research Grants Program,"This work was supported by a NSF CRII Award #1566612, Air Force SMC FA8810-17-C-0006, and an Early Career Faculty grant from NASA's Space Technology Research Grants Program under award NNX16AR58G.

Nevertheless, they form an important part of the way of life of archaeological populations and can provide information about everyday life, farming, art, trade, economy, technological development. One way of discovering organic finds, in this case textile remains, are those cases when they withstand the test of time by remaining attached to metal finds. As part of the corrosion process, metal forms corrosion products around textile fibres, thus preserving the shape of the textile. A small number of such finds - 8 - was found in 7 Late Avar Period graves at the Nustar/Dvorac site. According to other finds from these graves, they can be dated in period between 750 and 800 AD. Metal finds with preserved textiles from Nustar include parts of the garments of the deceased (belt buckles, hinges, and clasps) and tools (knives). Textile analyses have revealed simple textiles made of tabby with Z-spun yarns. Analyses of these textiles have identified their function as different parts of garments and as shrouds. Compared to other contemporary Avar period sites, nothing new has been noticed, but the importance of this work lies in awareness of the great value of archaeological textiles, which can be put to use in many different fields of science.","[Groemer, Karina] Nat Hist Museum Vienna, Prehist Dept, Burgring 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Papesa, Anita Rapan] Gradski Muzej Vinkovci, HR-32100 Vinkovci, Croatia",,"Gromer, K (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Vienna, Prehist Dept, Burgring 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",karina.groemer@nhm-wien.ac.at; anita@muzejvk.hr,,,,,,,37,1,1,2,2,ARHEOLOSKI MUZEJ & ZAGREBU,ZAGREB,"TRG N ZRINSKOG 19, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA",0350-7165,,,VJESN ARHEOL MUZ ZAG,Vjesn.

Are there midlatitude coupled ocean-atmosphere modes? Is there significant predictability in the midlatitudes? The authors address these questions in the broader context of trying to understand the mechanisms behind midlatitude variability. using an idealized model of the ocean-atmosphere system. The atmosphere is represented using a global two-level eddy-resolving primitive equation model with simplified physical parameterizations. The ocean is represented using a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model, but configured in a simple Atlantic-like sector geometry. In addition to a coupled integration using this model, uncoupled integrations of the component oceanic and atmospheric models are also carried our to elucidate the mechanisms behind midlatitude variability. The sea surface temperature in the coupled equilibrium state exhibits two dominant modes of variability : (i) a passive oceanic red noise response to stochastic atmospheric forcing. and (ii) an active oceanic mode of variability that is partially excited by atmospheric forcing, and is associated with a periodicity of 16-20 vr. True coupled ocean-atmosphere modes do not appear to play any quantitatively significant rule in the midlatitudes, due to the fundamentally different nature of atmospheric dynamics in the midlatitudes compared to the Tropics. However, coupling to the atmosphere does play an important role in determining the spatial and temporal characteristics of the oceanic variability. A statistical assessment suggests that midlatitude atmospheric predictability is modest compared to the predictability associated with tropical phenomena such as El Nino. This predictability arises from the atmospheric response to oceanic modes of variability). rather than from coupled modes. There is significant oceanic predictability on interannual timescales but not on decadal timescales.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Saravanan, R (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",,"Doney, Scott C/F-9247-2010; Saravanan, Ramalingam/G-8879-2012","Doney, Scott C/0000-0002-3683-2437; Saravanan, Ramalingam/0000-0002-0005-6907",,,,,51,31,31,0,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Therefore, promoting the development of electric vehicles is fundamental to facing the challenges of climate change and achieving sustainable transportation. For this reason, this article presents a bibliometric analysis based on databases to elaborate on the state of the art that integrates successful cases in the design and implementation of charging stations for electric vehicles. Once the results are presented, a methodological model is proposed for the design of charging stations considering restrictions and recommendations issued by international standardization organizations. The Digsilent PowerFactory software analyzes the behavior of active and reactive power, voltage, and current. Finally, a system for different charging modes and powers is proposed. The charging system is tested through the insertion of phase-ground, phase-phase, and three-phase short circuits located at the connection points of the charging stations, and the faults are inserted and released in different periods for the analysis of system stability. As a result, it has a stable system for all proposed scenarios, as long as the fault is released; otherwise, the system remains unstable. The three-phase fault is the most severe for the load system, making the performance of the protections assigned to each circuit essential.","[Tamay, Pablo] Univ Politecn Salesiana, Elect Program, Cuenca 010102, Ecuador; [Inga, Esteban] Univ Politecn Salesiana, Smart Grid Res Grp, ICT Educ Program, Quito 170525, Ecuador; [Tamay, Pablo] Postgrad Dept, Giron Campus,Av 12 Octubre 23-52, Quito 170525, Ecuador",Universidad Politecnica Salesiana; Universidad Politecnica Salesiana,"Inga, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Salesiana, Smart Grid Res Grp, ICT Educ Program, Quito 170525, Ecuador.",jtamaycr@est.ups.edu.ec; einga@ups.edu.ec,"; Inga, Esteban/M-7817-2015","Tamay, Pablo/0000-0002-4599-7081; Inga, Esteban/0000-0002-0837-0642",Universidad Politecnica Salesiana; GIREI -Smart Grid Research Group,Universidad Politecnica Salesiana; GIREI -Smart Grid Research Group,This work was supported by Universidad Politecnica Salesiana and GIREI -Smart Grid Research Group under the project Charging of electric vehicles in buildings and its impact on the sizing and planning of electrical distribution networks.,,32,1,1,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,,,,,,8248,10.3390/su14148248,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14148248,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3H6YB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000832178400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here the changes in desk studies, remote sensing, field mapping and various facets of ground investigations are examined. However, it is also necessary to highlight how global developments in communications and computing power have had an enormous impact on engineering geological practice, notably through on-site links between field teams and head office, and the creation of data management systems that allow complex ground conditions to be analysed and modelled. There have also been important improvements in on-site health and safety, the creation of professional qualifications and the adoption of international and national standards for all facets of ground engineering. Finally, some of the challenges engineering geology and its practitioners face in the future are explored, notably the implications of Industry 4.0, the changes that climate change will bring to society, training the next generation and ensuring that engineering geology remains a vibrant and globally recognized profession.","[Griffiths, James S.] Univ Plymouth, SoGEES, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Griffiths, JS (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, SoGEES, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",jim.griffiths@plymouth.ac.uk,"Griffiths, James/X-1862-2019","Griffiths, James/0000-0002-6431-3992",,,,,74,7,7,0,4,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBL HOUSE,BATH,"UNIT 7, BRASSMILL ENTERPRISE CENTRE, BRASSMILL LANE, BATH BA1 3JN, AVON, ENGLAND",1470-9236,2041-4803,,Q J ENG GEOL HYDROGE,Q.

Earth's biodiversity is increasingly under threat by sources of anthropogenic change (e.g. resource extraction, land use change, and climate change) and surveying animal populations is critical for developing conservation strategies. However, manually monitoring tropical forests or deep oceans is intractable. For species that communicate acoustically, researchers have argued for placing audio recorders in the habitats as a cost-effective and non-invasive method, a strategy known as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). In collaboration with conservation efforts, we construct a large labeled dataset of passive acoustic recordings of the African Forest Elephant via crowdsourcing, compromising thousands of hours of recordings in the wild. Using state-of-the-art techniques in artificial intelligence we improve upon previously proposed methods for passive acoustic monitoring for classification and segmentation. In real-time detection of elephant calls, network bandwidth quickly becomes a bottleneck and efficient ways to compress the data are needed. Most audio compression schemes are aimed at human listeners and are unsuitable for low-frequency elephant calls. To remedy this, we provide a novel end-to-end differentiable method for compression of audio signals that can be adapted to acoustic monitoring of any species and dramatically improves over naive coding strategies.","[Bjorck, Johan; Rappazzo, Brendan H.; Chen, Di; Bernstein, Richard; Gomes, Carla P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Wrege, Peter H.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Bioacoust Res Program, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Bjorck, J (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,NSF Expedition [CCF-1522054]; ARO DURIP [W911NF-17-1-0187]; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Robert G. and Jane V.

The target area is the Sea of Iroise (western Brittany) considered as one of the most energetic regions along the French coasts with a mean offshore energy flux around 50 kW m(-1). Model predictions based on the same settings are first evaluated against available measurements of significant wave height and peak period at nine wave buoys. Wave power predictions are then compared during a eight-year period (2004-2011). Patterns of wave energy flux present in both cases the same spatial and seasonal distributions identifying coastal hot spots off the isles of Ushant and Sein, the bay of Audierne, the headland of Penmarc'h and the Crozon peninsula. In offshore waters, SWAN provides however wave power estimates by 15% lower than TOMAWAC predictions. A part of these differences is attributed to the computational methods for extracting the wave energy flux from model predictions as SWAN method neglects additional terms in the output evaluation of the total wave potential. Differences are reduced to 5-10% in shallow waters where uncertainties in wave power characterisation appear mainly associated with the inter-annual and inter-seasonal variabilities of the wave climate.

The Prince Regent sought to establish a climate in which literature and the arts could flourish, but, because of his disorderly private life, his lavishly wasteful use of public funds, and his involvement in party-politics, he was often in conflict with contemporary writers. Leigh Hunt's strictures on the Regent earned him a two-year prison sentence, much to the indignation of many of his fellow writers. By contrast, the poet laureate Robert Southey had a complicit and compromised relationship with the Regent that had as much if not more to do with politics than it did with literature. Yet others, such as Walter Scott, who shared much of the Regent's political outlook, maintained friendly relations with him that were largely or entirely untainted. On the other hand, Jane Austen expressed her dislike of the Regent, and her unwillingness to dedicate Emma to him in the tightly rigid formulation of the Dedication. Finally, two poets who were also friends, Byron and Thomas Moore, expressed a covert but growing contempt for the Regent.","[Williams, Michael] Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Williams, M (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.",willimj@unisa.ac.za,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1812-5441,1753-5409,,SCRUTINY2,Scrutiny2,,2012,1,,,,76,86,,10.1080/18125441.2012.706063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/18125441.2012.706063,,,11,Literature,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Literature,V74GT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000211766200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Island endemics are among the most vulnerable to such change, accounting for a disproportionate number of recent extinctions. To prevent extinctions and conserve island biodiversity it is vital to combine knowledge of species' ecologies with their complex evolutionary histories. The Bering Sea has a history of cyclical island isolation and reconnection, coupled with modern rates of climate change that exceed global averages. The endangered Pribilof Island shrew (Sorex pribilofensis) is endemic to St. Paul Island, Alaska, which was isolated from mainland Beringia similar to 14,000years ago by rising sea levels. Using similar to 11,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 17 microsatellites and mitochondrial sequence data, we test predictions about the evolutionary processes driving shrew speciation across Beringia. Our data show considerable differentiation of S. pribilofensis from mainland sibling species, relative to levels of divergence between mainland shrews. We also find a genome-wide loss of diversity and extremely low N-e for S. pribilofensis. We then show that intraspecific genetic diversity is significantly related to interspecific divergence, and that differentiation between S. pribilofensis and other Beringian shrews is highest across loci that are fixed in S. pribilofensis, indicating that strong drift has driven differentiation of this island species. Our findings show that drift as a consequence of Arctic climate cycling can rapidly reshape insular biodiversity. Arctic island species that lack genomic diversity and have evolved in response to past climate may have limited ability to respond to modern environmental changes.","[Wiens, Ben J.; Combe, Fraser J.; Hope, Andrew G.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Dickerson, Bobette] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, 333 Raspberry Rd, Anchorage, AK 99518 USA; [Divine, Lauren M.; Padula, Veronica M.] Ecosyst Conservat Off, Aleut Community St Paul Isl, St Paul, AK USA; [Sage, George K.; Talbot, Sandra L.] Far Northwestern Inst Art & Sci, Anchorage, AK USA",Kansas State University; Alaska Department of Fish & Game,"Wiens, B (corresponding author), Biodivers Inst, 1345 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",bjwiens@ku.edu,,"Wiens, Ben/0000-0002-6125-4579","National Institutes of Health [P20GM113109]; National Science Foundation [ACI-1440548, CHE-1726332, CNS-1006860, EPS-0919443, EPS-1006860]; U.S. Geological Survey",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),"National Institutes of Health, Grant/ Award Number: P20GM113109; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: ACI-1440548, CHE-1726332, CNS-1006860, EPS-0919443 and EPS-1006860; U.S. Geological Survey",,139,0,0,21,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

These soils are typically formed by the weathering of carbonate or other rocks rich in iron and aluminium oxides in hot-humid climates and susceptible to a large reduction in disintegration upon wetting or other conditions. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review on the red soil disintegration mechanism and intergranular suction with reference to red soil. The present paper reviews the research progress that has been made regarding the disintegration characteristics and testing methods of the intergranular suction of red soil, including (1) influencing factors of disintegration and the mechanism of action, (2) advantages and disadvantages of each intergranular suction testing method and (3) the intrinsic relationship between disintegration and intergranular suction. The study indicated that the research on the disintegration mechanism of red soil is still in the macro stage, involving the different moisture contents, temperatures and other directly influential conditions. Soil disintegration characteristics have not been extensively analysed from the micro perspective (including pore structure and distribution, fracture development degree and particle arrangements). When these problems are solved, disintegration studies of red soil will be advanced. Some limitations of the previous research are highlighted at the end of the paper, and suggestions are made for future research.","[Sun, Yinlei; Xie, Jianbin] Yunnan Univ, Sch Architecture & Planning, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yinlei; Tang, Liansheng] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Tang, Liansheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",Yunnan University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Sun Yat Sen University,"Tang, LS (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.;Tang, LS (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",eestls@mail2.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877228, 41877229, 42102303, 42277142]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2018B030311066, 2019A1515010554]; Science and Technology of Guangzhou City, China [201904010136]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Science and Technology of Guangzhou City, China","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877228, 41877229, 42102303 and 42277142), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2018B030311066 and 2019A1515010554) and Science and Technology of Guangzhou City, China (201904010136).",,191,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,21,,,,,,14234,10.3390/su142114234,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114234,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6C7DL,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000882169900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It provides a greater understanding of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover in forest soils. P organic hydrolysis, soil mineral solubilization, indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, resistance factors, and production of siderophores by rhizosphere microbial populations help to explain the tolerance of Eucalyptus plants to biotic and abiotic stresses and the apparent steady-state condition of C and N soil stocks in many planted forests. This work aims to present the main findings on Eucalyptus rhizosphere processes and highlights their importance for trees nutrition, especially for N mineralization triggered by microbial activation or microbial community structure changes regarding the so-called rhizosphere priming effect and N fixation. Furthermore, we present an explanatory conceptual model of the steady-state condition for soil organic matter (SOM) stocks and its relation with fertilization based on a nutrient balance model. This review also considers the main experimental and modeling studies that demonstrate the quantitative importance of rhizosphere processes to Eucalyptus genus and their shortcomings. This provides a framework for process modeling under scenarios of global climate change. A better understanding of rhizosphere microbiological processes may allow improvements in Eucalyptus nutrition and production, as well as in accurate long-term estimates of SOM stocks and C-CO2 exchanges between forest soils and the atmosphere.

To increase the spatial resolution, researchers have been challenged to obtain a synthesized panchromatic band with a fine resolution for all S2 bands. The capacity to collect satellite imagery with a short revisit time at different spatial resolutions increases the ability for more accurate data fusion applications. Our work presents an investigation of different synthesized panchromatic bands for producing high-resolution S2 data. We produced a synthesized environment from PlanetScope (PS) data to evaluate the performance of different panchromatic bands for the enhancement of S2 10- and 20-m bands. For this, imagery over three different study areas with different characteristics was chosen: Pakistan, North Macedonia, and Turkey. After the three different synthesized panchromatic bands were produced, we fused the panchromatic bands with the 10- and 20-m S2 bands with three different state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques. Experimental comparison between the three newly produced panchromatic bands indicates that all synthesized bands can enhance the spatial resolution of the original multispectral bands. Since the difference in spatial resolution may be critical for more detailed image classification, for future studies, we recommend investigation of the fused data for different land cover applications.

Beyond investing in conventional transmission lines, new technologies, such as energy storage, can improve operational flexibility and assist with the cost-effective integration of renewables. Given the long lifetime of these network assets and their substantial capital cost, it is imperative to decide on their deployment on a long-term cost-benefit basis. However, such an analysis can result in large-scale mixed integer linear programming problems that contain many thousands of continuous and binary variables. Complexity is severely exacerbated by the need to accommodate multiple candidate assets and consider a wide range of exogenous system development scenarios that may occur. In this paper, we propose a novel, efficient, and highly generalizable framework for solving large-scale planning problems under uncertainty by using a temporal decomposition scheme based on the principles of Nested Benders. The challenges that arise due to the presence of nonsequential investment state equations and sub-problem nonconvexity are highlighted and tackled. The substantial computational gains of the proposed method are demonstrated via a case study on the IEEE 118 bus test system that involve planning of multiple transmission and storage assets under long-term uncertainty. The proposed method is shown to substantially outperform the current state of the art.","[Falugi, Paola; Konstantelos, Ioannis; Strbac, Goran] Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Falugi, P (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",p.falugi@imperial.ac.uk; i.konstantelos@imperial.ac.uk; g.Strbac@imperial.ac.uk,,"Konstantelos, Ioannis/0000-0002-4619-2592; Falugi, Paola/0000-0002-3619-6936","EPSRC [EP/N030028/1]; EPSRC [EP/M015025/1, EP/I013636/1, EP/E020798/1, EP/K002252/1, EP/L019469/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M015025/1, EP/N030028/1, EP/I013636/1, EP/L019469/1, EP/E020798/1, EP/K002252/1] Funding Source: researchfish",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by EPSRC under Grant EP/N030028/1.,,65,18,19,1,16,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0885-8950,1558-0679,,IEEE T POWER SYST,IEEE Trans.

Hydrogen, a potential and clean fuel, can be applied in the state-of-the-art technology of 'zero emission' vehicles. Hydrogen economy infrastructure both for stationary and mobile purposes is complicated due to its critical physico-chemical properties and materials play crucial roles in every stage of hydrogen production to utilization in fuel cells in achieving high conversion efficiency, safety and robustness of the technologies involved. Moreover, traditional hydrogen storage facilities are rather complicated due to its anomalous properties such as highly porous solids and polymers have intrinsic microporosity, which is the foremost favorable characteristics of fast kinetics and reversibility, but the major drawback is the low storage capacity. In contrast, metal hydrides and complex hydrides have high hydrogen storage capacity but thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, hydrogen storage is a real challenge to realize 'hydrogen economy' that will solve the critical issues of humanity such as energy depletion, greenhouse emission, air pollution and ultimately climate change. Magnesium based materials, particularly magnesium hydride (MgH2) has been proposed as a potential hydrogen storage material due to its high gravimetric and volumetric capacity as well as environmentally benign properties to work the grand challenge out.","[Rahman, Md.

Detecting selection in complex spatial environments remains challenging, especially for threatened species where the effects of strong genetic drift may overwhelm signatures of selection. We carried out a basinwide riverscape genomic analysis in the threatened southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. High-resolution environmental data and 5162 high-quality filtered SNPs were used to clarify spatial population structure and to assess footprints of selection associated with a steep hydroclimatic gradient and with human disturbance across the naturally and anthropogenically fragmented Murray-Darling Basin (Australia). Our approach included FST outlier tests to define neutral loci, and a combination of spatially explicit genotype-environment association analyses to identify candidate adaptive loci while controlling for the effects of landscape structure and shared population history. We found low levels of genetic diversity and strong neutral population structure consistent with expectations based on spatial stream hierarchy and life history. In contrast, variables related to precipitation and temperature appeared as the most important environmental surrogates for putatively adaptive genetic variation at both regional and local scales. Human disturbance also influenced the variation in candidate loci for adaptation, but only at a local scale. Our study contributes to understanding of adaptive evolution along naturally and anthropogenically fragmented ecosystems. It also offers a tangible example of the potential contributions of landscape genomics for informing in situ and ex situ conservation management of biodiversity.","[Brauer, Chris J.; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Nat Sci, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Beheregaray, LB (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia.",luciano.beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,"Beheregaray, Luciano/AAY-6384-2021; Beheregaray, Luciano B/A-8621-2008","Beheregaray, Luciano/0000-0003-0944-3003; Beheregaray, Luciano B/0000-0003-0944-3003; Brauer, Chris/0000-0003-2968-5915; Hammer, Michael/0000-0002-0981-4647",Australian Research Council [FT130101068]; AJ & IM Naylon PhD Scholarship,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); AJ & IM Naylon PhD Scholarship,"We thank the many people who helped with fieldwork, especially Peter Unmack and Mark Adams for curating samples.

This phase is characterized by sweeping through a wide set of parameter combinations of SVM kernel and cost parameters. As a consequence this process is computationally expensive but represents a principled way of tuning a model for better accuracy and to prevent overfitting together with regularization that is in SVMs inherently solved in the optimization. Since the cross-validation technique is done in a principled way also known as 'gridsearch', we aim at supporting remote sensing scientists in two ways. Firstly by reducing the time-to-solution of the cross-validation by applying state-of-the-art parallel processing methods because the sweep of parameters and cross-validation runs itself can be nicely parallelized. Secondly by reducing manual labour by automating the parallel submission processes since manually performing cross-validation is very time consuming, unintuitive, and error-prone especially in large-scale cluster or super-computing environments (e.g., batch job scripts, node/core/task parameters, etc.).","[Memon, Shahbaz; Cavallaro, Gabriele; Riedel, Morris] Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, Julich, Germany; [Memon, Shahbaz; Riedel, Morris; Neukirchen, Helmut] Univ Iceland, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Iceland,"Memon, S (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, Julich, Germany.;Memon, S (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland.",m.memon@fz-juelich.de,"Cavallaro, Gabriele/AAB-8763-2020; Riedel, Morris/AAD-7768-2021; Cavallaro, Gabriele/K-8947-2018","Cavallaro, Gabriele/0000-0002-3239-9904; Riedel, Morris/0000-0003-1810-9330; Cavallaro, Gabriele/0000-0002-3239-9904",Julich Supercomputing Centre (JSC); NordForsk as part of the Nordic Center of Excellence (NCoE) eSTICC (eScience Tools for Investigating Climate Change at High Northern Latitudes),Julich Supercomputing Centre (JSC); NordForsk as part of the Nordic Center of Excellence (NCoE) eSTICC (eScience Tools for Investigating Climate Change at High Northern Latitudes),Thanks to Julich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) for funding.

Meanwhile, vernacular architecture has been able to sustainably adapt to climate by developing creative and local solutions which provide a comfortable living environment, consume less energy and cause less pollution than the new ways of construction, one of which is wind induced ventilation. Vernacular architecture of Sistan (southeast of Iran) is not an exception to this rule. It utilizes its own set of unique elements and techniques that are compatible with region's climate. This original article studies wind induced ventilation and its elements in Sistan's architecture, including: (1) roofs (Sistani, Filpush and Barrel); (2) ventilator openings (Kolak, Surak and Dariche); and (3) walls. Then, this paper continues to classify three different compound room types in Sistan's architecture, based on orientation and use of mentioned elements by documenting thirty-two sample houses across the region: (1) stretched against the prevailing winds; (2) stretched aligned with the winds; and (3) L shaped. CFD simulations are used to study the wind behavior and evaluate the ventilation performance of these room-types. These simulations lead to guidelines to enhance the ventilation performance of existing buildings and future constructions, including: where to put the windows, which orientation maximizes the natural ventilation performance, where to consider precautions to block the undesirable winds from entering and how far from each other should different room types be built.","[Heidari, Abolfazl] Univ Zabol, Art & Architecture Fac, Dept Architecture, Zabol 9861335856, Iran; [Sahebzadeh, Sadra] Univ Tehran, Sch Architecture, Fine Arts Fac, Tehran 1417466191, Iran; [Dalvand, Zahra] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Design, Tehran 1983969411, Iran",University of Tehran; Shahid Beheshti University,"Heidari, A (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Art & Architecture Fac, Dept Architecture, Zabol 9861335856, Iran.;Sahebzadeh, S (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Sch Architecture, Fine Arts Fac, Tehran 1417466191, Iran.",abolfazlheidari@uoz.ac.ir; s.sahebzadeh@ut.ac.ir; z.dalvand@mail.sbu.ac.ir,"Sahebzadeh, Sadra/AAX-5031-2021","Sahebzadeh, Sadra/0000-0002-2010-3096",,,,,58,21,21,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2017,6,,,,,,1048,10.3390/su9061048,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9061048,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY6ZF,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000404133200173,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we assess the genetic connectivity of two bunyaviruses (Kigluaik phantom orthophasmavirus or KIGV and Nome phantom orthophasmavirus or NOMV) with zooplanktonic hosts from subarctic ponds. We expected weak genetic structure among populations as the hosts (phantom midges) have a terrestrial winged dispersal stage. To test whether their respective viruses mirror this structure, we collected and analyzed population datasets from 21 subarctic freshwater ponds and obtained sequences from all four genes in the viral genomes. Prevalence averaged 66 per cent for 514 host specimens and was not significantly different between recently formed thaw ponds and glacial ponds. Unexpectedly, KIGV from older ponds showed pronounced haplotype divergence with little evidence of genetic connectivity. However, KIGV populations from recent thaw ponds appeared to be represented by a closely related haplotype group, perhaps indicating a genotypic dispersal bias. Unlike KIGV, NOMV had modest structure and diversity in recently formed thaw ponds. For each virus, we found elevated genetic diversity relative to the host, but similar population structures to the host. Our results suggest that non-random processes such as virus-host interactions, genotypic bias, and habitat effects differ among polar aquatic RNA viruses.","[Ballinger, Matthew J.; Taylor, Derek J.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Medeiros, Andrew S.] York Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Qin, Jie] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ballinger, Matthew J.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; York University - Canada; Capital Normal University; University of Victoria,"Ballinger, MJ (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.;Ballinger, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada.",mattball@uvic.ca,"Medeiros, Andrew S./I-1947-2019; Ballinger, Matthew/J-7545-2019","Medeiros, Andrew S./0000-0002-7743-2560; Ballinger, Matthew/0000-0001-7453-8725",National Science Foundation [ARC 1023334],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to Art Borkent, Alexey Kotov, William Nichols, Skyler Resendez for assistance collecting Chaoborus samples and Jack Zhan for help with coding.

The analysis model of the impact of the meteorological comfort ecosystem on the human respiratory system is constructed to analyze the relationship between major meteorological elements and human respiratory diseases, as well as the distribution characteristics of mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. The results of this model show that human respiratory diseases are most significantly related to mean temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature, and respiratory disease mortality has the distinct seasonality in time distribution. In the summer half year, the climatic environment of low pressure, high temperature and multiple precipitations has the milder effect on the respiratory tract, and it is not easy to cause death of patients with respiratory diseases.

Evidence is given that people sleep comfortably where temperatures are 29-31 degrees C in their personal space within the bed and they use bedclothes to allow them to attain these temperatures.

Numerous studies have shown that green roofs (GRs) have great potential for facilitating urban heat mitigation. However, little is known about whether such cooling effects can be achieved under extreme heat conditions. With the expected occurrence of more extreme heat events under climate change, such understanding is crucially important for the effective design of heat mitigation. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the pedestrian-level cooling effect of GR under two weather conditions (i.e., typical summer weather conditions and extreme heat conditions). This research employed a three-dimensional simulation model, ENVI-met, to simulate pedestrian-level air temperature for three typical residential areas with different roof heights in Beijing. We conducted the simulations in two different roof scenarios, conventional roofs versus green roofs. The results showed that green roofs could provide large cooling exceeding 0.2 degrees C on downwind sides and in the daytime, although the average cooling intensity was small. The pedestrian-level cooling intensity of GR decreased significantly under extreme heat conditions compared to typical summer weather conditions. It varied diurnally following an inverted W-shape for both weather conditions. Results also showed that the pedestrian-level cooling intensity of GR decreased with the increase in roof height in a nonlinear way and became 0 when roof height reached similar to 50m for both weather conditions. The results of our research can provide important insights for cooling-oriented urban design in the future, as we are expecting such extreme weather conditions nowadays may be the new normal in the future.","[Feng, Ye; Wang, Jia; Li, Xiaoma] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art Design, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Feng, Ye; Yu, Xiaoying] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Feng, Ye; Li, Xiaoma] Hunan Prov Key Lab Landscape Ecol & Planning Desi, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jia; Zhou, Weiqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Eco Environm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University; Hunan Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Yu, X (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Wang, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Eco Environm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiawang@rcees.ac.cn; yuxiaoying@hunau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [32001160, 32001161]; Education Department of Hunan Province [20B297]; Science and Technology Bureau, Changsha [kq2202227]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Education Department of Hunan Province; Science and Technology Bureau, Changsha","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32001160, No. 32001161), the Education Department of Hunan Province (Grant No. 20B297), and the Science and Technology Bureau, Changsha (kq2202227).",,72,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The physicochemical properties of the cross-linked PA layer are the main criteria determining the filtration performance of the resultant TFC membrane, and this selective layer can be created through Interfacial Polymerization (IP) between two immiscible active monomers, i.e., amine monomer in aqueous solution and acyl chloride monomer in organic solution. This patent review article intends to provide insights to researchers in fabricating improved properties of TFC membranes through the utilization of secondary monomers during IP process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that gives a state-of-the-art account of the subject matter by emphasizing the impacts of secondary monomers (both amine and acyl chloride monomers) on the properties of conventional TFC membranes for nanofiltration and reverse osmosis applications. Our review indicated that the introduction of secondary monomers into either aqueous or organic solution could alter the physical and chemical properties of PA layer, which led to variations in membrane filtration performance. Nevertheless, more research is still required, as most of the secondary monomers reported in the literature did not overcome the membrane trade-off effect between permeability and selectivity.

An experimental field study has been carried out in the Mediterranean climate area of Spain and the Canary Islands in order to assess the air permeability of the building envelope and its energy impact. A wide characterization and Blower Door tests have been performed in 225 cases in Alicante, Barcelona, Malaga, Sevilla and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria for this purpose. The obtained mean air permeability rate for the 225 studied cases was 6.56 m(3)/(h.m(2)). The influence of several variables on airtightness was statistically analysed, although only location, climate zone and window material were found to be significant. Air infiltration has an energy impact between 2.43 and 16.44 kWh/m(2).year on the heating demand and between 0.54 and 3.06 kWh/m(2).year on the cooling demand. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicated that tea, dried tender bamboo shoots, chestnuts, and Torreya were ranked at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th in the average production. There were significant correlations between the coefficient of variation (CV) of annual average air temperature and the CV of production in dried tender bamboo shoots, and also between the CV of annual air temperature (or precipitation) and the CV of tea production. Regime shift occurred in the production of each heritage food based on multiscale entropy and Taylor's law.

Since the COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 constellation has an orbit altitude of about 800 km, the integral TEC measurements obtained from the topside GPS navigation data are rather small and imposed relevant challenges to obtaining stable electron density reconstructions. However, the developed method can represent the natural variability of the plasma ambient in terms of latitude, altitude, solar activity, season, and local time when analyzing electron density reconstructions during 2008-2013. The method employs independent spatial grids for satellite rising and setting geometries and imposes a set of constraints to stabilize the solution in the presence of noise and ill-conditioned geometry. We further consider background ionosphere and plasmasphere models for electron density initialization and filling data gaps. The quality assessment using TEC and in-situ electron density measurements has shown that the proposed method performs better than the background model, with improvements of about 26% in TEC and 20% in terms of electron density. Our investigation also reveals the necessity of more accurate background electron density representations and precise TEC measurements in order to have better plasmaspheric specifications at high altitudes.","[Prol, Fabricio S.; Hoque, Mohammed Mainul] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Solar Terr Phys, D-17235 Neustrelitz, Germany; [Prol, Fabricio S.] Finnish Geospatial Res Inst, Dept Nav & Positioning, Natl Land Survey Finland, Kyrkslatt 02431, Finland",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); The National Land Survey of Finland; Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI),"Prol, FS (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Solar Terr Phys, D-17235 Neustrelitz, Germany.",fabricioprol@hotmail.com; mainul.hoque@dlr.de,"Prol, Fabricio/F-8347-2012","Prol, Fabricio/0000-0002-7206-1705","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HO 6136/1-1]; Helmholtz Pilot Projects Information & Data Science II (Grant support from the Initiative and Networking Fund of the Hermann von Helmholtz-Association Deutscher Forschungszentren e.V.)

Our results showed that LST generally increased with urbanization intensity. This trend was extremely obvious in spring and summer, weak in winter, and slightly downward in autumn. Moreover, PLAND (e.g., percentage of impervious surface in a landscape) has the most significant effect on urban LST, and generally increases as the spatial scale becomes larger. In conclusion, the study recommends that urban planning in Zhengzhou should prioritize PLAND, especially at large spatial scales.

Water chemical data and environmental isotope analyses of delta D, delta O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86 were obtained from groundwater of 24 deep Upper Jurassic geothermal wells and coupled with a few analyses of noble gases (He-3/He-4, Ar-40/Ar-36) and noble gas infiltration temperatures. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three major water types and allowed a hydrochemical zoning of the SGMB, while exploratory factor analyses identified the hydrogeological processes affecting the water chemical composition of the thermal water. Water types 1 and 2 are of Na-[Ca]-HCO3-Cl type, lowly mineralised and have been recharged under meteoric cold climate conditions. Both water types show Sr-87/Sr-86 signatures, stable water isotopes values and calculated apparent mean residence times, which suggest minor water-rock interaction within a hydraulically active flow system of the Northeastern and Southeastern Central Molasse Basin. This thermal groundwater have been most likely subglacially recharged in the south of the SGMB in close proximity to the Bavarian Alps with a delineated northwards flow direction. Highly mineralised groundwater of water type 3 (Na-Cl-HCO3 and Na-Cl) occurs in the Eastern Central Molasse Basin. In contrast to water types 1 and 2, this water type shows substantial water-rock interaction with terrestrial sediments and increasing Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios, which may also imply a hydraulic exchange with fossil formation waters of overlying Tertiary sediments.","[Heine, Florian; Zosseder, Kai; Einsiedl, Florian] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Hydrogeol, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Heine, F; Einsiedl, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Hydrogeol, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",florian.heine@tum.de; kai.zosseder@tum.de; f.einsiedl@tum.de,,"Heine, Florian/0000-0001-5613-8947; Einsiedl, Florian/0000-0003-4225-8539; Zosseder, Kai/0000-0001-5317-3368","Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection (StMUV) [FKZ 104-0270-88806/2016, 104-0270-16955/2017, FKZ 104-0270-35385/2019]; Bavarian Ministry of Science and Art (StMWK); Technical University of Munich (TUM)",Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection (StMUV); Bavarian Ministry of Science and Art (StMWK); Technical University of Munich (TUM),"This work was performed in the framework of the project IsoMol (grant number FKZ 104-0270-88806/2016, 104-0270-16955/2017) and IsoChem (grant number FKZ 104-0270-35385/2019), which was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection (StMUV) and the project Geothermal-Alliance Bavaria (GAB), which was funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Science and Art (StMWK).

The prospects of conserving biodiversity in working landscapes help buffer the insularization effects of protected areas and hold great potential for biodiversity conservation on a landscape scale but depend on finding adequate space and a meaningful place in the lives of rural land users. Using a case study in southern Kenya, we show that the conservation of large open landscapes, biodiversity and the coexistence between wildlife and livestock can be achieved indirectly by reinforcing pastoral practices that depend on open space, mobility, social networks and institutional arrangements governing common-pool resources. Pastoral practices and wildlife both depend on large multiscale interactions within interlinked social and ecological systems, which are threatened by land fragmentation, alienation and degradation. We show that large open spaces can be maintained by using a conservation approach starting from within community aspirations that emphasize the links between livelihoods, productivity, efficiency and resilience in pastoral economies and the secondary benefits of wildlife enterprises. Scaling up from an ecosystem to multi-scale approach benefits pastoral communities by building resilience and new economic opportunities. In the process, the expanded scale conserves regional biodiversity and large free-ranging herbivore and carnivore populations underpinning ecosystem function and the nationally important tourism industry centered on the Kenya-Tanzania boundary. The 'inside-out' approach to the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity is place-based, draws on local knowledge and informal governance arrangements and avoids the stigma of wildlife conservation driven by outside agencies. The human-centered approach reinforces land health and spatial connectivity and encourages multi-level and distributed governance arrangements embedded in large regional and national jurisdictions. Translated Abstract Kikemikali Maeneo ya uhifadhi, ukuzingatia mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa, hayajafikia kiwango kinachohitajika kudumisha uendelevu wa bianuwai na utenda kazi wa ikolojia ulimwenguni. Kuhifadhi bianuwai kwenye ardhi inayotumika na watu yaweza kusaidia kuzuia maeneo ya uhifadhi kuwa visiwa, hivyo basi kuimarisha uwezo wa kuhifadhi bianuwai kwa maeneo makubwa ya mazingira. Lakini hili lategemea kupata nafasi ya kutosha, na umuhimu wake kutambulika katika maisha ya watumia ardhi vijijini. Kutumia uchunguzi wetu kwenye eneo la kusini mwa Kenya, twaonyesha ya kwamba uhifadhi wa maeneo makubwa ya mazingira yaliyowazi, uhifadhi ya bianuwai, na usawa wa utangamano baina ya wanyamapori na mifugo kwawezekana kupitia kuimaarisha tabia za ufugaji zinazotegemea maeneo yaliyowazi, uhamaji, mifumo ya kijamii, na mipangilio ya taasisi zinazoongoza rasilimali za watuwengi kwa pamoja. Mila na itikadi miongoni wa jamii za ufugaji, na wanyamapori, wote hutegemea mwingiliano ya kijamii na kiikolojia, ambayo inayotishiwa na ugavi wa ardhi, kutengwa na uharibifu. Tunaonyesha kwamba maeneo mengi ya ardhi yaliyo wazi yaweza kudumishwa kutumia njia ya uhifadhi mazingra ambayo inanzia ndani ya matamanio ya jamii, ambayo inasisitiza uhusiano kati ya riziki, tija, ufanisi, na ujasiri katika uchumi wa ufugaji, na pili, faida zinginezo zitokanazo na biashara zinazotegemea wanyamapori.

Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a versatile additive manufacturing (AM) technology that provides viable and cost-effective solutions for prototyping applications and low-volume manufacturing of high-performance functional parts, yet is defect-prone due to the inherent aspect of parametrization. A systematic yet parametric workflow for quality inspection is therefore required. The work presented describes a versatile and reliable framework for automatic defect detection during the FFF process, enabled by artificial intelligence-based computer vision. Specifically, state-of-the-art deep learning models are developed for in-line inspection of individual thermoplastic strands' surface morphology and weld quality, thus defining acceptable limits for FFF process parameter values. We examine the capabilities of an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a low-power, high-performance computer with an integrated graphical processing unit (GPU). The developed deep learning models used in this analysis use a pre-trained model combined with manual configurations in order to efficiently identify the thermoplastic strands' surface morphology. The proposed methodology aims to facilitate process parameter selection and the early identification of critical defects, toward an overall improvement in process reliability with reduced operator intervention.","[Bakas, Georgios; Bei, Kyriaki; Skaltsas, Ioannis; Koumoulos, Elias P.] IRES Innovat Res & Engn Solut, Rue Koningin Astritlaan 59B, B-1780 Wemmel, Belgium; [Gkartzou, Eleni; Tsiokou, Vaia; Papatheodorou, Alexandra; Karatza, Anna] BioG3D PC, 1 Lavriou Ave,Technol & Cultural Pk Lavrion, Lavrion 19500, Greece",,"Koumoulos, EP (corresponding author), IRES Innovat Res & Engn Solut, Rue Koningin Astritlaan 59B, B-1780 Wemmel, Belgium.",epk@innovation-res.eu,"; Koumoulos, Elias/K-8169-2013","Gkartzou, Eleni/0000-0002-6058-9369; Bakas, Georgios/0000-0003-0287-1937; Karatza, Anna/0000-0001-8385-8050; Koumoulos, Elias/0000-0002-7875-7324",H2020 project iclimabuilt-Functional and advanced insulating and energy harvesting/storage materials across climate adaptive building envelopes 560 [952886],H2020 project iclimabuilt-Functional and advanced insulating and energy harvesting/storage materials across climate adaptive building envelopes 560,The experimental activities presented in this paper were carried out as part of the H2020 project iclimabuilt-Functional and advanced insulating and energy harvesting/storage materials across climate adaptive building envelopes 560 (Grant Agreement no. 952886).,,18,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,OCT,2022,10,,,,,,2147,10.3390/pr10102147,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10102147,,,15,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,5Q0RC,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000873546800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study reveals that a major portion of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) within the cloud cells is contributed by the sub-cloud region. Cloud/rain scavenging reduces the CCN concentration within the saturated zone. Cloud dissipation followed by drizzle is explained based on increased local atmospheric stability. Delay in the production of fresh CCN and associated cloud formation is observed after the wet removal - a phenomenon called Recharging of the Atmosphere. A substantial effect of CCNs on the growth and dissipation of clouds and the subsequent changes in the local hydrological cycle are elucidated by some novel approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional forestry objectives aimed at sustainable yield are being replaced with those of sustainable ecosystem management. Such a shift in forest management requires an effective transfer of results from forest researchers to managers. In order to predict the potential impacts of changes in environment (such as climate, land-use, fire disturbance and forest harvesting) on the sustainability of forest ecosystems, forest resource managers will require forest simulation models. Forest simulation models have a long history in forestry and have proven to be useful tools for forest management. There have been two basic approaches to modeling forest growth and dynamics: empirical and mechanistic forest simulation models. This chapter reviews and compares four major types of forest simulation models: (1) growth and yield models (empirical approach), (2) succession models (empirical-mechanistic hybrid approach), (3) process models (mechanistic approach), and (4) hybrid models. Their applications are described in four case studies. The advantages and disadvantages of the different modeling approaches are discussed. Case studies deal with predicting future forest conditions under different management options, simulating the potential effects of climate change, and effects of fire disturbance on structure and function of forest ecosystems in Canada. There is still a gal) between foresters and ecologists in developing and using forest simulation models. There will not be a single, super model that will satisfy all of the diverse demands and purposes simultaneously. Diversified modeling approaches integrated into a decision-support system, an important tool for evaluating the sustainability of forest ecosystem in a changing environment, are emphasized.","[Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Wen, Xuezhi] Jishou Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Jishou 416000, Hunan, Peoples R China",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Jishou University,"Peng, CH (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",,"Peng, Changhui/G-8248-2012",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair Program,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chair Program(Canada Research Chairs),We thank the book editors and two anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions and comments on this manuscript.

In the year of the Tokyo Olympics and the heralding of the end of the post-war era for Japan, Shelter Plan, which involved the production of tailor-made bomb shelters, rejected the ideological function of the Tokyo Olympics, and the increasingly repressive political climate that accompanied it. I argue that Shelter Plan needs to be understood as a site-specific response to one of Frank Lloyd Wright's major works. As successor to a lineage of hotels designed to house Western visitors in Japan, and imagined by Wright as an opportunity to bring the Japanese 'off their knees' and into modernity, the Imperial Hotel was a highly charged site for addressing the politics of intercultural exchange between Japan and the West.","[Nettleton, Taro] Temple Univ, Art Hist & Asian Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Nettleton, T (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Art Hist & Asian Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1037-1397,1469-9338,,JPN STUD,Jpn.

The results indicated that there were no 3-year or multiyear cycles in its seed production. A positive correlation existed between the average seed production and the average annual air temperature in 5 or 10 years at both study sites. There was no trend of the increasing coefficient of variance (cv) in seed production, but the cv generally increased before 1975, and became flat after that time. Frequency power law existed in seed production at both sites, but Taylor's Law existed only at Zhaojiazhen. The multiscale entropy decreased with time scales, and the patterns were similar at both sites.

The influence of shrubs on air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity at the height of 1.5 meters are analysed, then the physiologically equivalent temperature is calculated. The analytical results reveal that, overall, shrub deteriorates the thermal comfort at pedestrian height in Singapore. In fact, shrubs do not have any significant impact on air temperature at the pedestrian level but do reduce wind speed, and slightly increase the relative humidity, which leads to an increase of PET during the daytime.

With all emissions except fires, O-3 decreases global GPP by 4.0 +/- 1.9 Pg C yr(-1) while aerosols increase GPP by 1.0 +/- 0.2 Pg C yr(-1) with contrasting spatial impacts. Inclusion of fire pollution causes a further GPP reduction of 0.86 +/- 0.74 Pg C yr(-1) during 2002-2011, resulting from a reduction of 0.91 +/- 0.44 Pg C yr(-1) by O-3 and an increase of 0.05 +/- 0.30 Pg C yr(-1) by aerosols. The net negative impact of fire pollution poses an increasing threat to ecosystem productivity in a warming future world.","[Yue, Xu; Unger, Nadine] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yue, Xu; Unger, Nadine] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; University of Exeter","Yue, X; Unger, N (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Yue, X; Unger, N (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England.",yuexu@mail.iap.ac.cn; N.Unger@exeter.ac.uk,"Unger, Nadine/AAI-4462-2021; Yue, Xu/ABD-9066-2021","Unger, Nadine/0000-0001-7739-2290; Yue, Xu/0000-0002-8861-8192",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070203]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603802]; University of Exeter,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program of China; University of Exeter,The authors would like to thank Dr. Danica Lombardozzi for providing the meta-analysis measurement data of O<INF>3</INF> vegetation damage.

In this work, the SM2RAIN-CCI (SM2RAIN-ASCAT) rainfall data obtained from the inversion of the microwave-based satellite soil moisture (SM) observations derived from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture data) were evaluated against in situ rainfall observations under different bioclimatic conditions in Brazil. The research V7 version of the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TRMM TMPA) was also used as a state-of-the-art rainfall product with an up-bottom approach. Comparisons were made at daily and 0.25 degrees scales, during the time-span of 2007-2015. The SM2RAIN-CCI, SM2RAIN-ASCAT, and TRMM TMPA products showed relatively good Pearson correlation values (R) with the gauge-based observations, mainly in the Caatinga (CAAT) and Cerrado (CER) biomes (R median > 0.55). SM2RAIN-ASCAT largely underestimated rainfall across the country, particularly over the CAAT and CER biomes (bias median < -16.05%), while SM2RAIN-CCI is characterized by providing rainfall estimates with only a slight bias (bias median: -0.20%), and TRMM TMPA tended to overestimate the amount of rainfall (bias median: 7.82%). All products exhibited the highest values of unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) in winter (DJF) when heavy rainfall events tend to occur more frequently, whereas the lowest values are observed in summer (JJA) with light rainfall events. The SM2RAIN-based products showed larger contribution of systematic error components than random error components, while the opposite was observed for TRMM TMPA. In general, both SM2RAIN-based rainfall products can be effectively used for some operational purposes on a daily scale, such as water resources management and agriculture, whether the bias is previously adjusted.","[Paredes-Trejo, Franklin] Univ Western Plains Ezequiel Zamora, Dept Civil Engn, San Carlos Campus 2201 CO, Barinas, Venezuela; [Paredes-Trejo, Franklin; dos Santos, Carlos A.

This was performed using two different approaches: a more traditional 2k full factorial design of experiments (DoE) and multiple polynomial regression using an algorithm implementing machine learning (ML) principles such as train-test split and cross-validation. Evaluated parameters included extrusion and printing bed temperatures, layer height and printing speed. It was concluded that when exposed to new observations, the ML-based model predicted the response with higher accuracy. However, the DoE fared slightly better at predicting observations where higher response values were expected, including the optimal solution, which reached an UTS of 117.1 +/- 5.7 MPa. Moreover, there was an important correlation between process parameters and the response. Layer height and printing bed temperatures were considered the most influential parameters, while extrusion temperature and printing speed had a lower influence on the outcome. The general influence of parameters on the response was correlated with the degree of interlayer cohesion, which in turn affected the mechanical performance of the 3D-printed specimens.","[Belei, Carlos; Joeressen, Jana; Amancio-Filho, Sergio T.] Graz Univ Technol TU Graz, Inst Mat Sci Joining & Forming, BMK Endowed Professorship Aviat, Kopernikusgasse 24-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Graz University of Technology,"Amancio, ST (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol TU Graz, Inst Mat Sci Joining & Forming, BMK Endowed Professorship Aviat, Kopernikusgasse 24-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",carlos.belei@tugraz.at; jana@joeressen.net; sergio.amancio@tugraz.at,"Amancio-Filho, Sergio T./AAE-3653-2022; Amancio-Filho, Sergio/AHE-1610-2022","Amancio-Filho, Sergio T./0000-0002-1886-1349; Belei, Carlos/0000-0001-8999-0052","Austrian aviation program TAKEOFF (PILOT) [852796]; BMK-The Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Graz University of Technology","Austrian aviation program TAKEOFF (PILOT); BMK-The Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Graz University of Technology","This research was funded by the Austrian aviation program TAKEOFF (PILOT, grant number 852796, 2018) and BMK-The Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology.

The Last Glacial Maximum has previously been identified as the peak of Late Quaternary aridity, when desert systems expanded to five times their present extent(1-3), and low-latitude aridity has been described for previous glaciations(4). But little evidence has been derived directly for large desert basins, particularly southern Africa. Here we report new chronological (optical dating) evidence of arid episodes recorded in aeolian sediments from the Mega Kalahari sand sea. Episodic aeolian activity is recorded at the northeastern desert margin, whereas more sustained activity is evident from the southwestern desert core. Several significant arid events are apparent since the last interglacial period, with dune-building (arid) phases at similar to 95-115, 41-46, 20-26 and 9-16kyr before present. Existing atmospheric general circulation model simulations and independent palaeoclimate data indicate that the changes in aridity are related to changes in the northeast-southwest summer rainfall gradient, which are in turn related to sea surface temperatures in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean.","UNIV OXFORD, ARCHAEOL & HIST ART RES LAB, OXFORD OX1 3TB, ENGLAND; UNIV SHEFFIELD, DEPT GEOG, SHEFFIELD CTR INT DRYLANDS RES, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",University of Oxford; University of Sheffield,"Stokes, S (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD, SCH GEOG, MANSFIELD RD, OXFORD OX1 3QJ, ENGLAND.",,"Klein, Richard G/B-5910-2009","Thomas, David/0000-0001-6867-5504; Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614",,,,,28,186,197,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jul,1997,6638,,,,154,158,,10.1038/40596,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/40596,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,XK109,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1997XK10900044,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus of this mission is on the hydrologic cycle in the atmosphere, with applications from weather forecasting to climate research. PATH will deploy a microwave sounder, a passive radiometer that measures upwelling thermal radiation, in geostationary orbit and will for the first time provide a time-continuous view of atmospheric temperature and all three phases of water under nearly all weather conditions. This is possible because microwave radiation is sensitive to but also penetrates both clouds and precipitation, as has been demonstrated with similar sensors on low-earth-orbiting satellites. Data from those sensors, despite observing a particular location only twice a day, have had more impact on weather prediction accuracy than any other type of satellite sensor, and it is expected that PATH will have a similar impact with its ability to continuously observe the entire life cycle of storm systems. Such sensors have also played an important role in climate research and have been used to estimate long-term temperature trends in the atmosphere. An important application of PATH data will be to improve the representation of cloud formation, convection, and precipitation in weather and climate models, particularly the diurnal variation in those processes. In addition to measuring the three-dimensional distribution of temperature, water vapor, cloud liquid water, and ice, PATH also measures sea surface temperature under full cloud cover. Such observations make a number of important applications possible. Depending on the application focus and the geostationary orbit location, PATH can serve as anything from a hurricane and severe-storm observatory to an El Nino observatory. A geostationary orbit offers many advantages, as has been demonstrated with visible and infrared imagers and sounders deployed on weather satellites, but those sensors cannot penetrate clouds. It has not been possible until now to build a microwave radiometer with a large enough antenna aperture to attain a reasonable spatial resolution from a GEO orbit. A new approach, using aperture synthesis, has recently been developed by NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and that is what makes PATH possible. Key technology enabling the large array of receivers in such a system has been developed, and a proof-of-concept demonstrator was completed in 2006. The state of the art in this area is now such that PATH mission development could start in 2010 and be ready for launch in 2015, but the actual schedule depends on the availability of funding. An option to fly PATH as a joint NASA-NOAA mission is being explored.","[Lambrigtsen, Bjorn; Brown, Shannon T.; Gaier, Todd C.; Herrell, Linda; Kangaslahti, Pekka P.; Tanner, Alan B.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Lambrigtsen, B (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",lambrigtsen@jpl.nasa.gov; shannon.brown@jpl.nasa.gov; todd.gaier@jpl.nasa.gov; linda.herrell@jpl.nasa.gov; pekka.kangaslahti@jpl.nasa.gov; alan.tanner@jpl.nasa.gov,,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

This system relies on NOAA's Coupled Forecast System (CFS) global climate model to provide initial and boundary conditions for dynamical downscaling with a high-resolution numerical ocean model. Experiments with J-SCOPE show that the bottom temperature on the shelf is more predictable than the sea surface temperature (SST) on seasonal time scales. While seasonal forecasts have been shown to have positive skill in terms of SST for the CCS due to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the mechanism(s) responsible for subsurface predictability in the N-CCS have yet to be determined. This study quantifies the relative importance of North Pacific and Tropical Pacific properties in determining the variations in temperatures at depth (TDs) on the N-CCS shelf. A multivariable linear regression (MLR) model with selected predictors explains almost 83% of the N-CCS TD variability with oceanic teleconnections from the North Pacific dominating the variance. The N-CCS TD is related to (i) coastally trapped waves (CTWs) related to ENSO, originating in Tropical Pacific, (ii) west-central Pacific spice anomalies, (iii) seasonal Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) variation, and a more local influence from (iv) anomalies south of N-CCS, originating in North Pacific. ENSO and CTW can each impact the depth of the California Undercurrent (CUC) core with the latter most prominently following ENSO events. The results on potential sources of predictability are relevant to the continued development of current seasonal forecasting efforts off the U.S. West coast. Plain Language Summary The Washington/Oregon shelf is a productive habitat with important commercial fisheries. One of the most valuable species is Dungeness crab, which resides on the subsurface shelf and is sensitive to near-bottom ocean properties such as temperatures and oxygen concentrations. The predictability of these properties on seasonal time scales is being investigated using JISAO's Seasonal Coastal Ocean Prediction of the Ecosystem (J-SCOPE). Previous studies have explored the driving mechanisms of surface temperature predictability, with a focus on linkages to ENSO; this study investigates their counterparts for subsurface temperatures. We find that remote forcings primarily from the North Pacific have strong influences on the subsurface temperatures. A relatively simple statistical model explains 83% of the subsurface temperature variability. The results on potential sources of predictability are relevant to the continued development of current seasonal forecasting efforts off the U.S. West Coast.","[Ray, S.; Siedlecki, S.

On the one hand, an important number of small-scale studies have been published that constitute direct measurement methodologies. On the other hand, the FAO Food Balance Sheets, which aggregate some of the prior studies, provides an indirect metric that has been applied using FLW coefficients in numerous food-related studies. However, to date, no standard methodology has been agreed upon to quantify FLW. This study performs an assessment of 237 studies in the field, aiming to identify existing FLW quantification methodologies, and if there is a need of developing alternative paths. Firstly, a descriptive review was performed. Secondly, an assessment of critical point of views was presented. For this, different critical voices in the scientific literature were retrieved, some of which highlight the high level of uncertainty and a certain degree of opacity in some of the most widespread FLW quantification and assessment reports. In this line, essential elements of quantification are being omitted. Moreover, the focus is being excessively placed on the role of the consumer, compared to the role played by agribusiness and large distribution chains.","[Hoehn, Daniel; Margallo, Maria; Laso, Jara; Fernandez-Rios, Ana; Ruiz-Salmon, Israel; Aldaco, Ruben] Univ Cantabria, DEPROs Grp, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Santander, Cantabria, Spain; [Vazquez-Rowe, Ian; Kahhat, Ramzy] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Engn, Peruvian LCA & Ind Ecol Network PELCAN, Ave Univ 1801, San Miguel 15088, Peru",Universidad de Cantabria; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Aldaco, R (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, DEPROs Grp, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Santander, Cantabria, Spain.",aldacor@unican.es,,"Hoehn, Daniel/0000-0002-9842-7728",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the KAIROS-BIOCIR project [PID2019-104925RB]; Direccion de Fomento de la Investigacion at PUCP [PI0769],"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the KAIROS-BIOCIR project(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); Direccion de Fomento de la Investigacion at PUCP","The authors are grateful for the funding of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the KAIROS-BIOCIR project (PID2019-104925RB) (AEO/FEDER, UE).

For example, a recently developed semi-empirical SWE retrieval algorithm accounts for systematic and random error caused by forest cover and snow morphology (crystal size - a function of location and time of year). However, we have found that climate and land surface complexities lead to significant systematic and random error uncertainties in remotely sensed SWE retrievals that are not included in current SWE estimation algorithms. Joint analysis of independent meteorological records, ground SWE measurements, remotely sensed SWE estimates, and land surface characteristics have provided a unique look at the error structure of these recently developed satellite SWE products. We considered satellite-derived SWE errors associated with the snow pack mass itself, the distance to significant open water bodies, liquid water in the snow pack and/or morphology change due to melt and refreeze, forest cover, snow class, and topographic factors such as large scale root mean square roughness and dominant aspect. Analysis of the nine-year Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) SWE data set was undertaken for Canada where many in-situ measurements are available. It was found that for SMMR pixels with 5 or more ground stations available, the remote sensing product was generally unbiased with a seasonal maximum 20 mm average root mean square error for SWE values less than 100 mm. For snow packs above 100 mm, the SWE estimate bias was linearly related to the snow pack mass and the root mean square error increased to around 150 mm. Both the distance to open water and average monthly mean air temperature were found to significantly influence the retrieved SWE product uncertainty. Apart from maritime snow class, which had the greatest snow class affect on root mean square error and bias, all other factors showed little relation to observed uncertainties. Eliminating the drop-in-the-bucket averaged gridded remote sensing SWE data within 200 km of open water bodies, for monthly mean temperatures greater than -2 degrees C, and for snow packs greater than 100 mm, has resulted in a remotely sensed SWE product that is useful for practical applications.

In the tropics, rising sea surface temperatures are restructuring coral reef communities with sensitive species being lost. At the biogeographical divide between temperate and tropical communities, warming is causing macroalgal forest loss and the spread of tropical corals, fishes and other species, termed tropicalization. A lack of field research into the combined effects of warming and ocean acidification means there is a gap in our ability to understand and plan for changes in coastal ecosystems. Here, we focus on the tropicalization trajectory of temperate marine ecosystems becoming coral-dominated systems. We conducted field surveys and in situ transplants at natural analogues for present and future conditions under (i) ocean warming and (ii) both ocean warming and acidification at a transition zone between kelp and coral-dominated ecosystems. We show that increased herbivory by warm-water fishes exacerbates kelp forest loss and that ocean acidification negates any benefits of warming for range extending tropical corals growth and physiology at temperate latitudes. Our data show that, as the combined effects of ocean acidification and warming ratchet up, marine coastal ecosystems lose kelp forests but do not gain scleractinian corals. Ocean acidification plus warming leads to overall habitat loss and a shift to simple turf-dominated ecosystems, rather than the complex coral-dominated tropicalized systems often seen with warming alone. Simplification of marine habitats by increased CO2 levels cascades through the ecosystem and could have severe consequences for the provision of goods and services.","[Agostini, Sylvain; Harvey, Ben P.; Wada, Shigeki; Kon, Koetsu; Hall-Spencer, Jason M.] Univ Tsukuba, Shimoda Marine Res Ctr, 5-10-1 Shimoda, Shizuoka 4150025, Japan; [Milazzo, Marco] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Mare, Palermo, Italy; [Milazzo, Marco] Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Mare CoNISMa, Rome, Italy; [Floc'h, Nicolas] Ecole Europeenne Super Art Bretagne, Rennes, France; [Komatsu, Kosei; Kuroyama, Mayumi] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Hall-Spencer, Jason M.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Tsukuba; University of Palermo; CoNISMa; University of Tokyo; University of Plymouth,"Agostini, S; Hall-Spencer, JM (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Shimoda Marine Res Ctr, 5-10-1 Shimoda, Shizuoka 4150025, Japan.",agostini.sylvain@shimoda.tsukuba.ac.jp; jhall-spencer@plymouth.ac.uk,"Milazzo, Marco/AAY-9990-2021; Harvey, Ben P/P-1061-2019; Hall-Spencer, Jason/AFN-7866-2022","Harvey, Ben P/0000-0002-4971-1634; Hall-Spencer, Jason/0000-0002-6915-2518; Agostini, Sylvain/0000-0001-9040-9296; Wada, Shigeki/0000-0001-6893-7498; Komatsu, Kosei/0000-0002-4731-7035; Kon, Koetsu/0000-0003-1379-0702; Kuroyama, Mayumi/0000-0001-7060-7623","Daiwa Foundation [10777/11517]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Short Term Invitation Fellowship [S16073]; JSPS KAKENHI [17K17621]; Ministry of Environment, Government of Japan [Suishinhi: 4RF-1701]","Daiwa Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Short Term Invitation Fellowship(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ministry of Environment, Government of Japan(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","Travel costs were funded by the Daiwa Foundation (Grant Number: 10777/11517) for J.

The Welsh Government is one of only a few governments in the world to have a legal duty to sustainable development, which includes the pioneering Well-being of Future Generations Act (2015). The legislation has received international attention and praise from the United Nations but, as yet, the Welsh Government's imaginaries of socioecological transformation have received little scrutiny regarding the kinds of ideas about the future and possibilities for change they set in motion. The article considers imaginaries as providing the very grounds of possibility for transformation, being comprised of stories and narratives about what kinds of futures are possible and desirable, intermingled with emotional-affective atmospheres that can promote or hinder people's engagement with environmental issues. The article focuses on three aspects of the Welsh Government's imaginaries related to socioecological transformation, namely; resilience and anticipatory discourse, linear time, and conspiracies of optimism. A number of tensions are drawn out that highlight how the Welsh Government's seemingly progressive rhetoric risks being undermined by the conceptions of time and change it employs. Thus, the article contributes to wider critical analyses of how new politics and modes of governance of and for the (proposed) Anthropocene are taking shape.","[Pigott, Anna] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Pigott, A (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",a.l.pigott@swansea.ac.uk,,"Pigott, Anna/0000-0002-0573-8181",Economic and Social Research Council; Swansea University (UK),Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Swansea University (UK),This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and Swansea University (UK).,,122,3,3,4,9,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2325-1026,,,ELEMENTA-SCI ANTHROP,Elementa-Sci.

Hence, the authors take a rough functional form, whereby the wave flux source spectrum has an amplitude proportional to the square root of total precipitation, to represent gravity wave source strengths in the Met Office global model's spectral nonorographic scheme. Key advantages of the new source are simplicity and responsiveness to changes in convection processes without dependence upon model-specific details of their representation. Thus, the new source scheme is potentially a straightforward adaptation for a class of spectral gravity wave schemes widely used for current state-of-the-art earth system models. Against an invariant source, the new parameterized source generates launch-level flux amplitudes with greater spatial and temporal variability, producing probability density functions for absolute momentum flux over the ocean that have extended tails of large-amplitude, low-occurrence events. Such distributions appear more realistic in comparison with reported balloon observations. Source intermittency at the launch level affects mean fluxes at higher levels in two ways: directly, as a result of upward propagation of the new source variation, and indirectly, through changes in filtering characteristics that arise from intermittency. Initial assessment of the new scheme in the Met Office global model indicates an improved representation of the quasi-biennial oscillation and sensitivity that offers potential for further impact in the future.","[Bushell, Andrew C.; Derbyshire, Stephen H.; Jackson, David R.; Shutts, Glenn J.; Vosper, Simon B.; Webster, Stuart] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Butchart, Neal] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Bushell, AC (corresponding author), Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",andrew.bushell@metoffice.gov.uk,"Shutts, Glenn/AAT-1833-2021","Jackson, David/0000-0001-6387-6876",European Commission's 7th Framework Programme [282672]; EMBRACE project; Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA1101]; Natural Environment Research Council,European Commission's 7th Framework Programme(European Commission); EMBRACE project; Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme, under Grant Agreement 282672; the EMBRACE project; and the Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme (GA1101).

Model simulations and satellite observations indicate a dipole pattern in aerosol emissions and loading between South Asia and East Asia, two of the most heavily polluted regions of the world. We examine the previously unexplored diverging trends in the existing dipole pattern of aerosols between East and South Asia using the high quality, two-decade long ground-based time series of observations of aerosol properties from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), from satellites (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)), and from model simulations (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The data cover the period since 2001 for Kanpur (South Asia) and Beijing (East Asia), two locations taken as being broadly representative of the respective regions. Since 2010 a dipole in aerosol optical depth (AOD) is maintained, but the trend is reversed-the decrease in AOD over Beijing (East Asia) is rapid since 2010, being 17% less in current decade compared to first decade of twenty-first century, while the AOD over South Asia increased by 12% during the same period. Furthermore, we find that the aerosol composition is also changing over time. The single scattering albedo (SSA), a measure of aerosol's absorption capacity and related to aerosol composition, is slightly higher over Beijing than Kanpur, and has increased from 0.91 in 2002 to 0.93 in 2017 over Beijing and from 0.89 to 0.92 during the same period over Kanpur, confirming that aerosols in this region have on an average become more scattering in nature. These changes have led to a notable decrease in aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rate (HR) over both regions between the two decades, decreasing considerably more over East Asia (- 31%) than over South Asia (- 9%). The annual mean HR is lower now, it is still large (>= 0.6 K per day), which has significant climate implications. The seasonal trends in AOD, SSA and HR are more pronounced than their respective annual trends over both regions. The seasonal trends are caused mainly by the increase/decrease in anthropogenic aerosol emissions (sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon) while the natural aerosols (dust and sea salt) did not change significantly over South and East Asia during the last two decades. The MERRA-2 model is able to simulate the observed trends in AODs well but not the magnitude, while it also did not simulate the SSA values or trends well. These robust findings based on observations of key aerosol parameters and previously unrecognized diverging trends over South and East Asia need to be accounted for in current state-of-the-art climate models to ensure accurate quantification of the complex and evolving impact of aerosols on the regional climate over Asia.","[Ramachandran, S.] Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Ramachandran, S.; Rupakheti, Maheswar; Lawrence, Mark G.] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Lawrence, Mark G.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany","Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India; University of Potsdam","Ramachandran, S (corresponding author), Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.;Ramachandran, S (corresponding author), Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany.",ram@prl.res.in,"Rupakheti, Maheswar/A-3251-2016","Rupakheti, Maheswar/0000-0002-9618-8735; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0002-2178-4903; Ramachandran, S./0000-0003-4921-7887","Projekt DEAL; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF); Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK)","Projekt DEAL; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK)","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Offline numerical schemes in which only the biogeochemical tracers are time stepped and transported using a precomputed circulation field can substantially reduce the burden and are thus an attractive alternative. One such scheme is the transport matrix method (TMM), which represents tracer transport as a sequence of sparse matrix-vector products that can be performed efficiently on distributed-memory computers. While the TMM has been used for a variety of geochemical and biogeochemical studies, to date the resulting solutions have not been comprehensively assessed against their online counterparts. Here, we present a detailed comparison of the two. It is based on simulations of the state-of-the-art biogeochemical sub-model embedded within the widely used coarse-resolution University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM). The default, non-linear advection scheme was first replaced with a linear, third-order upwind-biased advection scheme to satisfy the linearity requirement of the TMM. Transport matrices were extracted from an equilibrium run of the physical model and subsequently used to integrate the biogeochemical model offline to equilibrium. The identical biogeochemical model was also run online. Our simulations show that offline integration introduces some bias to biogeochemical quantities through the omission of the polar filtering used in UVic ESCM and in the offline application of time-dependent forcing fields, with high latitudes showing the largest differences with respect to the online model. Differences in other regions and in the seasonality of nutrients and phytoplankton distributions are found to be relatively minor, giving confidence that the TMM is a reliable tool for offline integration of complex biogeochemical models. Moreover, while UVic ESCM is a serial code, the TMM can be run on a parallel machine with no change to the underlying biogeochemical code, thus providing orders of magnitude speed-up over the online model.","[Kvale, Karin F.; Dietze, Heiner; Kriest, Iris; Oschlies, Andreas] GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Khatiwala, Samar] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3AN, England",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Oxford,"Kvale, KF (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",kkvale@geomar.de,"Kvale, Karin F/T-1231-2018; Dietze, Heiner/A-7466-2009; Oschlies, Andreas/F-9749-2012; Kriest, Iris/B-2741-2014; Kvale, Karin F/A-7597-2013","Kvale, Karin F/0000-0001-8043-5431; Dietze, Heiner/0000-0002-0931-8707; Oschlies, Andreas/0000-0002-8295-4013; Kriest, Iris/0000-0001-7982-6232; Kvale, Karin F/0000-0001-8043-5431; Khatiwala, Samar/0000-0001-9048-3234",DFG [SFB754]; US NSF grant [OCE 12-34971]; UK NERC grant [NE/K015613/1]; National Science Foundation,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); US NSF grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UK NERC grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is a contribution to DFG-supported project SFB754 and to the research platforms of DFG cluster of excellence The Future Ocean.

Identifying and merging these fragments can enhance their value for studies on the three-dimensional spatial structure of climate change. The Comprehensive Historical Upper-Air Network (CHUAN version 1.7), which was substantially extended in 2013, and the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) are the most important collections of upper-air measurements taken before 1958. CHUAN (tracked) balloon data start in 1900, with higher numbers from the late 1920s onward, whereas IGRA data start in 1937. However, a substantial fraction of those measurements have not been taken at synoptic times (preferably 00: 00 or 12: 00 GMT) and on altitude levels instead of standard pressure levels. To make them comparable with more recent data, the records have been brought to synoptic times and standard pressure levels using state-of-the-art interpolation techniques, employing geopotential information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 20th Century Reanalysis (NOAA 20CR). From 1958 onward the European Re-Analysis archives (ERA-40 and ERA-Interim) available at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are the main data sources. These are easier to use, but pilot data still have to be interpolated to standard pressure levels. Fractions of the same records distributed over different archives have been merged, if necessary, taking care that the data remain traceable back to their original sources. If possible, station IDs assigned by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have been allocated to the station records. For some records which have never been identified by a WMO ID, a local ID above 100 000 has been assigned. The merged data set contains 37 wind records longer than 70 years and 139 temperature records longer than 60 years. It can be seen as a useful basis for further data processing steps, most notably homogenization and gridding, after which it should be a valuable resource for climatological studies. Homogeneity adjustments for wind using the NOAA-20CR as a reference are described in Ramella Pralungo and Haimberger (2014). Reliable homogeneity adjustments for temperature beyond 1958 using a surface-dataonly reanalysis such as NOAA-20CR as a reference have yet to be created.

The Response Factors (RF) method sets the base for related dynamic calculations implemented by most well-known Building Energy Simulation (BES) software, and it represents a research topic of present interest. In this regard, this work introduces a new method for calculating conduction Response Factors in building multilayer constructions, based on the definition of an approximated wall model through Frequency-Domain Spline Interpolation (FDSI) and asymptotic analysis. Its conceptual development as well as first validations comparing with existing methods from previous literature are presented.

A conundrum for climate studies is the discrepancy between surface fluxes that minimize model-data differences for an atmosphere-only model vs surface fluxes that minimize model-data differences for an ocean model. As a first step towards a consistent coupled ocean-atmosphere data-assimilation (DA) system, we compare surface net heat flux from a state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis, the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), to net heat flux from a state-of-the-art ocean state estimate, the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Version 4 (ECCO-v4). The possible impacts of the MERRA-2 and ECCO-v4 air-sea net heat flux difference in a coupled DA system were assessed using a set of experiments designed to imitate different flavors of a coupled DA system in an ocean-only setup. This was done by forcing the ECCO-v4 underlying ocean model - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) - with different sets of MERRA-2 fields and utilizing different forcing methods. By doing so we were able to turn off different air-sea feedbacks which, in a coupled DA setup, are partially muted by the constraining observations. The set of experiments, therefore, represents a range of active feedbacks in different flavors of coupled data-assimilation systems. For the period 1992-2011, MERRA-2 net heat flux has a global mean difference of - 4.9 Wm(-2) relative to ECCO-v4. When MERRA-2 surface fields are used to force MITgcm, imbalances in the energy and the hydrological cycles of MERRA-2, which are directly related to the fact that MERRA-2 was created without an interactive ocean, propagate to the ocean. The experiment in which MITgcm is forced with MERRA-2 fluxes (MERRA-2-flux experiment) results in a 2.5 degrees C global mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cooling, a 1m reduction in global mean sea level, and other drastic changes in the large scale ocean circulation relative to those resulting when the MITgcm is forced with the optimized ECCO-v4 net heat flux (the ECCO-v4 experiment itself). When MITgcm is forced with MERRA-2 state variables (MERRA-2-state experiment), the SST is somewhat restored to the observed SST, but the errors are shifted to the water cycle, resulting in a global mean sea level increase of 2.7 m. To further explore the pros and cons of these two approaches, we introduce a new intermediate forcing method in which the ocean is forced with turbulent fluxes but has a long wave feedback. This method, unlike MERRA-2 state, preserves the MERRA-2 water and salinity cycles, and it reduces the SST error compared to the MERRA-2-flux experiment, but the SST is not as good as that in the MERRA-2-state experiment. Our results have implications for ocean-model forcing recipes and clearly reveal the undesirable consequences of limiting the feedbacks in either these types of experiments or in coupled DA.","[Strobach, Ehud] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Strobach, Ehud; Molod, Andrea] Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Forget, Gael; Campin, Jean-Michel; Hill, Chris] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Menemenlis, Dimitris] Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Heimbach, Patrick] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Strobach, E (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Strobach, E (corresponding author), Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",udistr@gmail.com,"Menemenlis, Dimitris/G-8091-2017; Heimbach, Patrick/K-3530-2013","Heimbach, Patrick/0000-0003-3925-6161; Strobach, Ehud/0000-0003-1465-6855","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP); Simons Fundation [549931]; NASA [6937342]","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP); Simons Fundation; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","The research leading to these results has received funding from the NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP).

The proposed mechanism consists of the formation of an anomalously strong Equator-to-pole temperature gradient in the stratosphere due to the presence of volcanic aerosols in the tropics, which are accompanied by an acceleration of the stratospheric polar vortex, which then shifts the Northern Annular Mode into a positive phase, resulting in warming surface temperatures over Eurasia. However, a large body of research in the past decade has shown that, for eruptions such as Pinatubo or Krakatau, no such warming is seen in simulations with more recent climate models which, in general, have much finer vertical and horizontal resolution than the early ones, and which have separated the forced response from the internal variability by using large ensembles of integrations. Since the proposed physical mechanism is sound, it is then possible that eruptions comparable to those of Pinatubo or Krakatau are simply too weak, but even larger ones might indeed be capable of causing Eurasian surface warming in winter. In this study, we explore this possibility using a state-of-the-art, stratosphere-resolving climate model, forced with prescribed aerosols from the Easy Volcanic Aerosol protocol. We consider eruptions with stratospheric sulfur injections of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 Tg(S). With 20-member ensembles, we find that with injections of 20 Tg(S) or more - roughly twice the amplitude of the Pinatubo and Krakatau eruptions - our model simulates a winter surface warming over Eurasia, which is statistically significant with a t test given our 20-member ensembles. However, the forced volcanic signal on Eurasian winter surface temperatures is very small, barely exceeding the 1 sigma range of internal variability for the 160 Tg(S) injection case, and much smaller for smaller eruptions.

In this context, the utilization of building integrated solar technology has proven to be a reliable and increasingly affordable alternative, however, there is still an immense potential remained unexplored. This study thus uses, a high -resolution, geospatial energy supply model to estimate the useable building rooftop areas across 11 regions of the World, and calculates the corresponding global and regional potential of energy production of state-of-the-art rooftop PV/T collectors over a 39-year period. Our results demonstrate that solar PV/T energy production on residential and commercial/public rooftops has enormous global potential (47.5 PWh), with the possibility of doubling by 2060. The current magnitude of potential implies that about 60% of the suitable building rooftops could be installed with PV/T collectors to offset most of the local energy demand. Regarding the future trends we found that beyond the extended building stock in large economies (e.g., China, USA and EU), the newly-built commercial buildings of developing regions (e.g., Latin America and South Asia) are modeled to have key role in realizing the estimated potential over the next decades. Our study also focuses on the geographical, temporal and building-level characteristics of energy production and concludes that rooftops in the Middle East, South and Pacific Asia have the most favorable geographical exposure for capturing solar (dominantly thermal) energy by PV/T collectors. It was found to be especially valid for months during the warm season. In regions dominated by temperate climate, the energy generation is characterized by a second maximum before the warm season, due to the peak of electricity production. At the time of the production peaks and in general annually, irrespective to regions, PV/T collectors installed on single-family roofs and retails were estimated to have the greatest potential to supply green energy for the entire building and thus likely to balance the in-situ energy consumption.","[Molnar, Gergely; Urge-Vorsatz, Diana; Chatterjee, Souran] Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Nador utca 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Molnar, Gergely] Univ Szeged, Dept Climatol & Landscape Ecol, Egyet utca 2, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary",Central European University; Szeged University,"Molnar, G (corresponding author), Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Nador utca 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",MolnarG@ceu.edu,"Urge-Vorsatz, Diana/J-6713-2016","Urge-Vorsatz, Diana/0000-0003-2570-5341","EC; nergy Demand changes Induced by Technological and Social innovations (EDITS) [837089]; Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), Japan","EC(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); nergy Demand changes Induced by Technological and Social innovations (EDITS); Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), Japan","This paper is based on research conducted within the EC funded Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (EU H2020) Project titled Sustainable Energy Transitions Laboratory (SENTINEL)- Grant Agreement No. 837089.

There is presently a lack of reliable measurements on the trace elemental content of marine particles, in part due to the inadequacies of the sampling and analytical methods employed. Here we report on the development of a series of state-of-the-art trace metal clean methods to collect and process oceanic particulate material in open-ocean and sea ice environments, including sampling, size-fractionated filtration, particle digestions and analysis by magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Particular attention was paid to the analysis of certified reference materials (CRMs) and field blanks, which are typically the limiting factor for the accurate analysis of low concentrations of trace metals in marine particulate samples. Theoretical detection limits (3 s of the blank) were low for all 17 elements considered, and varied according to filter material and porosity (sub-mu g L-1 for polycarbonate filters and 1-2 mu g L-1 for quartz and polyester filters). Analytical accuracy was verified using fresh water CRMs, with excellent recoveries noted (93-103%). Digestion efficiencies for various acid combinations were assessed using sediment and plankton CRMs. Using nitric acid only, good recoveries (79-90%) were achieved for Mo, Cd, Ba, Pb, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Ga. The addition of HF was necessary for the quantitative recovery of the more refractory trace elements such as U, Al, V and Cr. Bioactive elements such as P can also be analysed and used as a biomass normaliser. Our developed sampling and analytical methods proved reliable when applied during two major field programs in both the open Southern Ocean and Antarctic sea ice environments during the International Polar Year in 2007. Trace elemental data are presented for particulate samples collected in both suspended and sinking marine material, and also within sea ice cores. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Previous investigations estimated the maximum carrying capacity as large as about 1 trillion people under the assumption that photosynthesis is the limiting process. Here we use a present state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation model with managed planetary land surface, Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL), to calculate the yields of the most productive crops on a global 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid. Using the 2005 crop distribution the model predicts total harvested calories that are sufficient for the nutrition of 11.4 billion people. We define scenarios where humankind uses the whole land area for agriculture, saves the rain forests and the boreal evergreen forests or cultivates only pasture to feed animals. Every scenario is run in an extreme version with no allowance for urban and recreational needs and in two soft versions with a certain area per person for non-agricultural use. We find that there are natural limits of the maximum carrying capacity which are independent of any increase in agricultural productivity, if non-agricultural land use is accounted for. Using all land planet Earth can sustain 282 billion people. The save-forests-scenario yields 150 billion people. The scenario that cultivates only pasture to feed animals yields 96 billion people. Nevertheless, we should always have in mind that all our calculated numbers for the carrying capacity refer to extreme scenarios where humankind may only vegetate on this planet. Our numbers are considerably higher than the general median estimate of upper bounds of human population found in the literature in the order of 10 billion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Innovative methods, tools, and technologies for improved understanding and quantification of ET and crop water use are critical for adapting more effective management strategies to cope with increasing demand for freshwater resources under global climate change. This article introduces an ASABE Special Collection of 12 articles on ET monitoring and modeling research for multiple land uses and scales. The collection focuses on recent advances in four critical topical areas: (1) reference ET (REF-ET) method development and applications, including crop management and irrigation scheduling, limitations due to sensor inaccuracies and variability, and sensitivity to climatic drivers (three articles); (2) ET process and pathway characterization, including canopy interception, transpiration, and soil evaporation measured using various state-of-the-art techniques on crop lands and plantation forests, and effects of soil moisture on grassland water balance (three articles); (3) ET simulation within hydrological models (SWAT, MIKE SHE, RZWQM, RZ-SHAW, RegCM-BATS, DRAINMOD-FOREST, and Thornthwaite water balance) as well as related processes, such as crop growth and ET/PET ratios, for grass, crop, and forest lands (four articles); and (4) geospatial technology applications, such as using remote sensing to estimate ET and its components (soil evaporation and transpiration) for various land uses (two articles). Study sites represent a range of spatial scales and ecohydrological settings, including grasslands in Inner Mongolia dry lands in northern China, semiarid high plains in Texas, corn production regions from Iowa to Colorado, forest plantations on the humid Atlantic Coastal Plain, developed coastal areas on the island of Taiwan, and the continental U.S. Results from these studies will help guide current development and assessment of REF-ET, ET, and monitoring and modeling of their components in multiple scales and ecosystems. The studies also establish a platform for addressing potential inaccuracies in data from weather sensors and algorithms used in remote sensing products for estimating ET and its parameters, including uncertainties in REF-ET estimates, for tall forest vegetation in particular. Furthermore, the studies offer insights into the interactions between climatic variability and change and vegetation through the ET process.","[Amatya, D.

Knowledge and innovation are premises of social development and provide critical resources to local economies. Therefore countries with sizeable resources in human capital are likely to provide higher standards of living (Romer, 1989). Our argument draws on Richard Florida's theory and intends to test the hypothesis according to which the city, in order to maintain its knowledge intensity, must develop a beneficial and attractive urban climate likely to retain creative workers - it must promote creativity and support innovation. Design/methodology/approach - Our research is exploratory and proposes results from a first test of relevant attraction factors applicable to Montreal. We applied a qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews. The investigation examines artistic careers and the features offered by Montreal to visual artists. The survey was conducted largely in the Plateau and Mile End districts. The interview guide has four sections that focus on the career path of highly qualified and/or creative workers, on the city's strengths and weaknesses, on creativity-enabling aspects and on the city's features that contribute to retention. Also examined is the influence of self-managed artists centres on the network of stakeholders on the territory Originality/value - Richard Florida's theory (2005-2002) has attracted the attention of many cities, but has not been tested much. It is interesting to test as Richard Florida's theory considers that the city, in order to maintain its knowledge intensity, must develop an attractive urban climate likely to retain creative workers - it must promote creativity and support innovation - and it must offer not only good quality of life but scores of career opportunities, especially in the arts sector which can be seen as a source of innovation. The idea is also that the creative workers and amenities would then attract knowledge workers. Practical implications - The test of this hypothesis can have important implications in terms of city management, city infrastructure development as well as factors of attraction to develop in order to attract knowledge workers and creative workers.","[Tremblay, Diane-Gabrielle] Univ Quebec Teluq, Dept Adm Sci, Montreal, PQ H2S 3L5, Canada; [Pilati, Thomas] Univ Quebec Teluq, Montreal, PQ H2S 3L5, Canada",University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ; University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ,"Tremblay, DG (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Teluq, Dept Adm Sci, 5800 St Denis St, Montreal, PQ H2S 3L5, Canada.",,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-04-8,,,,2014,,,,,847,864,,,,,,18,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000357262301004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The novelty of the study lies specifically in the unprecedented use of constrained sensing devices as trustworthy data sources for a permissionless blockchain. Furthermore, we show how our research results, advancing the State-of-the-Art in the IoT and blockchain interactions, can support the interests of a diverse set of water management stakeholders in a concrete use-case implementation. To assess our contribution and validate our results we use a system architecture comprising constrained IoT devices for measuring water consumption used as direct data-source actors, a public blockchain infrastructure, and smart contracts that represent the interests of different water management stakeholders and regulate the distribution of incentives amongst virtuous farmers. Further validation on the usability of our results is obtained through the real implementation of a complete use case featuring the Ethereum network as a public blockchain and where six different types of IoT platforms are individually assessed for impact on the IoT devices, in terms of energy, processing time, and available memory. The findings show how solutions based on the proposed architecture can be implemented with only 6% of additional energy budget compared to the normal operations of the IoT devices. Besides showing new means to energy-efficiently integrate IoT data sources in a permissionless blockchain, the validation results make our contribution a strong candidate for use in automated and incentive-based irrigation water management systems as well as a key component in fostering increased sustainability of the whole agricultural sector.","[Pincheira, Miguel; Vecchio, Massimo; Giaffreda, Raffaele] Fdn Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy; [Pincheira, Miguel] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; [Kanhere, Salil S.] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Fondazione Bruno Kessler; University of Trento; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Pincheira, M (corresponding author), Fdn Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.",mpincheiracaro@fbk.eu,"kanhere, salil/ABA-2025-2021; Vecchio, Massimo/B-2539-2013; Pincheira, Miguel/AAJ-5651-2021","Vecchio, Massimo/0000-0003-4426-8220; Pincheira, Miguel/0000-0002-5847-2145; Kanhere, Salil/0000-0002-1835-3475",SAPIENCE project within the EIT Climate KIC programme of the European Institute of Technology [200081],SAPIENCE project within the EIT Climate KIC programme of the European Institute of Technology,This work was supported by the SAPIENCE project within the EIT Climate KIC programme (Project ID No 200081) of the European Institute of Technology.,,28,32,32,11,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

These issues will force major changes to physical and managerial aspects as well as the design of water delivery and on-farm irrigation systems. Thus, a water- and energy-limited future will be the likely catalyst that finally brings many of the existing precision agricultural technologies together for irrigated agriculture. Resource conservation as well as achieving environmental benefits will probably require the adoption of non-uniform water applications, also known as site-specific irrigation, for many growers. The goal of site-specific irrigation is to conserve water by directing the amount and frequency of water applications according to established spatial and temporal crop water requirements. However, more than 20 years of private and public research on site-specific irrigation has resulted in very limited commercial adoption of the technology. The current state of the art of site-specific center-pivot and linear-move sprinkler irrigation is reviewed Several general barriers to adoption of the technology and various knowledge gaps are identified. The primary reason for the very low rate of commercial adoption appears to be the absence of a market for the technology and a low rate of return. Documented and proven water conservation strategies using site-specific sprinkler irrigation for crop production are quite limited, and its cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Simulation studies comparing conventional and site-specific irrigation have reported water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered crop production, and the greatest savings are most likely to occur in humid climates by spatially maximizing utilization of non-uniform growing season precipitation. In arid and semi-arid climates, the greatest potential water savings could come from highly managed deficit irrigation strategies in which spatial management of soil water deficit timing is used to maximize net return rather than yield Future research needs to focus on developing and documenting cost-effective site-specific water conservation strategies to support market development for these advanced and needed irrigation technologies.","[Evans, R.

Four 29 year long simulations are compared against each other and against sea ice thickness and extent observations. Each simulation uses a separate parameterization for snow thermophysical properties. The first simulation uses a constant thermal conductivity and prescribed density profiles. The second and third parameterizations use typical power-law relationships linking thermal conductivity directly to density (prescribed as in the first simulation). The fourth parameterization is newly developed and consists of a set of two linear equations relating the snow thermal conductivity and density to the mean seasonal wind speed. Results show that simulation 1 leads to a significant overestimation of the sea ice thickness due to overestimated thermal conductivity, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Parameterizations 2 and 4 lead to a realistic simulation of the Arctic sea ice mean state. Simulation 3 results in the underestimation of the sea ice basal growth in both hemispheres, but is partly compensated by lateral growth and snow ice formation in the Southern Hemisphere. Finally, parameterization 4 improves the simulated Snow Depth Distributions by including snow packing by wind, and shows potential for being used in future works. The intercomparison of all simulations suggests that the sea ice model is more sensitive to the snow representation in the Arctic than it is in the Southern Ocean, where the sea ice thickness is not driven by temperature profiles in the snow.","[Lecomte, O.; Fichefet, T.; Massonnet, F.; Barriat, P.

Important indicators such as the annual mean of hourly mean surface ozone (AVG1), the daily maximum 8-h values (MDA8), and the AVG1 during daytime (D-AVG1) were high in background areas while low in urban areas including the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). It implies that regional background level largely determines the ozone characteristics in Korea while local photochemical reactions affect the ozone levels in individual district. This hypothesis was validated by the frequency of the high ozone episodes by district. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of surface ozone in Korea were high, thus, there should be control policy district by district based on the target indicator(s). (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, spatial accuracy of modeled melt is not well investigated, and neither is the level of accuracy required to assess ice sheet loss. Focusing on a fast-thinning region of West Antarctica, we calculate spatially resolved ice-shelf melt from satellite altimetry and compare against results from an ocean model with varying representations of cavity geometry and ocean physics. Then, we use an ice-flow model to assess the impact of the results on grounded ice. We find that a number of factors influence model-data agreement of melt rates, with bathymetry being the leading factor; but this agreement is only important in isolated regions under the ice shelves, such as shear margins and grounding lines. To improve ice sheet forecasts, both modeling and observations of ice-ocean interactions must be improved in these critical regions. Plain Language Summary The Antarctic coastline is fringed by large floating ice shelves, often the size of cities or larger. They play a crucial role as a stopgap against acceleration of the ice sheet, and their loss could lead to considerable sea level rise. Many of these ice shelves are exposed to warm waters from farther north, leading to considerable melting underneath. Scientists use models of the ice sheet and the ocean in order to understand the link between warming oceans and sea levels, and how this might change in the future. In our study we focus on one of these fast-thinning ice shelves and determine through satellite imagery that melting is not uniform across the ice shelf but is highly focused in certain areas due to ocean currents. Using state-of-the-art ice and ocean models, we investigate what information will be needed in order to predict how the Antarctic Ice Sheet will respond to climate change. Our findings suggest that improved knowledge of ocean depth under ice shelves, as well as improved understanding of ocean flow just below the ice bottom, will be vital in determining the effects of climate change on ice shelves and ice sheets.","[Goldberg, D.

The strategic goal of ecosystem management is to find a sensible middle ground between ensuring long-term protection of the environment while allowing an increasing population to use its natural resources for maintaining and improving human life. Ecosystem management has all the characteristics of 'wicked' problems that are tricky, complex, and thorny. Ambiguities, conflicts, internal inconsistencies, unknown but large costs, lack of organized approaches, institutional shock and confusion, lack of scientific understanding of management consequences, and turbulent, rapidly changing power centers all contribute to the wickedness of the ecosystem management paradigm. Given that ecosystem management, Like human survival and welfare, is a wicked problem, how can we proceed to tame it? Managers need to use the same tools that people have always used for handling such problems - knowledge, organization, judicious simplification, and inspired leadership. The generic theory of decision support system development and application is well developed. Numerous specific ecosystem management decision support systems (EM-DSS) have been developed and are evolving in their capabilities. There is no doubt that given a set of ecosystem management processes to support and adequate time and resources, effective EM-DSS can be developed. On the other hand, there is considerable doubt that sufficiently detailed, explicitly described and widely accepted processes for implementing ecosystem management can be crafted given the current institutional, educational, social and political climate. A socio-political climate in which everyone wants to reap the benefits and no one wants to pay the costs, incapacitates the federal forest management decision making process. Developing a workable ecosystem management process and the decision making tools to support it is probably one of the most complex and urgent challenges facing us today. This paper offers a concise review of the state of the art of decision support systems related to implementing ecosystem management. A conceptual model of the context in which ecosystem management is expected to function is presented. Next, a candidate for an operational ecosystem management process is described and others are referenced. Finally, a generic ecosystem management decision support system is presented and many existing systems briefly described.

In response, there has been an increasing focus on the use of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), including the administration of reproductive hormones to induce gamete release followed by in vitro fertilisation. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of two exogenous hormones to induce gamete release, for the purpose of conducting in vitro fertilisation (IVF), in one of Australia's most critically endangered frog species, Pseudophryne corroboree. Methods: Male frogs were administered a single dose of either human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRHa), while female frogs received both a priming and ovulatory dose of LHRHa. Spermiation responses were evaluated at 3, 7, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h post hormone administration (PA), and sperm number and viability were quantified using fluorescent microscopy. Ovulation responses were evaluated by stripping females every 12 h PA for 5 days. Once gametes were obtained, IVF was attempted by combining spermic urine with oocytes in a dilute solution of simplified amphibian ringer (SAR). Results: Administration of both hCG and LHRHa induced approximately 80% of males to release sperm over 72 h. Peak sperm release occurred at 12 h PA for hCG treated males and 36 h PA for LHRHa treated males. On average, LHRHa treated males released a significantly higher total number of live sperm, and a higher concentration of sperm, over a longer period. In female frogs, administration of LHRHa induced approximately 30% of individuals to release eggs. On average, eggs were released between 24 and 48 h PA, with a peak in egg release at 36 h PA. IVF resulted in a moderate percentage (54.72%) of eggs being fertilised, however all resultant embryos failed prior to gastrulation. Conclusions: Hormone treatment successfully induced spermiation and ovulation in P. corroboree, but refinement of gamete induction and IVF techniques will be required before ART protocols can be used to routinely propagate this species.","[Byrne, Phillip G.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Silla, Aimee J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",Monash University; University of Western Australia,"Byrne, PG (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",phillip.byrne@sci.monash.edu.au,,"Byrne, Phillip/0000-0003-2183-9959; Silla, Aimee/0000-0002-2277-9030","NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW); Corroboree Frog Conservation Trust; Murray Catchment Management Authority (Murray CMA); Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife (FNPW); Abbott Australia","NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW); Corroboree Frog Conservation Trust; Murray Catchment Management Authority (Murray CMA); Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife (FNPW); Abbott Australia(Abbott Laboratories)","Thanks to Dale Roberts, Dave Hunter and four anonymous referees for comments on the manuscript.

While recent approaches for few-shot object detection have advanced the state of the art, they still do not fully meet the requirements of practical workflows, e.g., in media production and archiving. In these applications, annotated samples for novel classes are drawn from different data sources, they differ in numbers and it may be necessary to add a new class quickly to cover the requirements of a specific production. In contrast, current frameworks for few-shot object detection typically assume a static dataset, which is split into the base and novel classes. We propose a toolchain to facilitate training for fewshot object detection, which takes care of data preparation when using heterogeneous training data and setup of training steps. The toolchain also creates annotation files to use combined data sets as new base models, which facilitates class-incremental training. We also integrated the toolchain with an annotation UI.","[Bailer, Werner] Joanneum Res, Graz, Austria",,"Bailer, W (corresponding author), Joanneum Res, Graz, Austria.",werner.bailer@joanneum.at,,"Bailer, Werner/0000-0003-2442-4900","European Union [951911]; program ICT of the Future of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK)","European Union(European Commission); program ICT of the Future of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK)","This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement n. 951911 AI4Media (https://ai4media.eu) and from the program ICT of the Future of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).",,6,0,0,5,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-98355-0; 978-3-030-98354-3,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2022,,,,,445,451,,10.1007/978-3-030-98355-0_37,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98355-0_37,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT0JY,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000788273600037,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigates the spatiotemporal patterns of changes in land covers, forest harvest areas and soil erosion rates in Nordic countries, namely Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. This region is highly sensitive to environmental changes, as it is experiencing high levels of human pressure and among the highest rates of global warming. An analysis that uses consistent land cover dataset to quantify and compares the recent spatiotemporal changes in land cover in the Nordic countries is missing. The recent products issued by the European Space Agency and the Copernicus Climate Change Service framework provide the possibility to investigate the historical land cover changes from 1992 to 2018 at 300 m resolution. These maps are then integrated with time series of forest harvest areas between 2004 and 2018 to study if and how forest management is represented in land cover products, and with soil erosion data to explore status and recent trends in agricultural land. Land cover changes typically involved from 4% to 9% of the total area in each country. Wetland showed the strongest reduction (11,003 km(2), 11% of the wetland area in 1992), followed by forest (8,607 km(2), 1%) and sparse vegetation (5,695 km(2), 7%), while agriculture (15,884 km(2), 16%) and settlement (3,582 km(2), 84%) showed net increases. Wetland shrinkage dominated land cover changes in Norway (5,870 km(2), 18%), followed by forest and grassland with a net gain of 3,441 km(2) (3%) and 3, 435 km(2) (10%), respectively. In Sweden, forest areas decreased 13,008 km(2) (4%), mainly due to agriculture expansion (9,211 km(2), 29%). In Finland, agricultural areas increased by 5,982 km(2) (24%), and wetland decreased by 6,698 km(2) (22%). Settlement had the largest net growth in Denmark (717 km(2), 70%), mainly from conversion of agriculture land. Soil erosion rates in Nordic countries are lower than the global average, but they are exacerbating in several locations (especially western Norway). The integration of the land cover datasets with maps of forest harvest areas shows that the majority of the losses in forest cover due to forestry operations are largely undetected, but a non-negligible share of the forest-to-agriculture (up to 19%) or forest-to-grassland (up to 51%) transitions overlap with the harvested sites. Forestry activity in the study region primarily involves small-scale harvest events that are difficult to be detected at the 300 m resolution of the land cover dataset. An accurate representation of forest management remains a challenge for global datasets of land cover time series, and more interdisciplinary international efforts are needed to address this gap. Overall, this analysis provides a detailed overview of recent changes in land cover and forest management in Nordic countries as represented by state-of-the-art global datasets, and offers insights to future studies aiming to improve these data or apply them in land surface models, climate models, landscape ecology, or other applications.","[Zhou, Na; Wu, Qiaosheng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Na; Hu, Xiangping; Byskov, Ingvild; Naess, Jan Sandstad; Cherubini, Francesco] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Program, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Zhao, Wenwu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Beijing Normal University,"Wu, QS (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Hu, XP (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Program, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",Xiangping.Hu@ntnu.no; qshwu@cug.edu.cn,", Wenwu Zhao/AFU-3731-2022; Naess, Jan Sandstad/AAW-6187-2021; zhao, wenwu/L-7716-2018","Naess, Jan Sandstad/0000-0003-3166-913X; zhao, wenwu/0000-0001-5342-354X; Zhou, Na/0000-0002-8125-8702; Hu, Xiangping/0000-0003-3468-8248","Norwegian Research Council [286773]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41861134038]; China Scholarship Council [201906410051]; Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) [2201710266]","Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)","This research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council (Grant No. 286773), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41861134038) through the CHINOR bilateral research project MitiStress, China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906410051) and the Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (Grant No. 2201710266).

Considering the near-surface zonal mean zonal wind at 60 degrees N and the near-surface temperature in northern Europe as predictands, we find that the inclusion of stratospheric information improves the daily forecast on lead times larger than 5 days. The best forecasts are obtained for predictors in the lower stratosphere. Similar predictions cannot be obtained if the statistical forecast only includes tropospheric information. The simple statistical forecast based on stratospheric winds compares favorably to the forecasts of a state-of-the-art dynamical ensemble prediction system. The statistical forecast can be substantially improved by considering only strong stratospheric anomalies and by predicting averaged values.","Danis Meteorol Inst, Div Climate Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Danish Meteorological Institute DMI,"Christiansen, B (corresponding author), Danis Meteorol Inst, Div Climate Res, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",boc@dmi.dk,,"Christiansen, Bo/0000-0003-2792-4724",,,,,18,57,59,0,7,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The state-of-the-art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl< primary< secondary< tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, themH(3-m)C(center dot) radical is destabilized with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C-H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested MemH3-mC-H molecule even more.","[Blokker, Eva; van Zeist, Willem-Jan; Sun, Xiaobo; Hamlin, Trevor A.; Bickelhaupt, F.

Machine learning (ML) allows for high resolution modeling of the water table depth beyond the capabilities of conventional numerical physically-based hydrological models with respect to spatial resolution and overall accuracy. For this, in-situ well and proxy observations are used as training data in combination with high resolution covariates. The objective of this study is to model the depth of the uppermost water table for a typical summer and winter condition at 10 m spatial resolution over entire Denmark (43,000 km(2)). CatBoost, a state of the art implementation of gradient boosting decision trees, is employed in this study to model the water table depth and the associated uncertainties. The groundwater domain has not been the most prominent field of applications of recent hydrological ML advances due to the lack of big data. This study brings forward a novel knowledge-guided ML framework to overcome this limitation by integrating simulation results from a physically-based groundwater flow model. The simulation data are utilized to (1) identify wells that represent the uppermost water table, (2) augment missing training data by accounting for simulated water level seasonality, and (3) expand the list of covariates. The curated training dataset contains around 13,000 wells, 19,000 groundwater proxy observations at lakes, streams and coastline as well as 15 covariates. Cross validation attests that the ML model generalizes well with a mean absolute error of around 115 cm considering solely well observations and a MAE of <50 cm taking also the proxy observations into consideration. Quantile regression is applied to estimate confidence intervals and the estimated uncertainty is largest for moraine clay soils that are characterized with a distinct geological heterogeneity. This study highlights a novel research avenue of knowledge-guided ML for the groundwater domain by efficiently supporting a ML model with a physically-based hydrological model to predict the depth of the water table at unprecedented spatial detail and accuracy.","[Koch, Julian; Gotfredsen, Jane; Schneider, Raphael; Troldborg, Lars; Stisen, Simon; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Hydrol, Copenhagen, Denmark",Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland,"Koch, J (corresponding author), Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Dept Hydrol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",juko@geus.dk,"Schneider, Raphael/H-7499-2018; Koch, Julian/D-2509-2015","Schneider, Raphael/0000-0001-9628-0809; Koch, Julian/0000-0002-7732-3436; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen/0000-0003-4821-5310",Danish Digitalization Strategy (FODS) through the HIP (Hydrological Informationand Prognosis-system) project,Danish Digitalization Strategy (FODS) through the HIP (Hydrological Informationand Prognosis-system) project,The study has been funded by the Danish Digitalization Strategy (FODS) through the HIP (Hydrological Informationand Prognosis-system) project related to FODS 6.1.,,58,4,4,2,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

We suggest that a process of describing and sharing mental models-the cognitive frameworks that people use to interpret and understand the world-provides promising and as yet underutilized techniques for conservation planners to improve implementation success. The processes and techniques associated with the mental models concept have been applied in a variety of fields including business and organization science, risk analysis, education, natural resource management, and climate change adaptation. Our review of mental models illustrates that their application can strengthen the success of conservation planning by: (1) contributing to clear and open communication between stakeholders; (2) aiding in overcoming obstacles to incorporating multiple sources of knowledge; (3) enabling shared ownership of a conservation plan; and (4) improving social assessments. Techniques to explicitly communicate mental models can contribute to each phase of a conservation planning process-assessment, planning, management, and review.

Although the use of certain psychotropic substances is associated with deviancy, multiple reasons can shed light on the drug phenomenon as a multifactorial reality. Among these reasons we can mention: medical use for health reasons, pleasure and sensorial experience; knowledge and exploration of the self; psychotherapy with LSD 25; war; support for religious practices; creation and artistic inspiration, etc. Through a literature review, this article explores the sociological and anthropological perspective in the field of psychotropic substances and their ties with the process of creativity and artistic inspiration (music, poetry, the arts, etc.). With a constructivist approach, a psychosocial perspective will be enabled to take a hold on certain social and cultural challenges in the context of psychotropic substance use and artistic creation. part les Inuits qui, jusqu'a l'arrivee de << l'homme blanc >>, ne pouvaient faire pousser des plantes pour des raisons climatiques, on peut dire que toutes les cultures et les societes humaines ont utilise une ou plusieurs substances psychoactives, leur usage etant universel.

Parmi celles-ci, l'usage medical pour ramener le corps a la sante, le plaisir et l'experience sensorielle, la connaissance et l'exploration de soi, la psychotherapie avec le LSD 25, la guerre, le support aux pratiques religieuses et bien sur la creation et l'inspiration artistique. travers une revue de litterature, cet article explore la perspective socioculturelle dans le champ des substances psychoactives et les liens avec le processus de creation (musique, poesie, arts, etc.). partir d'une perspective constructiviste et interactionniste, une analyse psychosociale sera privilegiee pour saisir certains enjeux sociaux et culturels du phenomene drogues en contexte de creation.","[Suissa, Amnon Jacob] Univ Quebec, Ecole Travail Social, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Suissa, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Ecole Travail Social, Fac Sci Humaines, Pavillon Therese Casgrain,455,Blvd Rene Levesque, Montreal, PQ H2L 4Y2, Canada.",suissa.amnon@uqam.ca,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0008-4298,2042-0587,,STUD RELIG-SCI RELIG,Stud.

Observation (ERA-Interim) shows a high negative correlation (-0.73) between the interannual variabilities of East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) intensity and North Pacific synoptic eddy (NPSE) activity during the period of 1979 similar to 2005. Namely, a stronger (weaker) EAWM is related to a weaker (stronger) synoptic eddy activities over the North Pacific. This strong reverse relationship can be well explained by latitudinal distributions of the surface temperature anomalies over East Asian continent, which leads the variation of local baroclinicity and significantly weakens the baroclinic wave activities over the northern latitudes of 40 degrees N. This feature is supported by the distribution of the meridional heat flux ((v'theta') over tilde) anomalies, which have negative (positive) values along the latitudes 40 similar to 50 degrees N for strong(weak) EAWM years. In this study, the historical simulations by 11 CMIP5 climate models (BCC-CSM1.1, CanESM2, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM1-M) are analyzed for DJF of 1979 similar to 2005. Correlation coefficient between the two phenomena is -0.59, which is comparable to that of observation. Model-to-model variation in this relationship is relatively large as the range of correlation coefficient is between -0.76 (HadGEM2-CC and HadGEM2-AO) and -0.33 (MRI-CGCM3). But, these reverse relationships are shown in all models without any exception. We found that the multi-model ensemble is qualitatively similar to the observation in reasoning (that is, latitudinal distribution of surface temperature anomalies, variation of local baroclinicity and meridional heat flux by synoptic eddies) of the reverse relationship. However, the uncertainty for weak EAWM is much larger than strong EAWM. In conclusion, we suggest that CMIP5 models as an ensemble have a good performance in the simulation of EAWM, NPSE, and their relationship.","[Yoon, Jae-Seung; Chung, Il-Ung] Gangneung Wonju Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, 7 Jukheon Gil, Kangnung 210702, Gangwon, South Korea; [Shin, Sang-Hye] Gangneung Wonju Natl Univ, Ind Acad Cooperat Grp, Kangnung, South Korea",Kangnung Wonju National University; Kangnung Wonju National University,"Chung, IU (corresponding author), Gangneung Wonju Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, 7 Jukheon Gil, Kangnung 210702, Gangwon, South Korea.",iuchung@gwnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,19,2,2,1,1,KOREAN METEOROLOGICAL SOC,SEOUL,"SHINKIL-DONG 508, SIWON BLDG 704, YONGDUNGPO-GU, SEOUL, 150-050, SOUTH KOREA",1598-3560,2288-3266,,ATMOS-KOREA,Atmos.-Korea,JUN,2015,2,,,,295,308,,10.14191/Atmos.2015.25.2.295,http://dx.doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2015.25.2.295,,,14,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,V9W2M,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000422581100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

We then captured the views to illustrate a HCL framework in a tropical context, whereby the quantitative and qualitative approaches were considered. The preliminary design strategies were developed based on this framework and exemplified in a selected nursing home in Singapore. Also, pre-/post implementation user surveys together with quantitative evaluations (involving horizontal and corneal illuminance measurements) were conducted for assessing the performance of the HCL design strategies.

Recent research has found that monthly variations of soil moisture and snow water simulated by land surface models compared favorably with the GRACE-derived TWS change. Compared to the GRACE data, the standard version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Land Model (CLM) produces a weaker TWS variability in tropical and mid-latitudes but a stronger TWS variation in high latitudes. However, a modified version of CLM that includes more realistic interception, runoff, and frozen soil processes improves the simulation of TWS change in global river basins of various scales. In addition, the modified CLM improves the modeling of evapotranspiration through the improvements in the modeling of TWS variation and runoff in the Amazon River basin. Along this line of research, this paper shows that such GRACE data can be used as a means of evaluating the hydrological schemes in a land surface model.","Univ Texas, John A & Katherine G Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Niu, GY (corresponding author), Univ Texas, John A & Katherine G Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",niu@geo.utexas.edu,"Niu, Guo-Yue/B-8317-2011; Yang, Zong-Liang/B-4916-2011","Niu, Guo-Yue/0000-0003-2105-7690; Yang, Zong-Liang/0000-0003-3030-0330",,,,,13,45,48,0,16,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Establishing a high-resolution timescale for the Carboniferous and Permian in the NCB is essential to understand the geologic events and explore the spatial and temporal distributions of the natural resources. The upper Carboniferous and the basal part of Permian are relatively well correlated because they yield marine conodont and fusuline fossils. However, the Permian terrestrial strata mostly rely on poorly constrained palynostratigraphy and phytostratigraphy and are short of the precise geochronologic constraints on the correlation with the marine strata. This study provides a critical review on the state-of-the-art of the latest Carboniferous and Permian chronostratigraphic and biostratigraphic frameworks and stratigraphic correlation in the NCB. The Penchi Formation ranges from lower Bashkirian to lower Gzhelian; the Taiyuan Formation is assigned to the upper Gzhelian to lower Asselian; the Shansi and Lower Shihhotse formations are from middle Asselian to lower Sakmarian; the Upper Shihhotse Formation is assigned to upper Artinskian to lower Kungurian, and the Sunjiagou Formation was assigned to Lopingian, respectively. A long hiatus up to similar to 20 Myr between the Upper Shihhotse and Sunjiagou formations, mainly marked by a large-scale erosional surface at the base of a coarse conglomeratic sandstone unit and/or multiple paleosol layers as well as significant differences of floras between these two lithostratigraphic units, is present probably due to tectonic uplift in association with the closure of the Paleo Asian Ocean (PAO) during the Cisuralian and Guadalupian. The possible amplitude of sea-level changes from Carboniferous to Permian on the NCB is estimated from 0 to 40 m. The floral succession, depositional records and organic carbon isotope profiles suggest that the latest Carboniferous and earliest Permian was a favorable period for coal accumulation under an ever-wet and warm climate, followed by a prominent shift to dry climate from early-middle Cisuralian. This climatic shift during the Permian was mainly resulted from northward migration of the Pangea and the closure of the PAO, which is comparable with the Carboniferous and Permian trends in central Europe.","[Shen, Boheng; Shen, Shuzhong; Wu, Qiong; Wang, Xiangdong; Hou, Zhangshuai; Shi, Yukun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn & Frontiers Sci, Ctr Crit Earth Mat Cycling, State Key Lab Mineral Deposits Res, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuichang; Zhang, Bin] Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, PetroChina, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Dongxun] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Resources & Geosci, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yichun; Liu, Feng; Zhang, Hua; Wang, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yichun; Liu, Feng; Zhang, Hua; Wang, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Feng, Zhuo] Yunnan Univ, Inst Palaeontol, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Nanjing University; China National Petroleum Corporation; China University of Mining & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology & Paleoanthropology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yunnan University","Shen, SZ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn & Frontiers Sci, Ctr Crit Earth Mat Cycling, State Key Lab Mineral Deposits Res, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",szshen@nju.edu.cn,"Hou, Zhangshuai/HDO-5171-2022; chen, shu zhong/D-8214-2011","Wu, Qiong/0000-0002-4993-6569; chen, shu zhong/0000-0001-8380-0692",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91955201]; Science Research and Technology Development of RIPED [RIPED-2019-JS-984],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Research and Technology Development of RIPED,"We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

The state-of-the art spectral wave model SWAN is implemented to perform a 31 - year wave hindcast in the area of interest. The simulation results are used to assess the inter-annual variability and long-term changes in wind and wave climate in the Black Sea for the period 1979-2009. The SWAN model is forced with the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) winds. The model is calibrated and validated against available wave measurements at six offshore and near-shore locations spread over a large region in the Black Sea. The calibration was performed by tuning parameters in the white-capping and wind input formulations against available measurements for 1996 at three offshore locations (Gelendzhik, Hopa, and Sinop). The validation was carried out using measured data, at Gelendzhik, Hopa, and Sinop offshore locations, Gloria drilling platform and Karaburun and Filyos near-shore locations. From the 31-year simulation results, the long-term spatial distributions and changes of the mean wind and mean and maximum wave characteristics and their inter-annual variabilities were determined. The calibration improved SWAN model performance by 11.6% for H-m0 and 3.3% for T-m02 on average at three locations. The mean annual significant wave height (H-m0) and mean wind speed (WS) indicate the occurrence of higher wave heights and wind speeds in the western Black Sea compared to the south eastern coasts of the Black Sea. The coefficient of variation over the Black Sea for H-m0 and WS shows that the variability for H-m0 is higher than that of WS.

To derive robust heat content (HC) variability, the ensemble-mean HC anomalies (HCA) of six state-of-the-art global ocean reanalyses for 1979-2007 are analyzed. Compared with previous studies, characteristic oceanic processes are distinguished through their dominant time scales. Using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, the HC fields are first decomposed into components with different time scales. The authors' analysis shows that these components are associated with distinctive ocean dynamics. The high-frequency (first three) components can be characterized as the equatorial modes, whereas the low-frequency (the fifth and sixth) components are featured as the meridional modes. In between, the fourth component on the time scale of 3-4 yr demonstrates mixed characteristics of the meridional and equatorial modes because of an active transition from the predominant meridional to zonal structures on this time scale. Physically, this transition process is initiated by the discharge of the off-equatorial HCA, which is first accumulated as a part of the meridional mode, into the equatorial waveguide, which is triggered by the breakdown of the equilibrium between the cross-equatorial HC contrast and the overlying wind forcing, and results in a major heat transport through the equatorial waveguide into the southeastern tropical Atlantic. It is also shown that remote forcing from El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts important influence on the transition from the equatorial to meridional mode and may partly dictate its time scale of 3-4 yr. Therefore, the authors' results demonstrate another mechanism of the equatorial Atlantic response to the ENSO forcing.","[Zhu, Jieshun; Huang, Bohua] Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; [Huang, Bohua] George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Coll Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Wu, Zhaohua] Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Wu, Zhaohua] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",George Mason University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Zhu, JS (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",jieshun@cola.iges.org,"Wu, Zhaohua/N-7102-2013; Zhu, Jieshun/G-5524-2012","Zhu, Jieshun/0000-0002-1508-9808; Huang, Bohua/0000-0003-4869-3849; Wu, Zhaohua/0000-0003-1660-0724",NOAA/CVP [NA07OAR4310310]; National Science Foundation [AGS-1139479]; Directorate For Geosciences [1139479] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NOAA/CVP(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Funding for this study is provided by the NOAA/CVP program (NA07OAR4310310).

Rather than stating when it is, we consider critical methods of reading the contemporary alongside the objects they favor and promote. We thereby disrupt the idea of an accepted canon of contemporary fiction by showing the wide array of texts contemporary critics do in fact study. This survey covers contemporary approaches to fiction that find their starting points in the neoliberal economy, in systems and institutions, in theories of the Anthropocene and world literature, and in critical race studies. We conclude with the proliferating posts of contemporary literature and theory - post-human, post-racial, and even post-postmodern - and with our intuitions about the temporal and historical function of literary form in contemporary fiction.","[Hyde, Emily] Rowan Univ, Stratford, NJ 08084 USA; [Wasserman, Sarah] Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA",Rowan University; University of Delaware,"Hyde, E (corresponding author), Rowan Univ, Stratford, NJ 08084 USA.",,,,,,,,117,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1741-4113,,,LIT COMPASS,Lit.

The poor electrical conductivity of sulfur and the high diffusivity of the intermediate lithium polysulfides create various problems, which limit the utilization of the full potential of these batteries. Polar conducive sulfur hosts such as titanium nitride (TiN) make it possible to realize remarkable improvements in active material utilization and capacity retention outcomes over long-term cycling. It has not been possible to use these polar, conducive, ceramic materials for higher active material loading ( > 2 mg cm(-2)) due to their low flexibility compared to carbonaceous materials. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of designing a three-dimensional free-standing electrode using polycrystalline 1-D TiN for a relatively high sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2). The electrochemical performance of this 1-D TiN-based electrode is compared to that of an electrode based on 1-D TiO2 (the starting material for TiN synthesis). The results demonstrate the catalytic effect of TiN by virtue of its endowed conductivity, leading to remarkable capacity retention and better active material utilization at high C-rates compared to a TiO2-based electrode.","[Beyene, Anteneh Marelign; Yun, Jong Hyuk; Ahad, Syed Abdul; Moorthy, Brindha; Kim, Do Kyung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Beyene, Anteneh Marelign] AAiT, Sch Chem & Bioengn, King George VI St, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, DK (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.",dkkim@kaist.ac.kr,"Moorthy, Brindha/AAZ-3078-2021; Kim, Do Kyung/C-2039-2011","Kim, Do Kyung/0000-0001-9092-9427; Yun, Jong Hyuk/0000-0002-0798-4669",Climate Change Research Hub of EEWS from KAIST [N11180108]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2017R1A2B2010148],Climate Change Research Hub of EEWS from KAIST; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT),This work was supported by the Climate Change Research Hub of EEWS from KAIST (Grant No. N11180108) and by a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2017R1A2B2010148).,,36,5,5,1,106,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-4332,1873-5584,,APPL SURF SCI,Appl.

Reactive nitrogen (Nr) plays a vital role in different areas, such as air pollution, climate change, eutrophication and acidification of soils, ecosystems and surface waters and such like. It inherently presents a multi-pollutant, multi-effect and multi-media problem. Historically, many of these individual problems have been addressed by models developed for a specific purpose, limited to single pollutants, effects or environmental compartments and media. In addition to that, relevant datasets and model approaches have been developed within different scientific and science-policy communities and hence their integration is facing not only technical and methodological problems, but as well needs communication and collaboration across disciplines, in many areas outside the comfort zones of modellers and decision makers alike. While climate change and carbon have been receiving a significant amount of attention in science, policy and the general public in the course of the last decade, the changes of the global nitrogen cycle and its implications have emerged to - potentially - become an even greater challenge for science An ever ongoing increase in vehicular traffic, energy use, industry, and animal husbandry are the principal causes of the increased emissions of oxidized and reduced forms of nitrogen. The negative impacts of these emissions include: (i) air pollution, such as increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone and fine particles, leading to effects on humans and vegetation and influencing the earth's radiation balance, (ii) elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), being one of the most important greenhouse gases, thus affecting climate change and to climate change, (iii) eutrophication and acidification of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with related impacts on plant species and faunal species diversity, (iv) surface water pollution with nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4), including damage to fisheries in coastal ecosystems and (v) drinking water (ground water) pollution by nitrate pollution (e. g. Vitousek et al., 1997, Galloway and Cowling, 2002; Galloway et al., 2003; Matson et al., 2002;) The undesirable cascading effects of nitrogen, as Galloway et al. (2003) call them, thus affect different environmental media, across different time spans and different nitrogen species contribute to most contemporary environmental pressures. It is thus a formidable example for taking stock of the methods and approaches which form the state-of-the-art in environmental modelling and how they may be integrated and combined to tackle the nitrogen problem. The relevance of nitrogen and the need for an integrated approach to address the complex issues of managing the nitrogen cycle have recently been highlighted at the 3(rd) of a series of workshops organised by the Swedish ASTA programme (http://asta.ivl.se/Saltsjobaden3.htm). It is anticipated, that under the UNECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) the development of strategies to address the nitrogen challenge will have a prominent role in the coming years. The paper will discuss some approaches currently taken in research projects in Europe, e. g. the NitroEurope IP (http://www.nitroeurope.eu, in particular the work on the INTEGRATOR model), the IIASA RAINS/GAINS model (http://www.iiasa.ac.at/rains/gains/) and link to discussions and developments on concepts for model integration and coupling such as OpenMI (http://www.openmi.org/).

In order to solve the problems, engineers need to understand how consumers use their water and their water use behaviours. This research is to re-analyse the effective technologies for researching the water use behaviours (behavioural models) in the water end use field, and proposes an integrated model for better understanding water end use behavioural intervention. It is recommended that the self-regulation attitude and the process of behavioral change play important roles and influent greatly on the behavioural intervention of water end use. An expanded theory of planned behavior model is used as the basis in the model and self-regulation theory also is adapted to modify the interventions. The integrated model proposed in this paper is to better understand the details of water end use behaviours, and intervention and its impact of energy saving.","[Fu, Yang; Wu, Wenyan] Staffordshire Univ, Fac Art & Creat Technol, Stafford, Staffs, England",Staffordshire University,"Fu, Y (corresponding author), Staffordshire Univ, Fac Art & Creat Technol, Stafford, Staffs, England.",y028136c@student.staffs.ac.uk; w.wu@staffs.ac.uk,,"Fu, Yang/0000-0003-2582-9862",,,,,37,4,4,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-909522-02-2,,,,2014,,,,,266,271,,,,,,6,Automation & Control Systems,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems,BC0LT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000349180700050,View Full Record in Web of Science

In China, particulate pollution is a serious environmental problem that is influencing air quality, regional and global climates, and human health(2,3). In response to the extremely severe and persistent haze pollution experienced by about 800 million people during the first quarter of 2013 (refs 4, 5), the Chinese State Council announced its aim to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) by up to 25 per cent relative to 2012 levels by 2017 (ref. 6). Such efforts however require elucidation of the factors governing the abundance and composition of PM2.5, which remain poorly constrained in China(3,7,8). Here we combine a comprehensive set of novel and state-of-the-art offline analytical approaches and statistical techniques to investigate the chemical nature and sources of particulate matter at urban locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an during January 2013. We find that the severe haze pollution event was driven to a large extent by secondary aerosol formation, which contributed 30-77 per cent and 44-71 per cent (average for all four cities) of PM2.5 and of organic aerosol, respectively. On average, the contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) are found to be of similar importance (SOA/SIA ratios range from 0.6 to 1.4). Our results suggest that, in addition to mitigating primary particulate emissions, reducing the emissions of secondary aerosol precursors from, for example, fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning is likely to be important for controlling China's PM2.5 levels and for reducing the environmental, economic and health impacts resulting from particulate pollution.","[Huang, Ru-Jin; Bozzetti, Carlo; Daellenbach, Kaspar R.; Slowik, Jay G.; Platt, Stephen M.; Canonaco, Francesco; Zotter, Peter; Wolf, Robert; Pieber, Simone M.; Bruns, Emily A.; Crippa, Monica; Ciarelli, Giancarlo; Baltensperger, Urs; El Haddad, Imad; Prevot, Andre S.

The basic idea is to test the feasibility of extending the technology of routine numerical weather prediction beyond the inherent limit of deterministic predictability of weather to produce numerical climate predictions using state-of-the-art global atmospheric models. Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) either forced by predicted sea surface temperature (SST) or as part of a coupled forecast system have shown in the past that certain regions of the extratropics, in particular, the Pacific-North America (PNA) region during Northern Hemisphere winter, can be predicted with significant skill especially during years of large tropical SST anomalies. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about how much the details of various AGCMs impact conclusions about extratropical seasonal prediction and predictability. DSP is designed to compare seasonal simulation and prediction results from five state-of-the-art U.S. modeling groups (NCAR, COLA, GSFC, GFDL, NCEP) in order to assess which aspects of the results are robust and which are model dependent. The initial emphasis is on the predictability of seasonal anomalies over the PNA region. This paper also includes results from the ECMWF model, and historical forecast skill over both the PNA region and the European region is presented for all six models. It is found that with specified SST boundary conditions, all models show that the winter season mean circulation anomalies over the Pacific-North American region are highly predictable during years of large tropical sea surface temperature anomalies. The influence of large anomalous boundary conditions is so strong and so reproducible that the seasonal mean forecasts can be given with a high degree of confidence. However, the degree of reproducibility is highly variable from one model to the other, and quantities such as the PNA region signal to noise ratio are found to vary significantly between the different AGCMs. It would not be possible to make reliable estimates of predictability of the seasonal mean atmosphere circulation unless causes for such large differences among models are understood.","George Mason Univ, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; Natl Ctr Environm Predict, Camp Springs, MD USA",George Mason University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Shukla, J (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",,"Brankoviƒá, ƒåedo/F-9069-2018; Kalnay, Eugenia/F-4393-2010; Ploshay, Jeffrey/V-4723-2018","Ploshay, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8650-2965; Palmer, Tim/0000-0002-7121-2196; Kalnay, Eugenia/0000-0002-9984-9906",,,,,30,241,248,2,31,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Management models containing simulation-optimization techniques are widely used to explore sustainable strategies of conjunctive water use, but previous studies often failed to address the system's complexity as a whole, characterized by many stakeholders, a heterogeneous flow regime, and uncertain driving forces. This article contributes to a many-objective robust decision-making (MORDM) framework that integrates a state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization algorithm (MOEA) with robustness-based decision analysis to advance the field's knowledge of conjunctive water use. The framework is applied to the trans-regional Heihe River Basin in China, which is facing a number of consequences of unsustainable water management, jeopardizing the downstream ecosystem and agricultural development in the river's midreach. Results show that the current water management scheme is unsustainable in two respects: It overexploits groundwater resources locally and it cannot fulfill the minimum ecological outflow target. The baseline can be further improved with optimized solutions, but an unresolvable conflict exists between the required environmental outflow and water demand for the irrigated agriculture scheme under the current policy of inflow-proportional water sharing with the downstream. The robustness assessment highlights the key driving forces and how they shape the robustness of the system under different policies and changing conditions. The case study sheds light on the potential of MORDM to solve complex conjunctive water management problems and shows how it can help to improve understanding of the problem itself.","[Li, Yu; Kinzelbach, Wolfgang] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Inst Environm Engn, Wolfgang Pauli Str 27,HIT E42-2, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Inst Environm Engn, Wolfgang Pauli Str 27,HIT E42-2, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",yu.li@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,,"LI, YU/0000-0002-6490-5672; Kinzelbach, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8230-5953",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation under the project Rehabilitation and Management Strategy for Over-Pumped Aquifers under a Changing Climate,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation under the project Rehabilitation and Management Strategy for Over-Pumped Aquifers under a Changing Climate,"The authors owe special thanks to Xin Li and his team from the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Zhengxu Lei from the Department of Water Resources, Gaotai County, for the tireless support of this work.

So far the demand could be satisfied by a mixture of conventional and renewable energies. With the global effort to eliminate conventional energies to stop the anthropological climate change, the demand for reliable and predictable renewable energies is growing. Under these circumstances, more attention is drawn towards the development of non-intermittent ocean energy systems. Apart from waves, thermal and salinity gradients, currents are an abundant and reliable ocean energy source. Inspired by state-of-the-art technology, a unique system for current energy, the Current Kite, is presented in the following paper. This tethered undersea kite (TUSK) consist of a wing to which a turbine is attached. The wing drags the turbine through the water in a certain trajectory, sweeping a large area at a relative speed that is several times the actual speed of the underwater current. In the following paper we present the general setup and design of our first and second prototype. The first prototype was build as a prove of concept. It was equipped with active steering and several on board sensors. With the second prototype the aim was to build a more sophisticated system, which would make the active steering redundant and use more efficient, circular flight paths. A wing which would adjust itself in the current and follow the predefined circular path, was designed using numerical simulations. To achieve this circular flight movement without twisting the electrical cable, a swivel and a stress reducer were designed and built to connect the TUSK as well as transfer electrical power to land. In addition the tracking-system was redesigned, communicating by modulation over the power line. This provides a fully autonomous ocean current power plant, which communicates in real time data and has a promising outlook in efficiency, regarding to the state of art. Due to Covid-19 regulations it was not possible to test the prototype. Therefore the paper mainly focuses on the design and construction process, up to the production of the TUSK.","[Guenzel, Leonard; Beer, Theresa; Wucherpfennig, Sjard; Boelmann, Jan] Univ Appl Sci Bremerhaven, Dept Marine Technol & Marine Energy, Maritime Technol Lab, Bremerhaven, Germany",,"Boelmann, J (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Bremerhaven, Dept Marine Technol & Marine Energy, Maritime Technol Lab, Bremerhaven, Germany.",jboelmann@hs-bremerhaven.de,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

In parallel, the use of columns with reduced dimensions is becoming more common. This means the effective column volume is also decreased, thereby making the systems more susceptible to effects of band broadening due to extra-column volume. Despite these trends and the fact that a growing number of miniaturized liquid chromatography systems are being offered commercially, manufacturers often stick to the modular concept with dedicated units for pumps, column oven, and detectors. This modular design results in long connection capillaries, which leads to extra-column band broadening and consequently prevents the exploitation of the intrinsic efficiency of state-of-the-art columns. In particular, band broadening post column has a considerable negative effect on efficiency. In this study, mass flow and concentration-dependent detectors were examined for their influence on band broadening using a micro-LC system. A mass spectrometric detector, an evaporative light scattering detector, two UV detectors, and a previously undescribed fluorescence detector were compared. The influence on efficiency is compared using plate height vs linear velocity data and peak variance. It is shown that an increase in the inner diameter after the post-column transfer capillary leads to significant loss in plate height. Comparing the UV detectors, it could be shown that the dispersion was reduced by 38% by the reduction of the post-column volume. The largest variance was found for the evaporative light scattering detector, which was 368% higher compared to the variance of the detector with the least effect on band broadening.","[Werres, Tobias; Teutenberg, Thorsten] IUTA Inst Energy & Environm Technol, Inst Energie & Umwelttech eV, Bliersheimer Str 58-60, D-47229 Duisburg, Germany; [Werres, Tobias; Schmidt, Torsten C.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Instrumental Analyt Chem, Univ Str 5, D-45141 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen,"Teutenberg, T (corresponding author), IUTA Inst Energy & Environm Technol, Inst Energie & Umwelttech eV, Bliersheimer Str 58-60, D-47229 Duisburg, Germany.",teutenberg@iuta.de,"Schmidt, Torsten/A-1143-2011","Schmidt, Torsten/0000-0003-1107-4403","German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action [19144 N, 20666 N]",German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action,The authors would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action for the financial support within the agenda for the promotion of industrial cooperative research and development (IGF) based on a decision of the German Bundestag (IGF - Project No. 19144 N and 20666 N).,,26,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1618-2642,1618-2650,,ANAL BIOANAL CHEM,Anal.

Results Here, we identify the physiological changes and differential expression of genes among different weeping forsythia populations under drought stress in common garden experiments. Physiological results showed that HBWZ might have higher drought tolerance among four populations. RNA-seq results showed that significant differential expression in the genes responding to the synthesis of flavonoids, aromatic substances, aromatic amino acids, oxidation-reduction process, and transmembrane transport occured among four populations. By further reanalysis of results of previous studies, sequence differentiation was found in the genes related to the synthesis of aromatic substances among different weeping forsythia populations. Conclusions Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that the dual differentiation in gene efficiency and expression increases among populations in response to heterogeneous environments and is an important evolutionary process of local adaptation. Here, we proposed a new working model of local adaptation of weeping forsythia populations under different intensities of drought stress, which provides new insights for understanding the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation for non-model species.","[Li, Yong; Shi, Long-Chen; Si, Yu-Tao] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape & Art, Innovat Platform Mol Biol, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Pei, Nan-Cai] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Cushman, Samuel A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 2500 S Pine Knoll Dr, Flagstaff, AZ USA","Henan Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, CAF; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service","Li, Y (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape & Art, Innovat Platform Mol Biol, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.;Pei, NC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",liyongrui1@126.com; nancai.pei@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770225, 31570594]; Henan Science and Technology Project [202102110077]; Henan Agricultural University Science & Technology Innovation Fund [KJCX2016A2]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Henan Science and Technology Project; Henan Agricultural University Science & Technology Innovation Fund,"The funders had no role in the experiment design, data analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.

In order to control the status of the microclimatic parameters, a continuous monitoring of the indoor environmental provides conservators, curators, restorers, and lenders with an exact knowledge of the microclimatic conditions under which the works of art are kept. Moreover, the monitoring results give important information in order to make adequate changes to the control strategy of microclimatic parameters. From this point of view, monitoring is an essential tool to develop an actual preventive control programme aimed at maintaining the optimal microclimatic conditions for preservation. As a consequence, long-term monitoring has to be applied to prevent deterioration of works of art. The widespread opinion that a correct approach to the topic of microclimate control for artefacts preservation is not only and necessarily to provide buildings with sophisticated environmental control systems, but mainly to investigate the actual environmental dynamics and, before any structural intervention, to de. ne the compatibility between the climate control potentials and the preservation requirements, has become more and more firm among the experts. Monitoring also allows to verify the capacity of the building and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system to maintain the desired thermo-hygrometric values within the operating conditions. To this aim, the Italian Standard UNI 10829 (1999) de. ning monitoring, elaboration and analysis of the microclimatic data as supporting actions for artefacts preservation, led to the need of a long-term monitoring and of a statistical approach to the data management. The approach proposed by the Italian Standard has been recently adopted by a European Standard (EN 15251, 2007). In accordance with the Standards mentioned above, in this paper an operational procedure to assess the thermo-hygrometric quality in museums is firstly synthetically presented and than applied to a case study. In particular, the procedure is developed in order to de. ne the thermo-hygrometric quality level of the exhibition areas in the large museum complex of Santa Maria della Scala in Siena (Italy) during the international temporary exhibition  Duccio.

Sensitivity of model simulated reflectivity, surface rain rate, and cold pool statistics to variations of raindrop breakup/self-collection parameters in four state-of-the-art two-moment bulk microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is examined. The model simulations generally overestimate reflectivity from large and deep convective cells, and underestimate stratiform rain and the frequency of cold pools. In the sensitivity experiments, introduction of more aggressive raindrop breakup or decreasing the self-collection efficiency increases the cold pool occurrence frequency in all of the simulations, and slightly reduces the reflectivity and precipitation statistics bias in some schemes but has little effect on the overall mean surface precipitation.

Since the advent of polar-orbiting and geosynchronous meteorological satellites, the ability to predict weather accurately and reliably, forever longer periods of time, has increased to a remarkable extent. With a diverse suite of sophisticated instruments, meteorological satellites also gather essential data for climate change studies as well. The first systems were pioneered by the USA and by NASA experimental satellites, but over time Europe, Russia, Japan, China, and India have evolved increased capabilities to monitor weather systems using increasingly sophisticated imaging systems. Today, this allows effective sharing of meteorological data on a global scale. The combination of polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites has allowed higher resolution images to be combined into accurate regional and global displays to see broad patterns of weather formations. New capabilities such as lightning intensity mapping have allowed greater capability to predict storm patterns in near real time and thus identify rapidly where the most violent and more energetic storm fronts are headed. The global sharing of meteorological data and the combined imaging of international meteorological satellites have not only greatly contributed to effective long range weather forecasting on land and in the oceans but have also allowed the collection of data to monitor longer-term conditions associated with climate change, global warming, and increases in aridity in some regions and increased rainfall in others. In short, meteorological satellites have evolved, particularly in the last decade, to serve an important role in not only short-to medium-term weather forecasting but also to provide important data with regard to national, regional, and global environmental assessment and analysis including the major ocean conditions known as La Nina and El Nino. The value of meteorological satellite systems and other Earth observation satellite systems for measuring the internationally recognized essential climate variables (ECVs) and for monitoring changes on land, oceans, and atmosphere is greatly increased when the acquired data is made available to national and international user organizations. A study by the International Academy of Astronautics recommends, among other things, that space agencies, companies, universities and nongovernmental organizations, and other international bodies already acting for the coordination of space agencies in the area of climate monitoring should work together to guarantee over time the continuous operational availability of the space sensors and datasets that are necessary for the monitoring of the space-observable ECVs (International Academy of Astronautics, in Study on Space Applications in Climate Change and Green Systems: The Need for International Cooperation, November 2010, eds. J.C. Mankins, M. Grimard, Y. Horikawa, ISBN EAN 9782917761113, pp. 15-21). Such cooperation is aimed at reinforcing the programmatic coordination of the Earth science programs worldwide, in the frame of institutions such as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), with the goal of guaranteeing the continuous long-term availability for all nations of all space-observable ECV, as defined by the global climate observing system (GCOS); and contribute to the elaboration and implementation of GEO data sharing principles (http://www.earthobservations.org/art_015_002.shtml). Despite patterns of data sharing and international cooperation with regard to data collection by meteorological satellite systems, there are limits to full disclosure of all satellite data. In particular, there remain certain areas of strategic concern in the context of possible military or defense-related use of meteorological and remote sensing data in the case of hostilities. It is partially because of these strategic and national defense-related concerns that so many different meteorological satellite systems have been deployed and why some parts of the imaging might be encrypted in a manner so that all data that is collected may not be in all instances fully shared. Despite these strategic concerns and interests, most meteorological satellite imaging data is today widely shared and global cooperation is quite universal. The areas of satellite communications, remote sensing, and satellite navigation have all - to some degree - evolved toward more commercialized economic models and thus have become more oriented to competitive markets. This is not to say that these other space applications services are fully commercialized since there are some well-defined military, defense, and governmental services for satellite communications, remote sensing, and satellite navigation that remain as publicly provided services. In the case of meteorological satellites, however, these space applications remain almost entirely as governmental services. Despite discussions and analysis of how meteorological services might transition to commercial service providers within the USA, the provision of space-based meteorological services seems likely to remain as essentially a public good and not completely commercialized in any spacefaring nation. Although many countries, private businesses, and individuals derive major benefits from meteorological satellite images, no viable economic model has yet evolved whereby these services might be fully commercialized. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), however, is currently evolving a new commercial space policy that mentions possible conditions whereby either hosted payloads on commercial satellites or certain routine, operational space functions might be transferred to the commercial space sector -perhaps on a temporary basis. The particular focus in this regard refers to potential future gaps in US polar orbiting meteorological satellite coverage that could occur in 2017. This potential commercialization of some meteorological satellite services in the U.S. is discussed later in this section. In the chapters that follow specific information about various national and regional meteorological satellite systems will be presented. This introductory chapter provides a quick overview of the various systems that have evolved over time and some information perspective on how these systems are coordinated and work together through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the World Weather Watch (WWW) program ( World Meteorological Organization http://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html also see Lessons Learned about the Integrated Global Observing Strategy through the World Weather Watch http://www.un.org/earthwatch/about/docs/igusland.htm).","[Pelton, Joseph N.] Int Space Univ, Arlington, VA 22207 USA; [Madry, Scott] Global Space Inst, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Camacho-Lara, Sergio] CRECTEALC, Santa Maria Tonantzintla, Puebla, Mexico",,"Pelton, JN (corresponding author), Int Space Univ, Arlington, VA 22207 USA.",joepelton@verizon.net; Scottmadry@mindspring.com; sergio.camacho@inaoep.mx,"Camacho-Lara, Sergio/AAS-8998-2020",,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-23386-4; 978-3-319-23385-7,,,,2017,,,,,1161,1170,,10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_52,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_52,10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4,,10,Telecommunications,Book Citation Index ‚Äì Science (BKCI-S),Telecommunications,BL3QS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000449988500044,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated two lignin fractions: commercial Protobind 1000 lignin and methanol-soluble Protobind 1000 lignin fraction after mild solvolysis. Although lignin has previously been incorporated into various cross-linked systems, this is the first report on lignin-based thermosets obtained via thiol-yne click chemistry. In this approach, lignin was functionalized with terminal alkyne groups followed by cross-linking with a multifunctional thiol, resulting in polymeric network formation. The influence of the curing conditions on the resin characteristics and performance was studied, by varying the amount of reactive monomeric diluents. Additionally, a post-curing strategy utilizing the Claisen rearrangement was investigated. These resins were tested as a wood adhesive and were proven to possess a desirable performance, comparable to the state-of-art phenol-formaldehyde resins. Lignin-based thiol-yne resins turn out to be an alternative to phenol-formaldehyde resins, currently used as adhesives and coatings. Although it is possible to use lignin in phenol-formaldehyde resins, lignin addition is compromising the resin's performance. The main benefits over the phenol-formaldehyde approach are that higher lignin loadings are possible to achieve, and no volatiles are emitted during the resin processing and use.","[Jedrzejczyk, Monika A.; Bernaerts, Katrien, V] Maastricht Univ, Aachen Maastricht Inst Biobased Mat AMIBM, Fac Sci & Engn, NL-6167 RD Geleen, Netherlands; [Kouris, Panos D.; Boot, Michael D.; Hensen, Emiel J.

This liaison of politics and dance created an unusual situation, in which political forces were at work in the introduction of a new dance style of the modern dance genre in Finland. The Finnish media gave the visit considerable publicity, and this analysis of the reception of the Graham Company shows how critics, influenced by a climate of receptivity to Western cultural ideas and a domestic critique of Finnish free dance as undevelopedas well as by Graham's carefully planned publicity and promotional materialsresponded to Graham as a legend of dance.

Vertical profiles of spectral upwelling radiance in the range 8-50 mu m were measured in clear and cloudy conditions from the surface up to 6 km. The clear sky profiles highlight the strong dependence of radiative fluxes to the temperature inversion typical of the Arctic. Measurements acquired for total column water vapour from 1.5 to 10.5mm also underline the sensitivity of the far-infrared greenhouse effect to specific humidity. The cloudy cases show that optically thin ice clouds increase the cooling rate of the atmosphere, making them important pieces of the Arctic energy balance. One such cloud exhibited a very complex spatial structure, characterized by large horizontal heterogeneities at the kilometre scale. This emphasizes the difficulty of obtaining representative cloud observations with airborne measurements but also points out how challenging it is to model polar clouds radiative effects. These radiance measurements were successfully compared to simulations, suggesting that state-of-the-art radiative transfer models are suited to study the cold and dry Arctic atmosphere. Although FIRR in situ performances compare well to its laboratory performances, complementary simulations show that upgrading the FIRR radiometric resolution would greatly increase its sensitivity to atmospheric and cloud properties. Improved instrument temperature stability in flight and expected technological progress should help meet this objective. The campaign overall highlights the potential for airborne far-infrared radiometry and constitutes a relevant reference for future similar studies dedicated to the Arctic and for the development of spaceborne instruments.","[Libois, Quentin; Ivanescu, Liviu; Blanchet, Jean-Pierre; Girard, Eric] Univ Quebec, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ivanescu, Liviu] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Applicat & Rech Teledetect CARTEEL, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Schulz, Hannes; Herber, Andreas B.] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Bozem, Heiko] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Leaitch, W.

Cognitive impairment is considered to be one of the main causes of work safety accidents under high temperatures. However, there is still no sufficient physiological basis for the damage of high temperature to cognitive performance. EEG is a potential physiological indicator that reflects cognitive performance. Nevertheless, no relevant research on the effects of extreme high indoor temperatures exceeding 35 degrees C on EEG has been found. In this study, a climate chamber simulation experiment was conducted, and the neutral temperature was set at 26 degrees C and the extreme high indoor temperature at 39 degrees C. In the experiment, the subjects completed 6 cognitive tests in the sitting position, and the EEG signals of 14 channels were continuously collected during 25-60 min of the experiment. Based on the analysis of the power of the EEG signals, the effects of extreme high indoor temperature on EEG are investigated in this study. The results showed that, on the one hand, the EEG relative power of delta-band of whole brain increased significantly at 39 degrees C, while the EEG relative power of beta-band of whole brain decreased significantly during certain experimental periods. On the other hand, the accuracy of Overlapping test also decreased significantly at 39 degrees C.

During operation at high temperatures, stresses are induced by the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the ceramic TBC and the metallic substrate. As a consequence cracks can grow, propagate and finally lead to a spallation of the top coat. Using atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), so-called self-healing MoSi2 particles can be incorporated into the YSZ matrix to mitigate the propagation of cracks leading to a lifetime gain and possibly higher temperature capability of the TBC. In the present work, the healing process is realized by the oxidation of the self-healing particles, which introduces a volume expansion by a formation of reaction products, which can seal the cracks. The self-healing particles were introduced within the first 150 mu m of the YSZ coating matrix immediately on top of the bond coat. The degradation and lifetime of such systems were studied in furnace cycling and in burner rig tests, in which a temperature gradient through the sample was applied. The lifetime of the self-healing coatings was then compared to the lifetime of an YSZ coating without self-healing particles. In burner rig tests a clear lifetime extension of the self-healing TBCs was observed. The origin of this different behavior was investigated by microstructural analysis in scanning electron microscopy. A further insight into the failure mechanisms was gained by the analysis of a self-healing TBC cycled in a furnace cycling test only for about 55% of its expected lifetime.","[Koch, Denise; Mack, Daniel E.; Vassen, Robert] Forschungszentrum Julich, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Inst Energy & Climate Res, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Koch, D (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 1, Frau Dr Denise Koch, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",d.koch@fz-juelich.de; d.e.mack@fz-juelich.de; r.vassen@fz-juelich.de,,,European Union [309849];  [? 309849],European Union(European Commission); ,"The authors would like to thank Frank Kurze and Karl-Heinz Rau-wald for their support during the manufacture of the thermally sprayed samples and Dr. Doris Sebold for the SEM analysis of the coatings (all Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Materials Synthesis and Processing (IEK-1) , Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH) .

With sufficiently large forcing of heat, the direction of fluid flow in the loop oscillates chaotically, dynamics analogous to the Earth's weather. As is the case for state-of-the-art weather models, we only observe the statistics over a small region of state space, making prediction difficult. To overcome this challenge, data assimilation (DA) methods, and specifically ensemble methods, use the computational model itself to estimate the uncertainty of the model to optimally combine these observations into an initial condition for predicting the future state. Here, we build and verify four distinct DA methods, and then, we perform a twin model experiment with the computational fluid dynamics simulation of the loop using the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) to assimilate observations and predict flow reversals. We show that using adaptively shaped localized covariance outperforms static localized covariance with the ETKF, and allows for the use of less observations in predicting flow reversals. We also show that a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) of the temperature and velocity fields recovers the low dimensional system underlying reversals, finding specific modes which together are predictive of reversal direction.","[Reagan, Andrew J.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.] Univ Vermont, Dept Math & Stat, Vermont Complex Syst Ctr, Computat Story Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Reagan, Andrew J.; Dubief, Yves; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.] Univ Vermont, Vermont Adv Comp Core, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Dubief, Yves] Univ Vermont, Sch Engn, Vermont Complex Syst Ctr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont; University of Vermont; University of Vermont,"Reagan, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Math & Stat, Vermont Complex Syst Ctr, Computat Story Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Reagan, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Vermont Adv Comp Core, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",andrew.reagan@uvm.edu,,,Vermont Space Grant Consortium; NASA EPSCoR; NSF-DMS [0940271]; Mathematics & Climate Research Network; Vermont Advanced Computing Center,Vermont Space Grant Consortium; NASA EPSCoR(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF-DMS(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Mathematics & Climate Research Network; Vermont Advanced Computing Center,"This work was made possible by funding from the Vermont Space Grant Consortium, NASA EPSCoR, NSF-DMS Grant No. 0940271, the Mathematics & Climate Research Network and the Vermont Advanced Computing Center.",,34,2,3,1,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,5-Feb,2016,2,,,,,,e0148134,10.1371/journal.pone.0148134,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0148134,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DC9PR,26849061,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000369554000042,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the current study, we investigated the dynamics of fish metacommunities in two intermittent streams (Hickory Creek and Clear Creek) in north Texas, USA, by examining changes in diversity, abundance, assemblage structure and temporal stability associated with prolonged seasonal drought and reconnectivity. Diversity (and ), abundance and stability increased with initial isolation during summer drought but dramatically declined as drought or drying persisted through the winter (November-December). During post-drought reconnectivity in Hickory Creek, diversity and abundance increased and approached pre-drought levels. Abundance and body size varied greatly among species and indicated species-specific responses (i.e. mortality, recruitment, dispersal) to hydrologic fragmentation and connectivity. Ultimately, assemblage structures were significantly altered by drought in Hickory and Clear creeks, and despite a trend towards recovery in Hickory Creek, assemblages did not fully recover during the present study. Intermittent-stream fishes may be generally adapted to natural drought dynamics; however, climate change and human-mediated habitat alterations may result in prolonged and intensified drought conditions that exceed many species mechanisms of resistance or resilience having potentially large impacts on biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales.","[Driver, Lucas J.; Hoeinghaus, David J.] Univ North Texas, Dept Biol Sci, 1155 Union Circle 310559, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Driver, Lucas J.; Hoeinghaus, David J.] Univ North Texas, Inst Appl Sci, 1155 Union Circle 310559, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Driver, LJ (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Biol Sci, 1155 Union Circle 310559, Denton, TX 76203 USA.;Driver, LJ (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Inst Appl Sci, 1155 Union Circle 310559, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",lucasdriver@my.unt.edu,,"Driver, Lucas/0000-0003-2549-1849",University of North Texas College of Art and Sciences graduate student support grants; National Science Foundation [CBET-1039172]; University of North Texas Office of Research and Economic Development,University of North Texas College of Art and Sciences graduate student support grants; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of North Texas Office of Research and Economic Development,"We thank R.

Conservation of energy at the expense of ventilation in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems adversely affects IAQ. Extensive use of new materials in building, fitting, and refurbishing emit various pollutants such that the indoor environment creates its own discomfort and health risks. Various schools in Kuwait were selected to assess their IAQ. Comprehensive measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) consisting of 72 organic compounds consisting of aliphatic (C-3-C-6), aromatic (C-6-C-9), halogenated (C-1-C-7), and oxygenated (C-2-C-9) functional groups in indoor air were made for the first time in schools in Kuwait. The concentrations of indoor air pollutants revealed hot spots (science preparation rooms, science laboratories, arts and crafts classes/paint rooms, and woodworking shops/decoration rooms where local sources contributed to the buildup of pollutants in each school. The most abundant VOC pollutant was chlorodifluoromethane (R22; CIF2CH), which leaked from air conditioning (AC) systems due to improper operation and maintenance. The other copious VOCs were alcohols and acetone at different locations due to improper handling of the chemicals and their excessive uses as solvents. Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were measured, and these levels reflected the performance of HVAC systems; a specific rate or lack of ventilation affected the IAQ. Recommendations are proposed to mitigate the buildup of indoor air pollutants at school sites.","[Al-Awadi, Layla] Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Environm Pollut & Climate Program, Environm & Life Sci Res Ctr, POB 24885, Safat 13109, Kuwait",Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research,"Al-Awadi, L (corresponding author), Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Environm Pollut & Climate Program, Environm & Life Sci Res Ctr, POB 24885, Safat 13109, Kuwait.",lawadi@kisr.edu.kw,,,Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS); KISR; KFAS [2006-1401-06],Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)(Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)); KISR; KFAS(Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)),The author would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS) and KISR for funding this research project and the KISR team for the execution of this work.

The model is based on 16 years of data from Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest Madagascar. The parameters in the stage-classified life cycle were estimated using mark-recapture methods. Statistical models were evaluated using information-theoretic techniques and multi-model inference. The highest ranking model is time-invariant, but the averaged model includes rainfall-dependence of survival and breeding. We used a time-series model of rainfall to construct a stochastic demographic model. The time-invariant model and the stochastic model give a population growth rate of about 0.98. Bootstrap confidence intervals on the growth rates, both deterministic and stochastic, include 1. Growth rates are most elastic to changes in adult survival. Many demographic statistics show a nonlinear response to annual rainfall but are depressed when annual rainfall is low, or the variance in annual rainfall is high. Perturbation analyses from both the time-invariant and stochastic models indicate that recruitment and survival of older females are key determinants of population growth rate.","[Lawler, Richard R.] Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lawler, Richard R.; Caswell, Hal] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Richard, Alison F.] Univ Cambridge, Vice Chancellors Off, Cambridge, England; [Ratsirarson, Joelisoa] Univ Antananarivo, ESSA, Dept Eaux & Forets, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Dewar, Robert E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Cambridge CB2 3DZ, England; [Schwartz, Marion] Yale Univ, Dept Anthropol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Boston University; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Cambridge; University Antananarivo; University of Cambridge; Yale University,"Lawler, RR (corresponding author), James Madison Univ, Dept Anthropol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",rlawler@bu.edu,,"Caswell, Hal/0000-0003-4394-6894","National Science Foundation [DBI 0305074, DEB 0531988]; NSF [DEB-0343820]; NOAA [NA03NMF4720491]; Ocean Life Institute",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Ocean Life Institute,"We thank the government of Madagascar and ANGAP authorities for permission to conduct this research.

But there is another side to the topic that has received relatively little attention. Bellini was formed within a climate of passionate involvement with letter forms, both antique and those developed within the active book production of Renaissance Venice. Analyzed here are the specific forms of the letters used by Bellini in his signatures, concentrating on the italic, or cursive, signature. This signature type emerges rather late in Bellini's career, first seen - it is argued here - in Bellini's portrait of Pietro Bembo in the Royal Collection of Her Majesty the Queen. The connection between Pietro Bembo and Aldus Manutius, the publishing genius who put cursive letters in the service of a new type of humanist book, is seen as a key component of the dynamic that led to the change in Bellini's signature style.","Natl Gallery Art, Dept Sculpture & Decorat Arts, Washington, DC 20565 USA",,"Pincus, D (corresponding author), Natl Gallery Art, Dept Sculpture & Decorat Arts, Washington, DC 20565 USA.",,,,,,,,94,12,12,0,5,IRSA PUBLISHING HOUSE,KRAKOW,"PLAC MATEJKI 7-8, KRAKOW, 31-157, POLAND",0391-9064,,,ARTIBUS HIST,Artibus Hist.,,2008,58,,,,89,119,,,,,,31,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,V11WU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000207562500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results show that warm (cold) tropical Atlantic SST (TASST) during May tends to be followed by a strong (weak) EASM with positive (negative) precipitation anomalies over the subtropical frontal area. Evidence is also provided that the atmospheric teleconnections propagating in both east and west directions are the key mechanisms linking the EASM with the preceding May TASST. That is, the warm TASST anomaly during late spring can persist through the subsequent summer, which, in turn, induces the Gill-type Rossby wave response in the eastern Pacific, exciting the westward relay of the Atlantic signal, as well as the eastward propagation of the Rossby wave along the jet stream. Furthermore, the westward (eastward) propagating teleconnection signal may induce the anomalous anticyclone in the lower troposphere over the Philippine Sea (anomalous tropospheric anticyclone with barotropic structure over the Okhotsk Sea). The anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the Philippine Sea (Okhotsk Sea) brings warm and humid (cold) air to higher latitudes (lower latitudes). These two different types of air mass merge over the Baiu-Meiyu-Changma region, causing the enhanced subtropical frontal rainfall. To support the observational findings, CMIP5 historical simulations are also utilized. Most state-of-the-art CMIP5 models can simulate this relationship between May TASST and the EASM.","[Choi, Yeon-Woo; Ahn, Joong-Bae] Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, 2,Busandaehak Ro 63beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Ahn, JB (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, 2,Busandaehak Ro 63beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea.",jbahn@pusan.ac.kr,,"Choi, Yeon-Woo/0000-0002-3400-6705",,,,,54,13,13,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Intriguingly, bacterioplankton can be de novo B1 synthesizers or B1 auxotrophs, which cannot synthesize B1 de novo and require exogenous B1 or B1 precursors to survive. Recent isolate-based work suggests select abundant bacterioplankton are B1 auxotrophs, but direct evidence of B1 auxotrophy among natural communities is scant. In addition, it is entirely unknown if bulk bacterioplankton growth is ever B1-limited. We show by surveying for B1-related genes in estuarine, marine, and freshwater metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that most naturally occurring bacterioplankton are B1 auxotrophs. Pyrimidine B1-auxotrophic bacterioplankton numerically dominated metagenomes, but multiple other B1-auxotrophic types and distinct uptake and B1-salvaging strategies were also identified, including dual (pyrimidine and thiazole) and intact B1 auxotrophs that have received little prior consideration. Time-series metagenomes from the Baltic Sea revealed pronounced shifts in the prevalence of multiple B1-auxotrophic types and in the B1-uptake and B1salvaging strategies over time. Complementarily, we documented B1/precursor limitation of bacterioplankton production in three of five nutrient-amendment experiments at the same time-series station, specifically when intact B1 concentrations were <= 3.7 pM, based on bioassays with a genetically engineered Vibrio anguillarum B1-auxotrophic strain. Collectively, the data presented highlight the prevalent reliance of bacterioplankton on exogenous B1/precursors and on the bioavailability of the micronutrients as an overlooked factor that could influence bacterioplankton growth and succession and thereby the cycling of nutrients and energy in aquatic systems.","[Paerl, Ryan W.; Tan, Demeng; Riemann, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark; [Paerl, Ryan W.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Sundh, John] Stockholm Univ, Natl Bioinformat Infrastruct Sweden, Sci Life Lab, Dept Biochem & Biophys, S-17121 Solna, Sweden; [Sundh, John; Andersson, Anders F.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sci Life Lab, Dept Gene Technol, S-17121 Solna, Sweden; [Svenningsen, Sine L.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Biomol Sci Sect, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hylander, Samuel; Pinhassi, Jarone] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst, SE-39182 Kalmar, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; Stockholm University; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Copenhagen; Linnaeus University,"Paerl, RW (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark.;Paerl, RW (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",rpaerl@ncsu.edu,"Svenningsen, Sine Lo/M-7925-2014; Riemann, Lasse/J-7091-2014","Svenningsen, Sine Lo/0000-0001-7322-2681; Riemann, Lasse/0000-0001-9207-2543; Paerl, Ryan/0000-0003-3980-8181; Andersson, Anders/0000-0002-3627-6899; Pinhassi, Jarone/0000-0002-6405-1347; Tan, Demeng/0000-0003-0082-1848","Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS) Blueprint project - European Union [Art 185]; Danish Council for Strategic Research; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS); Swedish Research Council FORMAS [215-2012-1319]","Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS) Blueprint project - European Union; Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas)","We thank Sachia Jo Traving and Elisabeth Munster Happel for assistance with whole-water incubations; Emil Skov Schluter for assistance with auxotrophy screening of Baltic Sea isolates; Emil Fridolfsson, Carina Bunse, and Kristofer Bergstrom for laboratory assistance at Linnaeus University; Johannes Alneberg for bioinformatics support; and Hans Paerl for comments on the manuscript.

Here, we present a sediment-based environmental reconstruction of surface water productivity, salinity and bottom water oxygen for the past 5400 years at GAyensfjarden, a coastal site in SE Sweden. As proxies, we use dinoflagellate cysts, benthic foraminifera, organic carbon (C-org), biogenic silica (BSi), C-org/N-tot, C-org/P-tot, Ti/Al, K/Al and grain size distribution. The chronology of the sediment sequence is well constrained, based on Pb-210, Cs-137 and AMS C-14 dates. Between 3400 and 2100 BCE, isostatic conditions favored enhanced deep water exchange between GAyensfjarden and the open Baltic Sea. At that time, GAyensfjarden was characterized by relatively high productivity and salinity, as well as frequently occurring hypoxic-anoxic bottom water, despite the relatively large connection with the Baltic Sea. The most severe interval of oxygen depletion is recorded between 2400 and 2100 BCE, and appears to coincide with a similar hypoxic event in the Gotland Basin in the open Baltic Sea. As regional climate became wetter and colder between 2100 BCE and 700 BCE, salinity declined and bottom water oxygen conditions improved. Throughout the record, grain size, Ti/Al and K/Al data indicate an evolution towards a more enclosed coastal system, as suggested by reconstructions of the post-glacial shoreline regression. GAyensfjarden shifted to close to modern conditions after 700 BCE, and was characterized by less hypoxia and lower salinity compared with 3400-700 BCE. The timing of the shift corresponds with the Sub-Boreal/Sub-Atlantic transition in Europe. Human-induced erosion in the catchment is observed as early as 600 CE, and is particularly prominent since regional copper mining activity increased around 1700 CE. A sharp increase in sediment C-org concentration is recorded since the 1950s, indicating significant anthropogenic impact on biogeochemical cycles in the coastal zone, as observed elsewhere in the Baltic Sea.","[Ning, Wenxin; Ghosh, Anupam; Khan, Mansoor; Conley, Daniel J.; Filipsson, Helena L.] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Solvegatan12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Ghosh, Anupam] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Ctr Adv Study, Kolkata 700032, India; [Jilbert, Tom; Slomp, Caroline P.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, POB 80-021, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Jilbert, Tom] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Nyberg, Johan] Geol Survey Sweden, Box 670, S-75128 Uppsala, Sweden",Lund University; Jadavpur University; Utrecht University; University of Helsinki,"Ning, WX (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Solvegatan12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",wenxin.ning@geol.lu.se; anupam.ghosh@gmail.com; tom.jilbert@helsinki.fi; c.p.slomp@uu.nl; mansoorswati@yahoo.com; johan.nyberg@sgu.se; daniel.conley@geol.lu.se; helena.filipsson@geol.lu.se,"Ghosh, Anupam/AAK-4306-2020; Slomp, Caroline P/A-9406-2012; Jilbert, Tom/AAL-2273-2021; Filipsson, Helena L/F-7419-2011","Slomp, Caroline P/0000-0002-7272-0109; Filipsson, Helena L/0000-0001-7200-8608; Conley, Daniel Joseph/0000-0001-9668-9284",FORMAS Strong Research Environment: Managing Multiple Stressors in the Baltic Sea [217-2010-126]; Crafoord Foundation; Royal Physiographic Society in Lund; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO Vidi) [86405.004]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO ERC) [278364]; BONUS [Art 185]; EU; FORMAS; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SWAM),FORMAS Strong Research Environment: Managing Multiple Stressors in the Baltic Sea; Crafoord Foundation; Royal Physiographic Society in Lund; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO Vidi)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO ERC); BONUS; EU(European Commission); FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SWAM),"We thank the captain and crew of R/V Ocean Surveyor for help during sampling.

However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the literature on the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies is still missing. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to better understand the knowledge base in the field energy efficiency technology diffusion in the European residential building stock. After the scanning and screening process, we identified 954 scientific articles pertinent to this topic. Through a co-citation network analysis, we generated a visual knowledge structure of the field and by the further investigation of the bibliography we were able to synthesize the state-of-the-art and answer to our initial research questions. Results of the co-citation network show a scattered and fragmented field in many domains. The descriptive analysis highlights this fragmentation, especially on a cross-country level among EU country members. Findings from this study contribute to map the scientific knowledge base in relation to technology diffusion in European residential building projects, identify relevant topic areas, visualize the links between the topics, as well as to recognize research gaps and opportunities.

A look at the plan of old houses in Iran as well as other countries in the region show that the structure of buildings are formed around the yard with several strategies. Solar radiation entering the courtyard space is received by different surfaces and will affect the thermal conditions of the buildings. The amount of received radiation generally depends on several factors including climatic conditions, location, orientation, the surrounding environment, proportion, the time during the year and the form of the courtyard. The absorbed solar radiation will increase the surface temperatures and consequently the temperature of the adjacent zones will be affected. This effect on thermal conditions in the courtyard space is reflected on the thermal behavior of the surrounding spaces. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure an optimum amount of shadow and irradiation in the courtyard space for an efficient courtyard performance through the year. It is evident that this can be achieved through properly configuring and proportioning the courtyard's form and surfaces. Using an improper pattern not only will cause poor courtyard performance but will also increase the cooling and heating loads of the building because of the existence of too much shadow when solar radiation is needed or receiving plenty of irradiation when it is not desirable. The courtyard building is suitable for use and enjoyable if special arrangements are made in the design of the building. This includes the internal envelope's finishing and materials, as well as the proportions of the physical parameters of the courtyard form, which are the most important element and the focus of the present study. Dezful is one of the cities of Khuzestan province in southwestern Iran which is located on latitude 32 degrees 22' north and 48 degrees 24' east. This city has severe summer climate conditions and on some days the temperature reaches 52 degree centigrade. In traditional buildings of Dezful, different passive design strategies have been used to control climate conditions and obtain thermal comfort inside the building. One of these strategies is creating a micro climate condition by using courtyards as a design pattern. For the present study, 15 cases of the courtyards in traditional buildings of Dezful have been selected. Generally, when more solar radiation is received in building, solar heat gain would be greater. Since solar radiation is the only thermal factor considered in this study, cooling loads for building is referred to the variation in the obtained solar radiation. Two different indices have been used to classify cases. These indices have been introduced as N1 (ratio of width to length of the courtyard) which defines elongation of form and N2 (ratio of length to height of courtyard) which shows the depth of form. From each classification, one case is selected and used for this study. The investigated cases have been modeled using three-dimensional simulation by Townscope software. An image processing is used to calculate the amount of shadows in different proportions on courtyard surface levels by Imagej software. The amounts of shadows have been measured in different months of the year on vertical and horizontal surfaces. Generally, in summer, the solar radiation received by horizontal surfaces is more than that obtained when the surface is vertical. Therefore, shadows on vertical and horizontal surfaces ave been measured separately. The total amount of shadows of each sample has been compared in the research with the climate requirement table of Dezful and the best sample regarding the needed periods for irradiation and shadow have been introduced. The optimum ratios of a courtyard building are defined as that which ensures minimum energy requirement throughout the year to achieve comfort in the building. Results show that courtyards with length to width ratio of 1 to 1.4 (near to square form) and height to length ratio of 1.1 to 1.2 had the most proper shade on different courtyard surfaces. Results also showed that for the purpose of reducing the cooling load in summer, deep and square shape courtyard forms were the most preferable. The self- shading of the courtyard building acts to reduce the need for cooling by an average of about 4%. By using this proportion, the amount of shadow on the courtyard will be optimized. This will accordingly result in reducing the temperature of the walls - what would help the cooling load in summer and also maintain warmth in winter. Courtyards with suggested proportion in buildings make great advantages for thermal condition of building. However, it must be mentioned that this passive strategy is not enough for achieving thermal comfort in building. Rather, a series of other strategies must be used to create more favorable thermal condition. They include thermal mass, proper insulation, good orientation and ventilation.","[Taban, Mohsen; Pourjafar, Mohamad Reza; Bemanian, Mohamad Reza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Heidari, Shahin] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University; University of Tehran,"Taban, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",mhsntaban@yahoo.com; pourja_m@modares.ac.ir; bemanian@modares.ac.ir; shheidary@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 3, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,DEC,2014,27,,,,37,46,,,,,,10,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH0RX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000450015100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The COSMO-ART model system has been extended and applied for a large part of Europe and adjacent waters within this investigation. For the radiation calculations, we determined the sea salt optical properties based on Mie calculations, giving the optical properties for the three sea salt modes and eight spectral intervals. The simulated sea salt aerosol optical depth is found to show strong dependence on the 10 m wind speed under cloud-free conditions. This relation is best represented by a power law fit and compares well with satellite observations. For clear-sky conditions, the simulated sea salt direct radiative effects on the shortwave and longwave radiative budgets are approximately of the same order of magnitude, but with opposite signs. This causes the net radiative effect to approach zero, which leads to a low impact on the temperature for this area. Citation: Lundgren, K., B. Vogel, H. Vogel, and C.

Traditionally, such risk assessments provide estimates of loss of life and economic damage. However, the effect of policy measures aimed at reducing risk also depends on the capacity of households to adapt and respond to floods, which in turn largely depends on their social vulnerability. This study shows how a joint assessment of hazard, exposure and social vulnerability provides valuable information for the evaluation of FRM strategies. The adopted Methodology uses data on hazard and exposure combined with a social vulnerability index. The relevance of this state-of-the-art approach taken is exemplified in a case-study of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The results show that not only a substantial share of the population can be defined as socially vulnerable, but also that the population is very heterogeneous, which is often ignored in traditional flood risk management studies.

Though born of a vulnerability specific to white, European bodies, this headwear's distinctive, recognizable form became an emblem of imperial power for those same bodies. This imperial connotation propelled the helmet into dress practices on the other side of the colonial divide, where West African consumers brought further layers of semantic complexity to this headwear's colonial connotations. A select few West Africans wore pith helmets to signify their status as adjuncts to the French administration, thus extending that power. Others took up the pith helmet in defiance of French sartorial norms, bringing its associations with elite status into their own dress systems. Wherever it appeared, the pith helmet alluded to an elsewhere. In France, the helmet conjured the steamy climate of the colonies; in the colonies this headwear invoked the metropole and its administration of colonial subjects. My analysis demonstrates the complex roles of this key element of colonial material culture, which moved between colony to metropole, both projecting European power and revealing the precarity of that power.","[Rovine, Victoria L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Art & Art Hist, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Rovine, VL (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Art & Art Hist, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",vrovine@unc.edu,,,,,,,84,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1359-1835,1460-3586,,J MAT CULT,J.

The analysis of a UWS's performance across interdependent subsystems benefits from a multi-model approach where different designs are tested against a variety of metrics and in different times scales for each subsystem. In this work, we present a stress-testing framework for UWSs that assesses the system's resilience, i.e., the degree to which a UWS continues to perform under progressively increasing disturbance (deviation from normal operating conditions). The framework is underpinned by a modeling chain that covers the entire water cycle, in a source-to-tap manner, coupling a water resources management model, a hydraulic water distribution model, and a water demand generation model. An additional stochastic simulation module enables the representation and modeling of uncertainty throughout the water cycle. We demonstrate the framework by stress-testing a synthetic UWS case study with an ensemble of scenarios whose parameters are stochastically changing within the UWS simulation timeframe and quantify the uncertainty in the estimation of the system's resilience.","[Nikolopoulos, Dionysios; Kossieris, Panagiotis; Tsoukalas, Ioannis; Makropoulos, Christos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Heroon Polytech 5, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Nikolopoulos, D (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Heroon Polytech 5, Athens 15780, Greece.",nikolopoulosdio@central.ntua.gr; pkossier@mail.ntua.gr; itsoukal@mail.ntua.gr; cmakro@mail.ntua.gr,,"Nikolopoulos, Dionysios/0000-0002-3934-4746","project A resilience assessment framework for water supply infrastructure under long-term uncertainty: A Source-to-Tap methodology integrating state of the art computational tools [MIS 5049174]; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) by the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020","project A resilience assessment framework for water supply infrastructure under long-term uncertainty: A Source-to-Tap methodology integrating state of the art computational tools; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) by the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020","This research is carried out/funded in the context of the project A resilience assessment framework for water supply infrastructure under long-term uncertainty: A Source-to-Tap methodology integrating state of the art computational tools (MIS 5049174) under the call for proposals Researchers' support with an emphasis on young researchers-2nd Cycle.

In the absence of such legislation, the Clean Air Act is a potentially effective vehicle for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Decisions regarding existing stationary sources will have the greatest effect on emissions reductions. Although the magnitude of reductions is uncertain, it is plausible that a 10 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels could be achieved at moderate costs by 2020. This is comparable to domestic emissions reductions that would have been achieved under the Waxman-Markey legislation. These measures do not include the switching of fuels, which could yield further reductions. The ultimate cost of regulation under the Act hinges on the stringency of standards and the flexibility allowed. A broad-based tradable performance standard is legally plausible and would provide incentives comparable to the proposed legislation, at least in the near term.","[Burtraw, Dallas; Fraas, Art; Richardson, Nathan] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Burtraw, D (corresponding author), Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",burtraw@rff.org; fraas@rff.org; richardson@rff.org,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

In order to maintain the computational viability of these models for large-scale application cases, temporal aggregation has emerged as a technique for reducing the number of considered time steps by reducing the original time horizon down to fewer, more representative ones.This study presents advanced but generally applicable clustering techniques that allow for ad-hoc improvements of current approaches without requiring profound knowledge of the individual energy system model. These improvements comprise a method to find the optimal tradeoff between the number of typical days and inner-daily temporal resolutions, and a representation method that can reproduce the value distribution of the original time series. We prove the superiority of these approaches by applying them to two fundamentally different model types and benchmarking them against state-of-the-art approaches. This is performed for a variety of temporal resolutions, which leads to many hundreds of model runs.The results show that the proposed improvements on current methods strictly dominate the status quo with respect to Pareto-optimality in terms of runtime and accuracy. Although a speeding up factor of one magnitude could be achieved using traditional aggregation methods within a cost deviation range of two percent, the algorithms proposed herein achieve this accuracy with a runtime speedup by a factor of two orders of magnitude.","[Hoffmann, Maximilian; Kotzur, Leander; Stolten, Detlef] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Technoecon Syst Anal IEK 3, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Hoffmann, Maximilian; Stolten, Detlef] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Fuel Cells, Aachen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University,"Hoffmann, M (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Technoecon Syst Anal IEK 3, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52428 Julich, Germany.",max.hoffmann@fz-juelich.de,,"Hoffmann, Maximilian/0000-0003-1232-8110",Federal Ministry for Economic Af-fairs and Climate Action of Germany as part of the METIS project [03ET4064A],Federal Ministry for Economic Af-fairs and Climate Action of Germany as part of the METIS project,Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Af-fairs and Climate Action of Germany as part of the METIS project (project number: 03ET4064A) .,,117,1,1,11,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

In the present work we employ density functional theory to examine a variety of two-dimensional materials, including, carbon based materials, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2) and layered oxides, to give an overview of the trends in adsorption energies. By examining key reaction intermediates relevant to the oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution reactions we find that binding energies largely follow the linear scaling relationships observed for pure metals. This observation is very important as it suggests that the same simplifying assumptions made to correlate descriptors with reaction rates in transition metal catalysts are also valid for the studied two-dimensional materials. By means of these scaling relations, for each reaction we also identify several promising candidates that are predicted to exhibit a comparable activity to the state-of-the-art catalysts.

Saline irrigation water is a major problem in the basin. The Elm Fork Creek flows through salt deposits, making the creek and its receiving stream, the North Fork River, too saline to use for irrigation. This greatly reduces the number of hectares that can be utilized for agricultural crops within the basin. A baseline SWAT model was setup, calibrated and validated to simulate streamflow and wheat and cotton yields. The SWAT model and a regression equation were used to analyze variable weather impacts on crop yields and salinity levels. Using the weather generator WXGEN and 58 years of observed weather data, ten 50-year weather datasets were generated. Output from the weather generator was input into the calibrated SWAT model to simulate wheat and dryland and irrigated cotton yields for the ten weather scenarios. Using an empirical relationship between ionic strength and streamflow, salinity levels were estimated. Though the crop yields varied greatly from year to year, the yields were not significantly different over the 50-year simulation period. The electrical conductivity (EC, expressed in decisiemens per meter or dS/m) at the US Geological Survey gage station just downstream of the salt deposits was significantly different with levels ranging from 40 to 65 dS/m. Though the water in the Elm Fork is much too saline to use for irrigation, the water in the North Fork River may be used as long as the flow rates in the river are greater than 0.60 m(3)/s. In order to optimize the available cropland, a salinity control must be installed upstream of the salt deposits on the Elm Fork Creek.","[Mittelstet, Aaron R.; Storm, Daniel E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Stoecker, Art L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Mittelstet, AR (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",aaron.mittelstet10@okstate.edu; dan.storm@okstate.edu; art.stoecker@okstate.edu,,,,,,,53,12,12,0,22,CHINESE ACAD AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING,BEIJING,"RM 506, 41, MAIZIDIAN ST, CHAOYANG DISTRICT, BEIJING, 100125, PEOPLES R CHINA",1934-6344,1934-6352,,INT J AGR BIOL ENG,Int.

Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight into the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008-2017 using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As a reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the ERA5-HRES fourth-generation reanalysis, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. The (re) analyses generally performed better in winter than in summer, while the opposite was the case for the satellite-based datasets. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The WRF regional convection-permitting climate model showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics.

In the face of climate change and accompanying risks, however, planning in order to achieve this aim becomes increasingly challenging, underlining the need for new and innovative methods. Models potentially integrate a wide range of system knowledge and present scenarios of variables important for any management decision. In the past, however, model development has mainly focused on specific purposes whereas today we are increasingly aware of the need for the whole range of information that can be provided by models. It is therefore assumed helpful to review the various approaches that are available for specific tasks and to discuss how they can be used for future management strategies. Scope Here we develop a concept for the role of models in forest ecosystem management based on historical analyses. Five paradigms of forest management are identified: (1) multiple uses, (2) dominant use, (3) environmentally sensitive multiple uses, (4) full ecosystem approach and (5) eco-regional perspective. An overview of model approaches is given that is dedicated to this purpose and to developments of different kinds of approaches. It is discussed how these models can contribute to goal setting, decision support and development of guidelines for forestry operations. Furthermore, it is shown how scenario analysis, including stand and landscape visualization, can be used to depict alternatives, make long-term consequences of different options transparent, and ease participation of different stakeholder groups and education. Conslusions In our opinion, the current challenge of forest ecosystem management in Europe is to integrate system knowledge from different temporal and spatial scales and from various disciplines. For this purpose, using a set of models with different focus that can be selected from a kind of toolbox according to particular needs is more promising than developing one overarching model, covering ecological, production and landscape issues equally well.","[Pretzsch, H.; Roetzer, Th.; Seifert, St.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Landscape Management, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Grote, R.] Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Reineking, B.] ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Technical University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Pretzsch, H (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Landscape Management, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Am Hochanger 13, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Hans.Pretzsch@lrz.tu-muenchen.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019; Grote, R√ºdiger/A-7350-2013; Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Grote, R√ºdiger/0000-0001-6893-6890; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Reineking, Bjorn/0000-0001-5277-9181",,,,,202,184,188,1,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Therefore, it is crucial that we understand how we can successfully alter our behavior and promote physical distancing. We present a framework to systematically assess the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to stimulate physical distancing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this framework in a large-scale natural experiment (N = 639) conducted during an art fair. In an experimental design, we varied interventions to evaluate the effect of face masks, walking directions, and immediate feedback on visitors' contacts. We represent visitors as nodes, and their contacts as links in a contact network. Subsequently, we used network modelling to test for differences in these contact networks. We find no evidence that face masks influence physical distancing, while unidirectional walking directions and buzzer feedback do positively impact physical distancing. This study offers a feasible way to optimize physical distancing interventions through scientific research. As such, the presented framework provides society with the means to directly evaluate interventions, so that policy can be based on evidence rather than conjecture.","[Blanken, Tessa F.; Tanis, Charlotte C.; Nauta, Floor H.; Dablander, Fabian; van Harreveld, Frenk; de Wit, Sanne; Borsboom, Denny] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zijlstra, Bonne J.

This paper numerically studied the application effect of PCMs as a passive alternative in lightweight building with high shape coefficient for temporary accommodations under Tianjin climate, and the impacts of some key design parameters, such as the location, thickness and orientation, on building's thermal behavior were explored when single orientation layout scheme was adopted. Besides, the multi-orientation layout schemes were put forward to achieve further optimization on indoor thermal comfort. The simulation results stated that the proper application of PCMs could obviously improve and promote indoor thermal comfort. In detail, the results indicated that PCM layer with a reasonable thickness, e.g. 5.0 mm in this paper, which was positioned to the interior surface was recommend when single orientation layout was applied. When incorporating the PCM layer in at least five orientations (S5), the proposed multi-orientation optimization schemes could ensure a comfortable indoor climate under the extreme closed condition without extra mechanical cooling measures. Thereby, the numerical results in this paper support and highlight the potential of using PCMs and multi-orientation optimization in lightweight temporary buildings.","[Zhu, Li; Yang, Yang; Chen, Sarula; Sun, Yong] Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Li; Sun, Yong] APEC Sustainable Energy Ctr, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Sun, Y (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",yong.sun@tju.edu.cn,,"Yang, Yang/0000-0002-4711-9485",Natural Science Foundation of China [51478297];  [B13011],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ,This work was sponsored by Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51478297) and the Programme of Introducing Talents (Grant No. B13011).,,54,28,33,0,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1359-4311,,,APPL THERM ENG,Appl.

The effects of FWF may be represented in ocean modeling as real freshwater flux (RFF) formulations and virtual salt flux (VSF) methods. RFF formulations have been implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5) as a replacement for the non-physical VSF method, which is primarily used in state-of-the-art ocean models. Here, we systematically evaluated the effects of RFF-related processes on the GFDL MOM5-based simulations in the tropical Pacific. When the FWF was treated as the natural boundary condition (NBC), it directly decreased the local temperature and the salinity by changing the volume of the top model layer, and it increased the temperature in the eastern Pacific by triggering an eastward Goldsbrough-Stommel circulation in the subsurface. Moreover, the heat content induced by the FWF tended to counteract the decreasing effects of the NBC on sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western-central tropical Pacific. The relationships between SST perturbations and the FWF representation in ocean modeling are also discussed. (C) 2017 Science China Press.

Originating from the basic physical framework of the Zebiak-Cane (ZC) model, this tropical intermediate couple model (TICM) extends to the entire global tropics, with a surface heat flux parameterization and a surface wind bias correction added to improve model performance and inter-basin connections. The model well reproduces the variabilities in the tropical Pacific and Indian basins. The simulated El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) shows a period of 3-4 years and an amplitude of about 2 degrees C, similar to those observed. The variabilities in the Indian Ocean, including the Indian Ocean basin mode (IOBM) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), are also reasonably captured with a realistic relationship to the Pacific. However, the tropical Atlantic variability in the TICM has a westward bias and is overly influenced by the tropical Pacific. A 47-year hindcast experiment using the TICM for the period of 1970-2016 indicates that ENSO is the most predictable mode in the tropics. Skillful predictions of ENSO can be made one year ahead, similar to the skill of the latest version of the ZC model, while a spring predictability barrier still exists as in other models. In the tropical Indian Ocean, the predictability seems much higher in the west than in the east. The correlation skill of IOD prediction reaches 0.5 at a 5-month lead, which is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models. The prediction of IOD shows a significant winter-spring predictability barrier, implying combined influences from the tropical Pacific and the local sea-air interaction in the eastern Indian Ocean. The TICM has little predictive skill in the equatorial Atlantic for lead times longer than 3 months, which is a common problem of current climate models badly in need of further investigation.","[Song, Xunshu; Chen, Dake] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China; [Song, Xunshu; Chen, Dake; Tang, Youmin; Liu, Ting] Second Inst Oceanog, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dake] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Tang, Youmin] Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada",Zhejiang University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Second Institute of Oceanography (SIO); Columbia University; University of Northern British Columbia,"Chen, DK (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China.;Chen, DK (corresponding author), Second Inst Oceanog, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Chen, DK (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",dchen@sio.org.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41690124, 41690121, 41690120, 41530961, 41705049]; National Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-IPOVAI-06]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction,"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0604202), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41690124, 41690121, 41690120, 41530961 & 41705049) and the National Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction (Grant No. GASI-IPOVAI-06).",,86,6,6,0,10,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7313,1869-1897,,SCI CHINA EARTH SCI,Sci.

A new retrieval of ozone profiles from the measured ozone line spectra has been developed using the inversion software ARTS/Qpack. To validate the new retrieval method it has been compared to ozone profiles measured by ozonesonde and satellite (MLS/AURA). Before May 2001 and after June 2005, the relative difference to ozonesonde is within -5 to 15% depending on the altitude. However, SOMORA and ozonesonde profiles show a difference of up to 30% below 23 km between May 2001 and June 2005, after technical interventions on the instrument, i.e. mixer and front end changes. The new retrieval still has some problems with the instrumental change of 2001 below 23 km but is satisfactory for the change of 2005 where the difference to ozonesonde has been significantly reduced compared to the previous retrieval algorithm. A high difference is shown in summer 2006 which can be related to low tropospheric transmittance during this period. The comparison to MLS on AURA satellite is good before May 2007 with values of -5 to 15% depending on the altitude. The relative difference to satellite ozone profiles show a seasonal cycle with higher values in summer correlated to low tropospheric transmittance.","[Barras, Eliane Maillard; Ruffieux, Dominique] MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Payerne, Switzerland; [Hocke, Klemens] Univ Bern, Inst Appl Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); University of Bern,"Barras, EM (corresponding author), MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Payerne, Switzerland.",eliane.maillard@meteoswiss.ch,,"Hocke, Klemens/0000-0003-2178-9920",Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology Meteoswiss; Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR),Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology Meteoswiss; Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR),This work has been funded by the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology Meteoswiss within the Swiss GAW program.

Most such studies have excluded the impact of pastoralists in shaping grassland ecosystems and, over the last half century, the growing human impact on the world's rangelands. The mounting human impact calls for selecting indicators and integrated monitoring methods able to track ecosystem changes and the role of natural and human agencies. Our study draws on five decades of monitoring the Amboseli landscape in southern Kenya to document the declining role of natural agencies in shaping plant ecology with rising human impact. Results We show that plant diversity and productivity have declined, biomass turnover has increased in response to a downsizing of mean plant size, and that ecological resilience has declined with the rising probability of extreme shortfalls in pasture production. The signature of rainfall and physical agencies in driving ecosystem properties has decreased sharply with growing human impact. We compare the Amboseli findings to the long-term studies of Kruger and Serengeti national parks to show that the human influence, whether by design or default, is increasingly shaping the ecology of savanna ecosystems. We look at the findings in the larger perspective of human impact on African grasslands and the world rangelands, in general, and discuss the implications for ecosystem theory and conservation policy and management. Conclusions The Amboseli study shows the value of using long-term integrated ecological monitoring to track the spatial and temporal changes in the species composition, structure, and function of rangeland ecosystems and the role of natural and human agencies in the process of change. The study echoes the widespread changes underway across African savannas and world's rangelands, concluding that some level of ecosystem management is needed to prevent land degradation and the erosion of ecological function, services, and resilience. Despite the weak application of ecological theory to conservation management, a plant trait-based approach is shown to be useful in explaining the macroecological changes underway.","[Western, David; Mose, Victor N.; Maitumo, David; Mburu, Caroline] African Conservat Ctr, POB 15289-00509, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Mose, VN (corresponding author), African Conservat Ctr, POB 15289-00509, Nairobi, Kenya.",vnmose@gmail.com,"Mose, Victor N./AAT-3677-2021","Mose, Victor N./0000-0001-6859-4667",Wildlife Conservation Society; Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation,Wildlife Conservation Society; Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation,The main donors funding ACP over the years include the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation.,,99,3,3,5,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2192-1709,,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

The state-of-the art SWE membrane, Flemion(R), has excellent chemical resistance to harsh SWE conditions, but still needs to lower its energy consumption by reducing its ohmic resistance to Na(+)ion transport. Meanwhile, most of cation exchange membranes (CEMs) have been suffering from chemical degradation under the alkaline conditions, owing to their single layer matrices composed of sulfonic acid moieties, though they show fast Na(+)ion transport behavior. Here double-layered SWE membranes were prepared on the basis of design strategies composed of the incorporation of a chemically stable carboxylic acid layer (C layer) via UV irradiation onto one surface of perfluorinated Nafion(R)212 membrane chosen as one of commercially available CEMs, and the thickness control of the C layer. The resulting membranes showed excellent SWE performances and improved electrochemical service life, when compared with those of Nafion(R)212 and Flemion(R), respectively.","[Park, In Kee; Lee, Chang Hyun] Dankook Univ, Energy Engn Dept, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Lee, Dong-Hoon] Wonkwang Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Coll Engn, Iksan 54538, Jeonbuk, South Korea",Dankook University; Wonkwang University,"Lee, CH (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Energy Engn Dept, Cheonan 31116, South Korea.",inkee0149@gmail.com; merits98@wku.ac.kr; inkee0149@gmail.com,,"Lee, Dong-Hoon/0000-0002-1599-5122; Park, InKee/0000-0001-7141-6845","Technology Development Program to Innovative Hydrogen Energy of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2019M3E6A1064093]; Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2018M1A2A2063865]","Technology Development Program to Innovative Hydrogen Energy of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","This work was supported by the Technology Development Program to Innovative Hydrogen Energy, and to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (2019M3E6A1064093 and 2018M1A2A2063865), respectively.",,28,0,0,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,SEP,2020,9,,,,,,2114,10.3390/polym12092114,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym12092114,,,13,Polymer Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Polymer Science,OD9FW,32957460,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000580151200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies on high intensive dry mixing of cathode materials have shown significant changes in product properties across the process chain. Despite a decrease in electrical conductivity, due to the fixation of carbon black particles on the active materials' surface, electrochemical results have shown more stable long-term cycling performance of the lithium-ion battery cells. Despite that, no research studies investigating this process for anode materials have been published yet. Therefore, the effect of an intensive dry mixing process, using a ring shear device and state-of-the-art anode materials, on the slurry, electrode, and cell properties is investigated. The tangential velocity and, therefore, the mechanical stress have been varied, as well as the amount of carbon black in the dry mixing process. The results reveal new insights into material interactions between the binder, carbon black, and the active material that can be purposefully modified. Based on the results, an optimum parameter set is suggested, which not only improves the product characteristics across the process chain, but also increases the long-term cycling performance of the battery cells significantly.","[Weber, Marcel; Moschner, Robin; Kwade, Arno] TU Braunschweig, Inst Particle Technol, D-38104 Braunschweig, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology,"Weber, M; Moschner, R (corresponding author), TU Braunschweig, Inst Particle Technol, D-38104 Braunschweig, Germany.",marcel.weber@tu-braunschweig.de; r.moschner@tu-braunschweig.de,,,BMWK -Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action [03ETE017A],BMWK -Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action,"The authors thank the BMWK -Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action for supporting the project DALION 4.0 -Data Mining as Basis for cyber-physical Systems in Production of Lithium-ion Battery Cells (03ETE017A).

The process involves surface treatment of previously anodized SS meshes in different gaseous atmospheres. The activity of the resulted electrocatalysts varies as-anodized SS annealed in oxygen (ASS-O-2) > anodized SS annealed in hydrogen (ASS-H-2) > anodized SS annealed in air (ASS-Air). The ASS-O-2 showed an impressive low overpotential of 280 mV at the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is 120 mV less than that of the as-received SS (SS-AR), and a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. These findings have also been asserted by the estimated electrochemical active surface area, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis, Mott-Schottky analysis, and the calculated turnover frequency, affirming the superiority of the ASS-O-2 electrocatalyst over the ASS-H-2 and ASS-Air counterparts. The high activity of the ASS-O-2 electrocatalyst can be ascribed to the surface composition that is rich in Fe3+ and Ni2+ as revealed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The simple method of anodization and thermal annealing in O-2 at moderate conditions (450 degrees C for 1 h) lead to the formation of a SS mesh-based OER electrocatalyst with activity exceeding that of the state-of-the-art IrO2/RuO2 and other complex modified SS catalysts. These results were also confirmed via density functional theory calculations, which unveiled the OER reaction mechanism and elucidated the d-band center in different SS samples with different oxygen content. The presence of oxygen moved the d-band center closer to the Fermi level in the case of ASS-O-2, explaining its superior activity.","[Gomaa, Aya K.; Shaheen, Basamat S.; Khedr, Ghada E.; Mokhtar, Abdelrahman M.; Allam, Nageh K.] Amer Univ Cairo, Energy Mat Lab EML, Sch Sci & Engn, New Cairo 11835, Egypt; [Khedr, Ghada E.] Egyptian Petr Res Inst EPRI, Dept Evaluat & Anal, Cairo 11727, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute (EPRI),"Allam, NK (corresponding author), Amer Univ Cairo, Energy Mat Lab EML, Sch Sci & Engn, New Cairo 11835, Egypt.",nageh.allam@aucegypt.edu,,"M.

Despite its isolated location and severe desert climate-particularly in terms of solar radiation, sand drift, and sand deposition-the region of El-Oued Souf in the Grand Erg Oriental in the Algerian Sahara has been a key cultural and trade center for many centuries. To resist the extreme weather conditions, the architecture of the vernacular settlements in the region of El-Oued Souf has unique design traits. Newly constructed buildings, on the other hand, frequently employ technologies based on models imported or imposed from climates that bear little resemblance to the desert. As a result, the inhabitants of these structures live more 'in the desert' than 'with the desert'. This study investigates the impact and the effectiveness of vernacular desert architecture to resist aeolian sand encroachment problems in sandy desert areas. The sand accumulation patterns around vernacular buildings were identified and quantified using wind tunnel experiments. The size and shape of the buildings, as well as their geometric configuration within the settlement, were investigated in relation to the shape and dimension of sand accumulation formations. Field observations in north Algeria and the United Arab Emirates confirmed the accumulation patterns produced by the wind tunnel experiments. The study proposes possible design indicators for building forms to minimize the impact of sand deposition on such forms.","[Sherzad, Mohammed Fareed] Ajman Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Dept Architecture, POB 346, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Goossens, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Geo Inst, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Geog & Tourism Res Grp, Celestijnenlaan 200, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Goossens, Dirk] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Ajman University; KU Leuven; Wageningen University & Research,"Sherzad, MF (corresponding author), Ajman Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Dept Architecture, POB 346, Ajman, U Arab Emirates.",msherzad@ajman.ac.ae,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,NOV,2022,11,,,,,,2006,10.3390/buildings12112006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12112006,,,19,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,6V0QZ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000894764100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The energy and climate directives set by the European Union for 2050 call for changes in the building sector, particularly for existing public building stock. This study suggests a design approach and assessment for retrofitting scenarios, which meet energy demands for educational buildings in Cyprus, based on their long-term cost effectiveness. Adaptation measures refer to changes in the geometry, construction, and operation of buildings. The approach combines energy demand modelling through dynamic software simulation using Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES-VE) and retrofit options, ranked by life cycle costing analysis (LCCA). These options may have very different upfront costs, but also very different carbon implications, and they result in different life expectancy predictions. The research findings contributes to delivering novel knowledge in the rather limited literature regarding the implication of adaptation measures on energy performance of educational buildings in the Mediterranean region and especially in correlation to their life-cycle cost. The aim is to give the stakeholders as much information as possible regarding their interventions, so that they can make informed decisions. This information will then be used to develop a framework that may be used more extensively to support decision-making in retrofitting existing educational buildings for climate change resilience.

Glacial atmospheric dust loads were generally greater than those during the Holocene, as shown, for example, by the covariation of dust fluxes in the Equatorial Pacific and Antarctic ice cores. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether these increases in dust flux were associated with changes in sources of dust, which would in turn suggest variations in wind patterns, climate or paleoenvironment. Such questions can be answered using radiogenic isotope tracers of dust provenance. Here, we present a 160-kyr high-precision lead isotope time-series of dust input to the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) from core ODP Leg 138, Site 849 (0 degrees 11.59' N, 110 degrees 31.18' W). The Pb isotope record, combined with Nd isotope data, rules out contributions from Northern Hemisphere dust sources, north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, such as Asia or North Africa/Sahara; similarly, eolian sources in Australia, Central America, the Northern Andes and Patagonia appear insignificant based upon the radiogenic isotope data. Fluctuations in Pb isotope ratios throughout the last 160 kyr show, instead, that South America remained the prevailing source of dusts to the EEP. There are two distinct South American Pb isotope end-members, constrained to be located in the south Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ, 22 degrees S - 27.5 degrees S) and the South Volcanic Zone (SVZ, 33 degrees S - 430 degrees S), with the former most likely originating in the Atacama Desert. Dust availability in the SVZ appears to be related to the weathering of volcanic deposits and the development of ash-derived Andosols, and influenced by local factors that might include vegetation cover. Variations in the dust fluxes from the two sources are in phase with both the dust flux and temperature records from Antarctican ice cores. We show that the forcing of dust provenance over time in the EEP overall is influenced by high-southerly-latitude climate conditions, leading to changes in the latitudinal position and strength of the South Westerlies as well as the coastal winds that blow northward along the Chilean margin. The net result is a modulation of dust emission from the Atacama Desert and the SVZ via a northward migration of the South Westerlies during cold periods and southward retreat during glacial terminations.

This species is not considered particularly anthropophilic: therefore, a low vector risk for human health was considered.

Various threats contribute to the erosion of coffee genetic diversity such as human population pressures leading to conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation and land degradation; low coffee prices leading to abandoning of coffee trees in forests and gardens and shifting cultivation to other more remunerative crops; and climate change. Additionally, the cultivated species of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) has a very narrow genetic base. Increased incidence of pests and diseases associated with climate change is leading to significant crop losses, threatening livelihoods in many coffee growing countries. A comprehensive conservation strategy for coffee should take into account complementary methods of in situ and ex situ conservation. The development of molecular techniques has expanded the possibilities and tools for genetic analysis for efficient conservation and use of coffee genetic resources. Before it is too late, a thorough evaluation of existing germplasm should be performed based upon which a comprehensive conservation strategy could be developed. A case study using four different Coffea species in Madagascar is discussed.","[Krishnan, S.] Denver Bot Gardens, Dept Hort, Denver, CO USA; [Krishnan, S.] Denver Bot Gardens, Ctr Global Initiat, Denver, CO USA; [Ranker, T.

J,"Molteni, F",,,,"Molteni, F",,,Atmospheric simulations using a GCM with simplified physical parametrizations. I: model climatology and variability in multi-decadal experiments,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CIRCULATION; TEMPERATURE; REANALYSIS,"This work describes the formulation and climatology of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, based on a spectral primitive-equation dynamical core and a set of simplified physical parametrization schemes. The parametrization package has been specially designed to work in models with just a few vertical levels, and is based on the same physical principles adopted in the schemes of state-of-the art GCMs. The parametrized processes include large-scale condensation, convection, clouds, short-wave and long-wave radiation, surface fluxes and vertical diffusion. In the current configuration, the model (nicknamed SPEEDY, from Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics) has five vertical levels and a spectral truncation at total wave number 30 (T30L5). The top vertical level (crudely) represents the stratosphere, the bottom one the planetary boundary layer. Computationally, SPEEDY requires (at least) one order of magnitude less CPU time than a state-of-the-art GCM at the same horizontal resolution, and is therefore suitable for studies of inter-decadal or inter-centennial variability. Statistics of the model mean state and variability are computed from an ensemble of 41-year simulations forced by observed sea-surface temperatures in the period 1952-1992. The model mean state is closer to the observed climatology during the (boreal) winter than during summer. In winter (i.e. December to February, DJF), the model underestimates the amplitude of the Northern Hemisphere stationary wave pattern, particularly in the European-Atlantic sector. Some aspects of the systematic error of SPEEDY are in fact typical of many GCMs, although the error amplitude is, stronger than in state-of-the-art models. On the other hand, the global distribution of precipitation in DJF is quite realistic, and compares well with that of more complex GCMs. In summer (June to August), a strong negative bias in the mid-tropospheric temperature generates a Northern Hemisphere circulation with some springtime characteristics. In particular, the position of the Tropical Convergence Zone in the Indian Ocean remains too far south, leading to a deficient simulation of the monsoon circulation over South Asia. The simulated variability during the northern winter is reasonably realistic as far as the spatial distribution is concerned, although some underestimation in the intensity can be found, particularly in the low-frequency range and in the Atlantic sector. The atmospheric response to ENSO events is also weaker than observed, although the spatial patterns of the rainfall and geopotential response in the Pacific sector are in phase with their observed counterparts. In the Atlantic/Eurasian region, the spatial patterns associated with the interdecadal trends in the simulated and observed large-scale circulation show a clear positive correlation, consistent with the hypothesis of a positive ocean-atmosphere feedback on decadal time scales.","Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, I-34014 Trieste, Italy",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),"Molteni, F (corresponding author), Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Strada Costiera 11, I-34014 Trieste, Italy.",moltenif@ictp.trieste.it,,,,,,,25,275,278,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

An optimized configuration of the facade can contribute to reduce the total energy demand of the building. Traditionally, the search for the optimal facade configuration is obtained by analyzing the heating demand and/or the cooling demand only, while the implication of the facade configuration on artificial lighting energy demand is often not addressed. A comprehensive approach (i.e. including heating, cooling and artificial lighting energy demand) is instead necessary to reduce the total energy need of the building and the optimization of the facade configuration becomes no longer straightforward, because non-linear relationships are often disclosed. The paper presents a methodology and the results of the search for the optimal transparent percentage in a facade module for low energy office buildings. The investigation is carried out in a temperate oceanic climate, on the four main orientations, on three versions of the office building and with different HVAC system's efficiency. The results show that, regardless of the orientations and of the facade area of the building, the optimal configuration is achieved when the transparent percentage is between 35% and 45% of the total facade module area. The highest difference between the optimal configuration and the worst one occurs in the north-exposed facade, while the south-exposed facade is the one that shows the smallest difference between the optimal and the worst configuration.

The ocean-particularly the coastal regions-have been recognized to be a net source of CH4, however, the constraints on temporal and spatial resolution of CH4 measurements have been the limiting factor to estimate the total oceanic contributions. In this study, the viability of micrometeorological methods for the analysis of CH4 fluxes in the marine environment was evaluated. We present 1 year of semi-continuous eddy covariance measurements of CH4 atmospheric dry mole fractions and air-sea CH4 flux densities at the Ostergarnsholm station at the east coast of the Gotland Island in the central Baltic Sea. The mean annual CH4 flux density was positive, indicating that the region off Gotland is a net source of CH4 to the atmosphere with monthly mean flux densities ranging between -0.1 and 36 nmol m(-2)s(-1). Both the air-water concentration gradient and the wind speed were found to be crucial parameters controlling the flux. The results were in good agreement with other measurements in the Baltic Sea reported in the MEMENTO database. Our results suggest that the eddy covariance technique is a useful tool for studying CH4 fluxes and improving the understanding of air-sea gas exchange processes with high-temporal resolution. Potentially, the high resolution of micrometeorological data can increase the understanding of the temporal variability and forcing processes of CH4 flux.","[Gutierrez-Loza, Lucia; Wallin, Marcus B.; Sahlee, Erik; Nilsson, Erik; Rutgersson, Anna] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bange, Hermann W.; Kock, Annette] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Marine Biogeochem Res Div, Chem Oceanog Res Unit, Kiel, Germany",Uppsala University; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel,"Gutierrez-Loza, L (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden.",lucia.gutierrez_loza@geo.uu.se,,"Wallin, Marcus/0000-0002-3082-8728; Gutierrez-Loza, Lucia/0000-0003-1575-3796","BONUS (Art 185); EU; Swedish Research Council Formas; Academy of Finland; Estonian Research Council; Polish National Centre for Research and Development; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Swedish Research Council [2012-03902, 2013-02044]; Uppsala University",BONUS (Art 185); EU(European Commission); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Polish National Centre for Research and Development; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Uppsala University,"The BONUS INTEGRAL project receives funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU, the Swedish Research Council Formas, the Academy of Finland, the Estonian Research Council, the Polish National Centre for Research and Development, and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

There are however, few datasets available to address spatial uncertainties, such as the influence of snow microstructure, at scales relevant to space-borne application. In this study we introduce measurements from SnowSAR, an airborne, dual-frequency (9.6 and 17.2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to evaluate high resolution (10 m) backscatter within a snow-covered tundra basin. Coincident in situ surveys at two sites characterize a generally thin snowpack (50 cm) interspersed with deeper drift features. Structure of the snowpack is found to be predominantly wind slab (65%) with smaller proportions of depth hoar underlain (35%). Objective estimates of snow microstructure (exponential correlation length; l(ex)), show the slab layers to be 2.8 times smaller than the basal depth hoar. In situ measurements are used to parametrize the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3&a) and compare against collocated SnowSAR backscatter. The evaluation shows a scaling factor (phi) between 1.37 and 1.08, when applied to input of l(ex), minimizes MEMLS root mean squared error to < 1.1 dB. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrate contrasting contributions from wind slab and depth hoar components, where wind rounded microstructures are identified as a strong control on observed backscatter. Weak sensitivity of SnowSAR to spatial variations in SWE is explained by the smaller contributing microstructures of the wind slab.","[King, Joshua; Derksen, Chris; Toose, Peter] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Langlois, Alexandre] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Applicat & Rech Teledetect, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Larsen, Chris; Sturm, Matthew] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Geophys, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Lemmetyinen, Juha] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Arctic Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Lemmetyinen, Juha] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Marsh, Phil] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Cold Reg Ctr, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Montpetit, Benoit] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlife & Landscape Sci Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Roy, Alexandre] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rutter, Nick] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England","Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Sherbrooke; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS; Wilfrid Laurier University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Universite de Montreal; Northumbria University","King, J (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.",Joshua.King@Canada.ca,"Derksen, Chris/S-9828-2017; Lemmetyinen, Juha/B-3739-2016; Sturm, Matthew/GXF-6926-2022; Rutter, Nick/F-6998-2014","Derksen, Chris/0000-0001-6821-5479; Lemmetyinen, Juha/0000-0003-4434-9696; Rutter, Nick/0000-0002-5008-3575","European Space Agency; University of Alaska Fairbanks; NASA [NNX13AQ90G, NNX15AC09G]; Canadian Space Agency [13MOA07103]; Environment and Climate Change Canada",European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission); University of Alaska Fairbanks; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Canadian Space Agency(Canadian Space Agency); Environment and Climate Change Canada,"Trail Valley Creek activities were supported by the European Space Agency, University of Alaska Fairbanks, NASA (NNX13AQ90G and NNX15AC09G), Canadian Space Agency (13MOA07103), and Environment and Climate Change Canada.

This gap of 3 to 3.5 months between uprooting of nursery plants and ultimate transplanting in the orchard leads to high mortality because of lack of acclimatization. This implies that nursery plants for cold desert areas should be produced locally. Due to the short growing season, prolonged winters and high diurnal temperature variation in cold desert areas, the growing of temperate fruit trees in the nursery under open field conditions is quite difficult, as seedlings cannot attain graftable thickness even after 23 years. To overcome the problem pioneer efforts have been made at University of Horticulture and Forestry, Regional Horticultural Research Sub-Station, Tabo, district Lahaul & Spiti, India by producing locally acclimatized nursery plants of temperate fruits on seedling rootstocks under polyhouses. Owing to difficult growing conditions, the present studies were conducted with the objectives to standardize the most suitable time of tongue grafting and optimize doses of N application for producing good quality nursery plants. These plants are uprooted 3-7 days prior to transplanting in the region, which has resulted in 95-100% field survival rates. Tongue grafting is the commonly used method of propagation. The application of N during June to September after 30 days interval have been found to be effective in achieving best bud-take success, plant height and radial diameter of nursery plants.","[Sharma, D.

Subsurface temperature-depth profile data acquired for Kumamoto Plain, Japan, between 1987 and 2012 were collected and analyzed to elucidate regional groundwater and heat flows. The observed and simulated temperature-depth profiles showed the following: subsurface water flows from northeast to southwest in the study area; the combined influence of surface warming and water flow perturbation produces different temporal changes in thermal profiles in recharge, intermediate, and discharge areas; and aquifer thermal properties contribute more than hydraulic parameters to the perturbation of temperature-depth profiles. Spatial and temporal evolution features of subsurface thermal regimes may be utilized to investigate the influence of surface warming events on subsurface water and heat flows at the basin scale.","[Dong, Linyao; Liu, Jigen; Wang, Yifeng] Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Wuhan 431000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fu, Congsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Yangtze River Water Resources Protection Bureau; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Fu, CS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",csfu@niglas.ac.cn,,"Fu, Congsheng/0000-0001-7838-1323","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1502506, 2017YFC1502502]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41501037]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Special thanks are extended to Professor Taniguchi of the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature and Professor Shimano of the Bunsei University of Art for the provision of the preterit subsurface temperature data used for this research.

We illustrate how understanding current and projected threats to plants and fungi is necessary to manage and mitigate risks, while building awareness of gaps and bias in current assessment coverage is essential to adequately prioritize conservation efforts. We highlight the state of the art in conservation science and point to current methods of assessment and future studies needed to mitigate species extinction. SummaryPlant and fungal biodiversity underpin life on earth and merit careful stewardship in an increasingly uncertain environment. However, gaps and biases in documented extinction risks to plant and fungal species impede effective management. Formal extinction risk assessments help avoid extinctions, through engagement, financial, or legal mechanisms, but most plant and fungal species lack assessments. Available global assessments cover c. 30% of plant species (ThreatSearch). Red List coverage overrepresents woody perennials and useful plants, but underrepresents single-country endemics. Fungal assessments overrepresent well-known species and are too few to infer global status or trends. Proportions of assessed vascular plant species considered threatened vary between global assessment datasets: 37% (ThreatSearch), and 44% (International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species). Our predictions, correcting for several quantifiable biases, suggest that 39% of all vascular plant species are threatened with extinction. However, other biases remain unquantified, and may affect our estimate. Preliminary trend data show plants moving toward extinction. Quantitative estimates based on plant extinction risk assessments may understate likely biodiversity loss: they do not fully capture the impacts of climate change, slow-acting threats, or clustering of extinction risk, which could amplify loss of evolutionary potential. The importance of extinction risk estimation to support existing and emerging conservation initiatives is likely to grow as threats to biodiversity intensify. This necessitates urgent and strategic expansion of efforts toward comprehensive and ongoing assessment of plant and fungal extinction risk.","[Lughadha, Eimear Nic; Bachman, Steven P.; Leao, Tarciso C.

Remote sensing (RS) can support effective monitoring and mapping approaches for tropical forests, and to facilitate this we propose a deep neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture here to classify tropical forests and their environment. To deal with the complexity of tropical landscapes, this method utilizes a multi-scale convolution neural network (CNN) to expand the receptive field and extract multi-scale features. The model refines the features with several attention modules and fuses them through an upsampling module. A two-stage training strategy is proposed to alleviate misclassifications caused by sample imbalances. A joint loss function based on cross-entropy loss and the generalized Dice loss is applied in the first stage, and the second stage used the focal loss to fine-tune the weights. As a case study, we use Hainan tropical reserves to test the performance of this model. Compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation networks, our network achieves the best performance with two Hainan datasets (mean intersection over union (MIoU) percentages of 85.78% and 82.85%). We also apply the new model to classify a public true color dataset which has 17 semantic classes and obtain results with an 83.75% MIoU.

The present review summarizes information concerning C. spinosa L. including agronomic performance, botanical description, taxonomical approaches, traditional pharmacological uses, phytochemical evaluation and genetic studies. This knowledge represents an important tool for further research studies and agronomic development on this indigenous species with respect to the emerging climatic change in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. Indeed, this world region is particularly under the threat of global warming and it appears necessary to rethink agricultural systems to adapt them to current and futures challenging environmental conditions. Capparis spinosa L. could be a part of this approach. So, this review presents a state of the art considering caper as a potential interesting crop under arid or semi-arid regions (such as Eastern Mediterranean countries) within the climate change context. The aim is to raise awareness in the scientific community (geneticists, physiologists, ecophysiologists, agronomists,.) about the caper strengths and interest to the development of this shrub as a crop.","[Chedraoui, Stephanie; Rajjou, Loic] Univ Paris Saclay, Saclay Plant Sci SPS RD10, AgroParisTech, Inst Jean Pierre Bourgin,INRA,CNRS, Versailles, France; [Chedraoui, Stephanie; Abi-Rizk, Alain; El-Beyrouthy, Marc; Ouaini, Naim] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Chalak, Lamis] Lebanese Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Beirut, Lebanon",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Lebanese University,"Chedraoui, S; Rajjou, L (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Saclay Plant Sci SPS RD10, AgroParisTech, Inst Jean Pierre Bourgin,INRA,CNRS, Versailles, France.;Chedraoui, S (corresponding author), Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Jounieh, Lebanon.",stephaniechedraoui@hotmail.com; loic.rajjou@agroparistech.fr,,"Rajjou, Loic/0000-0001-9739-1041; Chalak, Lamis/0000-0003-1301-982X","Women's association in Hadath el Jebbeh, Lebanon","Women's association in Hadath el Jebbeh, Lebanon","SC fellowship was funded by the Women's association in Hadath el Jebbeh, Lebanon.",,207,40,41,3,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

However, the physiological function of DMSP has remained enigmatic for >30 yr. Recent insight suggests that there are different physiological roles for DMSP based on the cellular DMSP concentrations in producers. Differential production of DMSP was tested with multiple physiological experiments that altered nitrate availability, salinity and temperature to create stressed growth and target different metabolic conditions in Emiliania huxleyi, a high DMSP producer and Thalassiosira oceanica, a low DMSP producer. Emiliania huxleyi intracellular DMSP did not respond to metabolically imbalanced conditions, while Thalassiosira oceanica intracellular DMSP was significantly correlated to stressed growth rate across all conditions tested and exhibited a plastic response on a timescale of hours in nonsteady-state. The previous assumption that proposed DMSP mechanism(s) can be universally applied to all producers is shown to be unlikely. Rather, two distinct ecological roles for DMSP likely exist that differ by producer type, where: (1) the primary role of DMSP in high producers is a constitutive compatible solute; and (2) DMSP production in low producers is a finely tuned stress response.","[McParland, Erin L.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [McParland, Erin L.; Wright, Anna; Art, Kristin; He, Meagan; Levine, Naomi M.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Marine & Environm Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Southern California,"McParland, EL (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.;McParland, EL (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Marine & Environm Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",emcparland@whoi.edu,,"McParland, Erin/0000-0003-1734-8938; Levine, Naomi/0000-0002-4963-0535",Rose Hills Foundation; University of Southern California; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,Rose Hills Foundation; University of Southern California; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,"This work was supported by funding from the Rose Hills Foundation, the University of Southern California, and a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.

Carnot Batteries offer an important alternative to other electricity storage systems due to the possible use of low-cost storage materials in their thermal energy storage units. The use of sensible storage material at high temperatures is of particular interest in order to achieve higher storage densities. A high number of research projects are currently being carried out in this field, and an increasing number of industrial players are also pushing the development of systems to market maturity, which results in a large variety of concepts. This work offers new approaches to the classification of Carnot Batteries and thermal energy storage systems. It gives an overview of the current state of the art in the field of thermal energy storage above 500 degrees C and compares the systems and concepts on the basis of key figures. The large number of concepts will inevitably be selected based on technical and environmental considerations. It is shown that solid and sensible thermal energy storage units can be represented as an efficient component of a Carnot Battery in the high temperature range. Total cycle energy efficiencies of >= 95% have been shown in literature. The 'fixed structure' design as a differentiation to the 'packed bed' is particularly well suited as it allows internal charging at temperatures greater than 1000 degrees C while minimizing charging losses.","[Paul, Alexej; Holy, Felix; Textor, Michel; Lechner, Stefan] TH Mittelhessen Univ Appl Sci THM, Inst Thermodynam Energy Proc Technol & Syst Anal T, Wiesenstr 14, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",,"Paul, A (corresponding author), TH Mittelhessen Univ Appl Sci THM, Inst Thermodynam Energy Proc Technol & Syst Anal T, Wiesenstr 14, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",alexej.paul@me.thm.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK);  [03ET1607 A],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK); ,"The authors wish to express their thanks to the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), funding the project entitled EnEff:Stadt: FlexQuartier Gie beta en: Integrale Planung und Errichtung eines hochflexiblen Hybridspeichers mit Sektorenkop-plung fuer ein energieeffizientes netzdienliches Neubau-Quartier(grant number 03ET1607 A), for their great support of this research work, which was performed under the project.",,120,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-152X,2352-1538,,J ENERGY STORAGE,J.

The primary objective of LT-1 is to generate a highly accurate global digital elevation model (DEM). Beyond that, LT-1 will serve for the demonstration of some state-of-the-art technologies in radar field and some applications, such as biomass inversion, disaster forecasting, and climate and environmental monitoring, and phase synchronization is a technical challenge in realizing the highly accurate topography and deformation measurements. The pulsed alternate synchronization scheme, which is proposed to solve the synchronization problem of TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM)-X, is an efficient and accurate method. However, it interrupts the normal work of the TanDEM-X, accordingly flowing a series of problems. For LT-1, a novel synchronization scheme, in which the phase synchronization signal is exchanged by virtue of a time slot between radar signals, is applied. Thus, the working efficiency and synchronization accuracy can further be improved. Furthermore, the performance prediction and phase synchronization experiment for this synchronization scheme is presented, which verifies the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Finally, in order to guarantee the transmission quality of the synchronization signal, the illumination combinations and gain variation of the synchronization antenna in an orbital period are detailed.","[Jin, Guodong; Liu, Kaiyu; Liu, Dacheng; Liang, Da; Zhang, Heng; Ou, Naiming; Zhang, Yanyan; Deng, Yun-Kai; Li, Chuang; Wang, Robert] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect, Dept Space Microwave Remote Sensing Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Liu, Kaiyu; Liu, Dacheng; Zhang, Heng; Ou, Naiming; Deng, Yun-Kai; Wang, Robert] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Elect Elect & Commun Engn, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Electronics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, R (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect, Dept Space Microwave Remote Sensing Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",jinguodong15@mails.ucas.ac.cn; yuwang@mail.ie.ac.cn,"Wang, Robert/AAF-2805-2020; li, chuang/GSE-0089-2022","Liang, Da/0000-0002-9092-5298; Zhang, Yanyan/0000-0002-3497-4474; Jin, Guodong/0000-0003-2423-412X; Ou, Naiming/0000-0002-6077-2171",National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFB0502700]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [61825106]; National Science Fund [61701479],National Key Research and Development Program; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Science Fund,"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program under Grant 2017YFB0502700, in part by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars under Grant 61825106, and in part by the National Science Fund under Grant 61701479.",,40,25,26,1,13,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

As a response to the present climate crisis focus on wind energy is increasing due to its renewable and environmentally friendly characteristics. Due to social and political reasons the trend has been shifted largely from onshore to offshore wind farms. Offshore wind energy production faces a wide range of new challenges in design, development, manufacturing, installation, and maintenance and operation. The need, objectives, method, benefits, and application of a proposed reliability and maintainability database are identified in this paper. In the offshore oil and gas industry the OREDA concept for data collection has been running for more than 25 years. Therefore it will be briefly described what is considered to be the state of the art in this industry when it comes to data collection. Potential challenges and issues pertaining to the reliability and maintainability data collection of offshore wind turbines are outlined and categorized. The architecture of the proposed database is illustrated. The main building blocks of the database are briefly described and their possible effects on the reliability and maintainability of offshore wind turbines are highlighted. It is expected that the realization of the proposed database will open a new vista of knowledge in understanding the real behavior of offshore wind turbines in the marine environment. Another expectation is the benefits it will bring to the technological areas ranging from design to operation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TNO has performed a study aimed at improving aerosol characterisation using a space based instrument and state-of-the-art aerosol retrieval algorithms, based on requirements for up-to-date regional and global aerosol transport models. The study has resulted in instrument specifications and a concept design for aerosol detection from space. Based on the study the main requirements for a dedicated aerosol spectrometer are: a spectral range from 330-1000 nm with a spectral resolution from 2 nm (UV) to > 30 nm (NIR), observation in at least 3 polarisation directions (Stokes parameters) over a field of view (FOV) in swath direction of > 114 degrees and observation in at least 3 viewing directions (backwards, nadir, forward). The spectrometer design is a prism imaging spectrometer using a single detector array to measure the complete spectra for 2 polarisation directions. In this way the requirements for each viewing direction can be met with only 2 detector arrays. The system has a modular set-up, which makes the implementation of, for example, a change in the number of observation directions very simple. The basic requirements to discriminate between aerosol types are currently only met POLDER, that combines multiple view angles with polarisation.

The activity concentrations of Cd-109 and Zn-65 determined in the seven extracts were used in a three-component model to calculate the kinetics of Cd-109 and Zn-65 transfer between the water-soluble, reversibly sorbed and irreversibly sorbed model components. The rates and the time-dependent distribution coefficient constants for Cd-109 and Zn-65 distribution among the three components were determined, and the impacts of organic matter addition and increasing temperature on these constants were assessed. The reversible sorption of the tracers occurred rapidly, within 0.5 h, while the transfer of reversibly sorbed Cd-109 and Zn-65 into the irreversibly sorbed fractions was a significantly slower process. The addition of organic matter reduced the rate of Cd-109 and Zn-65 transfer into the irreversibly sorbed fractions, whereas the transfer rate Increased with increasing temperature. The interaction between organic matter and temperature affected both the rates and the pseudoequilibrium constants, and the temperature regimes and rate of organic matter addition may thus influence the potential mobility of the investigated metals.","Agr Univ Norway, Dept Soil & Water Sci, N-1432 As Nlh, Norway; Agr Univ Norway, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, N-1432 As Nlh, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Almas, AR (corresponding author), Agr Univ Norway, Dept Soil & Water Sci, Post Box 5028, N-1432 As Nlh, Norway.",,"Alm√•s, √Ösgeir Rosseb√∏/AAD-8020-2020; Alm√•s, √Ösgeir/B-4118-2011","Alm√•s, √Ösgeir Rosseb√∏/0000-0002-3891-5762; ",,,,,38,23,24,0,16,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Faculty at the UCLA/Getty Program in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage are working to support the next generation of researchers and practitioners to become leaders in adapting conservation for the climate crisis and addressing social inequity. This paper presents the first stage of an initiative to develop models for embedding sustainable practices into conservation education and producing scalable curricula for broad dissemination. In this first phase, we performed literature reviews, canvassed the field through surveys, conducted interviews and developed curricula for our laboratories and classrooms. Survey results indicate a high international interest in incorporating sustainability principles in cultural heritage education, but with a corollary challenge of being unable to substitute new concepts for those already taught. Literature reviews and interviews introduced the authors to existing pedagogical approaches for embedding sustainability within our courses. Sustainability concepts such as the Three Pillars of Sustainability, the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Inform, Engage, Empower and Embed (I3E) systems provide guidance in our teaching. The next phase of the initiative will involve a close evaluation of pedagogical systems for integrating sustainability into the existing curriculum to ensure that emerging professionals in art conservation, built heritage, libraries, archives, archaeology and historic preservation will prioritize intersectional environmentalism. A future goal is to disseminate educational models broadly for adaptation by others.","[Wuebold, Justine; Pearlstein, Ellen; Shelley, William; Wharton, Glenn] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Getty Program Conservat Cultural Heritage, A410 Fowler, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Wuebold, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Getty Program Conservat Cultural Heritage, A410 Fowler, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jwuebold@ucla.edu,,"Wuebold, Justine/0000-0002-1339-2766; Shelley, William/0000-0002-3132-1080; Wharton, Glenn/0000-0002-3831-0763",National Endowment for the Humanities [20200515-PR],National Endowment for the Humanities,This work was supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities under Grant 20200515-PR.,,10,0,0,4,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

These existential concerns demand that a passionate, interdisciplinary, and diverse community of plant science professionals is trained during the 21st century. Furthermore, societal trends that question the importance of science and expert knowledge highlight the need to better communicate the value of rigorous fundamental scientific exploration. Engaging students and the general public in the wonder of plants, and science in general, requires renewed efforts that take advantage of advances in technology and new models of funding and knowledge dissemination. In November 2018, funded by the National Science Foundation through the Arabidopsis Research and Training for the 21st century (ART 21) research coordination network, a symposium and workshop were held that included a diverse panel of students, scientists, educators, and administrators from across the US. The purpose of the workshop was to re-envision how outreach programs are funded, evaluated, acknowledged, and shared within the plant science community. One key objective was to generate a roadmap for future efforts. We hope that this document will serve as such, by providing a comprehensive resource for students and young faculty interested in developing effective outreach programs. We also anticipate that this document will guide the formation of community partnerships to scale up currently successful outreach programs, and lead to the design of future programs that effectively engage with a more diverse student body and citizenry.","[Friesner, Joanna] UC Davis, Atlanta, GA USA; [Friesner, Joanna] North Amer Arabidopsis Steering Comm, Atlanta, GA USA; [Colon-Carmona, Adan] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Schnoes, Alexandra M.] Sci Commun Lab, San Francisco, CA USA; [Stepanova, Anna; Long, Terri] North Carolina State Univ, Davis, CA USA; [Mason, Grace Alex; Callis, Judy; Brady, Siobhan] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Macintosh, Gustavo C.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Ullah, Hemayat] Howard Univ, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Baxter, Ivan; Woodford-Thomas, Terry] Danforth Plant Sci Ctr, St Louis, MO USA; [Sierra-Cajas, Kimberly; Yadegari, Ramin] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Elliott, Kiona; Haswell, Elizabeth S.; May, Victoria] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA; [Zavala, Maria Elena] Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Wildermuth, Mary; Lemaux, Peggy G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Williams, Mary] Amer Soc Plant Biologists, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Ayalew, Mentewab] Spelman Coll, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA; [Henkhaus, Natalie] Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, NY USA; [Prunet, Nathanael] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Amasino, Rick] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA; [Hangarter, Roger; Innes, Roger] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Sun, Ying] Stanford Univ, Las Vegas, NV USA; [Dinneny, Jose R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Iowa State University; Howard University; Donald Danforth Plant Science Center; University of Arizona; Washington University (WUSTL); California State University System; California State University Northridge; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Spelman College; Cornell University; Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Stanford University,"Friesner, J (corresponding author), UC Davis, Atlanta, GA USA.;Friesner, J (corresponding author), North Amer Arabidopsis Steering Comm, Atlanta, GA USA.;Dinneny, JR (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jfriesner@danforthcenter.org; dinneny@stanford.edu,"; Baxter, Ivan/A-1052-2009","Schnoes, Alexandra/0000-0003-2727-7758; Williams, Mary/0000-0003-4447-7815; Brady, Siobhan/0000-0001-9424-8055; Friesner, Joanna/0000-0002-6799-7808; Ullah, Hemayet/0000-0003-1748-3398; Callis, Judy/0000-0002-0622-078X; Baxter, Ivan/0000-0001-6680-1722; STEPANOVA, ANNA/0000-0003-1018-4758; Long, Terri/0000-0001-7846-0195",U.S. National Science Foundation; NSF--RCN [1518280],U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF--RCN,"This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (award no.

At the Dinosaur Wash locality, an undetermined theropod is preserved in paleosols that indicate a transition from wet to dry conditions on the floodplain. Coelophysis bauri remains from the Dinosaur Hill locality are preserved in a filled channel scour. The paleosols at this locality contain carbonate nodules intimately associated with Fe and Mn oxides, indicative of alternating alkaline/acidic conditions around roots in response to a semi-arid climate with strong seasonal precipitation. At the Dinosaur Hollow locality Chindesaurus bryansmalli is preserved in a setting similar to those encountered art Dinosaur Hill. The paleosols exhibit vertic features, such as pseudoanticlines, and are indicative of water-deficit periods during the year. The most complete theropod remains at PEFO are predominantly preserved in distinctive blue-colored paleosol horizons showing depletion in iron and aluminum, and exhibiting features such as localized Fe concentrations and mottling. These are interpreted as,A-horizons of redoximorphic paleosols developed in wet areas of the floodplain where the degree of water saturation fluctuate. Preservational conditions of PEFO theropod localities indicate they are time-averaged attritional mortality assemblages representative of contemporaneous organisms. Comparison of these localities to the well-known Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, Coelophysis quarry reinforces the idea that the quarry represents unique preservational conditions.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Geosci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Therrien, F (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",,,,,,,,93,46,48,0,12,SEPM-SOC SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY,TULSA,"6128 EAST 38TH ST, STE 308, TULSA, OK 74135-5814 USA",0883-1351,,,PALAIOS,Palaios,JUN,2000,3,,,,194,211,,10.2307/3515642,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3515642,,,18,Geology; Paleontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Paleontology,321CB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000087436400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The author returns to the case of Lawrence/Leticia/Latisha King, a murdered middle schooler, to unpack the evolving frames that have been developed since King's murder in 2008. To do this, the author addresses the ways King's name and clothing choices were used to frame King's life and death in diverse ways at school. Schools, of course, are a space and time where youth come into presence and where decades of research have documented the less than ideal climate of schools for LGBTQ + students. King's school experiences represent a challenge to the typical narrative of victimization that often frames LGBTQ + issues in education. The author argues engaging King's life contributes to the need to address the everyday agentive practices of youth, particularly queer youth of color, in educational scholarship. As the author argues, King's school experiences represent a challenge to the frame of victimization providing a key inflection point for understanding twenty-first century students.","[Greteman, Adam J.] Sch Art Inst Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",School of the Art Institute of Chicago,"Greteman, AJ (corresponding author), Sch Art Inst Chicago, Dept Art Educ, 37 S Wabash Ave Suite 713A, Chicago, IL 60603 USA.",agreteman@saic.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1946,1532-6993,,EDUC STUD-AESA,Educ.

Targeted manipulation of root system architecture (RSA) to increase water and nutrient use efficiency can minimize the adverse effects of climate change on crop production. However, phenotyping of RSA is a major bottleneck since the roots are hidden in the soil. Recently the development of 2- and 3D root imaging techniques combined with the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have opened up new research tools to identify the genetic basis of RSA. These approaches provide a comprehensive understanding of the RSA, by accelerating the identification and characterization of genes involved in root growth and development. This review summarizes the latest developments in phenotyping techniques and GWAS for RSA, which are used to map important genes regulating various aspects of RSA under varying environmental conditions. Furthermore, we discussed about the state-of-the-art image analysis tools integrated with various phenotyping platforms for investigating and quantifying root traits with the highest phenotypic plasticity in both artificial and natural environments which were used for large scale association mapping studies, leading to the identification of RSA phenotypes and their underlying genetics with the greatest potential for RSA improvement.

In this context, solar H-2 plays a fundamental role as it can be easily used as a green energy vector in many applications, ranging from transportation to industry. Sun-driven water splitting devices for H-2 production are a perfect example of the circular economy concept, as they use a renewable energy source to split water into H-2 and O-2, which in turn can be used in combustion engines, producing water as a by-product. This technology has still many limitations and needs a strong breakthrough to be considered in the market. The aim of this review is to precisely outline, from a critical point of view, the recent developments in this field. In particular, the three fundamental types of devices, i.e. photocatalytic (PC), photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV-EC), are firstly described in terms of fundamental working principles. Then, a recent state-of-the-art update underlines the main progress in materials optimization and device engineering, pointing out the limitations of large-scale application of these systems.

Global fisheries resources are central to the sustainability and quality of life on earth but are under threat from climate change, ocean acidification and over consumption. One way to analyze these marine resource is through remote underwater surveying. However, the sheer volume of recorded data often make classification and analyses difficult, time consuming and resource intensive. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) have shown promising application in extracting high level context with near human performance on image classification tasks. The application of ML in remote underwater surveying can drastically reduce the processing time of these datasets. In order to train these deep neural networks used in ML, it is necessary to create a series of large-scale benchmark datasets to test any proposed algorithm for this kind of specific imaging classification. Currently, none of the publicly available datasets in the marine vision research domain have sufficiently large data volumes to reliably train a deep model. In this work, a publicly available large-scale benchmark underwater video dataset is created and used to retrain a state-of-the-art machine vision deep model (MaskRCNN). This model is in turn applied into detecting and classifying underwater marine lives through random under-sampling (RUS), and achieves a reasonably high average precision (0.628 mAP), indicating great applicability of this dataset in training instance segmentation deep neural network for detecting underwater marine species.","[Zhang, Dian; O'Conner, Noel E.; Little, Suzanne] Hainan Univ, Smart Sensing Grp, Haikou, Peoples R China; [O'Conner, Noel E.; Cao, Chunjie] Dublin City Univ, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Simpson, Andre J.; Wu, Bing] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys Environm Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C1A4, Canada; [Wu, Bing] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Hainan University; Dublin City University; University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Little, S (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Smart Sensing Grp, Haikou, Peoples R China.;Wu, B (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys Environm Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C1A4, Canada.",suzanne.little@dcu.ie; friedrichbing.wu@utoronto.ca,"Wu, Bing/ABE-0378-2022","Wu, Bing/0000-0002-2739-5124",Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) [SFI/12/RC/2289_P2]; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province [713279]; EU [621MS017]; Marine Institute under Marine Research Programme; Irish Government,Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland); Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province; EU(European Commission); Marine Institute under Marine Research Programme; Irish Government,"This research work is funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number SFI/12/RC/2289_P2, Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province, fund number: 621MS017 and the EU Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Cofund project (Grant No. 713279) .

Existing works mainly focus on the prediction of target time series based on the prior of the sequence itself, but ignore the background information behind the sequences. Such ignored information is usually essential to build a robust prediction model in complex real-world applications. However, how to extract the shared back-ground information behind multiple sequences and how to incorporate the extracted information in the prediction model are two main challenges. To address the above two challenges, we propose a shared state space model (SSSM) by introducing a shared background information component into the state space model. In SSSM, we consider all sequences as a whole and model each target series by utilizing a state space model with shared same parameters and background information. First, we employ two recurrent neural networks to extract the temporal characteristic of the target sequence as well as the background information. Second, the above extracted information is integrated into a state space model in the form of a linear Gaussian component, whose inference procedure is accomplished by Kalman Filter. Finally, the model is optimized following a log-likelihood of the model with the above two components. Experiments on real-world applications show that our model can extract the share information behind the data and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis allowed us to determine the annual publication rate both total and segregated by country, author, journal, and research institution. With an overall increasing trend in the total number of publications, China was identified as the leading country in solar cooling research followed by the USA, and Southern European countries. Keyword analysis and time evolution of various key solar cooling technologies have shown that the focus has so far been on solar thermal cooling technology. Nonetheless, as solar photovoltaic prices drop significantly, researchers are expected to focus more closely on photovoltaic driven cooling systems in the near future as a step towards reducing fossil fuel dependence and mitigating climate change.","[Saikia, Kangkana; Valles, Manel; Fabregat, Alexandre; Saez, Raul; Boer, Dieter] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Engn Mecan, Av Paisos Catalans 26, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Boer, D (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Engn Mecan, Av Paisos Catalans 26, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain.",dieter.boer@urv.cat,"Tomas, Alexandre Fabregat/AAO-1999-2020; Boer, Dieter/K-3162-2014; Saez, Raul/GWC-6171-2022","Tomas, Alexandre Fabregat/0000-0002-6032-2605; Boer, Dieter/0000-0002-5532-6409; Saikia, Kangkana/0000-0003-3863-727X; Saez, Raul/0000-0003-2175-1447","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RTI2018-093849-B-C33, DPI2016-75791-C21-P, RTI2018-100907-A-I00]; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) [RED2018-102431-T]; Catalan Government [2017-SGR-1409, 2017-SGR-1234]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI)(Spanish Government); Catalan Government","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the projects RTI2018-093849-B-C33 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), DPI2016-75791-C21-P and RTI2018-100907-A-I00 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), from the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) (RED2018-102431-T).

The coordination of comminution and transport aimed at avoiding operational delays is also complex. Nevertheless, the use of forest biomass helps to reduce the effects of climate change and produces an additional income, especially in rural areas. About 20 years ago, at the beginning of the industrial forest fuel utilisation, the focus of the research was on developing and analysing adequate supply chains and machines. Nowadays, as state-of-the-art systems have been established, the focus is on improving the efficiency of the processes and the quality of the products. This paper provides a review of research trends of the last ten years focusing on comminution and transport of forest biomass in Europe. Comminution should become more efficient by analysing the effects of wood characteristics on chipper performance and product quality, by tailoring chipper configuration according to those findings and by introducing mechanical devices for improving the quality of chips. Transport processes have the potential to become more efficient if the configuration of trucks is adapted according to operational and legal requirements, and when considering moisture content management. Finally, economic and environmental assessment of supply chains was made by several studies. Future research is expected to focus on customizing the product quality according to user's requirements and on optimising the coordination of chipper and truck by simulation and automatization tools.","[Kuehmaier, Martin; Erber, Gernot] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forest Engn, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Kuhmaier, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forest Engn, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",martin.kuehmaier@boku.ac.at; gernot.erber@boku.ac.at,"Erber, Gernot/AAH-3517-2019","Erber, Gernot/0000-0003-1606-5258; Kuhmaier, Martin/0000-0002-0537-3610",,,,,107,12,12,0,16,"ZAGREB UNIV, FAC FORESTRY",ZAGREB,"SVETOSIMUNSKA 25, ZAGREB, HRVATSKA 10000, CROATIA",1845-5719,,,CROAT J FOR ENG,Croat.

It is imperative to understand the relationship between built forms and energy use in order to provide guidance in early project stage such as preliminary design. Therefore, this study focuses on two aspects to understand characteristics of energy use due to the change of parameters related to building form. The first aspect is to apply new metamodel global sensitivity analysis to determine key factors influencing energy use and the second aspect is to develop reliable fast-computing statistical models using state-of-art machine learning methods. An office building, located in Harbin, China, is chosen as a case study using EnergyPlus simulation program. The results indicate that non-linear relationships exist between input variables and energy use for both heating and electricity use. For heating energy, two factors (floor numbers and building scale) show a non-linear yet monotonic trend. For electricity use intensity, building scale is the only significant factor that has non-linear effects. It is also found that the ranking results of critical factors to both electricity use and heating energy per floor area vary significantly between small and large scale buildings. Neural network model performs better than other machine-learning methods, including ordinary linear model, MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines), bagging MARS, support vector machine, random forest, and Gaussian process.","[Tian, Wei; Yang, Song; Li, ZhanYong; Liu, YunLiang] Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Integrated Design & On Line Monit, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, ECIC, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Tianjin University Science & Technology; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Tian, W (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Integrated Design & On Line Monit, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",tjtianjin@126.com,"Tian, Wei/A-7888-2018","Tian, Wei/0000-0003-3447-2287; Zuo, Jian/0000-0002-8279-9666","Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology [14JCYBJC42600]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry of China","Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry of China(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese ScholarsMinistry of Education, China)","This research is supported by the Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology (No. 14JCYBJC42600) and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry of China.",,33,35,37,6,64,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1996-3599,1996-8744,,BUILD SIMUL-CHINA,Build.

We tested whether feelings of belonging to competing (non-STEM) classes were associated with women's interest in their STEM classes using an interval contingent diary methodology. We recruited 62 undergraduate women STEM majors concurrently enrolled in STEM and Humanities/Liberal Arts (H/LA) courses. We first assessed self-competence (SC) and self-liking (SL), and then every 2 weeks during the academic semester the participants were asked to report their feelings of belonging and interest in both types of courses (resulting in eight entries). For women with low felt SC and high SL, a greater feeling of belonging to their H/LA class throughout the semester was associated with less STEM class interest, above and beyond feelings of belonging in STEM. For all women, fluctuations in STEM class belonging mapped onto their STEM class interest but not their H/LA class interest. Results suggest not only that can women feel pushed out of STEM when they feel a low sense of belonging, but also that for women with specific self-esteem contingencies, competing experiences of belonging in non-STEM can pull interest away from STEM. Thus, to promote women's greater participation in STEM, practitioners may need to consider the role of women's broader motivational experiences across the curriculum.","[Thoman, Dustin B.; Arizaga, Jessica A.; Story, Tyler S.; Soncuya, Gretchen] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Psychol, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Smith, Jessi L.] Montana State Univ, Dept Psychol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Thoman, DB (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Psychol, 1250 Bellflower Blvd,PSY-100, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",dustin.thoman@csulb.edu,"Ayibiowu, Olusola David,/W-4966-2018","Ayibiowu, Olusola David,/0000-0002-6478-8779; Thoman, Dustin/0000-0002-7763-762X",,,,,81,27,28,0,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0361-6843,1471-6402,,PSYCHOL WOMEN QUART,Psychol.

Therefore, a reliable maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is essential to track the GMPP within an appropriate time. This article proposes a hybrid technique by combining an evolutionary optimization technique, namely the modified invasive weed optimization (MIWO) with the conventional P&O algorithm to enhance the search performance for the maximum power output of the PV system. MIWO executes in the initial stages of the tracking followed by the P&O at the final stages in the MPPT search process. The combined approach ensures faster convergence and better search to the GMPP under rapid climate change and PSCs. The search performance of the hybrid MIWO+P&O technique is examined on a standalone PV system through both MATLAB/Simulink environment and experimentally using dSPACE (DS1103)-based real-time microcontroller hardware setup. The performance of the proposed hybrid MPPT scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art MPPPT techniques. In addition, the small-signal analysis of the PV system is carried out to evaluate the loop robustness of the controller design. For a given set of system parameters, simulations for the small-signal model and robustness studies are analyzed to verify the results. The overall results justify the efficacy of the proposed hybrid MPPT algorithm.","[Senapati, Manoj Kumar] Indian Inst Technol ISM, Dept Elect Engn, Dhanbad, Bihar, India; [Pradhan, Chittaranjan] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Elect Engn, Narvik, Norway; [Calay, Rajnish Kaur] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Bldg Energy & Mat Technol, Narvik, Norway",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Pradhan, C (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Elect Engn, Narvik, Norway.",chittaranjan.pradhan@uit.no,,"Senapati, Dr. Manoj Kumar/0000-0003-0393-4418; Calay, Rajnish/0000-0002-4132-3514","UiT The Arctic University of Norway; Arctic Centre for Sustainable Energy, Norway [ARC-381300]","UiT The Arctic University of Norway; Arctic Centre for Sustainable Energy, Norway","UiT The Arctic University of Norway and Arctic Centre for Sustainable Energy, Norway, Grant/Award Number: ARC-381300",,43,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-2087,1099-1514,,OPTIM CONTR APPL MET,Optim.

Their heating system is a meaningful example of the outstanding level of technological progress achieved by the Romans in the art of building. However, while their mode of operation is sufficiently known, there is uncertainty regarding temperatures and relative humidity (RH) maintained in the heated rooms, thermal level and expulsion process of hot flue gases, presence of window glazing and concamerationes. In order to overcome such uncertainty, a multidisciplinary approach - based on in situ analyses, topographic and 3D laser scanning surveys and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations - has been developed by studying the main features of the Indirizzo Baths of Catania (Sicily), which represent one of the best-preserved hypocausted thermal buildings anywhere in the Roman Empire. Results show that temperatures in the caldarium ranged between 30 and 35 degrees C, with a RH of around 60 divided by 70%, while the thermal level of hot gases inside the hypocaust fluctuated from about 90 to 125 degrees C, in function of the outdoor climate. Moreover, the original presence of windowpanes and concamerationes has been confirmed, as they were necessary to guarantee appropriate indoor thermal sensations and to prevent burns by touching the heated surfaces. These outcomes may constitute a useful support for better understanding the operation of other similar Roman thermal complexes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Existing large-scale storage platforms, however, lack support for the efficient sharing of large datasets over the Internet. Those systems that are widely used for the dissemination of large files, like BitTorrent, need to be adapted to handle challenges such as network links with both high latency and high bandwidth, and scalable storage backends that are optimised for streaming and not random access. In this paper, we introduce Dela, a peer-to-peer data-sharing service integrated into the Hops Hadoop platform that provides an end-to-end solution for dataset sharing. Dela is designed for large-scale storage backends and data transfers that are both non-intrusive to existing TCP network traffic and provide higher network throughput than TCP on high latency, high bandwidth network links, such as transatlantic network links. Dela provides a pluggable storage layer, implementing two alternative ways for clients to access shared data: stream processing of data as it arrives with Kafka, and traditional offline access to data using the Hadoop Distributed Filesystem. Dela is the first step for the Hadoop platform towards creating an open dataset ecosystem that supports user-friendly publishing, searching, and downloading of large datasets.","[Ormenisan, Alexandru A.; Dowling, Jim] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch ICT, Dept Software & Comp Syst, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Ormenisan, AA (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch ICT, Dept Software & Comp Syst, Stockholm, Sweden.",aaor@kth.se; jdowling@kth.se,,,Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research project E2E-Clouds; EU H project AEGIS Advanced Big Data Value Chain for Public Safety and Personal Security [732189],Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research project E2E-Clouds(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); EU H project AEGIS Advanced Big Data Value Chain for Public Safety and Personal Security,"This work has been partly supported by Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research project E2E-Clouds, and by EU H2020 project AEGIS Advanced Big Data Value Chain for Public Safety and Personal Security under Grant Agreement no. 732189.",,13,0,0,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",1063-6927,,978-1-5386-1791-5,INT CON DISTR COMP S,,,2017,,,,,2533,2536,,10.1109/ICDCS.2017.199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2017.199,,,4,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BI5RN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000412759500276,View Full Record in Web of Science

Part I: Initial energy situation of glasshouse companies,BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT,,,German,Article,,,,,,,,"Small glasshouse companies predominate in Saxony, Germany, where they lack state-of-the-art technical equipment and have higher energy costs compared to large greenhouses. From an economic point of view, the horticultural glasshouse companies in Saxony, which mostly cultivate ornamental plants, show an unclear picture. Aside from the relatively higher expenditures compared to companies in other federal states of the Federal Republic of Germany, companies with indirect marketing approaches have sustained slumps in expected turnovers. The initial conditions for adaptive measures of several horticultural companies are estimated to be difficult or very risky due to the economic climate. Large-scale and capital-intensive modernizations of many companies will not be feasible without an intense promotional campaign. With regard to this study, many parts of greenhouses in Saxony are not optimally equipped in terms of energy consumption. Most of those built are an older type of greenhouse known as a German standard greenhouse. Heating oil is the most frequently used energy source, followed by natural gas and coal/coke in Saxony. Up to now, biomass materials have only been used to a minor extent. Therefore, it is necessary to examine feasible measures that are energy- and cost-efficient for existing companies in Saxony. Furthermore, the question remains as to which heating systems/heat supply concepts should be regularly used by boilers or greenhouses in the future. An answer to these questions can be found in the second part of this paper.","[Gruda, Nazim; Schmidt, Uwe] Humboldt Univ, Inst Gartenbauwissensch, Fac Tech Gartenbau, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Ruhm, Georg; Bokelmann, Wolfgang] Humboldt Univ, Inst Wirtschafts & Sozialwissensch Landbaus, Fachgebiet Okon Gartner Prod, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Gruda, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Gartenbauwissensch, Fac Tech Gartenbau, Lentzeallee 55-57, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",nazim.gruda@rz.hu-berlin.de; georg.ruhm@rz.hu-berlin.de; w.bokelmann@agrar.hu-berlin.de; u.schmidt@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Gruda, Nazim S./E-2480-2018","Gruda, Nazim S./0000-0002-2663-1594",,,,,8,8,8,0,4,"W KOHLHAMMER GMBH, I A JOCHEN KRAUSS",STUTTGART,"AMTGERICHT  STUTTGART HRB 1733HRB, STUTTGART, 00000, GERMANY",0005-9080,,,BER LANDWIRTSCH,Ber.

That often invisible worker on whom we wish to speak was a discreet but determined arbiter of taste, who noticeably influenced the latter Russian landscape, and not only in philology. The strictly prescribed aesthetic norms of the eighteenth century allowed him to offer the productive syncretism of his talents. L'vov reacted spontaneously to all challenges of beauty and in his gifted dilettantism surpassed all the qualified experts. He earned the sympathy and protection of the highest authorities. He was able to escape the status of a favorite and always acted on his own, following the vocation of an inventor and taking care not of himself but of others. The remarkable diversity of his heritage is closely connected to the aesthetic climate in Russia at the end of the eighteenth century: let us call this uncatchable stylistic melange pre-romanticism. Here for the first time, although timidly and most often in the genre of the epistle, the theme of a creative personality is affirmatively presented.",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,MATICA SRPSKA,NOVI SAD,"MATICE SRPSKE 1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",0352-5007,,,ZB MATICE SRP SLAV,Zb.

Photovoltaic power offers a promising solution but also brings considerable uncertainties and risks that may endanger the continuity and quality of supply. From an operational point of view, large-scale integration of solar power could result in unmet demand, electrical instabilities and equipment damage. The performance and lifetime of conventional fossil equipment are likely to be altered by repeated transient operations, making it necessary to adopt specific modeling tools. Control strategies and sizing methodologies must be adapted to account for the strong reliability constraint while dealing with significant production uncertainties. In addition, conventional mitigation technologies, such as storage and load flexibility, have limited potential in these applications and may result in high investments or penalties if they are not properly assessed. This study provides an overview of these challenges by providing a transversal analysis of the scientific literature from fossil engine thermodynamics to control system theory applied to industrial systems. The main characteristics of reliability-constrained microgrids are identified and a conceptual definition is proposed by analyzing state-of-the art studies of various industrial applications and taking oil-and gas microgrids as an enlightening example. Then follows a review of the challenges of accounting for dynamical behavior of fossil equipment, PV and storage systems, ending with the identification of several research gaps.

In densely populated and highly fragmented landscapes as observed in the Walloon region (Belgium), very high spatial resolution is required to depict all the infrastructures, buildings and most of the structural elements of the semi-natural landscapes (like hedges and small water bodies). Because of the resolution, the vertical dimension needs explicit handling to avoid discontinuities incompatible with many applications. For example, how to map a river flowing under a bridge? The particularity of our data is to provide a two-digit land cover code to label all the overlapping items. The identification of all the overlaps resulted from the combination of remote sensing image analysis and decision rules involving ancillary data. The final product is therefore semantically precise and accurate in terms of land cover description thanks to the addition of 24 classes on top of the 11 pure land cover classes. The quality of the map has been assessed using a state-of-the-art validation scheme. Its overall accuracy is as high as 91.5%, with an average producer's accuracy of 86% and an average user's accuracy of 91%.

In the strong, cold Antarctic vortex, rapid springtime chemical ozone loss occurs throughout a large region of the lower stratosphere, whereas in the Arctic, although chemical ozone depletion has been observed(3-11), the vortex is generally much smaller, weaker and more variable(12). Here we report a model-based analysis of the relative importance of dynamics and chemistry in causing the Arctic ozone trend in the 1990s, using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional stratospheric chemistry-transport model. North of 63 degrees N we find that, on average, dynamical variations dominate the interannual variability, with little evidence for a trend towards more wintertime chemical depletion. However, increases in the burden of atmospheric halogens since the early 1970s are responsible for a large (14%) reduction in the average March column ozone, but this effect is mostly caused by increased destruction throughout the year rather than by halogen chemistry associated with wintertime polar statospheric clouds. Any influence of climate change on future average Arctic ozone amounts may thus be dominated by possible circulation changes, rather than by changes in chemical loss.","Univ Leeds, Ctr Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England",University of Leeds; University of Cambridge,"Chipperfield, MP (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Ctr Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Chipperfield, Martyn/H-6359-2013","Chipperfield, Martyn/0000-0002-6803-4149; Jones, Roderic/0000-0002-6761-3966",,,,,24,82,82,1,12,MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Aug,1999,6744,,,,551,554,,10.1038/22999,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/22999,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,223RT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000081854800051,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, the coefficient of globalization has a positive and significant effect on the CO2 emission, which confirms that globalization accelerates the CO2 emission in the country. Also, the results indicate that ICT usage (more specifically ICT-internet and ICT-mobile subscription) could boost economic growth and mitigate climate change.

While literature on ES valuation has grown in recent years, its application to urban contexts is still limited. Twenty-five papers, which include 29 different case studies, carry out an economic valuation and have undergone an in-depth analysis. The papers have been selected out of 80 papers detected through keywords. Six different valuation methodologies have been employed in the case studies. The most common ESs valued at the urban level are air quality regulation, local climate regulation, carbon sequestration and storage, and aesthetic appreciation and inspiration for culture, art, and design. The methodologies recur with different frequencies in the valuation of ESs at the urban level. Choice modeling and contingent valuation methodologies are used to value a variety of ESs, including regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Other methodologies are used to value only specific ESs. The replacement cost and damage cost avoided methodologies are used for the assessment of regulation services only; the travel cost method and contingent valuation are used for cultural services only. The results indicate that the considered valuation methodologies show different levels of appropriateness with respect to specific ES categories. Therefore, there is a need to expand the application of valuation methodologies to capture the value of all ESs provided by natural resources, in order to protect and enhance them.","[Croci, Edoardo; Lucchitta, Benedetta; Penati, Tommaso] Bocconi Univ, GREEN Res Ctr, I-20100 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Croci, E; Lucchitta, B (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, GREEN Res Ctr, I-20100 Milan, Italy.",edoardo.croci@unibocconi.it; benedetta.lucchitta@unibocconi.it; tommaso.penati@unibocconi.it,,"Penati, Tommaso/0000-0001-7132-3294; CROCI, EDOARDO/0000-0003-1704-0909",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [730426],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,This research was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [grant agreement No 730426].,,81,9,9,5,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,3,,,,,,1129,10.3390/su13031129,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13031129,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QD6IR,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000615619800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such models use machine learning and internet of things (IoT) to learn personal comfort requirements and integrate them into control systems for indoor environments. However, it is a challenging task to have consistent feedback from individuals, which is normally obtained from thermal comfort surveys. In this study, a PCM approach was tested, where the effects of thermal adaptation on occupants' thermal responses were analysed. Nine occupants participated during a three-week field study. Thermal preferences were learned by a framework grounded on fuzzy logic used to calculate a set point implemented in the HVAC control system of an open-plan office. The results show that only 29% of the occupants' thermal comfort improved and decreased on 71% of them, when implementing the user-driven control strategy. The performance of the demand-driven control strategy was mainly influenced by insufficient and poorly distributed data, as well as the effect of thermal expectations on occupants' thermal responses. These were affected by the better opportunities of behavioural adjustment offered by the participatory sensing approach as well as of their experience with the prevailing outdoor environment. The findings indicate that implementing demand-driven control grounded on user feedback should consider constant data renovation, accurate measurements of local indoor climate and occupants' thermal expectation.","[Aguilera, Jose Joaquin; Kazanci, Ongun Berk; Toftum, Jorn] Tech Univ Denmark, Int Ctr Indoor Environm & Energy, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Aguilera, JJ (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Int Ctr Indoor Environm & Energy, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",jojap@byg.dtu.dk,"Aguilera, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n/AAN-9715-2021; Kazanci, Ongun Berk/N-3727-2013; Toftum, Jorn/B-4670-2017","Aguilera, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n/0000-0001-9049-5817; Kazanci, Ongun Berk/0000-0002-4309-0320; Toftum, Jorn/0000-0001-7697-7617",,,,,40,31,31,1,50,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

Therefore, it is crucial to keep developing models and systems that can accurately predict the concentration of major air pollutants. In this paper, our target is to predict concentration in Japan using environmental monitoring data obtained from physical sensors with improved accuracy over the currently employed prediction models. To do so, we propose a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) that is enhanced with a novel pre-training method using auto-encoder especially designed for time series prediction. Additionally, sensors selection is performed within DRNN without harming the accuracy of the predictions by taking advantage of the sparsity found in the network. The numerical experiments show that DRNN with our proposed pre-training method is superior than when using a canonical and a state-of-the-art auto-encoder training method when applied to time series prediction. The experiments confirm that when compared against the prediction system VENUS (National Institute for Environmental Studies. Visual Atmospheric Environment Utility System.http://envgis5.nies.go.jp/osenyosoku/, 2014),, our technique improves the accuracy of concentration level predictions that are being reported in Japan.","[Ong, Bun Theang; Sugiura, Komei; Zettsu, Koji] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Univ Commun Res Inst, Informat Serv Platform Lab, 3-5 Hikaridai,Seika Cho, Kyoto 6190289, Japan",National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan,"Ong, BT (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Univ Commun Res Inst, Informat Serv Platform Lab, 3-5 Hikaridai,Seika Cho, Kyoto 6190289, Japan.",ong_bt@nict.go.jp; komei.sugiura@nict.go.jp; zettsu@nict.go.jp,,,,,,,41,123,135,3,88,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

We present results from an ongoing effort to extend machine vision methodologies to the environmental sciences, using state-of-the-art adaptive signal processing, combined with compressive sensing and machine learning techniques. We use a Hebbian learning rule to build undercomplete spectral-textural dictionaries that are adapted to the data. We learn our dictionaries from millions of overlapping multispectral image patches and then use a pursuit search to generate classification features. Land cover labels are automatically generated using our CoSA algorithm: unsupervised Clustering of Sparse Approximations. We demonstrate our method using multispectral Worldview-2 data from three Arctic study areas: Barrow, Alaska; the Selawik River, Alaska; and a watershed near the Mackenzie River delta in northwest Canada. Our goal is to develop a robust classification methodology that will allow for the automated discretization of the landscape into distinct units based on attributes such as vegetation, surface hydrological properties, and geomorphic characteristics. To interpret and assign land cover categories to the clusters we both evaluate the spectral properties of the clusters and compare the clusters to both field- and remote sensing-derived classifications of landscape attributes. Our work suggests that neuroscience-based models are a promising approach to practical pattern recognition problems in remote sensing.","[Moody, Daniela I.; Brumby, Steven P.; Rowland, Joel C.; Gangodagamage, Chandana] Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Moody, DI (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",,"Rowland, Joel/GSD-7387-2022","Gangodagamage, Chandana/0000-0001-6511-1711; Rowland, Joel/0000-0001-6308-8976; Moody, Daniela/0000-0002-4452-8208",US Department of Energy (DOE) through the LANL LDRD program; DOE BER Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE) - Arctic project,US Department of Energy (DOE) through the LANL LDRD program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE BER Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE) - Arctic project(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This work is supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) through the LANL LDRD program.
